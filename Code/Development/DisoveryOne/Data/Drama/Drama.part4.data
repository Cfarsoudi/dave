   Note:

   Our story alternates between Past and Present

   "Present" means the fall of 1858 when Darwin was 49. The
   children are: Etty (15) George (14) Betty (11) Franky (10)
   Lenny (8) and Horace (6).

   "Past" means the summer of 1850, when Darwin was 41. The
   children are: Willy (11), Annie (9) Etty (6) George (5),
   Betty (3) Franky (2y) and baby Lenny.

1   INT. DARK ROOM. THE PAST. DAY                                  1

    In darkness, chemicals wash over a copper plate. Strange
    silvery patterns evolve in the half-light.


2   EXT. TERRA DEL FUEGO. DAY                                      2

    Our POV rotates downwards onto an irregular shape.

    This shape is grey-green and crammed with detail which
    emerges as we draw close - like a continent seen from outer
    space.

    A fruit fly lands on it and we now recognise the shape as a
    patch of lichen.

    A number of other fruit flies are grazing there.

    Wider. The lichen is on a rock. A   black lizard climbs over
    the horizon - stalking flies.

    A slow advance. A sudden rush. A fly is snapped up and
    mashed between toothless gums.

    The lizard is fixing its beady gaze on the next potential
    victim when...

    A shadow falls, the lizard tries to flee. A seabird grabs
    the lizard in its claws. Death is sudden and bloody.

    The bird settles to eat.

    Whizz...Thunk. A sharpened stick flies out of nowhere and
    impales the bird through its wing.

    The wounded bird falls between boulders, flapping
    helplessly.

    The rest of the flock take to their air, calling and
    wheeling as...

    A crowd of local savages come racing over the larger
    horizon of the rocks armed with primitive bows and arrows,
    spears, rocks and throwing-sticks...

    A child grabs the injured bird and kills it.

    An adult biffs the child on the head and steals the bird.

    The rest of the savages leap among the jagged rocks smiting
    each other, shouting and snarling among the whirling flock
    of birds.

    AND WE CUT TO
                                                              2


3   EXT. COASTLINE. DAY                                           3

    A POV shot through a telescope: The whirling birds the
    strange half-animal forms of the savages.

    The whole scene is jerky, out of focus and inaudible at
    this great distance like a very old silent movie.

                        CHARLES DARWIN (V.O.)
              In Terra del Fuego. The "land of
              fire" - A blighted and loveless
              country on the earths furthest
              rim - there lives a community of
              the dirtiest, the rudest, the
              least civilised beings you can
              imagine.

    The telescope focusses. The image becomes a little clearer


4   EXT. CLIFF TOP. DAY                                           4

    The flock of boobies fly out to sea.

    The savages follow as far as the top of the cliffs, where
    they stop in sudden amazement, staring at a distant sailing
    ship.

                        DARWIN (V.O.)
              They were all completely naked,
              the men as well as the women,
              with hair down to their bottoms.
              They spoke in grunts and they
              never washed their hands and
              faces! In many respects they
              resembled wild animals, except
              that animals are kinder to their
              children.

    A savage child makes a comment and gets biffed on the head
    again.

    Strange, foreign cries of the sailors are faintly audible
    over the water, as the anchor is dropped with a rattle and
    a splash. A small boat is lowered.

                        DARWIN
              One day, Captain Fitzroy went
              ashore to meet them.

    The slow rhythm of the oars.

    Sailors and savages clutch their weapons, watching each
    other in breathless anticipation.

5   INT. DAGUERROTYPE STUDIO. THE PAST. DAY.                      5

    A door opens and a figure in black, hurries past, clutching
    a number of prepared photographic plates in their light
    proof cases.

                        TECHNICIAN
              Not long now. I shall be with you
              immediately...

    ANNIE DARWIN, wearing in a checkered dress, aged about 9
    years old, sits looking straight at camera.

    She has short hair and a pretty oval face

    On her lap there is a posy of artificial flowers, in the
    background an improbable vista of jagged mountain.

                        PHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.)
              Ready now. Very still please.

                        ANNIE
              Will this hurt, papa?

                        DARWIN
              No. It is only a beam of light.

                        ANNIE
              How can light make a picture.

                         DARWIN
              Well they prepare a copper plate
              with chemicals on it. The
              chemicals are sort of energized
              by the light reflecting off your
              face.
              Then silver sticks onto the plate
              according to where the light is
              brightest.

                        ANNIE
              Betty was worried it would hurt.
              ....What a little duck she is.

                        DARWIN
              So as I was saying, Captain
              Fitzroy went ashore to interview
              the Fuegans....



6   EXT. SHORE. TIERRA DEL FUEGO. DAY                             6

    Waves lap on the black pebbly beach, where a young naval
    captain FITZROY with mutton chop sideboards disembarks
    lightly from his jolly-boat.
                                                              4


                        DARWIN (V.O.)
              After some discussion persuaded
              three of the savages` children to
              come home with him.

    The "discussion" is more in the nature of heated bargaining
    for slaves.

    Fitzroy finally produces enough cloth and axe-heads to
    secure the deal.

    The unwilling children pushed away by their parents and
    grabbed by sailors who bundle them, biting crying and
    kicking, into the waiting boat.

                        DARWIN (V.O.)
              Their names were Jemmy Buttons,
              York Minster and Fuegia Basket.


7   INT. BELOW DECKS. DAY.                                        7

    Below decks: a slapstick struggle with soap and scrubbing
    brushes - much biting kicking and howling - as sailors
    scrub the children clean.

                        SAILORS
              Ow! Shite! Hold still ye maggot!

                        DARWIN
              The captain had them washed and
              got their hair cut, then dressed
              them in proper clothes, and
              taught them proper table manners.


8   INT. CAPTAIN'S CABIN.    DAY                                  8

    The children, cleaned and dressed,   seem happy enough in
    their new situation.

    They sit at the captain's table clumsily sawing with a
    knife and chasing Brussel sprouts around a plate with their
    cutlery.

    A sprout shoots off the table


9   EXT. SHIP'S DECK. DAY                                         9

    Splosh! A weighted canvas body bag is tipped overboard.

    The rough unshaven seamen crew all remove their hats, some
    of them cry openly.
                                                               5


                         DARWIN
               York Minster died of the smallpox
               but the other two learned English
               and went to meet the queen.


10   EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE. DAY                                   10

     A fanfare as the gates swing open as a coach-and-four
     rattles through.


11   INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE. DAY                                   11

     Jemmy Buttons, looking very smart in velvet suit with
     silver buttons gives proper bow and shakes the Royal hand.

     Fuegia Basket curtsies.

     Queen Victoria remains out of shot but her attendants hand
     out presents off a purple silk cushion: A Bible for Fuegia
     and a telescope for Jemmy


12   EXT. SHORE OF TIERRA DEL FUEGO. DAY.                          12

     Hairy savages reassemble on the cliff tops

                         DARWIN
               Two years later. Captain Fitzroy
               and I took them back, in the
               company of a young Parson, hoping
               they would bring the other
               savages to god and to teach the
               others by example.

     The hairy savages squint from the cliffs to sea....

     Another boat, the Beagle, has anchored in their bay.

     Captain Fitzroy is being rowed ashore with Darwin, plus a
     very young parson and the two young Fuegans, who are happy
     and agitated to see their homeland again.

                         DARWIN
               And what do you think happened?


13   INT. DAGUERROTYPE STUDIO. THE PAST. DAY.                      13

     Annie suspects there is a joke coming and cant help her
     mouth from twitching the corners.

                         DARWIN
                   (laughing)
               Correct! A complete and total
               failure!
                                                              6


14   EXT. ROCKY CREVICES. TERRA DEL FUEGO. DAY                    14

     At the first sight of their countrymen, Jemmy and Fuegia
     rip off their clothes, drop the bible and the telescope,
     and run to join them, yelling like nut-cases.

                           HAIRY SAVAGES
               YAAAAAH!!

                         JEMMY/ FUEGIA
               Yaah!! Yahh!!

     The benighted young parson scrambles after them, collecting
     their discarded garments from among the rain-swept rocks.

                         PARSON
               Jemmy! Fuegia

     The telescope is smashed. The Bible lies abandoned - the
     wind catching its soggy pages and whirling them off in the
     storm.


15   INT. DAGUERROTYPE STUDIO. DAY.                               15

     Darwin still laughing, dabs his eyes

                         ANNIE
                   (laughing)
               Yaaah!

     The photographer disappears behind black curtains.

                         TECHNICIAN
               Very still now. No more talking
               please

     Annie composes her face in an expression of angelic
     seriousness.

     A glass dome above her head glows snapdragon blue

     Close on Darwin watching his daughter, his eyes still damp
     with tears of laughter.

     Electricity hums. The strange blue light glows brighter,
     brighter... Brighter.

     The image of his daughter imprints on Darwin's memory. Just
     so. Forever.


16   INT. DOWN HOUSE. DINING ROOM. THE PRESENT. EVENING.          16

     Servants are laying a table for dinner

     Gas lamps and the coal fire struggle to illuminate the
     lofty room.
                                                          7


Mrs Davies the Welsh cook, bangs the dinner gong and shouts
across the darkening garden outside.

                    MR DAVIES (O.S.)
          Children! Franky! Horace! Dinner!

Darwins attractive wife Emma adjusts the lamps and the boys
run in, Franky aged 10 Lenny aged 8 Horace aged 6.

                       LENNY
          Mama mama.

                    EMMA
          Yes. What is it

                    LENNY
          Horace says he's six feet tall.

                    EMMA
          Have you all washed your hands.

                    HORACE
          He said I have to be or I can't
          join the army.

                    EMMA
          First things first. An officer
          must always tuck his shirt in.

Their elder sisters Betty and Etty take their places at
table

                    BETTY
          The boys made a camp with a camp-
          fire

                       LENNY
          Oh! Sneak!

                    EMMA
          Where's the campfire.

                    BETTY
          In the summer house but Brodie
          put it out.

Parslow enters with the turreen

                    EMMA
          Thank-you Parslow. Where is Mr
          Darwin?

                    PARSLOW
          He was killing pigeons Ma'am

                    EMMA
          Will everybody sit down please.
                                                       8


As they are pulling in their chairs, Darwin enters, drying
his hands on his trousers.

He's aged ten years since we last saw him and has lost his
former air of gaiety.

He sits, with a distracted nod to the family.

                    PARSLOW
          Soup du jour, sir

The children smile at Parslow's air of earnest formality
but the atmosphere even among the younger kids is sombre
and subdued.

                    DARWIN
          Thank you Parslow

He butters some bread and starts eating. Emma clears her
throat.

                    DARWIN.
          Oh.

The children bow their heads. The bread stick in darwins
mouth. Emma says grace.

                    EMMA
          Lord God who watches over all
          that we do. Bless this family and
          the food we eat. In Jesus name.
          Amen.

Everyone repeats the "Amen" except Darwin.

                    EMMA
          I hear Mr Hooker is coming
          tomorrow.

The children prick up their ears at this. They like Hooker

                    DARWIN
          He won't stay long.

                    EMMA
          Did he say what it was about?

                    DARWIN
          I think this is not the time to
          discuss it.

                    EMMA
          Maybe the time to discuss it was
          before you invited him.

                    DARWIN
          He sent a telegram. I'm sorry if
          it inconveniences you.
                                                               9


     Emma purses her lips and turns her attention back to the
     children

                         EMMA
               Eat your soup now.

     Darwin takes a couple of spoonfuls, pauses, as a wave of
     nausea sweeps over him, then pushes away the dish.

                          DARWIN
                    (To Parslow)
               Tell Mr Davies it was delicious,
               but my stomach is not quite right
               yet.
                    (To Emma)
               Excuse me.

     He gets up and leaves. As soon as he has gone, the children
     natural talkativeness reasserts itself.

                         CHILDREN
               Can we take Mr Hooker to the
               Chalk pits. Why can't he stay.
               Can we pick blackberries?

                         EMMA
               I think he is just here to work




17   EXT. DOWN HOUSE. DARWIN'S STUDY. THE PRESENT. NIGHT.          17

     A branch taps gently against the window pain, like an
     insistent guest demanding to be admitted.

     The coal fire burns low in the grate - wind in the chimney
     rattling the damper

     Firelight flickers on a collection of finches in a glass
     case, on a bird skeleton, on a fossil, and on numerous
     specimen bottles containing the fleshy parts of barnacles
     preserved in spirit-of-wine.

     Darwin sits immobile in his chair, regarding a locked,
     black lacquered steel trunk, on the floor under his work
     table.

     A voice speaks behind him.

                         ANNIE
               Aren't you going to open it?

     He turns and sees her sitting on the day bed - the same
     little bright eyed girl from the daguerrotype studio.

     She's the same age as she was then and wearing the same
     checkered dress - though Darwin himself has aged ten years.
                                                              10


                          DARWIN
               Maybe best if I just burn the
               whole lot.

                         ANNIE
                   (horrified)
               No papa - You can't. I'm in it.

                         DARWIN
               Don't be absurd. Of course you're
               not.

                         ANNIE
               The story of me when I was small.
               You showed me the pages.

                          DARWIN
               Ah yes.

                         ANNIE
               "The natural History of babies"
               ...Remember?

                         DARWIN
               Of course I remember.

     He continues to stare at the shiny black box, his hand
     fluttering lightly - a nervous tic.

     Music seeps in - a soothing Chopin Nocturne and....


18   INT. DOWN HOUSE DRAWING ROOM.   THE PAST. NIGHT               18

     Darwin aged 40 - bright-eyed and inquisitive leans over to
     examine something, offering it his finger tip while making
     little tut tut tut noises.

     In the cot is a one-month old baby.

                         DARWIN
               Annie. Annie. Annie.

     The piano music continuing over, as her fist closes round
     the end of his finger, then tries to pull it towards her
     mouth.

     He pulls it away from her and she frowns.

     He offers it again and the tug of war becomes a game.

     Baby Annie laughs.

     Darwin writes something in his notebook. Then tucks his
     pencil behind his ear and tries out various facial
     expressions - scowling, smiling - to gauge the baby's
     response.
                                                           11


     Emma turns on the piano-stool.

                         EMMA
                   (affectionately)
               What are you doing?

                         DARWIN
               Just playing.

     She comes over and, leaning against him, reads from his
     notebook.

                         EMMA
               "Six weeks: Gurgles. Holds tight
               to my finger. Tries to suck.
               Smiles at my smile"

     The baby lets out a long yodel of pleasure

                         DARWIN
               I should add that she is musical.

                         EMMA
               I hope you do not plan to treat
               all our children as little
               animacules to be included in your
               experiments.

                         DARWIN
               Do you mean there will be more.

                         EMMA
               I assumed that's what you wanted.
               Of course, if the idea doesn't
               appeal then...

                         DARWIN
               Appeal? Dearest cousin. I am
               making plans for an army!

     He takes Emma in his arms. She gives a little squeak -
     caught off balance then laughing as he waltzes her around
     the room, singing.


19   EXT. WOODS AND MEADOW. THE PAST. DAY                        19

     An army of children - the Darwin family - run across the
     screen from left to right. The little kids first,
     scampering through the hay meadow off into the trees.

     Household servants follow, carrying blankets, hampers and
     parasols.

     The red haired Scottish nursemaid Brodie, shouts ahead to
     the little ones.
                                                            12


                         BRODIE
               Careful! Not too far ahead now.

     The children ignore her so she pick up her skirts and races
     after them.

     The Adults follow in their wake - Charles and Emma Darwin
     plus two younger men aged about 30 - Joe Hooker and the Rev
     Innes


20   EXT. RIVER BANK. THE PAST. DAY                               20

     They have set up their picnic on a river bank.

     Emma is reading.

     Joseph Hooker is teaching the boys to fish. He has
     spectacles and long wispy side-whiskers: a battered panama
     on his head and his trousers rolled up to his knees.

                         HOOKER
               Give it time to take a bite.

     The fishing float moves a little

                         HOOKER
               He's Nibbling. Nibbling. Oh
               Bother. No-one move.

     He's dropped his spectacles in the shallows.

     George (aged 5) feels a jerk on the line. He squeals and
     drops the rod. The fish takes off upriver. Will goes after
     the dropped rod.

     On shore, Annie runs up with a collecting box to show her
     father

                         ANNIE
               I've got one.

     She opens the box to show him a little black beetle.

     The local parson, Innes, inclines his head to inspect it

                         ANNIE
               What should I feed it?

                         MR INNES
               A leaf I should think. What plant
               did you find him on?

                         ANNIE
               In the mud under that log.

     Innes looks to Darwin for advice
                                                      13


                    MR INNES
          ...Or a piece of bark maybe.

Darwin peers at the insect

                    DARWIN
          Cycrus caraboides. You can see
          from the mandibles he's a hunter.
          He feeds on slugs and snails.

                    INNES
          Oh.

Annie runs off, calling to the other children

                    ANNIE
          Etty! Willy! Find me some slugs.
          He's hungry!

                    INNES
          When I said I knew something of
          insects.....

                    DARWIN
          Oh tush.... I studied Theology
          for a year but yet I know
          exceedingly little of the bible.

                    INNES
          Then once I am properly installed
          at Down I shall take pleasure in
          instructing you.

                     DARWIN
          I should look forward to that
          immensely.

Emma, knowing her husband's ambivalence towards religion,
casts him a slightly arch, amused look. Innes notices this,
though he pretends not to.

Hooker returns from the river, looking slightly damp, with
the rod which he has managed to retrieve

                    HOOKER
          Everyone's a bit wet. Sorry, but
          the fish are surely biting. More
          worms, boys, more worms.

George is looking under stones

                    HOOKER
          Try over there, Georgey, we've
          used all these ones up.

They move off, joining Annie and the other in their hunt
for crawling things. The air above them is heavy and
sparkling with pollen.
                                                           14


21   EXT. OCEAN. NIGHT                                            21

     A sailing ship sails past, trailing phosphorescence it its
     wake.

                         DARWIN (V.O.)
               On the Beagle, quite, often we
               would drop a flask in the ocean
               and find it teeming with living
               particles which glowed in the
               night


22   INT. SHIP'S CABIN. NIGHT                                     22

     The figure in silhouette of young Darwin inspects a flask
     of sea water, glowing in the darkness.

     He takes a few drops on a watch glass and places them on
     the illuminated stage of his microscope.

     Under the microscope, against a black background, millions
     of tiny swimming animals.


23   EXT. BY THE RIVER BANK. THE PAST. DAY                        23

     Cut to the air above the picnickers - alive with glittering
     particles - against the dark trees behind.

                         DARWIN
               ....so much beauty for so little
               purpose.

                         EMMA
               Surely not without purpose. They
               were helping to light the ship's
               way were they not.

     Darwin smiles at the idea, turns to Innes

                         DARWIN
               Are you familiar with the works
               of Thomas Malthus, Mr Innes?.

                          INNES
               He married his first cousin
               didn't he?

                         EMMA
               So did Charles.... So did I.

                         INNES
               Oh, I was not at all
               suggesting....

     Emma waves it away. Just teasing
                                                        15


                    DARWIN
          He made the point that if every
          trout, say, has a hundred
          offspring And so on and so on
          through the generations. Then the
          planet would be knee deep in
          trout in just a few decades.

                    INNES
          Of course most of the eggs are
          destroyed and eaten so the
          numbers remain stable. That is
          the beauty of God's plan.

Emma gives Darwin a "So there" look and hands Innes a
sandwich.

                    EMMA
          Cheese and cucumber

                      INNES
          Thank-you

Somewhere in the woods, Annie has found a treasure trove of
worms and slugs.

                    ANNIE (O.S. DISTANT)
          Over here ....there are millions!

                    DARWIN
          It doesn't strike you as an
          exceedingly wasteful plan - these
          myriad lives created only to be
          immediately extinguished.

                    EMMA
              (a gentle warning)
          Charles....

                    INNES
              (confidently)
          They are providing food for
          others.

                    DARWIN
          You think they are happy about
          it?

                      INNES
          Happy?

Close up on a writing worm. Hooker is instructing George
how to put a worm on a hook.

                    HOOKER
          Through his bottom and up though
          his mouth - perfect
                                                      16


                    DARWIN
          ....To be doing Gods will.

                    EMMA
              (to Innes)
          Please ignore him. After two
          glasses of claret he tends to
          becomes mischievous.

                    DARWIN
          No I'm serious. If thousands are
          destroyed that a few may live
          their lives, is not the general
          sum total of happiness not in
          some kind of massive deficit?

                    INNES
          Well far be it from me to
          speculate on the mind of God, far
          less the happiness of an
          earthworm ha ha ha. But it seems
          to me that nature is at
          peace...and most of her denizens
          are content.

                    EMMA
          Amen.

                    INNES
              (to Darwin)
          You don't agree.

                    DARWIN
          I think it is a battlefield. A
          constant and shifting struggle
          for survival between everything
          and everything else.

                     EMMA
          I really do think men have a
          problem with natural beauty. They
          cannot ever just accept it for
          what it is.
              (Calls off)
          Children! Sandwiches!
              (Then)
          Tell me of your wife Mr Innes.

Darwin lies back on the rug and turns his head away from
the sun.

The base of a tangled hedgerow is just a few feet away.

Looking into its tangled depths he sees something gleaming
white - the skull of a sheep with briars growing through
the eye sockets.
                                                              17


24   EXT. BASE OF THE HEDGEROW. TIME-LAPSE. NIGHT                  24

     The sheep's skull is half-decomposed.

     In fast forward we see maggots pecking the remnants of
     flesh from the bone, birds feeding on the maggots.

     A bird becomes trapped among the briars. It flaps madly
     upsetting a nest.

     Eggs and blind featherless hatchlings fall down through the
     dark web of branches where they are devoured by voles and
     rats, then slugs, then worms

     All the times tendrils and vines are growing, the skull -
     bleached white - now encased in a cage of thick spiny
     branches, fizzing with insect life, where ants and ground
     beetles feast on the carcasses of slugs and....


25   INT. DARWIN'S BEDROOM. THE PRESENT. DAWN                      25

     Darwin wakes in sudden terror.

     Dawn light illuminates the wallpaper in front of him - a
     William Morris design of interweaving vines.

     Emma, is asleep in her night-cap at his side.

     Darwin lies for a while in the semi darkness, until his
     hand, fluttering on the coverlet, becomes still at last.


26   INT. SCULLERY. THE PAST. DAY.                                 26

     Light and noise.

     Crash of gleaming copperware, clattering of water in the
     pipes as the servants prepare Sunday breakfast

     The cook, Mrs Davies looks out through a steamed up window
     to see the angular figure of Charles Darwin, bent almost
     double inspecting a tiny segment of lawn.

     Brodie joins Mrs Davies at the window.

                         MRS DAVIES
               What is he doing now, exactly?

                         BRODIE
               Cutting the grass with nail
               scissors.

                         MRS DAVIES
               Such a shame he never had a
               proper job. At least your Mr
               Thackeray had his books to write.
                                                              18


27   INT. DOWN HOUSE. THE PAST. DAY                                27

     Children thunder up and down the stairs between Brodie who
     is doing a final check on grooming and Emma who is
     marshalling them in the hall.


28   INT. HALLWAY. THE PAST. DAY                                   28

                         EMMA
               Chop chop Georgie. Socks! And you
               have not buttoned your trousers.

     Baby Lenny starts crying and she goes to comfort him


29   INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM. THE PAST. DAY.                           29

     Brodie is arranging hair and tying ribbons for Annie (9)
     Etty (6) and Betty (3)

                         ANNIE
               Did you never think of getting
               married Miss Brodie.

                         BRODIE
               Once. But he went to Australia
               and I missed my chance.

     Willy passes the door, his hair in need of brushing.

                         BRODIE
               Master William. Hairbrush.

     William comes in. Brodie brushes the back of his hair.

                          WILLY
               Ow. Ow!

                         BRODIE
               Well what do you expect. It is a
               birds nest.

                         WILLY
               Papa says God doesn't care if we
               are neat.

                         BRODIE
                   (brushing)
               Your father is a very wize man
               but has a small understanding of
               religion. No-one can read what
               goes down in Gods great book of
               accounts. ....Fingernails.

     Willy presents them for checking.
                                                              19


                         BRODIE
               You can go.


30   INT. HALLWAY. THE PAST. DAY.                                  30

     The children come racing and swinging and clattering down
     the stairs.

     Emma, holding the baby in one arm, steers a tricycle out of
     the way, clearing a path to the door

                         EMMA
               Mrs Davies, Will you ask Jenny to
               wear a bonnet. I would not like
               people to think her fast.

     George aged 5 tugs at her skirt

                         WILLY
               Can I bring my mouse for a
               blessing?

                         EMMA
               What mouse?

     George (5) pulls it out from his pocket. Its dead, muddy
     and bloody

                         GEORGE
               Elsie caught it in the barn. We
               need to pray for his soul

                         EMMA
               Mice don't have souls. Leave it
               on the window sill. Everyone come
               now or we shall be late.


31   EXT. LANEWAY. DOWN HOUSE. THE PAST. DAY                       31

     Pealing of church bells

     Mist rises from the ploughed fields and hangs among the
     ancient oaks.

     A little procession heads down the lane. The Darwins -
     Charles and Emma - plus their servants and children (older
     now, for we have flipped into the present), all in their
     Sunday best.

     The trees are bare. Their breath condenses as they walk.


32   EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE. THE PRESENT. DAY                         32

     The ancient flint church stands in the centre of Downe
     (sic) village, opposite the George and Dragon pub.
                                                             20


     A massive and venerable Yew tree casts its shade over a
     number of gravestones one of them inscribed "to Mary Darwin
     born Sept 1842 died Oct 1842."

     Beyond the church fence, villagers greet each other before
     heading inside. The great majority of the village have
     turned out, from Squire Lubbock through the tradesmen and
     domestic servants from the village to the clodhoppers (farm
     labourers) in their colored smocks.

     Rev Innes is welcoming his large flock at the gate.

                         EMMA
               Reverend Innes.

                         INNES
                   (smiling)
               Ma'am. Welcome. Welcome

     Then his eye moves on to Charles Darwin and his smile
     falters, his expression turning slightly cold.

     Darwin tips his hat rather stiffly and walks away, through
     the throng of parishioners, leaving his family to file into
     the church without him.


33   EXT. WOODLAND. PRESENT. DAY                                  33

     Darwin walks across the meadow and into the woods.

     A flock of crows take flight from the rookery in the bare
     trees overhead.




34   INT. DOVECOTE. PRESENT. DAY                                  34

     In darkness, a furious struggle, squawking and frantically
     beating wings.

     Darwin seizes on a dove and backs out of the dovecote, the
     silhouette of his upper torso taking shape in the square
     hole in the floor.

     He climbs down the ladder, passes the captive bird down to
     Parslow, then climbs back up and pushes him upper body into
     the dovecot again, in search of the next victim.


35   EXT. THE GARDEN. DOWN HOUSE. THE PRESENT. DAY                35

     The dovecote is a substantial affair on four pillars with a
     ladder in the centre.

     Outside the dovecote, the boys are racing around playing at
     soldiers. (Franky 10, Lenny 8, Horace 6)
                                                              21


     Parslow has a number of the birds in cages

                         DARWIN
               Ring the two milky pouters. We'll
               sacrifice the tumblers and
               skeletonize them. Then...

     He looks up as a coach appears in the lane. The boys
     immediately break off from their game and run after it,
     shouting.

                         BOYS
               It's Mr Hooker. It's Mr Hooker!

     Darwin tries to wipe the bird shit off his hands and
     succeeds only in getting it on his sleeve.

     His breathing quickens. He seems at a loss. Parslow is
     awaiting further instructions

                         PARSOLOW
               Then... what Sir?

                         DARWIN
               Just. ...to the shed with them. I
               shall clean myself up.

     He hurries off.


36   EXT. THE FRONT GATE. THE PRESENT. DAY.                        36

     The coach pulls up and Hooker alights - ten years older
     than when we saw him catching fish, but still with the same
     hallmark side whiskers and wire-rimmed spectacles, the same
     springy step and ready grin.

     Already he is being mobbed by the younger boys - Lenny,
     Franky, and Horace - who clearly adore him.

                         BOYS(AD LIB)
               - We're the Light Brigade Horace
               is a Russian.

                         HOOKER
               Good choice Horace. I shall be
               Lord Raglan and watch the
               slaughter from a safe distance.

                         BOYS
               - Will you give us a piggy-back?
               - Lenny cut his foot on a nail.
               There was lots of blood!

     Emma emerges from the front door. She smiles, pleased to
     see Hooker despite her misgivings.
                                                         22


Then her smile falters as another man emerges from the
coach behind him.

                    HOOKER
          Emma. Forgive the short notice.
          You know Thomas Huxley.

                    EMMA
          Only by reputation

                    HUXLEY
          Mrs Darwin.

                    HOOKER
          He insisted on coming and I could
          not refuse him.

                    EMMA
          Tell papa his visitors are here.

                    LENNY
          He knows already.

                    HORACE
          He went that way.

Emma smiles brightly, covering for her embarrassment at her
husband's increasingly erratic behavior.

                    EMMA
          Anyway. Come in please. Come in.

Hooker heads towards the house, the boy still clustered
around him.

                    FRANKY
          Sir, Is it true when you were in
          the Himalayas you were imprisoned
          by the king of Sikkim?

                    HOOKER
          Absolutely true.

                    LENNY
          And he thought you were a spy for
          stealing his rhododendrons?

                    HOOKER
          That's approximately true.

                    FRANKY
          ....and he wouldn't let you leave
          unless you agreed to marry his
          fattest daughter.
                                                             23


                         HOOKER
               Yes. (Conspiratorial) ....but
               you are never to tell my wife
               that!

                         EMMA
               Children leave Mr Hooker alone
               now. I'm sure he has more
               important things to discuss.

                         HOOKER
               Not really, but I think Mr Huxley
               does....

     Huxley has seen Darwin, washing his hands by the
     "skeletonizing shed".

     Huxley hangs back to introduce himself as Hooker steers
     Emma off into the house.

                         HOOKER
               I have my heart set on a cup of
               tea and one of Mrs Davies'
               scones.

     Emma looks anxiously after Huxley but allows herself to be
     gently side-lined.


37   INT. KITCHEN. THE PRESENT. DAY .                             37

     Emma is by the kitchen window, rearranging tea things on a
     tray.

     The sky outside is dark and lowering.

     Through the window she can see Darwin heading off down the
     sand walk - head bowed, walking stick in hand - deep in
     conversation with Huxley.

     She drops a tea-cup which smashes on the stone floor.

                         MRS DAVIES
               I'll do that ma'am. Please. Let
               me do it.


38   EXT. DOWN HOUSE. THE SAND WALK. THE PRESENT. DAY.            38

     The Sand-walk is a gravel walking path between the garden
     and the fields, flanked by mature oaks and ancient willows.

                         HUXLEY
               We're reforming the Linnean. The
               committee will comprise myself,
               Lyell, Huxley...yourself of
               course if you are willing.
                                                      24


Darwin grunts noncommittally. The Crunch crunch of their
feet is punctuated by the regular stomp of his metal-shod
walking stick.

                    HUXLEY
          We intend to reclaim science as a
          profession - wrest it away from
          the country parsons and beetle-
          collectors. Your book will be our
          rallying point.

                    DARWIN.
          You know it is not yet any fit
          state to publish.

                    HUXLEY
          I have read your detailed
          abstract. The argument is
          complete and utterly compelling.
          All that is lacking is the detail
          and we know you have that in
          abundance. Your barnacle work has
          established you as the pre-
          eminent authority on marine life.

                    DARWIN.
          On one small mollusc!

                     HOOKER
          In which the whole story of
          creation can be read. Do not
          pretend to me that was not your
          intention.

                    DARWIN.
          Honestly....

                    HUXLEY
          A "family tree" of barnacles
          stretching back 300 million years
          to the time it was a free
          swimming prawn!.

                    DARWIN.
          There are many gaps.

                    HOOKER
          Of course with gaps! But that is
          the very point. If we but had the
          complete fossil record we could
          trace all life back to one speck
          of protoplasm. The branching of
          forms in ever more complex
          succession...until.

                    DARWIN.
          Yes yes, but one cannot infer too
          much.
                                                      25


                    HOOKER
          Mr Darwin. Either you are being
          disingenuous or you do not fully
          understand you own
          accomplishment. You have killed
          God.

                      DARWIN.
          Mr Huxley

                    HUXLEY
          ....and good riddance to the
          bearded malicious old bugger!

                    DARWIN
              (interrupts)
          Please I must beg of you....

                    HUXLEY
          No. I must beg of you sir. Joseph
          Hooker we know is too nice a chap
          to do it. You are a fine and
          brilliant man who hates to give
          offence - an admirable quality -
          wish I had it myself. But what do
          we believe? What do we know to be
          true. Will you light the way or
          leave us all to flounder in the
          mire for another decade.

He stops and lowers himself onto a bench, teeth clenched.

                    HOOKER
          Are you alright?

                    DARWIN.
          A touch of indigestion. It will
          pass.

Its clearly worse than that, but Huxley, refusing to be
distracted, blithely ignores it and sits down beside him
til the worst of it passes.

                    HUXLEY
          It is time to write your book Mr
          Darwin. Write it brilliantly as
          we all know you can. Strike hard
          and fast with a blow that is
          utterly conclusive.

                    DARWIN
              (in pain)
          Sir, you are talking like a
          revolutionary and really...

                    HUXLEY
          It is a revolution. And not
          before time.
                    (MORE)
                                                           26

                         HUXLEY (cont'd)
               Goodbye to the lot of em - damned
               bishops and Archbishops with
               their threats of eternal
               punishment.

                         DARWIN
               And you'd replace Gods Laws with
               what.

                         HUXLEY
               The laws of logic. The laws of
               nature.

                         DARWIN
               Knowing, as we do, that most
               capital crimes are her everyday
               practises: Theft, rape, murder,
               adultery, infanticide....

     Huxley waves it away

                         DARWIN
               We live in a society bound
               together by the church. An
               improbable sort of barque I grant
               you but at least it floats. You
               suggest we change all that at a
               stroke. You wish me to rebuild,
               plank by plank, the very vessel
               we are sailing in.


39   EXT. DOWN HOUSE. DAY.                                        39

     The Coach to London has pulled up outside the front gate.
     Huxley is aboard. Darwin is talking with the coachman

     Hooker comes down the path in his black coat, carrying his
     Gladstone bag.

                            EMMA
               Mr Hooker.

     He turns. He has already said his good-byes.

                         EMMA
               I beg you, please don't push him.

                         HOOKER
               No-one can push Charles. You know
               how fixed he is. Bit of a
               barnacle himself ... his own
               words.

                         EMMA
               And if you prize him from his
               rock he will die. I know you all
               mean well but....
                                                              27


                         COACHMAN
                   (Impatiently)
               All aboard!

     Hooker gets aboard. Huxley leans out of a window and waves
     cheerily to the whey-faced Darwin

                         HUXLEY
               We'll meet again, Mr Darwin


40   INT. THE LANEWAY. DAY                                         40

     The coach pulls away.

     Looking back though the rear window Hooker sees Emma with
     the boys clustered around her skirts.

                         HUXLEY
               What did she say to you?

                         HOOKER
               That it was killing him.

                         HUXLEY
               A mighty slow death considering
               the time he's spent. We'll be
               dead and buried ourselves if he
               prevaricates much longer.

     Huxley takes off his spectacles and polishes them,
     embarrassed by Huxley's directness, inspecting his own
     conscience in the bevelled glass.


41   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY. NIGHT                                    41

     In the darkened study, with his specimens and books all
     around him, Darwin kneels by the box.

     Steeling himself, he unlocks the padlock and opens the lid
     and takes out the papers and notebooks which are stored
     there.

     The bulk of it is a single manuscript, accumulated over
     many years, divided into 14 chapters with pages of notes
     interleaved.

     The Chapters are headed. Variation under domestication,
     variation under nature, Struggle for Existence, Natural
     Selection....

     A noise behind him almost makes him jump out of his skin.

     Its Annie, ten years old in her checked dress, as she will
     always be in his imagination.
                                                              28


                         ANNIE
               Why are you scared?

                         DARWIN
               Like you said. You're in it.

                         ANNIE
               Its only a book, silly.

     He sits there regarding the open box, paralysed by
     indecision. Annie tenderly smooths his hair, rearranging
     his collar.

                         DARWIN
               What are you doing, Annie?

                         ANNIE
               I'm making you beautiful.

                         DARWIN
               I have to work.

     Though the soft touch of her little hands is almost too
     real for him to bear and he closes his eyes

                         ANNIE
               Breath in, papa. Breathe out. Now
               Tell me a story.

                         DARWIN
               I have no time....

                         ANNIE
               About Jenny. Please?

     The sound of a wave breaking. Wind stirs Darwin's hair

     He opens his eyes and he is ....


42   EXT. ENGLISH BEACHSIDE. THE PAST DAY                          42

     Sitting with Annie ten years ago on an English pebble
     beach.

     She has collected a pile of shells and is arranging them in
     "families".

     The dialogue is continuous

                         DARWIN
               Why do you always ask for Jenny?
               Its so sad.

                         ANNIE
               That's why I like it. It makes me
               cry.
                                                           29


     She looks up from her shells and smiles winningly.

     Darwin looks out to sea, at the bright crashing line of
     surf, and begins the familiar, much-told tale:

                         DARWIN
               Once apon a time there was a
               family of Orang-u-tangs living in
               the jungles of darkest Borneo



43   EXT. JUNGLES OF BORNEO. DAY                                  43

     Our POV moves between dark tropical trees to find a group
     of Orangutans flopping around grooming each other.

     As with the land of the Fuegan savages, there is something
     slightly artificial about these jungles, as though the
     trees really belong in Kew gardens, and the naked jungle
     warriors, whom we now see stalking through them, are on
     loan from the museum of mankind.

                         DARWIN
               Their eldest daughter was the
               most loving, caring and trusting
               Orang of all.

     We follow a young nimble female, swinging through the
     trees, revelling in her own gymnastic ability, until she
     stops - hearing something: the sound of human speech.

                         DARWIN
               But these qualities in themselves
               cannot guarantee an ape's
               survival. Sometimes, quite the
               reverse.

     Native hunters are creeping through the undergrowth

     A warning screech from one of the Orang-u-tangs posted as
     lookouts.

     Most of the apes flee up into the canopy. Jenny stays where
     she is, fascinated, just a moment longer than is prudent.

                         DARWIN
               When she realized her danger it
               was too late.

     As she turns to flee a weighted net is thrown on top of
     her. The hunters pounce.

                         DARWIN
               They put her in a bag and carried
               her off....
                                                              30


                         ANNIE
               " much to her loving parent's
               sorrow."

                            DARWIN
               Exactly.

     The family screech and hoot, anguished, as the hunters head
     back off through the trees.


44   EXT. MARKET-PLACE. DAY                                        44

     Exotic coins and bank-notes pass from hand to hand: from
     the tribal chief to the sultan, in his overlarge turban,
     from the sultan to the trader in his solar topee and
     stained white suit.

                         DARWIN
               The hunters sold her the to the
               Sultan who promptly sold her to a
               visiting Englishman who packed
               her aboard a sailing ship and
               brought her to London zoo.

     Jenny is taken out of a bamboo cage and put into a metal
     cage.


45   INT. CARGO SHIP. DAY                                          45

     The cage is lowered by a crane. Jenny looks out from her
     swaying prison at spinning grey skies and brick warehouses.


46   INT. CAGE. LONDON ZOO. DAY                                    46

     Now she sits disconsolately in a corner of her permanent
     enclosure.

     She has been dressed, ridiculously and poignantly in a
     smock and a bonnet.

     A group of onlookers are trying to get a reaction out of
     her. Eventually they give up and move on.

                         DARWIN
               In London she had many admirers -
               of whom your father was but one.

     Darwin moves forwards from the shadows, where he has been
     observing and taking notes.

     As the other humans move away be attempts to start a
     conversation with Jenny in her own language, much in the
     way he communicated with baby Annie.
                                                        31


                    DARWIN
          Hoo hoo hoo hoo.

Jenny regards him sceptically then looks away.

                    DARWIN.
          HOO!!

She startles and looks at him aggressively.

                    DARWIN
          Hm?

He reaches in his pocket. This gets her interest. She comes
closer, expecting food.

Darwin takers out a sprig of verbena - a strongly scented
herb.

He holds in front of his nose and inhales, making contented
expressions of pleasure.

Jenny watches.

Darwin holds the verbena towards Jenny.

Cautiously she extends a hand through the bars.

Their fingers touch in space, like God Giving life to Adam.
For Darwin its a breakthrough - a moment of connection.

Jenny eats the verbena and spits it out, shrieking angrily.

                    CHARLES
          Wait, sorry, wait - I've got
          something else here for you

He reaches in his pocket. She cocks her head, alert.

With the air of a conjurer, he pulls out:

A child's hand mirror, flashing as it catches the sun
through the skylights.

                    CHARLES
              (pleasurable surprise)
          Ahhhh!!

He shows Jenny her own reflection and, then hands the
mirror through the bars.

Jenny takes the mirror, bites it, discovers it is inedible,
and smashes it on the ground.

Charles makes a sad, whining sound

                    CHARLES
          Hew Hew Hew...
                                                              32


                         JENNY
                   (pouting)
               Hmph.

     Meaning: "OK then, I'm sorry."

     It's such a complex human reaction - grudging contrition -
     that Charles laughs aloud with pleasure.

     Jenny laughs.

     Charles takes out a mouth organ and plays a snatch of
     Chopin.

     Jenny covers her ears and chatters. "Not listening not
     listening!"

     Charles, insulted, stops playing.

     Jenny laughs waves a hand as if to say: "Play, if it amuses
     you. I'm must kidding."


47   EXT. THE BEACH. THE PAST. DAY                                 47

     The salt wind. The dazzling light. The slow pulse of the
     surf.

     Darwin has paused in his narrative.

                         ANNIE
               Go on papa.

                         DARWIN
               Go on what.

                         ANNIE
               The bit where she gets sick and
               dies.

                         DARWIN
               No. Why do you want to hear that
               bit?

                         ANNIE
               I just like it. It makes me cry.

     Darwin smiles, his own eyes filling with tears.

     Then a door opens, softly, in the sky.


48   INT. THE STUDY. THE PRESENT. NIGHT                            48

     It opens wider to reveal Emma's elegant profile, framed
     against the gaslight of the hallway.
                                                      33


Her POV: the black box is unlocked and open, its contents
strewn around the floor at darwins feet.

Darwin is sitting on the floor of the study holding in his
had a magazine, published by the Society for the useful
Distribution of Knowledge, with a picture of Jenny on the
cover

                    EMMA
          Are you coming to bed?

                       DARWIN
          Presently.

He doesn't move. She comes in

                    EMMA
          What did Huxley want?

                    DARWIN
          He thinks I should write it and
          be done with it. He feels it is a
          question of moral courage ...or
          the lack of it.

                    EMMA
          You did not tell him about your
          health.

                    DARWIN
          His theory is that I am making
          myself ill by holding back. That
          I should lance the boil. Plunge
          in and hang the consequences.

                    EMMA
          Thank the Lord he is not a
          surgeon.

Darwin takes a breath and plunges in himself:

                    DARWIN
          I've concluded he is right. Bite
          the gag. Speed is everything. It
          will all be over in a matter of
          months.

Emma is horrified.

                    EMMA
          It is not mere months that
          concern me Charles. Nor even
          years or decades...

Its said quietly but with genuine anguish. To Emma it is
as though her life partner has announced he's contemplating
suicide.
                                                           34


                         EMMA
               Do you really care   so little for
               your immortal soul   - for the
               knowledge that you   and I may
               never be together,   in all of
               eternity.

                         DARWIN
                   (softly)
               You know that what concerns you
               concerns me also. What do think
               has held me in limbo all these
               years.

     Emma has. They both know it. She turns abruptly from the
     door and hurries away.


49   INT. BEDROOM. THE PRESENT. NIGHT.                            49

     Emma has been crying. She lies in bed pretending to sleep.

     Darwin gets into bed behind her. He wants desperately to
     reach out a hand to touch her, to comfort her, but he
     cannot do it for fear of weakening his own fragile resolve.

                         DARWIN
               Dearest Emma. You know This is
               not a decision made lightly....


50   INT. DARWINS STUDY. THE PRESENT. DAWN                        50

     In the dawn light, Darwin is writing a letter to his wife.

                         DARWIN (V.O.)
               .... It has been a very slow and
               gradual process, like the raising
               of continents.


51   EXT. GARDEN. THE PRESENT. DAY.                               51

     EMMA stands alone in the wintry garden, a white apron over
     her black dress, reading.

                         DARWIN (V.O)
               What else can I say to you,
               except that it seems the process
               is now complete.

     A tear tracks down the curve of Emma's cheek as she folds
     the letter, puts it in her pocket and return to the
     business of dead-heading flowers.

     In voice over we hear singing.
                                                             35


                           CONGREGATION
               All   things bright and beautiful,
               all   creatures great and small.
               All   things wize and wonderful,
               The   lord God made them all.


52   EXT. DOWN VILLAGE CHURCH . THE PAST. DAY.                     52

     Move in through the graveyard, past the ancient yew..

                         CONGREGATION (OS)
               Each little flower that opens,
               Each little bird that sings,
               He made their glowing colors,
               He made their tiny wings.



53   INT. DOWNE VILLAGE CHURCH. THE PAST. DAY.                     53

     The church is packed for the Sunday Morning service

     The Darwin family stand in the front row.

     Emma, the servants and the rest of the family are singing
     lustily: Parslow - a somewhat pompous operatic tenor,
     Brodie and Innes both loudly Scottish (Innes out of tune),
     Annie by Darwins side, trilling along in a tuneful little
     descant.

     She notices her father is not singing and offers him her
     hymn book with the words.

     Darwin smiles and returns it. Its not that he doesn't know
     the lyrics, its just that he can't bring himself to say
     them.

                         DARWIN FAMILY
               All things bright and beautiful
               all creatures great and small.
               All things wize and wonderful the
               Lord God made them all.

     The organ, played by Mrs Innes,   wheezes to a pause. Innes
     himself mounts the pulpit.

                         INNES
               Let us pray.

     Everyone bows their heads in prayer.

                         INNES (CONT'D)
               Lord God we know the world is
               governed by Thy plan.

     Darwin is immediately not listening.
                                                              36


     He looks along the row of his children, standing dutifully
     in a line between Charles and Emma.

     George, aged 5, is studying the woodlice which are nesting
     between the pages of his hymnal

                         INNES (O.S)
               Extending even to the merest
               creatures thou hast made, such
               that even a sparrow falls not to
               the ground without thy will.

     Darwin, stands watching the play of light from the stained
     glass window on his shoes. Then raises his head

                         INNES
               Teach us that all misfortune.
               All sickness and death, all the
               trials and miseries of which we
               daily complain are intended for
               our good, being not the vagaries
               of an uncaring universe but the
               corrections of a wize and
               affectionate parent

     Innes looks up sternly and sees the Darwin's head raised
     among the sea of down-turned heads.

     Their eyes meet briefly in a sort of challenge, and in that
     moment, Darwin somehow knows with absolutely certainty that
     religious faith has left him.

     With a whispered word to the beadle standing next to him to
     take the collection Darwin slips out from the pew and heads
     off up the aisle.

                           DARWIN
               Excuse me

     He's intending to be quiet and subtle but the creaking
     boards under his feet loudly announce his departure.

     Innes raises his voice above the fusillade.

                         INNES
               Turn with me now to the book of
               Job, Chapter Two verse twelve

     The congregation, not daring to raise their heads, watch
     Darwin's sturdy walking shoes departing down the aisle.


54   EXT. THE CHURCH. THE PAST. DAY.                               54

     The rise and fall of Innes's voice continues in the
     background as Darwin walks out from the porch, emerging
     from shadow into sunlight.
                                                              37


     A summers day. He feels like a weight has been lifted.

     The church beadle comes out behind him.

                         BEADLE
               Are you all right, sir?

                         DARWIN
               Never better. Thank-you.

     He heads off up the gravel path


55   INT WOODLANDS. THE PRESENT. DAY                               55

     The faint and Distant sound of church singing filters
     through the misty woods. The black wet trunks of trees
     catch the sunlight.

     Frosty dew highlights Mistletoe and holly and dead bracken
     and the sudden red flash of a robin.

     Darwin cuts a strange dark angular figure, walking along
     the narrow track a single step at a time.

     He pauses breathing, and listens.

     His quick eye catches the robin seizing a worm.

     Further on. A pheasant breaks cover. A hare stands upright
     in a clearing then bounds away.

     Darwin looks down and takes another step, placing his feet
     carefully, silently so as not to disturb the wildlife.

     Cut to a different pair of much newer shoes in exactly the
     same spot.


56   INT. WOODLANDS. THE PAST. DAY                                 56

     Darwin is ten years younger, pacing in the same, measured
     way through summer woodland.

     There's a noise behind him and he turns, finger to his lips
     for silence.

     Annie turns away from him and passes the sign down the line
     of children: Etty, George, Betty and Franky, in decreasing
     order of height.

                         ANNIE
               Shh

                         FRANKY
                   (to ANNIE)
               What are we looking at?
                                                      38


The question comes back up the line

                      DARWIN
          A weasel.

The children bunch up to gaze on a strange and wonderful
sight.

In a little sun-dappled clearing a weasel is turning loop
the loops in a strange spiralling dance for the benefit
of...

...a young rabbit, which sits utterly hypnotized by the
performance.

At first its strange and amusing, then the dance becomes
more sinister. The weasel advancing by tiny increments as
it tumbles in the air, finally

                      ANNIE
          NO!

The weasel seizes the bunny rabbit by the back of the neck
and shakes it savagely.

The rabbit shrieks and spasms.

Annie is beside herself, drumming the ground with her feet
in a fever of fear and pity.

The rabbit is still in its dearth throes, its neck broken,
its back legs still jerking

                    ANNIE
          No! No! Stop it. Daddy. Stop it.
          Make it stop.

The rabbit is already dead.

                    DARWIN
          Annie, Annie, Annie.

He sinks to his knees, heedless of the mud on his Sunday
best worsted, embracing her.

The others are shocked and amazed by the rabbits death, but
none of them distressed as Annie. They are country children
and death is an everyday event

                    GEORGE
          The chickens do that too when
          cookie kills them

                    ANNIE
              (tearful furious)
          Chickens are different!
              (To her father)
                    (MORE)
                                                           39

                         ANNIE (cont'd)
               Why didn't you do something. You
               should have stopped it!

                         DARWIN
               The weasel has to eat. Its the
               way of the world. Annie

                         ANNIE
               Its not fair. Its not fair.

                         DARWIN
               No, its not fair at all.

     Patting her and stroking her as the little sobs subside.

     The weasel is dragging the dead rabbit back to its lair.

                         DARWIN
               ....but still it is
               extraordinary, do you not think,
               that a weasel should learn to
               dance the polka.

     Despite herself the concept amuses Annie. Chest still
     heaving with sobs - she dries her eyes and smiles at him
     through her tears.


57   INT. DOWN HOUSE. BEDROOMS. THE PAST .NIGHT .                 57

     Piano music - Chopin - plays softly over as Charles and
     Emma do the rounds of their large brood of children,
     turning out lamps and kissing sleeping heads, taking a doll
     from one sleeping child's embrace, a sword from another.
     Shooing a cat and her kittens from the bedroom.

                         EMMA
               Good-night Lenny.

                          DARWIN

               Good-night Frankie

                         EMMA
               Good-night Betty.

     Darwin watches his wife, a sensuous figure, stooped over
     the sleeping child, a lock of hair falling forwards as she
     kisses her.

                         DARWIN
               Good-night George

                         EMMA
               Good-night Etty.

                         DARWIN
               Good-night Willy
                                                              40


                         DARWIN AND EMMA
               Good-night Annie

     She's sound asleep. Finally Charles and Emma are alone
     together in the blissfully silent house.

     Emma smiles

                         EMMA
               Dear Charles

                         DARWIN
               Dearest Emma

     He takes her hand and leads her to their bedroom.


58   EXT. THE BEACH. THE PAST. DAY                                 58

     Emma lies on a rug, her head is in Darwin's lap. She is
     reading aloud from a new book of poems by Wordsworth.

                         EMMA
               "Loving she is, and tractable
               though wild.
               And innocence hath privilege in
               her.
               To dignify arch looks and
               laughing eyes;
               And feats of cunning; and the
               pretty round
               Of trespasses, affected to
               provoke Mock chastisement, and
               partnership in play"

     She puts the book down

                         DARWIN
                   (smiling)
               Then we were wrong. She is not
               unique after all.

     Darwin is watching Annie dancing in front of the surf ,
     turning cartwheels - a wild dancing sprite of the sea,
     oblivious to the cold, shouting and singing:



59   THE BEACH. LATER                                              59

     Later, Near the cliff, Darwin is "geologising"

     He's excited, breathless and windswept, shouting over the
     sound of the nearby surf as he clambers over the huge
     assorted boulders pointing out the geological strata to his
     kids who are more interested in clambering.
                                                      41


                    DARWIN
          This is Devonian, about 400
          million years ago. Rocks like
          this might have fishes in them,
          trilobites, tree ferns, corals
          maybe....

He knock off a corner of rock with his geological hammer,
then moves on

                    ETTY
          Is this a bit?

                    DARWIN
          No that is Cretaceous Etty. It
          was made a hundred millions years
          ago, when this cliff was a coral
          reef and Down village was a swamp
          full of great crocodiles.

Tap tap tap with his hammer as the boys scramble upwards,
playing at mountaineers.

                    DARWIN
          We might find oysters and sponges
          imprinted in it, or dinosaurs if
          we were lucky...

                    GEORGE
          What's a dinosaur?

                    ETTY
          Professor Owen invented them.

                    DARWIN
          They are the giant lizards which
          lived on earth before there were
          any humans.

                    BETTY
          But they weren't real

                    DARWIN
          Of course they are, Betty. Did I
          never tell you of the skeletons I
          found in South America
              (to Etty)
          Do you remember Mr Martell?

                    ETTY
          No.

Annie arrives, hopping nimbly over the rocks still in her
wet swimsuit
                                                           42


                         ANNIE
               Yes you do. When he came to tea
               and showed us drawings of his
               Iguanodon. And George burnt his
               fingers roasting chestnuts.

                          ETTY
               Oh yes.

                         ANNIE
               She doesn't remember.

                         DARWIN
               You should have your clothes on
               Annie. You are quite blue.

                         ANNIE
               Savages don't swear clothes.

     She runs to the top of a great fallen rock, spreads her
     arms out, and yells to the sky.

                         ANNIE
               I'm a Fuegan.

                         DARWIN
               Well don't fall and hurt
               yourself. Your mother would never
               forgive me.

     Annie gives a shout and disappears head over heels.

                          DARWIN
               Annie!

                         ANNIE
               I've found one!

     In the rubble at the base of the rocks she has landed,
     unhurt and quite by accident on a perfect specimen of a
     fossilized trilobite.


60   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY. THE PRESENT. DAY                        60

     The black box lies open with all its secrets strewn around
     the office.

     Stacks of paper - a stack for every chapter - are held down
     with paperweights - a fossil, a skull, a specimen bottle.

     Darwin squares a stack of blank paper between his hands,
     then reaches for his pen.


61   INT. VILLAGE SCHOOL. THE PAST . DAY.                         61

     Annie reaches for her pen.
                                                           43


     Reverend Innes is giving the children their writing
     lessons, according to "Mulhauser's technique"

                         INNES
               First positions.

     The children assume the position as if in some militaristic
     drill.

                         INNES
               Second positions.

     Grips are adjusted, pens are dipped.

                         INNES
               Assume the distance.

     The children lean back fractionally, so their elbows are
     just back from the edge of the desk.

                         INNES
               .....and begin.

     The Children start to copy the sentence which Innes has
     written on the blackboard.

     Annie reads the sentence and hesitates: "And on the seventh
     day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested"


62   INT DARWIN'S STUDY. DAY.                                    62

     Darwin massages his cramped hand then takes a blank sheet
     of notepaper.

                         DARWIN
               Dearest Hooker. I am one week
               into the great project and I feel
               at last that it is real. Its
               title is "On the Origin of
               Species." As I write theses words
               why does it feel as though I am
               confessing to a murder...

     A paper stirs in the breeze and he pins it with the nearest
     object to hand - Annie's trilobite.

     His eye rests on it a moment

     CUT TO


63   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY. THE PAST . DAY                         63

     The corrugated gray surface, greatly magnified.

     The Darwin of ten years ago is examining the trilobite with
     a watchmakers eyeglass.
                                                             44


     There is a small mirror above his desk, angled so as to
     give him a view of the path leading round from the front of
     the house.

     Innes appears briefly in it, preceded by Annie, who is
     trotting to keep pace with him and crying.

     Darwin, intent on his work, notices neither of them

     From downstairs he hears the door knocker then Brodie's
     voice, then Emma's overlapping with half-heard fragments of
     Innes's Scottish brogue.

                           INNES (O.S.)
                 I thought you needed to know why
                 I had to chastised her.

     Darwin remains immersed, examining each detail of the
     trilobite, comparing it with other specimens in books and
     in boxes.

                           INNES (O.S.)
                 ....It is not fair to the other
                 nor to Annie herself that her
                 head be filled with these ideas....

                           EMMA
                 Are you listening, Annie?

     Annie sobs louder, incoherent in her grief.

     Darwin finally focusses on the sounds, recognizes her
     distress and gets up to investigate.


64   EXT .UPPER HALLWAY. DAY.                                     64

     He reaches the top of the stairs. Annie is directly below
     him, slumped, still sobbing at the foot of the stairs.

     Emma has ushered Innes to the porch out of sight.


                           INNES (O.S)
                  I shall bid you good day then

     The front   door closes. Darwin comes downstairs

                           DARWIN
                 What happened?

                            ANNIE
                 Nothing.

                           DARWIN
                 Its not nothing. (To Annie) Why
                 are your knees bleeding?
                                                      45


                    EMMA
          Mr Innes had to have words with
          her. It is sorted now.

                    DARWIN
          Words are very well. I am asking
          what happened to her knees.

                    ANNIE
          Mr Innes sent me to the corner
          and made me kneel on rock-salt.

                    DARWIN
          What!

                    ANNIE
              (in a rush)
          I said there were dinosaurs and
          he said there wasn't dinosaurs
          but there were because you saw
          them.

                    EMMA
              (interrupting)
          Annie. Let me talk to your
          father. He told her to kneel til
          she repented...

                    DARWIN
          Repented what?

                    EMMA
          The bleeding is due to her own
          stubborn-ness. It is finished
          now.

                    DARWIN
          It is by no means finished. Where
          is my coat. Its intolerable

                    EMMA
          Charles. Please.

Charles ignores her, Forcing his arm into the sleeve of his
coat.

                    EMMA
          Mr Innes is a dear friend and
          neighbor. I beg you at least
          appraise yourself the facts. She
          contradicted him repeatedly. The
          fault was Annie's Mr Innes was
          quite within his rights.
                                                      46


                    DARWIN
              (his arm is stuck)
          In his rights to torture our
          children for expressing the plain
          truth.

Brodie appears and Darwin ushers Annie towards her

            DARWIN                           EMMA
...Please take her to           It is not the truth as he
kitchen.                        sees it

                    DARWIN
          Well damn how he sees it. Damn
          the pair of them and all their
          works

                    EMMA
          Charles listen to yourself.
          Listen

Blocking his path as he heads for the door. Her palm flat
on his lapel, soothing, reasoning with him

                    DARWIN
          Emma please. I will not have
          Innes tell me what I can and
          cannot tell my children.

                    EMMA
          It is what I have told them every
          night at bedtime. It is the
          instruction my aunt and your
          brother and most of our family
          live by. It is what all of the
          village believe ...or try to.
          Charles. Must our children be
          revolutionaries at nine years of
          age. Write to him with your
          concerns - our concerns - about
          the manner of the punishment but
          please do not set yourself
          against him. Think of my feelings
          on this. I beg you.

Finally his outrage has spent itself, neutralized by her
gentle persistence and the deep affection he holds for her.

                    DARWIN
          You're right of course.... I'm
          sorry.

He embraces her.

Emma is reassured, she cannot see the conflict written all
over Darwins face.
                                                              47


65   INT. STUDY. DAY. (THE PRESENT)                                65

     The conflicted expression has hardened, the furrows in
     Darwin's brow etched deeper, as he dips his pen and begins
     the second chapter.

     From the floor below we can hear Emma practising a piece of
     music on the piano - Chopin's revolutionary etude: a
     rippling, brooding arpeggio running up and down the
     keyboard, redolent of an angry sea.

     Darwin's pen scratches doggedly over the paper.


66   INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT.                                          66

     In the bedroom, in his nightgown, Darwin scrubs the ink
     stains off his fingers with a pumice stone.

     Emma passes behind him, preparing for bed. He glances at
     her in the mirror

                         DARWIN
               You're still angry with me.

                            EMMA
               No. Why?

                         DARWIN
               I can always tell by your
               playing.

                         EMMA
               Not angry. I'm sad.


67   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY. THE PRESENT. DAY                         67

     Darwin sits at his desk, writing and editing, his hand
     clamped on the pen.

     A voice speaks from nowhere

                         ANNIE
               Talk to her.

                         DARWIN
                   (still writing)
               And say what? She does not want
               to hear it.

                         ANNIE
               Then write to her.

                         DARWIN
                   (irritably)
               That is what I am doing Annie, I
               am writing all of it.
                                                            48


68   EXT. DARWIN'S STUDY. DAY                                    68

     Emma, passing the open door glimpses Darwin talking angrily
     to himself as he writes.

                         DARWIN
               ....and then she can read it, and
               we can all be free of this! Now,
               please, Annie no more
               interruptions!


69   EXT. GARDEN. DAWN                                           69

     The music continues, louder.

     A frosty coating of dew covers the lawn.

     Footprints lead to a strange wooden tower in the garden.
     Parslow stands outside, shivering in the grey morning
     light.

     Darwin shouts from inside.

                         DARWIN
               Pull!

     Parslow pulls a lever.

     There's the sound of crashing water, a yell of pain from
     inside the tower.

     Ravens rise, calling, from the surrounding trees.


70   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY. THE PRESENT. DAY                       70

     Darwin dips his pen, scores out some text from his previous
     draft and writes again.

     The music continues from downstairs, louder and more
     insistent than before.


71   LOUNGE ROOM. THE PRESENT. DAY                               71

     Emmas hands race back and forwards along the piano
     keyboard.


72   INT DARWIN'S STUDY. THE PRESENT                             72

     Darwin's pen scratches across the pages, making a noise
     like fingernails on a blackboard.

     The music from downstairs seeming to drive into his skull
                                                           49


     He speaks aloud the words he is writing, in an effort to
     drown out the piano music.

                              DARWIN (THOUGHT VOICE)
                  ... In time small variations become
                  extreme...

     Strange detailed drawings of barnacles are strewn across
     his desk, seeming to change and transmute before his eyes.

                            DARWIN (V.O.)
                  ...Organs change their very
                  function, the oviduct becomes a
                  cement gland.

     He stops. His hand is shaking too much to write.

                            ANNIE
                  What's an oviduct?

                            DARWIN
                  Nothing that need concern you.

                            ANNIE
                      (sulkily)
                  I know what it is anyway.

     Darwin gets up abruptly from his desk.


73   INT. WATER TOWER. DAY                                        73

                             DARWIN
                  Pull!

     Darwin stands naked, clutching to two hand rails for
     support as a great tub of freezing water tilts and pours
     its contents on top of him.

     Darwin yells


74   EXT DOVECOTE                                                 74

     Birds rush out from the dovecote


75   INT. STUDY                                                   75

     Darwin dips his pen and writes

                            DARWIN
                  ....What was once a free-
                  swimming creature now finds
                  itself glued by its head to a
                  rock, flailing for food with its
                  legs...,
                                                             50


     The Revolutionary etude is continuous now - real or
     imagined.


76   UNDER THE SEA                                                76

     Surf crashes.

     Underwater, among the swirling seaweed, fragile sea
     creatures being torn this way and that by the raging surf


77   INT. MALVERN SPA TREATMENT ROOM. DAY                         77

     Annie screams and kicks her legs, overwhelmed by water in
     some dark place.

     Pull back to reveal:


78   INT. HELL.                                                   78

     A vision of hell:

     The water is fire.

     The barnacles are people.

     The people are Annie, Emma and Darwin.



79   INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT                                          79

     Darwin wakes in a panic and sits up in bed. He raises his
     right arm and looks down at his inky writing hand
     fluttering in the moonlight, like an organ with a will all
     of its own

     Emma is a sleep. There's a crucifix on the wall above her
     bed. On the bedside table there's a bible.

                            EMMA
                  " ...About the midst of this
                  valley I perceived the mouth of
                  hell to be; and it stood also
                  hard by the wayside. Now, thought
                  Christian, what shall I do?


80   INT. NURSERY. THE PRESENT. NIGHT                             80

     The children are gathered around Emma who is reading a bed-
     time story to them by lamplight.

     Emma is in the centre of a circle of little attentive
     faces.
                                                            51


     She's aware of Darwin, standing in the darkened corridor
     beyond the door, drawn to the cosy little group but unable
     to join it.

     She lets him be. Continues reading

                         EMMA
               And ever and anon the flame and
               smoke would come out in such
               abundance with sparks and hideous
               noises, that he was forced to put
               up his sword, and betake himself
               to another weapon, called "All
               Prayer"..."


81   INT. ETTY'S ROOM NIGHT.                                      81

     The older girls Etty and Betty finish their prayers and
     jump into bed in their night-gowns

     Emma comes in to take away their lamp.

                          ETTY
               Is Daddy not coming to kiss us
               good-night

                         EMMA
               He is still a little bit ill from
               working ...maybe tomorrow.

                         BETTY
               That's what you said last night.

     Emma turns out the light. In the darkness Etty says.

                         ETTY
               I think when Annie died he
               stopped loving us.

     Emma returns to her bedside

                         EMMA
               Oh come now, Etty. You know
               that's not true. He is just a
               little bit ill - and a little bit
               busy.



82   INT. BOILER ROOM. DAY                                        82

     In the bowels of Down House the house, we find Darwin
     wrapped in wet towels sweating in front of the wood-burning
     stove.

     As he gazes into the leaping flames, Annie appears at his
     shoulder.
                                                             52


                           ANNIE
                 Is there really such a place as
                 hell.

                           DARWIN
                 No of course not. How can there
                 be?
                 If he is supposed to be loving
                 and forgiving - what on earth is
                 the sense punishing all these
                 millions of souls.

                           ANNIE
                 But just suppose if there was.
                 And all this was punishment.

                             DARWIN
                 All what?

     No reply.

                           DARWIN
                 I don't know what you mean. All
                 what?


83   INT THE WATER TOWER. DAY                                     83

     Darwin stands, legs apart in the water tower bracing
     himself like a colossus against the full force of the
     deluge.

                             DARWIN
                 Pull!


84   EXT THE WATER TOWER. DAY                                     84

     The gardener, splitting logs, watches Darwin stagger from
     the tower with a rug wrapped around him, and make his way
     back to the house.


85   INT. DARWIN'S BEDROOM. DAY.                                  85

     Darwin lowers himself into bed, inky and tousled. He seems
     prematurely aged, crippled by the gruelling process of
     writing the book.

     As he lies there, unable to sleep lines of written text
     seems to appear behind his closed eyes, or in the tangled
     vines of the wallpaper.

     Emma speaks from the other side of the bed.

                           EMMA
                 Talk to Mr Innes. Please. You are
                 clearly not well
                                                              53


                         DARWIN
               He is what? A physician now

                         EMMA
               You know what I mean. I think he
               can help you.

     Charles remains stubbornly silent, his hand fluttering over
     the coverlet.


                          EMMA
               I am taking the children to Maer
               for a while, to visit their
               cousins.
                   (Beat)
                I worry for you, Charles. Please
               talk to him


86   INT DARWIN'S STUDY. DAY                                       86

     Fire flares in the grate as Darwin compares the skeletons
     of various pigeons.

     He starts a new Chapter: "changes under domestication"


87   INT. THE DOVECOTE. THE PRESENT. DAY                           87

     Pigeons mate and coo in the dusty twilight.


88   EXT. THE DOVECOTE. THE PRESENT. DAY                           88

     Parslow picks up two of them, casually wrings their necks
     and heads off with them to the skeletonizing shed.


89   INT. DARWINS STUDY. THE PRESENT. DAY                          89

     Darwin Looks out of the study window, searching for
     inspiration.

     He sees Emma and the children getting into a coach with
     their baggage.


90   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY. THE PRESENT. NIGHT.                      90

     Darwin sits at his desk.

     He has written the chapter heading and nothing else.

     Parslow knocks and looks in

                         PARSLOW
               Will you be eating sir.
                                                           54


                         DARWIN
               No thank you.

     Parslow leaves. Darwin addresses the empty room.

                         DARWIN
               Annie? .....Annie.

     She will not come.


91   EXT. THE BEACH.    THE PAST. DAY                             91

     Annie dancing in the surf. One minute she is there and the
     next she has vanished, lost among the churning waves.

     Darwin leaps top his feet shouting

                            DARWIN
               Annie!

     Raucous male laughter takes us to


92   INT. PUBLIC HOUSE. THE PAST. EVENING.                        92

     The George and Dragon on a Saturday night. The air loud
     with laughter and thick with pipe smoke.

     Clodhoppers crowd the snug, many of them roaring drunk,
     with their florid complexions, stained and broken teeth.

     Darwin trying, to slip in discreetly is spied by a group of
     locals who hail him and gather around him, wedging him into
     a corner with their overloud loud talk and laughter.

                         THATCHER
               Mr Darwin! Mr Darwin! I was
               explaining to Mr Goodman here
               your interest in breeding. Mr
               Darwin is our foremost scholar in
               the village.

                         DARWIN
               No. No I am but one of many.
               There is Squire Lubbock, and the
               reverend Innes

     The Thatcher waves them away as lesser talents.

                         THATCHER
               ....he is also a noted explorer,
               the author of many books..

                         DARWIN
               ...which no-one has read.
                                                              55


                         THATCHER
               ...a fellow of the Royal society
               and a prodigious expert on
               clams...oysters?

                            DARWIN
               Barnacles.

                         THATCHER
               Mr Goodman, now, is the foremost
               pigeon fancier in all the
               southern counties. Kent champion
               two years running. I swear he can
               give you any beak or plumage in
               four generations. Head and tail
               in five.

                         DARWIN
               How do you do it?

                         GOOODMAN
               By breeding cousin with cousin. I
               find it the fastest way to alter
               the strain - provided you do not
               weaken it in other ways.

     Darwin takes a slug of whiskey


93   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY.   THE PRESENT. NIGHT                     93

     He is drinking in his office.

     The clock strikes twelve. The page in front of him remains
     stubbornly blank

     Darwin is rising from his desk when he sees something move.

     In one of the bottles on his desk, a fleshy marine specimen
     seems to have come to life.

     It writhes blindly in its bottle of formalin, making a
     sound like a baby crying.

     Darwin, recoiling in horror, pushes himself back from his
     desk. The castors on his chair trundle back from his desk.

     Behind him he hears a tapping and turns to see that all the
     birds in his big glass display case of Galapagos finches
     have started to beat against the inside the crowded glass
     case. They flutter, frenzied, tapping with their beaks on
     the inside of the glass, which shatters as...

     One by one the bottled specimens explode, discharging their
     contents onto the floor.

     A lamp falls over. The room is filled with birds the floor
     awash with formalin and broken glass.
                                                           56


     The Study seems to tilt like the cabin of a ship in a storm
     and.


94   INT. DARWIN'S BEDROOM. THE PRESENT. DAWN                     94

     Darwin wakes from the nightmare asleep at his desk, the
     whiskey bottle a quarter empty, ink on his hands and his
     shirt cuffs

     He gets up and puts on his shoes.


95   INT. DOWN HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. THE PRESENT. DAWN .           95

     The scullery maid, lighting the fire, looks round and sees
     Darwin.

     He walks past her without a word and heads out into the
     garden.


96   EXT. DOWN HOUSE GARDEN. THE PRESENT. DAWN                    96

     Darwin heads across the lawn, takes a key from his belt and
     opens the door of the skeletonizing shed.


97   INT. SKELETONIZING SHED. THE PRESENT. DAWN                   97

     In the grey light he takes in the corpses of doves from the
     dovecote.

     Some have been skinned, their pelts curing on frames, their
     carcasses steeping in a buckets chemicals which remove the
     flesh from the bones.

     Previously he regarded this place as a sort of laboratory.
     Now it seems a place of horror.

     The door opens behind him. Its Parslow.

                         DARWIN
               Get rid of them.

                         PARSLOW
               Which ones sir?

                         DARWIN
               All of them. All of it.


98   INT. DOVECOTE. THE PRESENT. DAWN                             98

     Darwin reaches into the dovecote and starts grabbing
     pigeons at random, dragging them out and flinging them into
     the air.
                                                               57


                            DARWIN
                Go. Go!


99    EXT. DOWN HOUSE. THE PRESENT. DAWN.                           99

      Displaced doves beat the air.

      Darwin climbs down the ladder, grabs and axe and attacks
      the wooden stanchions supporting the dovecote

      Parslow comes running over from the skeletonizing shed,
      calling:

                          PARSLOW
                Sir. Mr Darwin.

      Darwin stands back, hair wild, eyes crazed, his sleeves
      covered in bird shit.

                          PARSLOW
                Please rest sir. I'll have John
                Lewis remove it. Have some
                breakfast now and rest. Shall I
                call the doctor?

                            DARWIN
                God know.

                          PARSLOW
                Or the water tower.

                          DARWIN
                A pox on all of them!


100   INT. ANNIE'S ROOM. THE PAST. DAY                              100

      The local doctor Henry Holland takes out various
      concoctions from his medical bag and arranges them on the
      dresser.

      We are in the past. Annie is in bed with a fever.

      Emma is pregnant.

                          DOCTOR
                Calomel then, twice daily.

                          DARWIN
                I will not give it to her.

                    EMMA                             DOCTOR
      Charles....                        Mrs Darwin, it is nothing but
                                         chloride of mercury. I have
                                         prescribed it often in
                                         children as young as two.
                                                      58


                    DARWIN
          Not to any of mine I hope. On the
          Beagle I dropped some on a
          microscope slide and all my
          animacules died of it.

                    DOCTOR
          Well animacules are not persons.
          Presumably they would die if you
          dose them with Madeira wine.

                    DARWIN
          On Madeira they thrived most
          excellently, as did Captain
          Fitzroy, while it lasted.

Annie enjoys the joke and gives Darwin a weak smile. The
doctor regards her balefully

                    DOCTOR
          Or if she would submit to be
          bled.

                       ANNIE
          Please no.

                    DARWIN
          I will write to Dr Gully again.

                    DOCTOR
              (sceptical)
          The hydro-therapist?

                    DARWIN
          I have always found his
          treatments most effective.

                    DOCTOR
          ...no matter that they defy all
          sense of logic.

He is packing up his bottles and his lancets

                    DARWIN
          Logic is not everything.

Emma shoots him a look. Til now scientific logic has been
his guiding principle.

                    DOCTOR
          Then I shall bid you good day.

                    DARWIN
          Parslow will bring your carriage.
          I will be down presently

The doctor leaves the room. Emma is in a terrible quandary
                                                            59


                          DARWIN
                I should take her to Malvern.

                          EMMA
                I think it is better she is here.

                          DARWIN
                Gully can care for her properly
                there. She can be treated daily,
                as I was.

                          EMMA
                Charles no. She is better with
                us. With her family. Please do
                not take her away from me.


101   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY. THE PRESENT. DAY                       101

      Parslow enters to find his master staring vacantly into
      space.

      The page in front of him is still blank.

      The study is in chaos. It seems as though the contents of
      the black box have multiplied and spread out to colonize
      every corner of the room.

                          PARSLOW
                Post for you sir.

      He leaves it by Darwins elbow and backs out.

      After a while Darwin seems to rouse himself.

      He picks up the largest envelope, postmarked Malaysia, and
      slits it with a letter knife.

      The sender is a Mr Wallace. There's a covering letter and a
      twenty page attachment Darwin reads, and lets out a sudden
      loud bellow of laughter.

                           DARWIN
                Ha!!


102   EXT. DOWN HOUSE. THE PRESENT. DAY.                          102

      Darwin sits in sunshine at the rear of the house, rugged up
      against the cold. Looking frail still, but oddly at peace.

                          INNES
                Ah, there you are Mr Darwin.

      Darwin looks up blinking in the sunlight to see the stocky,
      dark-suited figure of Mr Innes.
                                                      60


                    INNES
          May I join you.

                    DARWIN
          By odd means

He makes some space on the bench. Innes hesitates, unable
to read Darwin's feelings towards him. The smile is
welcoming enough but there is something not altogether
balanced about it

                    INNES
          Mrs Darwin informed me you would
          be alone and ....perhaps a need
          to counsel.

He sees an envelope on the ground and stoops to retrieve
it.

                    INNES
          You dropped this. What a
          beautiful postage stamp.

                    DARWIN
          Yes. It is from the Spice
          islands.

                    INNES
          I do rather envy your wide circle
          of correspondents. In my youth I
          always wanted to travel.

                    DARWIN
          You are still young. You could be
          a missionary and follow in Mr
          Livingstone's footsteps.

                    INNES
          Yes, although I have always felt
          there is quite enough evil at
          home without looking for it
          abroad.
              (Then, casually)
          Mrs Darwin told me of the book
          you are writing.

                    DARWIN
          Not any more, thank goodness

                    INNES
          You have finished it?

                    DARWIN
          It has been finished for me. My
          correspondent In the spice
          islands has arrived independently
          at exactly the same idea,
          expressed in a mere twenty pages.
                    (MORE)
                                                      61

                    DARWIN (cont'd)
          There's brevity for you. I had so
          far covered two hundred an fifty
          and come to a dead end. So
          finally I am rid of the project.

Innes is relieved to hear it

                    INNES
          The Lord moves in mysterious
          ways.

                    DARWIN
          He does indeed Mr Innes. I was
          reflecting only the other day on
          the fact that he has endowed us
          in his blessed generosity with
          not one but nine hundred species
          of intestinal worm each with its
          own unique method of infiltrating
          the blood supply and burrowing
          through the mucosa.

Innes shifts uncomfortably.

                    DARWIN
           And then again on the great love
          he shows for butterflies by
          inventing a wasp to lay eggs
          inside the living flesh of
          caterpillars

                    INNES
          Well. It is not for us to guess
          at His reasons.

                    DARWIN
          No. We can leave that for Mr
          Wallace now. Should I advise him
          to stay overseas do you think? If
          he shows his face in Kent he may
          be required to kneel on rock
          salt.

Innes rises. He's a short man, acutely aware of any threats
to his dignity, and he's had enough of this mockery

                    INNES
          I once valued our friendship Mr
          Darwin. I had hoped it might be
          possible to restore it. Clearly
          in your present mood that is not
          going to be possible. My regards
          to Mrs Darwin

He starts off round the corner of the house.
                                                            62


      Darwin listens to his footsteps receding, then turns his
      face back to the sun. When he opens his eyes sees a figure
      standing in the lawn.

      It is Annie, plain as day, scowling at him angrily.

                           DARWIN
                What? I am forestalled by Mr
                Wallace. That is the simple fact
                of it. What reason do you have to
                be angry?!

      She shoots him a look of hatred then turns away from him
      and runs off towards the meadow.

      Darwin, instantly remorseful, gets to his feet and hurries
      after her.

                          DARWIN
                Annie!

      He reaches the centre of the lawn and stopped by a sudden
      intense pain in the gut which strikes him like a blow and
      fells him to his knees.

      He lies their gasping, his vision clouding as the pages of
      the Wallace letter slip from his grasp and are scattered to
      the wind.

      A view from high above: spiralling downwards on the Darwin
      garden, as household servants emerge from various quarters
      and hurry to his assistance.



103   INT. DARWIN'S BEDROOM. THE PRESENT. DAY.                    103

      There are some faint stains on the plasterwork of the
      bedroom ceiling. Like lichen on a rock. Like an archipelago
      of islands.

      Darwin lies, pale and weak, looking upwards from a sea of
      white blankets.

      The door opens and he turns his head. Its Emma.

                          EMMA
                You have a visitor.

                          DARWIN
                No. No. I will not be bled or
                lectured to.

      She gives him a pinched look, then Hooker pushes in behind
      her.
                                                        63


                    HOOKER
          It is me. Thank God you are still
          with us. Word came from London
          you had suffered an apoplectic
          stroke.

                    DARWIN
          No. Simply the great relief of
          liberation. Did you read the
          Wallace abstract.

Hooker bats the idea away

                    HOOKER
          It is a letter. You have a book

                    DARWIN
          ...barely half of it

                    HOOKER
          You have a book. What is not
          already on the page is most
          certainly inside your head and I
          intend to extract it, if it kills
          us both.

                    DARWIN
          You have been talking to Huxley.

                     HOOKER
          No. Had I done so he would have
          hastened here himself armed with
          every instrument of torture known
          to her majesty's navy.
              (Then)
          Charles I have read the first
          Chapters. It is brilliant. You
          must continue.

                    DARWIN
          I cannot. Seriously Joseph, I am
          completely blocked. All my old
          symptoms have returned with a
          vengeance. The sweats the shakes
          the abdominal pains. The whole
          endeavour was cursed from the
          outset.

Hooker takes darwins hand, presses it to stop it from
trembling

                    HOOKER
          Charles. It was you who opened my
          eyes to the wonders of science.
          So let me open yours. You have an
          illness. You have had it as long
          as I have known you.
                    (MORE)
                                                               64

                          HOOKER (cont'd)
                It is clearly made worse in times
                of overwork but the nature of the
                work is irrelevant. This is not
                visited on you by God or the
                devil. This is a set of physical
                symptoms. Go to Malvern and get
                treated.

                          DARWIN
                Not Malvern

                          HOOKER
                Why not. What is there to be
                scared of there. He has worked
                for you in the past it will work
                again. Then come back and finish
                the book. Your enemies are
                already toasting their good
                fortune but they shall not
                prevail.

                          DARWIN
                What are you talking about. I
                have no enemies.

                           HOOKER
                They are legion, believe me, and
                they are implacable. We are all
                of us fighting a battle against
                fear and superstition but we can
                win this battle. We must win it.
                You can win it for all of us. Go
                to malvern, then come back and
                finish it.


104   INT. DOWN HOUSE. THE PAST. DAY.                               104

      Upstairs, Servants are packing for a journey.

      The vigorous Darwin of the past moves swiftly from room to
      room, gathering his things. Hat and gloves, books,
      spectacles, papers.

      Emma, eight months pregnant, tries to keep up with him

                          EMMA
                Charles, please reconsider

                          CHARLES
                Emma it is weeks now, months. She
                is getting worse, not better.

                          EMMA
                Then I am coming with you.
                                                         65


                    DARWIN
          You cannot come. How can you
          possibly come in your condition.

                    EMMA
          It is not so far.

                    DARWIN
          It is two days by coach and
          train. Who will look after the
          others.

                    EMMA
          I do not care for the others. I
          care for Annie!

Etty, coming apon then unexpectedly, hears this and is
instantly heartbroken.

EMMA is devastated by the slip but is presently too
overwrought to retract it.

                    DARWIN
          Leave us please, Etty.

Parslow has gathered up Annie from her room and is carrying
her downstairs, pale and sickly-looking, with Brodie
fussing behind.

                    BRODIE
          Make sure she is tucked in. Watch
          her shawl

                    ANNIE
          I don't need to go.

At the bottom of the stairs, Darwin takes Annie from
Parslow's arms

                    DARWIN
          The coach is outside. I will
          carry her from here.

                     EMMA
          Annie...

                     ANNIE
          Mama...

She clasps Emma's hand. Darwin keeps heading for the door.
Emma holds fast to Annies hand and follows behind

                    DARWIN
          You will see Mamma when you are
          better. Say goodbye now.
                                                                66


      Parslow holds the door open. The coach is at the Gate. Emma
      stops on the threshold, unable to let go her daughters hand
      and suddenly deeply convinced that she is making a mistake
      here.


                          EMMA
                Wait. I am coming with you

                          DARWIN
                Please, Emma

                          EMMA
                Wait there.

      She hurries back inside. Darwin makes a decision and heads
      for the coach.


105   EXT. DOWN HOUSE. DAY                                           105

      Down the patch and through the open gate with the servants
      following.

                          DARWIN
                Get aboard. Brodie

                          ANNIE
                    (shouts back)
                Mama!

      The garden gate clangs shut behind them.


106   INT. DOWN HOUSE STAIRWELL/ UPPER HALLWAY. THE PAST. DAY        106

      Emma looks out of the upstairs window, realizes they plan
      to leave without her and hurries downstairs again.


107   INT. COACH. THE PAST. DAY                                      107

      Charles bundles Annie inside.

                          DARWIN
                    (to the coachman)
                Go. Go.

                          EMMA
                    (calls)
                Wait!

                             DARWIN
                Go now!

                             ANNIE
                Mama!!
                                                               67


      The coach sets off. Emma runs to the gate calling
      desperately.

                          EMMA
                Charles. Please God. No. Annie!


108   INT. COACH. THE PRESENT                                       108

      Charles, feeble and debilitated, levers himself into the
      coach with Parslow assisting and slumps back in the leather
      upholstery.

      Servants gather at the gate. Some of them tearful, not
      expecting him to return


109   EXT. STEAM TRAIN. THE PRESENT. DAY.                           109

      A steam train comes charging past trailing plumes of black
      smoke, striking sparks from the track with its wheels.


110   INT. CARRIAGE. THE PRESENT. DAY.                              110

      The sickly Darwin of the present sits hunched and nauseous,
      with Parslow sitting beside him with his suitcase on his
      lap.

      Every jolt of the train sends a spasm of pain through
      Darwin's guts.

      The people sitting opposite - a woman, a child, and a man -
      regard Darwin in silence. Whatever he suffers from its not
      good and they are worried about getting infected with it

      They plunge into a tunnel. The carriage fills with smoke.
      Parslow gets up and tries to close the window but it won't
      budge. A burning ember flies inside and lands on Darwin's
      leg.

      Darwin is too weak to lift a finger. Parslow slaps the
      ember and extinguishes it.


111   EXT. STATION. MALVERN.                                        111

      The train wheezes to a halt. The doors open and the train
      disgorges its cargo of sick people, come to Malvern for
      treatment - a coughing child, a woman with one side of her
      face aflame with shingles - the halt the lame and the
      afflicted.
                                                               68


112   EXT. HORSE AND CART. DAY                                      112

      Darwin sits in the back as the attendant drives them
      through Malvern.

                          DARWIN
                Tell him not this way.

                          PARSLOW
                    (loudly)
                Hello there. Stop. Can we go by
                the other route

                          ATTENDANT
                The Worcester Road is shorter.

                          DARWIN
                ...by the low road.

                          PARSLOW
                He wishes to go by the other
                route.

                          ATTENDANT
                    (with a sigh)
                As you will sir.

      He backs up the horses and turns the cart around


113   INT. GULLY'S CLINIC. DAY                                      113

      Dr Gully is the chief physician at Malvern spa. His marble-
      tiled consulting rooms resound with the sound of rumbling
      pipes and dripping water.

      Darwin reclines on a leather couch, watching the watery
      play of light on the ceiling.

      A door opens and Dr Gully comes in, accompanied by two
      assistants.

      Gully is a small dapper man wearing an apron over his shirt
      and tie. His trousers are tucked into calf-length
      Wellington boots.

      He greets Darwin cheerfully, effusively.

                          MR GULLY
                Mr Darwin, old friend. Mr Darwin.
                It has been too long I fear. Tut
                tut tut tut tut. What have we now
                what have we now?

      He clasps Darwin's hand, feeling his pulse at the wrist,
      then commands him to open his mouth
                                                       69


                      GULLY
          tongue...

Darwin shows him.

                    MR GULLY
          Ugh. Shirt up. Let me feel your
          liver.

Darwin untucks his shirt. Gully prods at Darwin's belly.
Darwin winces.

                    DR GULLY
          Pulse hectic, togue furred, liver
          tender and enlarged.

Darwin's ink stained fingers speak volumes.

                    DR GULLY
          No doubt you have been exercising
          your brain every hour that God
          gave you.

                    DARWIN
          I was persuaded to write book.

                    DR GULLY
          Madness there are far too many of
          those already. Are you Sleeping?

                      DARWIN
          Poorly.

                    DR GULLY
          I suppose never taking the 50C
          dilution of Chelidonium.

                    DARWIN
              (shakes his head)
          I had the gardener build a water
          tower. It no longer has any
          effect.

                    GULLY
          Of course not. Your gardener is
          not a hydrotherapist. What on
          earth possessed you ?

                    DARWIN
          I feared I was dying.

                    DR GULLY
          Oh come come come. We shall not
          have that talk here.

Half turning to his assistant, who is staking notes.
                                                              70


                          GULLY
                A smart spinal scrub. Cold douche
                daily at 7.00. Wrapping in towels
                and sweating by the lamp.

      Then, to Darwin:

                          DR GULLY
                No red meat, no reading, no
                mental agitation of any kind. We
                shall soon have you right old
                friend, we shall have you right.


114   INT. TREATMENT ROOMS. DAY                                    114

      Music over:

      Darwin sits in a deep metal bath while one of Gully's
      assistants scrubs his spine with a loofah.


115   INT. DOUCHE. DAY                                             115

      Darwin stands in a shaft of light, grabbing onto the hand
      rails as the icy flood continues to crash down on his
      shoulders, splintering and fracturing in the shaft of
      light.


116   INT. TREATMENT ROOMS. DAY                                    116

      Two assistants bind him tight in damp linen sheets, til he
      is immobilised like a cocoon, with his legs together and
      his hands by his side.

      They pick him up and lie him down, quite rigid beside
      another pod like creature, similarly swaddled, with a red
      face and a beard.

                          BEARDED STRANGER
                Mr Darwin is it?

      Darwin nods, unable to turn his head, or make any gesture
      with his hands.

      The stranger continues to talk to him nonetheless.

                          BEARDED STRANGE
                William Carter of Southampton. I
                read your Beagle account many
                years ago. Former naval man
                myself. What brings you here?
                Myself, a Bilious fever with
                blood per rectum, but I have
                every faith in Gully. The man is
                a miracle worker.
                                                            71


117   INT. TREATMENT ROOM. DAY                                    117

      Darwin sits with a blanket draped over his shoulders, under
      the merciless glare of a heat lamp.

      Sweat pours off him and forms puddles at his feet.


118   EXT. TERRACE. DAY.                                          118

      A bright sunny day. Darwin, looking weak but purged, sits
      on the terrace, sipping a glass of foul-tasting mineral
      water and looking out over the stone houses, fields and
      valleys of Malvern.

      Gully sits with him, interviewing him.

                          GULLY
                What action do you most associate
                with the symptoms. Eating? Strong
                emotion? Strenuous Excercise?

                          DARWIN
                Does the exercise of memory count
                as an action.

                          GULLY
                Memory of what.

                          DARWIN
                My eldest daughter. You remember
                her.

                          GULLY
                Of course. Of course. You must
                accept there was nothing more we
                could do.

                          DARWIN
                I know that. I know.

      A long, awkward silence, neither of them wants to
      recapitulate the events of Annies death.

                          GULLY
                You say you were writing about
                her.

                          DARWIN
                No. It is a scientific text. But
                I had reached a point, beyond
                which it was impossible to
                progress. She had been my
                companion throughout. Now it
                seemed she was ahead of me in a
                place I could not follow.
                                    72


          GULLY
Of course. Plainly she is in
heaven.

          DARWIN
That is what my wife believes. It
is a great consolation to her

          GULLY
But not to you.

          DARWIN
Emma and I have become ...divided
on it.

           GULLY
Does it affect your marital
relations.

          DARWIN
We have none ...to speak of.

          GULLY
    (a beat)
Are you familiar with the
writings of DeQuincy."There is no
such thing known to the mind as
forgetting."

          DARWIN
I don't know what it means.

          GULLY
He suggests we have thoughts
which do not actually enter the
realm of consciousness. Nervous
fibres exist after all throughout
the whole body. Is it not
possible that certain primal
feelings manifest in some
physical way. Eczema. Boils. A
fever. Might some blocked passion
imitate a gall-stone? Or even
manufacture one.

          DARWIN
Well, until someone devises a
machine to read nervous impulses,
or a telescope to look inside
the body I suppose we can only
guess at it.

          GULLY
We can Mr Darwin. We can look
inside you. If you find yourself
open to it, there is a way of
seeing.
                                                               73


119   EXT. STREETS OF MALVERN. NIGHT                                119

      Darwin wanders the cobbled streets of Malvern, pausing
      occasionally to consult a hand-written address.

      It is starting to rain as, finally, he arrives at the
      address he is looking for. A substantial terraced house.

      Darwin descends a stone staircase to the imposing front
      door, and rings the bell.

      As he waits for an answer a woman appears, unseen in the
      rain streaked window above, observing him.

      Darwin rings again. A moment later the woman answers the
      door.

                          DARWIN
                Mrs St John?

                          MRS ST JOHN
                Mr Darwin. Come in.


120   INT. MRS ST JOHN HOUSE. NIGHT                                 120

      The room is large and hot, crowded with pot plants, and
      bric- a-brac. Various fringed lamp-shades, a dancing Shiva,
      a framed picture of Lourdes, and some illustrations from
      the Tarot. None of this inspires Darwin with confidence.

                           ST JOHN
                Just leave your coat on the
                table. Sit down here. Show me
                your palm.

      The husky voice and the plunging decollete troubles Darwin,
      who hesitates.

                          DARWIN
                Sorry. I'm confused. What is it
                you do exactly.

                          MRS ST JOHN
                I envision what's inside your
                belly, dear. That's what you
                wanted, isn't it.

                          DARWIN
                Envision how? When Gully
                described you I fancied some
                scientific instrument....

                          MRS ST JOHN
                Depends what you class an
                instrument. In more resistant
                cases I might use a pendulum...
                                                            74


      He frowns. She smiles.

                          MRS ST JOHN
                Its ten shillings for a reading
                by the way. In advance.

                          DARWIN
                Well. I have a ten shilling note
                here in my wallet.

      He doesn't take it out.

                          DARWIN
                If you can tell me the numbers on
                it we can begin.

      Mr St John' face hardens.

                          MRS ST JOHN
                    (coldly)
                I'm a professional lady Mr
                Darwin. I don't do party tricks.

                          DARWIN
                I am a professional man. And I
                asking for no more than I ask of
                all my colleagues - a
                demonstration of competence.

                          MRS ST JOHN
                It is you who are here to be
                tested, Sir, not me.

                           DARWIN
                Then I am sorry to have wasted
                your time.

      He puts his jacket back on and heads for the door.


121   INT. HALLWAY. NIGHT.                                       121

      Mrs St John follows him. As he reaches for the doorhandle,
      and opens it, she says:

                          MRS ST JOHN
                She's with you, you know that.

      Darwin turns.

                           MRS ST JOHN
                Your little girl. I saw her from
                the window standing at the top of
                the steps.

                          DARWIN
                How dare you.
                                                               75


                             MRS ST JOHN
                Pardon?

                          DARWIN
                ...prey on people's grief like
                this.

                          MRS ST JOHN
                I have done no such thing.

                          DARWIN
                    (furious)
                Do you take me for an idiot?
                Clearly Gully has appraised you
                of my history.

                          MRS ST JOHN
                I beg to inform you he did no
                such thing!

                          DARWIN
                It is chicanery of the very
                lowest order and I despise it
                utterly!

                             MRS ST JOHN
                Get out.


122   EXT. THE HOUSE. DAY                                           122

      Darwin steps outside and she slams the door on him. Darwin
      continues to rant at the closed door, standing in the
      pouring rain without his umbrella.

      He gets to the top of the steps, and looks around, trying
      to get his bearings.

      In a pool of lamp-light at the far end of the street a
      figure stands watching him.

      Darwin squints at her through the rain, which is falling
      harder now.

      The figure is Annie.

      She looks at him crossly, then heads off up a cobbled side-
      street.

      Darwin follows.


123   EXT. MALVERN. SIDE STREETS. VARIOUS. NIGHT                    123

      Darwin pursues his daughter up narrow cobbled lanes.

                          DARWIN
                Annie. Annie!
                                                               76


      The rain is getting heavier, turning the gutters into
      rivers.

      Water overflows the drains and culverts and rushes over the
      cobbles, making them slick and treacherous.

      Darwin hurries down darkened lanes and alleys, the sound of
      rushing water echoing all around, the little girl always
      ahead of him.

      A DRUNK MAN in oilskins comes barreling past him, head
      down, cursing the weather.

      A child's ball goes floating downhill in the current.

      Darwin loses Annie, then he sees her again, at the top of a
      steep flight of stone steps.

      Darwin, drenched chases after her.


124   EXT. WORCESTER ROAD. NIGHT.                                   124

      At the top of the steps he stops for breath and he looks
      around.

      There is no sign of Annie but he knows this street - The
      Worcester Road - a row of Grey Georgian houses, their backs
      against the hill, their sloping front gardens looking out
      over the rooftops of Malvern.

      Most of the street is in darkness but the house directly
      opposite has lights in the window.

      He knows this house also.

      He hesitates, then crosses the street towards it.


125   EXT. GUEST HOUSE. NIGHT                                       125

      Soaked to the skin, he raps with the brass door-knocker,
      then waits for someone to answer.

      Muffled voices. Then a man answers from within.

                          LANDLORD (O.S.)
                Hello?

                          DARWIN
                Is Mrs Carey still the landlady
                here.

                          LANDLORD
                No.

      The door opens on a chain.
                                                            77


                          DARWIN
                My daughter Annie ...lodged here
                some years ago. Can I come in?

      The man closes the door to release the chain, then opens it
      again to admit Darwin.

                          DARWIN
                I know this is an intrusion. I
                wonder - could I visit the room
                she stayed in?

      The landlord doesn't know what to make of this

                          LANDLORD
                Wait here. I'll get the missus.

      He leaves Darwin dripping in the hallway which he goes and
      consults with his wife in the lighted parlour.

      Darwin looks around. This place is all too familiar to him -
      the bevelled gold-rimmed mirror, the carved mock-Tudor coat-
      stand.

      Muffled conversation off.

      There are crutches and walking sticks among the umbrellas.
      Lavender potpourri in a brass dish. A wheel-chair in one
      corner, a picture of the pieta above the door.

      Finally, the land-lady emerges from    her parlour.

                          LANDLADY
                Which room?

                          DARWIN
                Fourteen. I would only be there
                ten minutes. I am happy to pay.

      She goes into an alcove and emerges with a key.

                          LANDLADY
                Up one flight and along the
                corridor to the right.

                          DARWIN
                I remember.

                          LANDLADY
                Try not to touch anything.


126   INT. GUESTHOUSE. THE PRESENT. NIGHT.                       126

      Darwin, climbs the stairs to the Landing.
                                                            78


127   INT. GUESTHOUSE. THE PAST DAY                               127

      The younger Darwin flees up the stairs.


128   INT. GUESTHOUSE. THE PRESENT. NIGHT.                        128

      The older Darwin, reaches the top of the stairs and walks
      along the corridor to the right.


129   INT. GUESTHOUSE. THE PAST DAY                               129

      The younger Darwin, races along the corridor.


130   INT. GUESTHOUSE. THE PRESENT NIGHT.                         130

      The older Darwin, hesitates, chest pounding, outside the
      door of number 14, then unlocks it as...


131   INT. GUESTHOUSE. THE PAST. DAY                              131

      The younger Darwin bursts into room 14 and takes in the
      scene.

      The room is full if light. A maid is bundling soiled
      sheets. Brodie is there with a harrassed-looking Dr Gully.

      They turn as he enters.

      Annie lies on the bed between them, her breathing fast and
      shallow. She manages a weak smile.

                          DARWIN
                Is she any better? Does she want
                for anything?

      Gully stands up from the bed. His expression tells us hope
      is fading. Annie's pale sunken cheeks and caked lips
      confirm it.

      Darwin kneels by her bedside, clasps her little hand is his
      own.

                          DARWIN
                Darling Annie. I am here now.

      Annie lets out a reedy whine of appreciation and strokes
      his lapel "making him beautiful"

      Brodie cannot bear it and bursts into tears.


132   INT. ROOM 14. THE PAST NIGHT.                               132

      Annie sleeps.
                                                              79


      Darwin sits up, writing to Emma, crying as he writes.

                          DARWIN (V.O.)
                Dearest Emma. I think it best for
                you to know how every hour
                passes. It's a relief for me to
                tell you. Whilst writing to you I
                can cry tranquilly.


133   INT. ROOM 14. THE PAST DAY.                                  133

      A local surgeon lays out various instruments, including a
      glass syringe with a long needle.

      Annie struggles and whimpers. Brodie comforts her

                          DARWIN (V.O.)
                Mr Coates the Surgeon came today
                to draw off Annie's water. This
                did not hurt her, but she
                struggled with surprising
                strength against being uncovered.

                          BRODIE
                There there. It will all soon be
                over.


134   EXT. CHURCH AT MALVERN. ENTRANCE. DAY                        134

      Darwin enters through the heavy stone entrance.


135   INT. THE CHURCH AT MALVERN. DAY                              135

      The relatives of the sick, stand or sit among the pews,
      arriving, praying, departing

      Darwin kneels awkwardly in front of the altar, clasps his
      hands together and prays:

                          DARWIN
                Save her. I will believe
                whatever. Forever. Please save
                her

      He looks up at the image of Christ on the cross, hoping
      against all reason, for some sense of epiphany.

      It's not working. He feels nothing embarrassment at the
      cheapness of the gesture.


136   INT GUEST HOUSE. ROOM 14.   THE PAST .NIGHT                  136

      Darwin sits alone with Annie who is babbling incoherently.
      He can't make out anything she says
                                                            80


                          DARWIN (V.O.)
                Our dear child has taken a turn
                for the worse. She talked a great
                deal but we could seldom make out
                anything. Much of what she says
                we cannot make out from the
                roughness of her poor mouth.



137   INT. GUEST HOUSE. ROOM 14 NIGHT                             137

      Dr Gully leaves, the surgeon arrives. The maids squeeze
      between the two medical men, bundling sheets

                          DARWIN (V.O.)
                Today she vomited rather much
                again. Dr Coates has been to draw
                off more water.

      Brodie and the maid roll Annie on her side and cut off the
      tail of her shirt, then roll her on her back again, with a
      pillow between her two bony knees.

                          DARWIN
                Is that good, my lovely

                          ANNIE
                    (suddenly lucid)
                Beautifully good. I am making
                custards.

                          DARWIN (V.O.)
                Gully thinks her in imminent
                danger.


138   INT. DOWN HOUSE. DAY.                                       138

      Heavily pregnant Emma sits in the drawing room, crying and
      reading Darwin's latest letter.

                          DARWIN (V.O.)
                We sponged her with water and
                vinegar, made her sweet with
                chloride of lime....I fear we
                must prepare ourselves for the
                worst


139   INT. ANNIE'S ROOM. GUEST HOUSE. DAY.                        139

      It is midnight Darwin, exhausted, keeps a lonely Vigil by
      Annie's bedside. Each breath seems like it will be her
      last.

      Suddenly she speaks: faintly but audibly:
                                                               81


                          ANNIE
                The rabbit.

                           DARWIN
                What?

                          ANNIE
                The rabbit taught him the polka.

                          DARWIN
                I don't understand my love.

                          ANNIE
                Tell me about Jenny.

      Darwin bends low to hear her more clearly.

                          DARWIN
                What about her.

                          ANNIE
                When she died

                          DARWIN
                I don't want to talk about death
                my love.

                          ANNIE
                But tell me. I like it.

                          DARWIN
                Well. What the keeper told me
                was. When she was very sick with
                pneumonia, lying very still, he
                tried to feed her but she shook
                her head, looking at him as
                though to say: "Its nice of you
                but really you shouldn't bother".
                And as he bent down to take the
                spoon away she brought her arms
                around his neck and kissed him.
                And then she was dead.

      Annie smiles, puts her hands around her fathers neck and
      dies.


140   INT. TRAIN THE PAST DAY                                       140

      Darwin sits, his face wet with tears, reading, through
      blurred vision, a letter from Emma.

                          EMMA (V.O.)
                I was in the garden looking at
                our poor darling's little flower
                bed when John Griffiths drove up
                with your letter.
                                                             82


141   INT. DARWIN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT                                141

      Emma goes to bed, utterly drained.

                          EMMA (V.O.)
                When I went to bed I felt as if
                it had all happened long ago.
                When the blow comes it wipes out
                all that preceded it.


142   INT. DARWIN'S BEDROOM. DAY.                                 142

      She opens the curtains on a bright day. The other children
      are playing in the garden

                          EMMA (V.O.)
                My feeling of longing for our
                lost treasure makes me feel
                painfully indifferent to the
                other children, but I shall get
                right before long.


143   INT. TRAIN CARRIAGE. THE PRESENT. DAY                       143

      Darwin sits in the train, Heading home from malvern.

      He is looking across the carriage at his younger self, re-
      reading the letter and weeping uncontrollably.


144   EXT DOWN HOUSE. LOUNGE. THE PRESENT. NIGHT                  144

      Torrential rain crashes down on the house, the garden, the
      ancient trees and the outbuildings, flooding the path and
      the lane beyond the gate.

      Darwin pays the coachman and hurries inside


145   INT. DOWN HOUSE. LOUNGE ROOM.                               145

      Emma is playing a beautiful slow Nocturne.

      The rain outside drown out all other side.

      She doesn't notice the figure of Darwin until he appears,
      like a ghost, reflected in the polished wood of the piano.

      She turns with a start and sees him, still in his dripping
      coat, hair plastered over his brow

                          DARWIN
                Sorry. I startled you.
                                                      83


                    EMMA
          Take your coat off by the fire
          there. What time is it?

Darwin stays where he is, dripping on the carpet

                    DARWIN
          We need to talk. I need to talk
          to you.

                    EMMA
          Of course, but dry your hair. I
          shall call for a towel.

As she moves to the bell-pull he grabs her wrist

                     DARWIN
          I went back to Worcester Road. I
          saw Annie.

                    EMMA
          Charles. No.

                    DARWIN
          Let me tell you.

                     EMMA
          I don't want to hear it. This
          must stop.

                    DARWIN
          You don't understand.

                    EMMA
          I do! Do you think me deaf and
          blind. You have lived with her
          and spoken with her every day
          since she died.

Parslow comes in with firewood then sees Emma yelling at
darwin and hurriedly retreats, spilling logs in the
hallway.

                    EMMA
          She is more real to you than I
          am. She's dead Charles.

                    DARWIN
          I know that.

                    EMMA
          Then what is wrong with you that
          even our poor daughter cannot be
          left in her grave but you
          would....
                                                      84


                     DARWIN
          I know she is dead. I know it. It
          is you who will not accept the
          fact, preferring to think of her
          in heaven.

This again! The unspoken argument which has been brewing
for a decade, never before expressed so bluntly. Emma heads
for the door

                    EMMA
          Get away from me!

She heads into the hallway, he follows her ranting

                    DARWIN
          Snowy white wings and dancing
          with the angels. Is that your
          idea of honesty.

Servants scramble out of sight and out of earshot

                     EMMA
          Why did you come back. I will not
          hear this!

Emma picks up her skirts and hurries up the stairs. Darwin
pursues her.

On the landing, Betty and Horace, wide eyed and terrified
are bundled into the nursery by Brodie as Charles thunders
up the stair.

                    DARWIN
          You have to Emma, everything
          these was between us is gone.
          The boat is wrecked and sunk now.
          We have to hold to something
          else.

                    EMMA
          To what. Your ghosts? Your
          theories? What Charles.

                    CHARLES
          To the truth of what we know it.

She slams the bedroom door on him and bolts it.

                    DARWIN
          Open this door Emma. The truth,
          how wonderful and extraordinary
          our daughter was....

                    EMMA
              (through the door)
          I know that. I do not need you to
          say it. Of course I know.
                                                      85


Charles throws his shoulder to the door and bursts through
it. Emma screams

                    CHARLES
          But free of the fantasy, free of
          the rest, the silly vain hope
          that we will be reunited in
          heaven and the nagging unspoken
          belief that I killed her!

In the lower hallway all the servants hear this

In the nursery, Brodie, aghast, covers the childrens ears

In the bedroom, Emma has nowhere left to run

                    EMMA
          I have never said that

                    CHARLES
          Say it now. Say it. And all the
          rest that follows. That I should
          have kept Annie warm that day on
          the beach. I should not have
          taken her to Malvern. I should
          have let you come.

Tears spring to her eyes and to his. The fury has gone from
both of them, leaving sadness and pity

                    EMMA
          I should have insisted.

                    CHARLES
          No. It was me. I took her from
          you It was my fault.

                    EMMA
          I could have followed. I was her
          mother what was I thinking of.

                    CHARLES
          We thought she would live. You
          were not to know.

He moves to her, she startles, then lets him enfold her in
his damp coat

                    EMMA
          I did. I did know. I knew when
          you left that I would never see
          her again. I hated you for taking
          her.

                    CHARLES
          I hated myself. I knew that none
          of them could save her.
                    (MORE)
                                                              86

                          CHARLES (cont'd)
                All I could do was watch
                hopelessly and weep for her -
                then flee the place in terror,
                not even waiting to see our poor
                dear daughter buried. She was our
                treasure and I failed her. We
                both did. We should never have
                married each other.

                          EMMA
                What are you saying?

                          CHARLES
                The unspeakable . I am saying
                that you and I, in making our
                perfect child, endowed her with
                the very weakness which killed
                her. Emma. That is what I
                couldn't write. That is what
                forestalled me all these years.
                It wasn't you I was angry with,
                it wasn't Innes and it wasn't
                God. I was angry with my theory.
                It was the truth I was angry
                with. It is the truth.

      Weeping, she shakes her head in furious denial. He kisses
      her hair, her eyes, her tear-streaked cheeks...



146   INT/ EXT BEDROOM, THE PRESENT. NIGHT                         146

      Rain continues to batter the house outside

      Inside Darwin and Emma make love, with a kind of wild
      desperation, their clothes strewn all over the floor,
      clinging to each other like castaways in a storm.



147   INT OFFICE. THE PRESENT. DAY                                 147

      Darwin enters his office. The chaos that existed here
      previously has been tidied away into files and boxes.

      Darwin opens the black box, takes out the files, places
      them on his desk, then sits down and begins to write



148   INT. STUDY. NIGHT.                                           148

      Darwin sits at his desk. Writing. He is possessed of a new
      sense of calm and purpose, the pen gliding fluently across
      the page.
                                                             87


      Night turns to day and then to night again. Darwin
      completes the Chapter headed "variation under
      domestication" and begins on a fresh sheet of paper.


149   EXT. THE GARDEN. DOWN HOUSE. THE PRESENT. DAY               149

      Crocuses are pushing up through the flower beds. Tiny green
      buds have started to emerge from the dead black branches


150   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY. DOWN HOUSE. THE PRESENT. DAY           150

      Still Darwin writes

                          ANNIE
                Tell me a story.

                          DARWIN
                I'm busy Annie.

                          ANNIE
                    (petulantly)
                I'll go away again, then you'll
                be sorry.

                          DARWIN
                All right, come here, come here.

      She comes and sits on his lap.

                          DARWIN
                Once there was a man
                Who, while travelling in South
                America, came apon a beautiful
                and dangerous idea.


151   INT. SOUTH AMERICAN JUNGLES. DAY                            151

      Darwin is in the south American jungle, trying to coax down
      from the trees, some small squeaking creature - a tousled
      looking abandoned chick.

                          DARWIN
                Here, here. Come on, come on then

      The creature draws closer, eyes like gimlets in the dark
      foliage.

                          DARWIN
                ...I wont hurt you.

      He reaches into the dark recesses of the forest. Darwin
      grabs it and stuffs it, squawking into his collecting bag.
                                                               88


152   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY NIGHT                                     152

      Darwin comes in, empties the bag into a black box with
      perforations and closes the lid

                          DARWIN
                He knew his wife wouldn't care
                for this creature so when he came
                home he locked it in a box, where
                it couldn't run around and do any
                damage.


153   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY. DAY                                      153

      Darwin works at his desk. There's a plaintive cooing sound
      coming from the box next to his feet.

                          DARWIN
                But every so often he'd open the
                lid and feed it, just because he
                couldn't bear to let it die.

      Finally he opens the lid and offers the creature a biscuit.

      It has grown a bit larger and made itself a nest. It takes
      the biscuit and peeps gratefully.


154   INT. DOWN HOUSE. DAY                                          154

      Darwin goes to the box and opens it. There's nothing there
      but an empty nest and some broken eggshells.

                            DARWIN
                One day he opened the box and
                discovered it wasn't in there at
                all. It had escaped with all its
                babies, who were nesting all over
                the house making a terrible mess.


155   INT. DOWN HOUSE. DAY. VARIOUS                                 155

      The Darwin's, their children and their servants run around
      the house finding birds everywhere.

      There is bird-shit on the curtains and the antimacassars,
      birds nesting in the sewing basket, the bread bin and the
      dress-up box.

      Every time you open a cupboard, angry birds fly out and
      flap angrily around the room.

      Mayhem. The house is in uproar.
                                                              89


                          DARWIN
                But finally they caught them all,
                and bundled them in a blanket and
                he asked his wife to dispose of
                them as she saw fit.


156   INT. STUDY. CONTUNUOUS                                       156

      Annie listens entranced. Darwin pauses

                          ANNIE
                And what did she do?

                           DARWIN
                I don't know but I fancy she took
                them out in the garden and set
                them free.


157   EXT. DOWN HOUSE. GARDEN DAY.                                 157

      Emma and Brodie come out carrying a huge white linen bag
      between them.

      They shake it out in the garden and birds come pouring out
      of it.

      High shot, looking down on EMMA as she watches the birds
      wheeling round and round in the sky above.


158   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY. DAY                                     158

      Darwin sits in his study window, watching a great flock of
      birds wheeling in the sky outside, the whole flock forming
      an ever-changing shape from the movement of its tiny
      component parts.


159   INT DARWIN'S STUDY. NIGHT                                    159

      Darwin puts down his pen, waking, as if from a dream.

      The manuscript is finished.

      The music of Chopin filters up from downstairs.


160   INT. DRAWING ROOM. DAY                                       160

      Emma is playing by candle-light. Darwin places the
      manuscript on top of the piano.

      She stops abruptly. The last chord resonates in the musky
      air.
                                                            90


                          DARWIN
                Done. I have finally got it out
                of the air and into these pages.
                Will you read it and decide what
                must be done with it. I confess I
                no longer know and I am very
                tired.

      She takes his hand and squeezes it.


161   INT. DOWN HOUSE. BEDROOM.                                   161

      Darwin undresses.


162   INT. DOWN HOUSE   DINING ROOM                               162

      Emma sits at the table and begins to read.


163   INT. DOWN HOUSE. BATHROOM                                   163

      Darwin gets out of the bath and towels himself dry.


164   INT. DOWN HOUSE. DINING ROOM                                164

      Emma lights a candle from the one before and continues to
      read.


165   INT. DOWN HOUSE. BEDROOM. NIGHT.                            165

      Charles lowers himself into the bed, sleep washes over him
      like a wave.


166   INT. DOWN HOUSE. DINING ROOM. NIGHT.                        166

      Still Emma reads.

                          DARWIN (V.O.)
                Thus, from the war of nature,
                from famine and death, the most
                exalted objects we can conceive
                directly follow. There is a
                grandeur in this view of life
                ...in which endless forms most
                beautiful and wonderful have been
                and are being evolved.

      Outside the sky is growing lighter.


167   INT. DOWN HOUSE. BEDROOM. DAY.                              167

      Charles wakes.
                                                              91


      He opens the curtains on a clear autumn day. The house is
      unusually quiet.


168   INT. DOWN HOUSE. TOP OF THE STAIRS. DAY.                     168

      The grandfather clock on the landing strikes mid-day.

      Darwin goes downstairs.


169   INT. DRAWING ROOM. DAY.                                      169

      He enters the drawing room. There is no sign of Emma nor of
      his manuscript.

      He goes to the window and sees her at the bottom of the
      garden standing over a bonfire, burning something.


170   EXT. GARDEN. DOWN HOUSE. DAY.                                170

      Darwin goes outside.

                             DARWIN
                Emma?

      She looks up from the fire. Darwin crosses the lawn to her.
      She's burning leaves and dead-heads from the flower garden.

                          DARWIN
                Did you read it?

                             EMMA
                Yes.

                             DARWIN
                And....

                          EMMA
                I wrapped it and put it on the
                table there.

      There's a brown paper parcel on the garden table where they
      like to sit under the big Cyprus tree.

      Darwin picks it up, it is addressed to John Murray,
      Publisher, stamped and sealed with sealing wax.

                          EMMA
                You're right. True or not it must
                all be said. Probably most of it
                is true. God help us.

      Darwin kisses her.
                                                            92


                          EMMA
                Careful. I have soot all over my
                hands.


171   EXT. BOTTOM OF THE DRIVE.                                   171

      Darwin stands with the brown paper package, turning it over
      in his hands.

                          DARWIN (V.O.)
                Dear Hooker, I have today
                despatched to John Murray the
                completed manuscript. Who knows
                if anyone will buy it and how
                they will respond. No doubt many
                will wish al diabolo altogether.
                But least it is out in the world
                now and no longer torturing me.

      John Griffiths, the postman, comes up the hill from the
      village.

      Darwin gives him the manuscript. The Postman puts it in his
      satchel and heads on up the lane.

      Darwin turns back and walks up towards the house.

      As he does so a little figure, Annie takes his hand, and
      together they continue on home, Annie skipping happily by
      her father's side.


172   POST-SCRIPT.                                                172

      Darwin's "Origin of Species" was sold out on its day of
      publication.

      A classic to this day, it was reprinted six times before
      his death; and his burial, with full Christian honours, in
      Westminster Abbey.

EXT. YUAN COMPOUND - DAY

Security men and porters are loading wagons for a convoy.
As they work, we see across the lake a lone horseman entering
the village.  One of the men recognizes him.

				WORKER
		Master Li is here!

ANGLE ON: Li Mu Bai, thirties, powerful and handsome.

In the background, old Aunt Wu, at the sight of Li Mu Bai,
drops her parcels and runs excitedly into the building.

INT. YUAN HALLWAY - DAY

Aunt Wu runs hurriedly through the halls.

				AUNT WU
		Shu Lien!

INT. YU'S ROOM - DAY

Yu, a beautiful woman in her early 30s, is finishing packing
for the convoy, wrapping a few small items in a linen
wrapper, as Aunt Wu bursts in.

				AUNT WU
		Li Mu Bai is here!

INT. YUAN PRACTICE HALL - DAY

				LI
		How's everything?

				AUNT WU
		Fine.  Please come in.

Yu sits, composed, as Aunt Wu ushers Li in.  Li carries a
large object, wrapped in silk.

Yu smiles.

				YU
		Mu Bai...It's been too long.

				LI
		It has.
			(he glances around
			the room)
		How's business?

				YU
		Good.  And how are you?

				LI
		Fine.

An awkward pause.

				YU
		Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan
		Mountain.  He said you were
		practicing deep meditation.

				LI
		Yes.

				YU
		The mountain must be so peaceful...
		I envy you.  My work keeps me so
		busy, I hardly get any rest.

				LI
		I left the training early.

				YU
		Why?  You're a Wudan fighter.
		Training is everything.

				LI
		During my meditation training... I
		came to a place of deep silence...
		I was surrounded by light... Time
		and space disappeared.  I had come
		to a place my master had never told
		me about.

				YU
		You were enlightened?

				LI
		No.  I didn't feel the bliss of
		enlightenment.  Instead... I was
		surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I
		couldn't bear it.  I broke off my
		meditation.  I couldn't go on.
		There was something... pulling me
		back.

				YU
		What was it?

				LI
		Something I can't let go of.  You
		are leaving soon?

				YU
		We're preparing a convoy for a
		delivery to Peking.

				LI
		Perhaps I could ask you to deliver
		something to Sir Te for me.

Li unwraps the object.  It is an ancient, astonishingly
beautiful sword.

				YU
		The Green Destiny Sword?  You're
		giving it to Sir Te?

				LI
		I am.  He has always been our
		greatest protector.

				YU
		I don't understand.  How can you
		part with it?  It has always been
		with you.

				LI
		Too many men have died at its edge.
		It only looks pure because blood
		washes so easily from its blade.

				YU
		You use it justly, you're worthy of
		it.

				LI
		It's time for me to leave it behind.

				YU
		So what will you do now?

Li doesn't reply.

				YU
		Come with me to Peking.  You can
		give the sword to Sir Te yourself.
		It'll be just like old times.

				LI
		First I must visit my master's
		grave.  It's been many years since
		Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet
		to avenge his death.  And yet I'm
		thinking of quitting.  I must pray
		for his forgiveness.

				YU
		Join me once you have finished.  I
		can wait for you in Peking.

				LI
		Perhaps.

EXT. THE GATE TO PEKING. DAY

Customs officials have just finished checking the contents
in a row of carriages bearing the Sun Security insignia.
The caravan slowly passes through the checkpoint into the
boundaries of Peking.  Yu, riding a handsome horse and
clearly the leader, watches as her crew clears inspection.

				GUARDS
		Ok.  Pass.

				YU
		Thanks.  Let's go into the city.

EXT. OUTSIDE A DEPOT. DAY

Workers are busy unloading the contents from the carriages.
Boss Giao is checking off the merchandise -- a cargo of
medicinal herbs.

				GIAO
		Everything got here safely.  I'm
		much obliged.

				YU
		Just doing my job.

				GIAO
		Sun Security has been the best
		since your father started it.
		You're a credit to his memory.

				YU
		Thank you.

				GIAO
		I mean it.

EXT. DAY. PEKING

From a gray tiled roof, we can see Peking's magnificent grid
of houses extending miles and miles out, freshly painted by
the morning sun.

EXT. PEKING STREET. DAY

Dusty and congested as always, people, horses, and carriages
are fighting to get through the boulevards.

A group of jugglers perform at a corner.

Yu surveys the busy street from on top of her horse.

INT. TE'S GREAT HALL - DAY

Yu presents the sword to Sir Te.

				SIR TE
		This is Li's personal sword, a
		great hero's weapon!  He is the
		only one in the world worthy of
		carrying it.  It's too fine a gift.
		I cannot accept it.

				YU
		Sir Te!  It has brought him as much
		trouble as glory.  Help him to
		leave these troubles behind.
		Otherwise, he'll never be able to
		start anew.

				SIR TE
		All right.  I'll act as the sword's
		custodian.

De Lu, the head servant, enters.

				DE LU
		Governor Yu has arrived.

				SIR TE
		I must change.

				YU
			(getting up)
		You've always been so good to Li Mu
		Bai and me.  Please accept our
		thanks.

				SIR TE
		Please do not be such a stranger.
		You'll stay the night as my guest.
		Now, Shu Lien... tell me something.
		And forgive me for prying.  Your
		father was a great friend to me,
		and I think of you as my own
		daughter.

				YU
		Please, Sir Te, what is it?

				SIR TE
		Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and
		his warrior days... maybe he's
		trying to tell you something?

				YU
		I don't know...

				SIR TE
		Don't be coy.  I've always known
		about your feelings for each other.
		All these years, it's a shame...
		neither of you is brave enough to
		admit the truth to the other.
		You're both wasting precious time.

				YU
		I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I
		aren't cowards.

				SIR TE
		When it comes to emotions, even
		great heroes can be idiots.  Tell
		me if Li Mu Bai is not more open
		the next time you see him.  I'll
		give him an earful!

INT. TE'S STUDY - DAY

Yu and De Lu approach the study.

				DE LU
		Sir Te said to leave the sword in
		here.

De Lu opens the door and is startled to find a young woman
inside.  The woman is studying the sheets of calligraphy
hanging on the walls.

				DE LU
		Who are you?

				JEN
		I'm your guest today.  I am Governor
		Yu's daughter.

				DE LU
		This is Sir Te's study.  You are
		here to...

				JEN
		I was looking for a quiet corner.

				DE LU
		I am Sir Te's head servant.  And
		this is another of our guests.

INT. TE'S STUDY - DAY

Yu gently lays the sword, still in its sheath, in Jen's hands.

				JEN
		It's heavy for such a thin piece of
		metal!

				YU
		The handle is heavy.  And the blade
		is no ordinary metal.  Still, the
		sword is the lightest of weapons.
		You're just not used to handling it.

				JEN
		But I have had much practice.  As a
		child in the West, a platoon lived
		with us.  They'd let me play with
		their weapons.  The scabbard is so
		beautiful.

				YU
		Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you
		see it tainted with blood, its
		beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400
		years old.

				JEN
		Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...

				YU
		My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it
		to Sir Te as a gift.

				JEN
		Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior?
		Why would he give his sword to Sir
		Te?

				YU
		You're too young to understand.

				JEN
		You're a sword fighter too?

Yu yanks the sword out of the sheath.  An eerie sound
resonates within the study.  Jen is even more impressed.

				YU
		Yes, I am.  But I prefer the
		machete.  Certain moves, however,
		call for a sword.

				JEN
		Really?

Yu puts the sword back in the case.

				JEN
			(longingly)
		It must be exciting to be a fighter,
		to be totally free!

				YU
		Fighters have rules too: friendship,
		trust, integrity... Without rules,
		we wouldn't survive for long.

				JEN
		I've read all about people like you.
		Roaming wild, beating up anyone who
		gets in your way!

				YU
		Writers wouldn't sell many books if
		they told how it really is.

				JEN
		But you're just like the characters
		in the stories.

				YU
		Sure.  No place to bathe for days,
		sleeping in flea-infested beds...
		They tell you all about that in
		those books?

				JEN
		You know what I mean.  I'm getting
		married soon, but I haven't lived
		the life I want.

				YU
		So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's
		the most important step in a
		woman's life, isn't it?

				JEN
		You're not married, are you?

				YU
		What do you think?

				JEN
		No!  You couldn't roam around
		freely if you were.

				YU
		You're probably right.

Yu studies Jen.  The room falls silent for a moment.

EXT. SIDE COURT YARD - DAY

It's dusk and the sky is beautiful orange and purple.  Jen
is leaving the study escorted by her maid.  She turns to Yu
for a final good-bye.  Yu seems intrigued by the encounter.

EXT. SIR TE'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Two lighted lanterns are raised up.

INT. TE'S STUDY - NIGHT

Sir Te hands the sword to Governor Yu.

				SIR TE
		Go ahead, Governor Yu.

Governor Yu is impressed by the opulence and elegance of the
sword.  He closes his eyes to guess the weight of the sword.
Te snubs out the flame from a candle, then slides the sword
out from its sheath.  The sword gives off a luminous blue
glow in the dark.

				SIR TE
		Two feet 9 inches long.  1 inch
		wide.  The handle is 1 inch deep,
		2.6 inches wide.  Seven-tenths of
		an inch thick.  With seven rubies
		missing from the hilt.  You can
		tell the design dates back to
		before the Chin era.  Engraved with
		a technique lost by the time of the
		Han Dynasty.

				GOVERNOR YU
		Your knowledge is remarkable, Sir Te.

				SIR TE
		A sword by itself rules nothing.
		It comes alive only through skillful
		manipulation.

				GOVERNOR YU
		I see your point.  Please continue.

				SIR TE
		The Imperial Court isn't the
		problem.  With royalty and officials
		everywhere, the Royal Guard keeps
		security tight.  But Peking is not
		like the West.  Here, you'll find
		all sorts of characters.  Proceed
		with caution in your quest for law
		and order.  Don't depend only on
		the court.  Contacts in the Giang
		Hu underworld can ensure your
		position.  Be strong, yet supple.
		This is the way to rule.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

A maid warms her hands in a basin of hot water for Jen, then
walks over to Jen and helps remove her earrings.  Someone
knocks and the maid goes to answer the door.

				MAID
		Governess...

				GOVERNESS
		Let me do it.

The maid leaves as the governess enters the room.

				JEN
		Please sit.

				GOVERNESS
		I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you
		want to change into them?

				JEN
		Put them down.

				GOVERNESS
		I heard you met Shu Lien today.

				JEN
		Do you know her?

				GOVERNESS
		She's one of those.  Your mother
		would not want you consorting with
		her kind.

Jen shoots her an angry look.

				JEN
		I'll socialize with whomever I
		please.

				GOVERNESS
		Don't invite danger into your
		father's house.

She's about to say something, then thinks better of it.

				JEN
		I'm tired now.

				GOVERNESS
		Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up,
		and is getting married soon.  God
		knows what the future will bring.

				JEN
		It will be just the same.  Enough!
		I'm tired.

				GOVERNESS
		Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the
		windows for you.

The governess leaves.  Jen sits on the side of her bed,
thinking.

EXT. TE'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

A wide shot of the compound.  A patrol man greets Master Bo,
Sir Te's head of security.  The place is serene.

				MASTER BO
		Chilly, eh?

				NIGHTMAN
		Yes, Master Bo.

As Bo walks on, shadows rustle in a treetop in the background.

EXT./INT. INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF TE'S STUDY - NIGHT

A masked figure silently opens the window and enters the
room.  It moves swiftly to the sword case, opens it, and
wraps the sword.

Bo enters, sees the thief, who leaps up to the ceiling.  The
thief steps over Bo and out into the courtyard.  Bo tries to
stop the thief, who easily outwits him, jumping onto the
roof as Bo yells out.

				BO
		Someone help!  Stop him!  He's on
		the roof!  The sword's been stolen!
		Stop thief!  Stop him!

The thief skips a few times and jumps off to a side street.

Bo grabs a pole and runs, as gongs begin to sound, alerting
people to the theft.  People rush outside, Yu Shu Lien among
them.

EXT. PEKING STREET - NIGHT

Bo runs through the streets.  The thief is nowhere in sight.
Suddenly, there are sounds of weapons clashing.  Bo hurries
towards the source.

EXT. AN ALLEY OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Bo is surprised to see the hooded figure battling with two
other fighters -- Tsai (male, 40s) and May, his daughter.

				TSAI
		It's Jade Fox!

				MAY
		We must avenge mother!

The hooded figure does a gravity defying flip and soars over
a wall, just as Bo arrives.

				BO
		Do something!  He's getting away!

EXT. PEKING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

The thief runs atop a roof -- right into Yu.  Yu and the
hooded figure face off.

				YU
		Return the sword, and I'll let you
		go.

The figure just regards her, slightly shifting weight.

Yu attacks, but the figure repels her.

				YU
		You've been trained at Wudan?

The figure answers by leaping to another rooftop.  Yu
catches up, and resumes her attack with a relentless series
of lightning-quick blows.

EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Bo follows Tsai and May, who are quickly walking away.

				TSAI
		You're mistaken.  We're just street
		performers.  We were rehearsing.

				MAY
		Father!

				BO
		You were rehearsing?  Who are you
		trying to fool?

May wants to respond but is again cut off by Tsai.  They run
off.

				BO
		Where did that thief go?

Bo looks around and discovers he had chased the thief into
Governor Yu's compound.

				BO
		Governor Yu's house!

EXT. ROOF TOP

Yu and the Black Figure continue to fight.

				YU
		Get down here!  Give back the sword!

EXT. GOVERNOR YU'S - NIGHT

Yu slowly gets the upper hand in her fight with the thief.
A small arrow cuts across the night and flies toward Yu.
She catches it, but the masked figure takes the opportunity
to get away.

Yu pauses to feel the arrow in her hand, standing in the
empty courtyard.

EXT. TE'S SIDE ENTRANCE - DAY

De Lu escorts Yu into Te's.

				DE LU
		Sir Te awaits you.

INT. TE'S GREAT HALL - DAY

Men are standing at attention.  Bo is giving his account of
what happened, as Yu enters.

				BO
		I'm sure the thief is in the Yu
		household.

				SIR TE
		How dare you imply?

				BO
		But I say --

				SIR TE
		-- Enough.

The men hustle out.  Bo can barely contain his frustration.

				YU
		Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?

				SIR TE
		Yes, though I doubt he's involved
		in this.

				YU
		But the sword could be in his
		compound.

				SIR TE
		Then someone's trying to set him up.
		We should inform Li Mu Bai.

EXT. OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Madam Yu is returning from temple.  The governess is helping
her out of the carriage.  Servants are peeling bills off a
wall across the street.

				MADAM YU
		What is it?

				MAID
		Madam Yu, someone's put up posters.

A partially torn flyer with the words "Jade Fox will not
escape justice!" is seen on the ground.

				MADAM YU
		Let me see.

				GOVERNESS
		Someone is after Jade Fox.
		Preposterous, looking for her here!

Madam Yu nods and walks inside, as the Governess tosses the
flyer away and follows her.

A hand scoops up the flyer -- it is Yu.  She studies it,
then puts it in her pocket, and moves on.

EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

Bo is searching for the Tsais.  The bridge is full of
jugglers.  But the two are nowhere to be found.

EXT. PEKING STREET - DAY

Bo quizzes a homeless man.

				BO
		Where are they?

				HOMELESS MAN
		I don't know.  I haven't seen them
		in two days.

Bo is about to give up when he looks up and sees May walking
quickly into an alley.  Bo follows her.

EXT. IN FRONT OF TSAI'S HOUSE

May walks into a dilapidated house surrounded by a broken-
down bamboo fence.  Bo inches closer and sees May and Tsai
oiling their weapons.

INT. BO'S ROOM - DAY

Jen practices calligraphy.  The governess is by her side
embroidering and throwing occasional glances at Jen.  The
maid enters.

				MAID
		There is a Miss Shu Lien here to
		see you.

Jen stops and looks up at them.

				GOVERNESS
		Miss is busy right now.

				MAID
		I'll tell her.

				JEN
		Show her in.

The governess shoots her a look.

				GOVERNESS
		This spells trouble.

				JEN
		I have a guest.

The governess gets up to leave just as the maid shows Yu in.

				MAID
		This way please.

The governess and Yu exchange quick glances.  The governess
bows slightly and departs.

				JEN
		I've missed you.

				YU
		How so?

				JEN
		I'm bored.

Yu sees the calligraphy.

				YU
		You're doing calligraphy?

				JEN
		I'll write your name.  Just for fun.

Jen writes Yu's name with great confidence and swiftness.

				YU
		I never realized my name looks like
		"sword."

Jen freezes slightly.

				YU
		You write gracefully.  Calligraphy
		is so similar to fencing.

				JEN
		Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.

The maid enters with tea.

				JEN
		Please.

				YU
		Thank you for seeing me.  I hear
		your wedding day is near.  You must
		be overwhelmed by the preparations.

				JEN
		I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less
		I think of it the better.  My
		parents are arranging everything.
		The Gous are a very powerful family.
		My marrying one will be good for my
		father's career.

				YU
		You are fornuate to marry into such
		a noble family.

				JEN
		Am I?  I wish I were like the
		heroes in the books I read.  Like
		you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm
		happy to be marrying.  But to be
		free to live my own life, to choose
		whom I love... That is true
		happiness.

				YU
		Do you think so?  Let me tell you a
		story.

				JEN
		About you and Li Mu Bai?

				YU
		Yes.  Did you know I was once
		engaged to be married?

				JEN
		No, really?

				YU
		His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was
		a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath.
		One day, while in battle, he was
		killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's
		enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went
		through a lot together.  Our
		feelings for each other grew
		stronger.  But how could we dishonor
		Meng's memory?  So the freedom you
		talk about, I too desire it.  But I
		have never tasted it.

				JEN
		Too bad for Meng, but it's not your
		fault, or Li Mu Bai's.

				YU
		I am not an aristocrat, as you
		are... but I must still respect a
		woman's duties.

				JEN
		Don't distance us.  From now on,
		let's be like sisters.

				YU
		Then as a sister, let me wish you
		happiness in your marriage.

EXT. YU'S GARDEN - DAY

The maid escorts Yu out.  Yu pauses, looks around, and sees
the profile of the Governess peering at her from around a
corner.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Moonlight spills into the room, as Jen rises sleeplessly
from bed and looks out the window.  A light breeze stirs her
hair.  The sound of the wind rises, and slowly her face
dissolves, into...

INT./EXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT - DAY

...the face of a younger, less sophisticated Jen, as she
lets the dry desert air flow through her hair.  She sits in
a carriage, part of a caravan, with guards on horseback,
that is traveling through the spectacular desert.  Across
from her sits her mother, of whom she is barely cognizant.

				MADAM YU
		What a godforsaken place!  Can't
		your father be appointed closer to
		civilization?  Jen... are you
		listening to me?

Jen is still looking out the side of the carriage, at a
beautiful mountainside.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Jen sighs, and turns back toward her bed.

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Tsai and May have been sitting, hidden in the branches of a
tree, watching Jen.

				TSAI
		Let's go!

They drop down silently and walk away.  From another rooftop,
Lo looks silently on.

EXT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Tsai and May enter the house.

INT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Inside the tiny house, they discover a hooded figure going
through their belongings.

Immediately Tsai throws a knife, which rips off the figure's
mask -- revealing Bo.  Tsai has another long knife at his
throat.

				TSAI
		Who are you?

				BO
		Wait!  I'm a friend!

Tsai pauses.

INT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT (LATER)

May fans a small coal-fired grill that is boiling a sizzling
pot of vegetable and meatball soup.  Her father and Bo are
now friendly dinner companions, much to May's delight.

				TSAI
		I don't care about your sword.

				BO
		Why were you spying on the Yus?

				TSAI
		I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox.
		I'm a police inspector from Shaan
		Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a
		master criminal.  I hear she
		infiltrated the Yus.  She must have
		come with them when they transferred
		here.  But with Yu's reputation, I
		can't just go in and accuse her.

				BO
		This Jade Fox is a woman?

				TSAI
		Yes.

				BO
		Then leave her to me.

				TSAI
		Pardon me, but I doubt you can
		handle her.  My wife was quite a
		martial arts expert.  Jade Fox
		killed her.  So you see, this is
		personal.  Leave her to me.

				MAY
		It's ready!
			(re: the soup)


				BO
		I'm ready for anything!

Bo fishes into the pot with his chopsticks.  May intercepts
him with her own chopsticks.

				MAY
		Father gets first dip.

Tsai stiffens and snaps his chopsticks, not to pick up a
meatball but to catch an incoming dart.  A dart wrapped with
a note.  Bo jumps up.

				TSAI
		They're gone.

				MAY
		What does it say?

				TSAI
		"We'll settle this at midnight on
		Yellow Hill."  Good, the fox is out
		of her hole.

INT. TE'S STUDY - NIGHT

Yu is ushered into the room, to discover Sir Te talking to
another man, whose back is to her.

				SIR TE
		Shu Lien, look who's here.

The man turns around -- it's Li Mu Bai.

EXT. TE'S HALL - NIGHT

Yu and Li Mu Bai sit together.

				LI
		Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast
		suspicion on Governor Yu.

				YU
		But something is going on at the Yu
		household.

				LI
		What have you discovered?

From her sleeve, Yu removes the flyer.  Li takes it, his
face darkening.

				LI
		Jade Fox?  Impossible.

				YU
		You always suspected she'd fled to
		the West.

				LI
		I didn't think she'd dare come back
		to Peking!

				YU
		Is there any place safer than under
		the nose of Governor Yu?

				LI
		So I shall avenge my master's death
		after all.

				YU
		Be careful.  Sir Te requires
		discretion.  Official business is
		difficult enough.  Don't let
		personal feelings make it worse.
		And I don't know... even this
		poster... could be some sort of trap.

				LI
		Did you see who posted it?

Yu pauses.

				YU
		No.

				LI
		It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's.
		On the night of the theft there was
		a brawl near Yu's.  Were you
		involved?

				YU
		It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he
		followed the thief to the Yus'.

				LI
		Have you questioned him yet?

				YU
		No, not yet...

				LI
		But your men are watching over Yu's
		compund?

				YU
		No, I'd already sent them home.
		You can blame me for losing the
		sword, but please trust that I'll
		get it back soon using my own
		methods.

				LI
		That's not what I meant.  I don't
		care about the sword.

				YU
		What do you mean?  Didn't you come
		back here for it?

				LI
		I don't know it was stolen until I
		got here.

				YU
		Then, why did you come?

				LI
		Well, we had talked...

De Lu enters.

				DE LU
		Pardon my intrusion.  Master Li,
		your room is ready.

				LI
		Thank you.  Please lead the way.

EXT. YELLOW HILL - NIGHT

Tsai, Bo, and May wait under an ancient tree.  Bo stifles a
yawn.

				BO
		The fox doesn't care much for
		punctuality.  Still no sign of her.

An old lady struggles up the hill, wearing a floppy hat over
her face, holding a cane.  The three exchange glances.

				TSAI
		Enough!  Show yourself.

The old woman shrinks in fear, but then throws off her
disguise and unveils herself -- the Governess.

				FOX
		Tsai... you dog!  You will pay for
		your stubbornness.

				BO
		That's what you think, old witch!

				TSAI
		If you surrender now, you'll suffer
		less.  But if you resist, I won't
		stop until you're dead.

				MAY
		Father!  Let me avenge my mother's
		death.

				FOX
		You'll soon end up like her, you
		little whore!

				BO
		You'll pay for that!

A fierce battle begins, the main fighting between Tsai and
Fox, with May and Bo getting a stab in occasionally, when
the opportunity presents itself.

				TSAI
			(to Bo)
		She's going to paralyze you!

Using acupressure, Fox disables Bo.  May shoots an arrow at
her, but she catches it and flings it back, hitting May.

				TSAI
		May!

Fox then disables Tsai, but just as she goes for the kill,
Li Mu Bai flies down from the treetops and steps between them.

				FOX
		Tsai, you filthy mongrel!  An ambush!

				MAY
		Father, are you all right?

Li addresses Fox.

				LI
		Wudan should have gotten rid of you
		long ago.  It's been a long time,
		Jade Fox!  You don't remember me...
		But you should remember my master.
		You infiltrated Wudan while I was
		away.  You stole our master!  Now
		it's time for you to pay!

				FOX
		Your master underestimated us women.
		Sure, he'd sleep with me, but he
		would never teach me.  He deserved
		to die by a woman's hand!

				LI
		You stole the secrets of Wudan's
		highest martial arts.  But after
		ten years of training, your moves
		are still undisciplined.  And
		today, under a Wudan sword... you
		will die!

Li easily brings Fox to the ground.

Li raises his sword to the prostrate Fox.  A figure masked
in black appears next to Fox, sword extended, saving her.

				FOX
		Disciple, we'll kill them all!

				FIGURE IN BLACK
		Let's go!

				BO
		Another one!

				FOX
		I must get rid of Tsai!

Fox fights Tsai, Bo, and May, as Li addresses the masked
figure.

				LI
		Who are you?  Why is the Green
		Destiny in your possession?

				FIGURE IN BLACK
		What's it to you?

				LI
		My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green
		Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be
		your master.  Where did you learn
		that "Xuan Piu" move?

				FIGURE IN BLACK
		I'm just playing around.

				LI
		Tell me, who is your master?

				FIGURE IN BLACK
		Let's go!

				FOX
		We must kill them!

Tsai throws his blade at Fox, who catches it and throws it
back, hitting him in the head.  Fox and the masked figure
leap away.

May drops to the ground, cradling her dead father's head.
Bo kneels beside her.

				MAY
		Father!

EXT. TE'S - DAY

Te and a group of his men look down as a cloth is removed
from over the body of Tsai.  Bo and May stand before them.

				TE
		This is Tsai?

				MAY
		My father.  Police Inspector from
		Shaan.

				TE
		This should be reported to Governor
		Yu.  The victim is an officer.  You
		believe the killer is hiding out in
		his compound.

				YU
		I'd bet my life on it!

				TE
			(to Li and Yu)
		Come with me.

He exits the room.

INT. TE'S STUDY - DAY

Te, Li, and Yu are seated.

				SIR TE
		This needs to be resolved, and
		quickly.

				LI
		I'll get into the Yu household and
		get her.  I'll ferret out Fox and
		her gang.

				YU
		We must be careful.  Governor Yu is
		a court official, and in charge of
		security.  Any disturbance will
		cast suspicion on him.  It might
		get Sir Te in trouble.

				SIR TE
		This is a delicate matter.

				YU
		Sir Te, can you find some excuse to
		invite Madam Yu and her daughter?

				SIR TE
		What do you have in mind?

				YU
		The best way to trap a fox is
		through her cubs.

Sir Te and Li look puzzled.

EXT. SIR TE'S GARDEN - DAY

Yu sits with Madam Yu and Jen.  They busy themselves with
various items for her trousseau.

				MADAM YU
		Madam Te is certainly spoiling us
		with these wedding gifts.  She's
		being so considerate.

				YU
		I'm sorry she's not feeling well
		enough to receive you today.

				MADAM YU
		I heard Sir Te lost something.  And
		now Madame Te's not feeling well...

Jen sits silently reading.

				YU
		We know who stole the missing item.
		If the thief returns it, I'm sure
		Sir Te will pursue the matter no
		further.

				MADAM YU
		That's good.  Sometimes the help
		can't keep their hands to themselves.
		It's very embarassing.

				YU
		Sir Te knows that even well-meaning
		people can make mistakes... that
		can bring ruin to themselves and
		their families.

				MADAM YU
		But don't be too lenient.

				YU
		No mercy will be shown toward the
		murderer who turned up in Peking.

				MADAM YU
		A murderer?

				YU
		Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu
		Bai's own master.  Last night, she
		killed a policeman who had tracked
		her down.

				MADAM YU
		A female criminal!  Now that's news!

Jen becomes visibly upset.

				JEN
		You say she killed a policeman?

				YU
		Yes, from the West.  He went
		undercover and and followed her
		here,

				MADAM YU
		Maybe the murderer and the thief
		are one and the same.

				YU
		I doubt it.  This thief... it very
		unusual...

As Yu speaks, she lifts the tea pot to pour Jen some tea.
As she finishes speaking, she looks into Jen's face and the
pot slips from her hand.  Without even looking down, Jen
instinctively catches the pot with a lightning-fast move.

				YU
		...And most likely smarter than a
		mere killer.

Sir Te and Li Mu Bai walk by.

				JEN
			(formal)
		Greetings, Sir Te.

				SIR TE
		Hello, Madam Yu.  This is Li Mu
		Bai, the renowned swordsman.

				LI
		Delighted to meet you.

Li sizes Jen up.

				TE
		Miss Yu is soon to be married.

				LI
		Congratulations.

EXT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT

May opens her door, only to find Bo standing guard.

				MAY
		Why don't you come in?

				BO
		I'm standing guard.

				MAY
		Come in.  It's cold.

She turns back inside, hesitates, then turns back to him.

				MAY
		Come in.  We don't have to fear
		Jade Fox if we're together.

EXT. TE COMPOUND - NIGHT

A still, dark night.

EXT. TE'S STUDY - NIGHT

Something moves in the moonlight.  A hooded figure jumps down.

Li Mu Bai, who had been hiding in the shadows, comes forward.

				LI
		Isn't it a bit too late to be out?
		You've brought me the sword?

				FIGURE
		I do as I please.

The masked figure lunges away, but Li Mu Bai leaps with
incredible speed and grabs the sword from her.

				LI
		Where's your master?

				FIGURE
		What's it to you?

The figure floats away.  Li chases after her.

EXT. PEKING STREET - NIGHT

The two fly over houses and bounce off of rooftops,
displaying amazing floating skills.

INT. ABANDONED MONASTERY - NIGHT

The figure bounces into an old monastery.  Li is already
there.

				LI
		Had enough flying?  You've got
		potential.  You've studied the
		Wudan Manual but you don't
		understand it.  You need a real
		master.

The figure doesn't respond, but we sense the pride in her
eyes.

				FIGURE
		Do you think you are a real master?

				LI
		Like most things, I am nothing.
		It's the same for this sword.  All
		of it is simply a state of mind.

				FIGURE
		Stop talking like a monk!  Just
		fight!

				LI
		Then tell me where Jade Fox is.

				FIGURE
		On guard!

				LI
		Real sharpness comes without effort.

EXT. MONASTERY - NIGHT

The figure leaps into the garden, but again, Li is ahead of
her.

The figure attacks Li, who uses his agility to evade her.
Frustrated, the figure intensifies her attack.

The figure, losing composure, attacks wildly.  Li gets even
more elusive, using a branch to repel her.

				LI
		No growth without assistant.  No
		action without reaction.  No desire
		without restraint.  Now give
		yourself up and find yourself again.
		There is a lesson for you.

Li now holds the stick to her mask, gently raising it
slightly.

				FIGURE
		Go ahead.

				LI
		Why should I?  You need practice.
		I can teach you to fight with the
		Green Destiny, but first you must
		learn to hold it in stillness.

				FIGURE
		Why do you want to teach me?

				LI
		I've always wanted a disciple
		worthy of Wudan's secrets.

				FIGURE
		And if I use them to kill you?

				LI
		That's a risk I'm willing to take.
		Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade
		Fox couldn't corrupt you.

The figure's eyes cloud with tears.

				FIGURE
		Wudan is a whorehouse!  Keep your
		lessons!

The figure swirls and takes off, leaving a rueful Li standing
alone in the monastery.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Jen slips in through the window.  She pulls off her mask, as
she spots the Governess/Fox sitting and sewing.

				FOX
		You're home late... or should I say
		early?

				JEN
		Why are you still here?  You killed
		a policeman.  You should leave!
		You'll bring ruin on my whole family.

				FOX
		They wouldn't have found me if you
		hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a
		little girl, you thought stealing
		would be fun?  You, too, are
		responsible for that death.  Come
		with me.  You don't want to waste
		your life as the wife of some
		bureaucrat.  Denied your talent...
		As a master and disciple we will
		rule.

				JEN
		I'll never live as a thief!

				FOX
		You're already a thief.

				JEN
		That was just for fun.  How can I
		leave?  Where would I go?

				FOX
		Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of
		anyone in our way.  Even your father.

				JEN
		Shut up!

				FOX
		It's the Giang Hu fighter
		lifestyle... kill or be killed.
		Exciting, isn't it?

				JEN
		I owe you nothing.

				FOX
		Yes, you do!  You are still my
		disciple.

Jen lunges at the Governess, and the two exchange a few
blows.  Jen presses her finger against one of the Governess's
pressure points, disabling her.  Jen pushes her across the
room.

				JEN
		You think you've been teaching me
		all these years from the manual?
		You couldn't even decipher the
		symbols!

				FOX
		I studied the diagrams.  But you
		hid the details!

				JEN
		You wouldn't have understood, even
		if I had tried to explain.  You
		know... you've gone as far as you
		can go.  I hid my skills so as not
		to hurt you.

				FOX
		If I hadn't seen you fight with Li
		Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of
		all you've hidden from me.

				JEN
		Master... I started learning from
		you in secret when I was 10.  You
		enchanted me with the world of
		Giang Hu.  But once I realized I
		could surpass you, I became so
		frightened!  Everything fell apart.
		I had no one to guide me, no one to
		learn from.

				FOX
		Believe me, I've a lesson or two
		left to teach you!

Fox exits.

EXT. GOVERNOR YU'S GATE - DAY

The Governess leaves, a small sack over her back.

EXT. TE'S COURTYARD - DAY

Li practices fluently with Green Destiny in hand, beautifully
at ease with the weapon.  He spins around to find Yu standing
in the doorway.

				YU
		The sword is back... are you happy?

Li smiles.

				LI
		I admit, getting it back makes me
		realize how much I'd missed it.

				YU
		But it's not your sword anymore.
		You gave it to Sir Te.

				LI
		True.  But I must borrow it for one
		last mission.  Jade Fox must die at
		its edge.  Did you know what you
		were hiding when you covered for
		that girl?

				YU
		My job was to get the sword back,
		without embarassing anyone.  I
		wasn't about to ruin her life, or
		her father's.

				LI
		You did your job well.  But, this
		girl... I saw her last night.

				YU
		I knew she would intrigue you.

				LI
		She needs direction... and training.

				YU
		She's an aristocrat's daughter.
		She's not one of us.  In any case,
		it will all be over soon.  You'll
		kill Fox, and she'll marry.

				LI
		That's not for her.  She should
		come to Wudan and become a disciple.

				YU
		But Wudan does not accept women.

				LI
		For her, they might make an
		exception.  If not, I'm afraid
		she'll become a poisoned dragon.

				YU
		It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan
		accepts her, her husband might
		object.

				LI
		I thought by giving away the sword,
		I could escape the Giang Hu world.
		But the cycle of bloodshed continues.

				YU
		I wish there were something more I
		could do to help you.

				LI
		Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Jen is asleep.  A noise awakens her.

Lo opens the window and sneaks in -- right into the point of
Jen's waiting sword.

Jen's sword drops to the ground.

				JEN
		Lo?

				LO
		Jen!

Lo grabs her by the wrist.

				JEN
		You shouldn't have come.

				LO
		With all the traffic on your
		rooftop these days... it took me a
		while to get in here.  I can't wait
		any longer.  I was wrong to let you
		go.  Come back with me.  You'll be
		happy in the desert.  You'll be
		free there.

Jen turns back to him and rests herself briefly in his arms
again.

				JEN
		You've been looking for me all this
		time?

FLASHBACK: FOUR YEARS EARLIER

INT./EXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT - DAY

Jen holds up a comb, with daylight shining through it.  Jen
admires the piece, her most prized possession.

Madam Yu sits opposite her.

				MADAM YU
		Jen... stop playing with it.

Jen looks out over the desert, as the wind picks up and the
sky darkens.

				JEN
		I won't break it.

EXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT - DAY

Lo and a group of armed bandits descend on the caravan.

				GUARD A
		It's Dark Cloud!  Dark Cloud is
		coming!

His warning is useless.  From Jen's pov, we see the guards
slaughtered in a hail of arrows and swords.

				MADAM YU
		Lower the shade, don't let them see
		you!

				DARK CLOUD (LO)
		Don't touch the women!

Though unharmed, Madam Yu immediately faints.  Lo approaches
the carriage and grabs the comb from Jen's hand.

She bolts from the carriage, and, once outside, bends down
and grabs a lance from the body of a dead guard, whose horse
flails beside him.

She looks up to see the gang of bandits already making their
escape on horseback.

				LO
		Let's go!

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Jen and Lo ride across the desert floor at breakneck speed.

				LO
		Come get your comb.

She tries to jab him with the lance, but he grabs it and
flings her off her horse.

				LO
		Hurry back to your mother.

Lo rides on as she charges after her horse.

EXT. DESERT BLUFF - DAY

A group of bandits is dividing up the loot, as Jen rides up,
keeping a respectable distance.  They notice her and rise as
she dismounts.

One of them saunters over to her and stands, grinning, a few
feet away.

In a second, she's slammed his balls into his stomach and
knocked his nose into his face.  He crumples to the sand.

The other bandits stop laughing, quickly exchange glances,
and charge her at once.

In a matter of seconds, they're either on the ground or
dragging their fallen comrades back.

Lo calls out and stops the fight.

				LO
		She's mine.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Lo and Jen ride, if not side-by-side, then parallel, about
20 feet apart.  Their pace has slowed considerably.  In
fact, they're dead tired.

				LO
		Let's stop a moment.

				JEN
		Give it back!

				LO
			(shouting a bit)
		You're tired.  You need rest.  Your
		horse needs water.  There's a creek
		up here.

He dismounts, looks down at the dry creek bed.

				LO
		Well, there used to be!  What's
		your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call
		me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall
		or big, but I'm quick as lightning.

				JEN
		My comb!

She kicks him.  They fight ferociously until Lo, exhausted,
collapses.  She kicks him a few times, then collapses too.

INT. CAVE - DAY

Jen comes to and finds herself wrapped in a blanket of
animal fur.  She sits up with a start and checks her clothes.
Looking around, she realizes she's in a cave.  Next to her
are a lamp, some hunting equipment, and a neat row of sharp
arrows.  She quickly grabs one of the arrows.

				LO
		If you like that arrow, I can make
		you a bow.  Great for hunting wild
		chicken.  They're delicious.

Jen raises one of the arrows, going on the attack again, but
her legs betray her and she falls.

				LO
		You need to eat, understand?  Then
		you'll have the strength to fight.
		Understand?

He helps her up, then pours her some horse milk from a sac.
He hands her a small chunk of food, which she first accepts
grudgingly, then, her hunger getting the better of her, she
starts to wolf it down.

				LO
		You're eating too fast.  Slowly.

EXT. CAVE - DAY

Lo walks out into a barren mountain landscape.  A chicken
roasts over a fire.  Lo whistles.

Jen appears suddenly with a rock and knocks it over his head.
Lo passes out as Jen scurries away.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE AND DESERT - DAY

Jen tries to find her way among the treacherous stony
terrain, her lips chapped and fingers bloody and blistered.
But soon she passes out.

INT. CAVE - NIGHT

Jen again awakes inside the cave.  Lo tries to feed her some
water, but she chokes, and tries to push him away, only to
find that her legs and hands are tied up.

				LO
		You've got quite a temper.  It's
		better this way.

				JEN
		You coward!

				LO
		Still in a bad mood?  At least
		you're speaking.  What's your name?

Jen spits at Lo.

				LO
		I didn't think the Hans had names
		like that.

Later: She weaves in and out of consciousness.  In the
flickering lights, she sees Lo sharpening his arrows.

Later, he pulls back an opaque curtain to reveal a makeshift
bathroom -- a water-filled cavity serves as a tub.

He rises as Jen sobs at the sight of her imprisoned and
dishevelled body.  He comes over and unties her.

				LO
		Relax.  If I had wanted to, I would
		already have done it.  You must be
		dying for a bath.  Fresh water's
		hard to get here.  But I managed to
		bring some up.  You can wear my
		clothes when you're done.  They're
		clean.  Don't worry.  I'll sing, so
		you'll know where I am.  After the
		bath, you'll be calmer.

Jen nods and the bandit releases her.  He starts to sing as
he walks out.  Jen waits until the sound recedes before
closing the curtain behind her and dipping into the pit.
While she bathes, she listens to his singing, a loud
rendition of a tribal song.  Lo apparently doesn't remember
all the lyrics, and la-las his way through more than a few
passages.  Jen smiles.

INT. CAVE - NIGHT

Jen grimaces as Lo pulls the last of some cactus needles
from the soles of her feet.

				LO
		No more hitting on the head!  All
		this trouble for a comb?

				JEN
		It's mine.  It means a lot to me.
		A barbarian like you wouldn't
		understand.

				LO
		Not true.  I can use it to pick
		fleas from my horse.

				JEN
		By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.

				LO
		I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I
		though you were a Han.

				JEN
		Give me back my comb.

				LO
		I don't take orders from anyone.

				JEN
		Give it back.

Jen impulsively grabs an arrow and stabs Lo, drawing a
little blood from his chest.  Furious, Lo lunges at her and
they tussle briefly.  Finally, Lo gets on top of Jen, and
the scuffling becomes more like foreplay.  Violence turns
into unleashed passion.

EXT. DESERT OASIS - DAY

Lo and Jen ride across the desert.  Jen holds tightly to him.

EXT. CAVE - NIGHT

Lo and Jen lie in the bath together.

				LO
		When I was a boy, one night, I saw
		a thousand shooting stars.  I
		thought, where did they all go?
		I'm an orphan.  I used to look for
		stars alone.  I thought if I rode
		to the other end of the desert, I'd
		find them.  I've been riding in the
		desert ever since.

				JEN
		And so, the little boy became a
		fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find
		the stars, so he stole my comb.

Lo pauses.

				LO
		Out here, you always fight for
		survival.  You have to be part of a
		gang to stand a chance.  Slowly,
		your gang becomes your family.  All
		that Dark Cloud stuff is just to
		scare people and make my life easier.

				JEN
		So you're still that little boy
		looking for shooting stars.

				LO
		I am a man.  And now I've found the
		brightest star of all.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Lo sees uniformed men through his binoculars.

				LO
		Your father's men are looking for
		you.

Jen doesn't respond.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Lo and Jen ride through a mountain pass.

EXT. CLIFF - DAY

Lo and Jen stand at the crest of a cliff.  Lo looks over,
viewing the desert valley below, as Jen joins him.  They see
a troop of uniformed men riding by in the distance.

				LO
		Your father's men are still looking
		for you.  They're still out there,
		circling closer.

				JEN
		Let them look.

				LO
		It is trouble for me.

Jen bites her lip.

				JEN
		Don't send me back!

				LO
		You must decide.  You might get
		tired of this life.  You might
		begin to miss your family.  If it
		were our daughter, we'd look for
		her too.  She would miss us.  Jen...
		I want you to be mine forever.  I
		will make my mark on the world.  I
		will earn your parents' respect.
		We have a legend.  Anyone who dares
		to jump from the mountain, God will
		grant his wish.  Long ago, a young
		man's parents were ill, so he
		jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't
		even hurt.  He floated away, far
		away, never to return.  He knew his
		wish had come true.  If you believe,
		it will happen.  The elders say, "A
		faithful heart makes wishes come
		true."

INT. TENT - DAY

Jen and Lo kiss.  Jen takes the jade comb out of her hair
and presses it into his palm.  Jen starts to cry.  They
embrace.

				JEN
		Keep it safe.  Return it to me when
		we are together again.

				LO
		I will.

				JEN
			(smiling painfully)
		If you don't, I'll come after you.
		And I won't let you off so easy.

EXT. TENT - DAY

Jen quietly walks out and stands sadly in the early morning
light.

End of flashback.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

				LO
		Wherever I went, someone always
		recognized me.  I really tried.
		Later, I heard you came to Peking.
		I was afraid I'd never see you
		again.  So I came.  I can't let you
		marry.

Jen is about to respond when a servant's voice is heard from
outside the door.

				JEN
			(whispering)
		Go.

				LO
		Jen...

				JEN
			(through her tears)
		Don't ever come back.

Lo hovers at the window frame.

				LO
		So it's over?

Jen pauses.

				JEN
		Yes.

Lo thrusts a small object in her hand.

He lifts his legs through the window, and drops out of
sight, just as Jen's door is opened from the hall.

				MAID
		We heard noises.

				JEN
		It was just a cat.

The maid pauses, then dutifully exits, closing the door.

Jen opens up her palm; gasping, she sees the comb that Lo
has given her.

EXT. WEDDING PROCESSION - DAY

The noise and color of a wedding procession.  A marching
band heralds the occasion, as throngs of onlookers fight to
get a glimpse of the groom, Gou Jun Pei, who trots by on a
handsome white horse.

INT. WEDDING CARRIAGE - DAY

Jen's head is completely covered in red cloth, as she rides
silently in the bride's carriage.

EXT. BALCONY OVERLOOKING WEDDING PROCESSION - DAY

Li and Yu watch the festivities from a balcony of the city
gate.

				YU
		You think Jade Fox will show up?

				LI
		She's out there, but I doubt she'll
		show herself.  We'll keep our eyes
		open.  Sooner or later, she'll come
		for the girl.

INT. WEDDING CARRIAGE - DAY

A small arrow flies into the carriage.  Jen calmly lifts the
red cloth from her face and pulls the arrow out of the
panelling inside the carriage.

We hear Lo's voice from outside the carriage, but Jen
doesn't seem to notice.

				LO
			(v.o.)
		Jen!  Come with me!  You're mine!

Lo runs wildly into the crowd.

				LO
		Come with me to the desert!  Jen!
		Come with me to Xin Jiang!

The guards surround Lo, but he escapes.

EXT. BEIJING STREET - DAY

Lo leaps and lands right in front of Li Mu Bai, his fingers
pressed against Lo's neck.  Yu comes running around the
corner and sees them.

				LI
		Where is Jade Fox?

Yu jumps in and pushes Li away.

				YU
			(to Lo)
		Come with me!  Hurry!

INT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - DAY

Lo sits dejectedly, having told his story to Yu and Li, who
look him over.

				YU
			(to Lo)
		You thought she'd give it all up
		and go back West with you?

				LO
		She's mine.

				LI
		Either way, you are no good to her
		dead.  With the Gou and Yu clans
		hunting you, you'll soon be in
		their hands.

				LO
		I don't care anymore.

				LI
		If you truly loved her, you wouldn't
		say that.

				YU
		Don't you want to see her again.

				LI
		All right.  I'll write you an
		introduction.  Take it to Wudan.
		Wait there for news from me.

				LO
		All right.

EXT. TE COMPOUND - NIGHT

Yu and Li enter, as other men and women race through the
compound, a sense of panic in the air.  Yu gives Li a look.
Li shrugs.

INT. TE'S HALL - NIGHT

A crowd, including Li and Yu, stand by as Te opens the empty
sword case, his voice rising.

				SIR TE
		When will this end?  They take it,
		they put it back, they take it
		again.  My home is turning into a
		warehouse.

Bo bursts into the hall, bows to Te.

				TE
		Speak!

				BO
		Jen has run away!  Gou found the
		wedding chamber empty.  Governor Yu
		requests your assistance.  You know
		the Giang Hu underworld.  He wants
		to find her, and keep her from harm.

				LI
		Sir Te, leave this to us.  Don't
		worry.

INT. TEA STALL - DAY

Jen arrives at the tea stall.  She places her sword on the
table, which catches the attention of a couple of Giang Hu
martial arts characters sitting nearby.

				WAITRESS
		What can I serve you?

As the waitress turns to leave, Jen grabs her by the arm.

				JEN
		The cup is dirty.

The flustered waitress apologizes and takes the cup away.
The men approach Jen.

				GANGSTER A
		Hello.  What is your name?

				JEN
			(without lifting her eyes)
		Long.

				GANGSTER B
		It's young Master Long.  My
		apologies.  I'm Iron Eagle Sung and
		this is my brother in arms, Flying
		Cougar Li Yun.  What brings you to
		Huai An, and where are you headed,
		Master Long?

				JEN
		Anywhere there's action.

The two men exchange glances.

				GANGSTER A
		In that case, perhaps we could be
		of assistance.

				JEN
		Don't bother.

				GANGSTER A
		You don't seem to understand.

				JEN
		So what if I don't?

				GANGSTER B
		We have ways of helping you
		understand.

The two pull out their weapons which are immediately chopped
into scraps by Jen.

				GANGSTER A
			(stunned)
		Are you related to Li Mu Bai?

				JEN
		He is my defeated foe!

EXT. WOODS - DAY

Li and Yu pass a cup back and forth as Bo tends to the
horses in the background.

				YU
		Have some tea.

As Yu passes the cup to Li, their fingers touch.
Embarrassed, Li pulls back.

				LI
		Shu Lien... The things we touch
		have no permanence.  My master
		would say... there is nothing we
		can hold on to in this world.  Only
		by letting go can we truly possess
		what is real.

				YU
		Not everything is an illusion.  My
		hand... wasn't that real?

				LI
		Your hand, rough and callused from
		machete practice... All this time,
		I've never had the courage to touch
		it.

Li takes Yu's hand and presses it to his face.

				LI
		Giang Hu is a world of tigers and
		dragons, full of corruption... I
		tried sincerely to give it up but I
		have brought us only trouble.

				YU
		To repress one's feelings only
		makes them stronger.

				LI
		You're right, but I don't know what
		to do.  I want to be with you...
		just like this.  It gives me a
		sense of peace.

Li Mu Bai smiles.

INT. STAR RESTAURANT - DAY

Jen walks upstairs.  A waiter greets her.

				WAITER
		Please follow me.

				JEN
		I want a clean room.

				WAITER
		We have plenty.  Your order?

Jen again sets her sword on the table as she sits down.

				JEN
		Steamed whole cod, bite-size
		meatballs, a little starchy, but
		keep the sauce light, shark fin
		soup, mixed vegetables, and some
		warm wine.

				WAITER
			(dazed)
		I have to order from a bigger
		restaurant.

				JEN
		Hurry then.

The waiter gauges Jen for an instant before bouncing off to
place the orders.  Jen checks her pouch and sees there's not
much money left.

A large group of Giang Hu characters enters.  They survey
the restaurant and quickly find Jen upstairs.

				GIANG HU A
		That's him.

				MI BIAO
		I am Iron Arm Mi.  I heard a true
		master has arrived.  I have come to
		seek a lesson.

Jen ignores him.

				MI BIAO
			(bristles)
		You asked for it!

Mi charges and attacks Jen, who is still sitting sipping tea.
Jen barely lifts a finger and disposes of Mi with a poke at
a sensitive pressure point.  This provokes a reaction from
the other men.

				JEN
		What kind of Iron Arm are you?

				FLYING MACHETE CHANG
		You have amazing technique!  I am
		Flying Machete.  Are you related to
		Southern Crane?

				JEN
		Southern Duck?  I don't eat anything
		with two feet.  Who could remember
		such long-winded names?

				GOU JUN SIHUNG
		Li Mu Bai is your defeated foe, and
		you don't know his master, Southern
		Crane?

				JEN
		Who are you?

				GOU JUN SIHUNG
		I'm Shining Phoenix Mountain Gou.

				JEN
			(furious)
		Gou?  I hate that name.  It makes
		me puke!  Too bad you're named Gou.
		You'll be the first to feel my
		sword today.

Jen leaps up and dives into battle.  The men all use
different kinds of weapons, but they all succumb to the
powerful Green Destiny.

				MONK JING
		Hold it!  Don't you know Monk Jing?

				JEN
		A monk, in a place like this?  You
		need a lesson!

				MONK JING
		Who are you?

She smiles, and leaps again into action after unsheathing
the Green Destiny.

				JEN
		Who am I?  I am... I am the
		Invincible Sword Goddess.  Armed
		with the Incredible... Green
		Destiny.  Be you Li or Southern
		Crane... lower your head... and ask
		for mercy.  I am the desert dragon.
		I leave no trace.  Today I fly over
		Eu-Mei.  Tomorrow... I'll kick over
		Wudan Mountain!

Jen is in a frenzy, slashing and maiming as she speaks.

INT. STAR RESTAURANT - DAY

Yu and Li are surrounded by the variously bandaged men who
battled with Jen.

				FLYING MACHETE CHANG
		We politely asked for a friendly
		match, but she showed no respect,
		and attacked us.  Everyone came by
		to teach her a lesson.

				MI BIAO
		Her sword was just too powerful.

				MONK JING
		I've traveled everywhere, but never
		met anyone so uncivilized.

				SHINING PHOENIX MOUNTAIN GOD
			(heavily bandaged)
		She kept accusing me of being Gou
		Jun Pei's brother.  Who is this
		Gou, anyway?

				YU
		Her husband.

The men all nod their heads.

EXT. OUTSIDE HWAI AN - DAY

Li and Yu ride together.

				LI
			(to Yu)
		We're close to your headquarters.
		Go home and check in.

				YU
		What about you?

				LI
		I'll look around and catch up later.

				YU
		Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get
		a good night's sleep at headquarters.

Yu takes a fork off the road.  Thunder can be heard in the
darkening sky.

EXT. SUN COMPOUND - DAY

A group of security men are practicing Kung Fu in the front
yard of Sun Security.  They stop when Yu enters.

				SECURITY MAN A
		Mistress, you're back.

				YU
		It's you!  How's everything here?

				CAPTAIN
		Fine.  You've been gone a while.

				YU
		Yes, and I leave again tomorrow.
		Your wife was due?

				AH WAI
		Yeah, a baby girl.

				YU
		Good!

				AH WAI
		I'll be happy if she's half as
		strong as you.

				YU
		Mrs. Wu...

				AUNT WU
		You're back!

				YU
		How's the arm?  Still sore?

				AUNT WU
		Much better.  You've been gone so
		long.

				YU
		Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the
		night.

				AUNT WU
			(excited)
		I'll go and make up his room!

Aunt Wu hustles out.  Yu goes into her own room.

INT. HALL OF ANCESTRAL WORSHIP

Yu lights incense for her former fiancé Meng.  Hearing
something, she turns to see a dishevelled Jen standing
outside downstairs.

				JEN
		Sister Shu Lien...

INT. YU'S ROOM - DAY

Yu eases her guard, then opens a drawer, and takes out some
clothes.  Jen, wearing just white underclothing, sets
herself on the edge of Yu's bed.  Yu brings over the clothes.

				YU
		Here you must be in proper attire.

				JEN
		I'm just borrowing some clean
		clothes.  I'm not staying.

				YU
		I'll give them to you.

				JEN
		I was just passing by and wondered
		how you were.

Jen tries to hide her anxiety but finally breaks down on
Yu's shoulder in tears.

				JEN
		You, sister...

				YU
		Look at the trouble you've caused.
		Now you know what Giang Hu life is
		really like.  If you think of me as
		your sister, let me give you some
		sisterly advice.  You can run from
		marriage, but not your parents.

				JEN
		They forced me to marry!

				YU
		Go back to them first.  Then you
		can decide about Lo.

				JEN
		You know about Lo?

				YU
		He really loves you.  Come back to
		Peking with me.  We'll find a
		solution.

				JEN
		Where is he now?

				YU
		Li Mu Bai has made arrangements.
		He sent him to Wudan Mountain.

				JEN
		You're working together to set me
		up!  I'm leaving!

				YU
		How dare you accuse us?  I always
		knew you had stolen the sword!
		I've done nothing but protect you
		and your family.  And you're repaid
		me with nothing but contempt.  Li
		Mu Bai himself spared you, and all
		you do is insult him.  We wanted
		some peace and you've ruined it all!
		You're no sister of mine!

				JEN
		What do I care?  You were never a
		real friend anyway.  But I wonder,
		how long could you last as my enemy?

Jen gets up to leave.  Yu intercepts her.

				YU
		Put the sword down!

Jen jumps out.

INT. YUAN COURTYARD - DAY

Jen soars out to the front courtyard where the guards are
still practicing.

They raise their weapons at the sight of an intruder.

				YU
			(calling out)
		Jen!

Jen greets Yu with the Green Destiny.

				YU
		Everyone out.  Shut the doors.

The men leave.

				YU
		Fine... the friendship is over.

Yu scoops up a weapon from one of many lying around and
begins her battle with Jen.

Yu uses every weapon that's available against Jen but none
are any match for the Green Destiny.

After slicing through another set of Yu's weapons, Jen looks
admiringly at the Green Destiny in her hands.

				YU
		Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's
		sword.

				JEN
		Come and get it if you can.

				YU
		Without the Green Destiny, you are
		nothing.

				JEN
		Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead.
		Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go
		ahead.

Yu picks up a huge broad sword and attacks.  Just as the
Green Destiny slices it in half, Yu holds the broken blade
at Jen's neck.  She pauses before hurting Jen, then pulls
back.

				YU
		Give me the sword.

Jen, taking advantage of Yu's trust, slices her arm.

				JEN
		Take it!

Yu, her shoulder bleeding, falls back as Li Mu Bai jumps in.

				LI
			(enraged)
		Stop it!  You don't deserve the
		Green Destiny.

				JEN
		Not another lecture!  On guard!

				LI
		Let's end this here.

				JEN
		Only the sword will settle this.

Jen soars up to the rooftop, with Li right on her tail.

EXT. LAKE - DAY

Jen floats over the lake, Li close behind.

EXT. BAMBOO FOREST - DAY

Jen runs into a sea of bamboo.  She appears to have lost Li
but is not slowing down.  Her white clothes are now stained
with blood and mud.  The wind had picked up and every breeze
sounds like an air attack by Li.

The two leap onto the tips of the bamboo trees and begin
their dances and dodges.  They glance off bamboos and each
other while staying afloat.  Finally Jen lands on the same
stick of bamboo as Li.  The two hold their positions for a
while, as the bamboo bends.

				LI
		I only let you go because I wanted
		to see the real you.

Jen tries to shake Li off the bamboo but Li recovers nicely.

				JEN
		What do you know about a true heart?

Li suddenly leaps off the bamboo tree.  The bamboo
straightens up and throws Jen toward the ground.  Jen
quickly pulls herself up and charges at Li.

Jen chases after Li, into a clearing, out of the bamboo
forest.

EXT. RIVER - DAY

Jen finally catches up to Li, who is standing on a rock
about a few feet wide amid the rapids.  Jen vaults onto the
rock and scuffles with Li.  Jen loses her balance.

				JEN
		What do you want?

				LI
		What I've always wanted, to teach
		you.

				JEN
		All right.  If you can take back
		the sword in three moves, I'll go
		with you.

Li takes the sword back.

				JEN
		Give it back!

				LI
		Kneel!

				JEN
		Never!

				LI
		Then you have no use for the sword.

Li throws the sword into the rapids.

Jen dives in to retrieve it.  He follows Jen downstream by
hopping from one rock to another.  Jen recovers the sword
but is herself drowning.  Suddenly Jade Fox swings into the
rapids and fishes Jen out.  Jade Fox carries the unconscious
Jen away.  Li gives chase, but loses them.

INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

It's raining.  Inside an old factory, Fox heats some medicine
paste and then dips a needle in the paste.  She burns the
needle point, causing a blue smoke.  She lights some incense
and puts it in a burner near Jen, who is barely conscious.

				FOX
		Sooner or later, they'd drag you
		back to Peking.  Your parents will
		never accept you again.  But why go
		home?  We've gone this far, we
		won't stop now.  You'll always be
		my lady.  At last, we'll be our own
		masters.  We'll be happy.  That's
		the most important thing.  All we
		have left is each other, right?
		Lie down and rest.

Jen is too weak to respond.

Fox leaves Jen clutching the Green Destiny.

EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

Fox scurries ahead in the rain.  Her eyes catch something,
but she keeps moving.

INT. YUAN COMPOUND - DAY

Aunt Wu finishes bandaging Yu.

				AUNT WU
		She's crazy.  You should have
		killed her.

				YU
		I didn't have the heart.

				AUNT WU
		Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.

Yu senses movement at the window.  Looking out, she sees
Jade Fox in the distance.

INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

Jen wakes up, flushed from fever.  She takes a sip from a
cup of water -- it's empty.  She tosses the cup, gets up,
and walks into the rain.

EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

Jen walks out, raises her face into the rain, and drinks the
raindrops.  Thirst quenched, she turns around and finds Li
standing there.  Jen limps towards him while mumbling.

				JEN
		Is it me or the sword you want?

Jen falls into Li, who checks her pulse and looks at her eyes.

				LI
		You've been drugged!

Li carries her inside, kicking away the incense burner.

INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

Li lays his hands on Jen's back; she slowly comes to.

				LI
		Where is Jade Fox?

Jen gestures that she doesn't know.  Yu and Bo enter.  Yu
looks at Jen.

				YU
		What happened?

				LI
		Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you
		get here?

				YU
		We followed Jade Fox.

Instantaneously, a flurry of darts flies directly in Jen's
direction.  Li and Yu swipe miraculously at them all,
sending them flinging hither and thither.

Fox shows herself.  Li attacks her.  She falls back, bleeding
to death.

				LI
		And so you die.

Li touches his neck.

				FOX
		And so shall you!

Li pulls a single needle from his neck.

				YU
		A poisoned needle!

				FOX
		You deserve to die, but the life I
		was hoping to take... was Jen's.
		Ten years I devoted to you.  But
		you deceived me!  You hid the
		manual's true meaning.  I never
		improved... but your progress was
		limitless!  You know what poison is?
		An eight-year-old girl, full of
		deceit.  That's poison!  Jen!  My
		only family... my only enemy...

Jade Fox dies.

				YU
		You can't die!  Tell us what poison
		you used!  You can't die!  Tell us
		the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu
		Bai die!

				JEN
		She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin
		poison.  It goes straight to the
		heart.

				LI
		My blood will soon reverse its flow.
		It's the same poison she used to
		kill my master.  There is no
		antidote.

				YU
		That can't be!  Everything has an
		antithesis!  Why not this?

				JEN
		The antidote exists.  She taught it
		to me.  The formula is simple, but
		it takes time to prepare.  Trust me.
		As you have helped me, let me help
		you.

				LI
		All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on
		as long as I can.

				YU
			(takes the comb from
			her hair)
		Take my horse and go to the compound.
		Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help
		you.  Hurry!

				JEN
		Spare your energy.  I'll be back!

EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT

Bo is burying Fox in the rain.

EXT. YUAN COMPOUND - NIGHT

The guards surround Jen.  She pushes past them.

				JEN
		Where is Mrs. Wu?

Aunt Wu comes running out.

				AUNT WU
		Stop it!

Jen pulls out Yu's comb.

				JEN
		Shu Lien told me to show you this.

				AUNT WU
		Let her in.

INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT

Yu sits across from Li, whose pose is almost meditational,
eerily calm.

				YU
		Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some
		hope...

				LI
		Shu Lien...

				YU
		Save your strength.

				LI
		My life is departing.  I've only
		one breath left.

				YU
		Use it to meditate.  Free yourself
		from this world as you have been
		taught.  Let your soul rise to
		eternity with your last breath.  Do
		not waste it... for me.

				LI
		I've already wasted my whole life.
		I want to tell you with my last
		breath... I have always loved you.
		I would rather be a ghost, drifting
		by your side... as a condemned
		soul... than enter heaven without
		you.  Because of your love... I
		will never be a lonely spirit.

Yu cries.

She kisses him lightly.  He closes his eyes.

EXT. PATH - DAY

As the sun rises, Jen rides speedily, clutching the medicine
in her hands.

INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

Li is in Yu's arms.  They're holding hands.  The sun shines
in.  Yu slowly releases Li's stiff fingers -- he is dead.

Jen is at the door.

				JEN
		He's gone?

Bo peeks over Jen's shoulder.

Yu rises and picks up Green Destiny.  Jen kneels.  Yu raises
the sword, but doesn't kill her.

				YU
		Bo... please take this sword back
		to Sir Te.

He takes the sword from her.

				YU
			(to Jen)
		Now you must go to Wudan Mountain.
		Lo awaits you there.  Promise me
		one thing, whatever path you take
		in this life... be true to yourself.

EXT. WU TAN TEMPLE - DAY

Jen climbs up toward the temple, finally reaching the temple
gate, and sees Lo standing there.

He runs to her.  She greets him.

INT. WU TAN TEMPLE - MAGIC

Jen and Lo make love.

INT. WU TAN TEMPLE - DAY

Lo wakes up to find the jade comb on the pillow beside him,
Jen gone.

EXT. WU TAN MOUNTAIN - DAY

Lo catches up to Jen, who stands on a bridge.  The gorges
below are shrouded in clouds.  She looks back at him.

				JEN
		Do you remember the legend of the
		young man?

				LO
		"A faithful heart makes wishes come
		true."

				JEN
		Make a wish, Lo.

Lo pauses.

				LO
			(closing his eyes)
		To be back in the desert, together
		again.

Jen smiles, turns, and leaps into the clouds.  They seem to
catch her gently, before she disappears into them.

Lo remains standing, a smile on his face, tears rolling down
his cheeks.

THE END.

 	The CROW

	by

	Davis Schow

	based on a screenplay by
	John Shirley

	Based on the comic book
	created, drawn, and written by
	James O'Barr

	September 14, 1992

	FADE IN:

	EXT. CEMETERY - LATE AFTERNOON

	BOOM!  A crack of lightning illuminates the silhouette of a
	perched crow large in the f.g.

	TIGHT ANGLE - FRESH GRAVE

	As a spade smooths the walls of a new double-decker plot.

				DIMITRI (O.S.)
		We're losing the light; let's pack
		it in.

	ANGLE - DIMITRI AND ALEXI

	TWO GRAVEDIGGERS.  Scoop digger parked f.g. towering gothic-
	style church b.g.  Rolls of astro turf.  They look up toward 
	the sky.

				ALEXI
		Snow, maybe?

				DIMITRI
		What, you gonna ski on this?

	He indicates the mound of fresh dirt.  Spits into the grave.

				DIMITRI (CONT'D)
		Come on, let's bag this.  It's
		beer time.

	Alexi nods and unfurls the tarp over the dirt.

	LOW ANGLE TRACKING SHOT - FLOWERS ON GRAVES

	As we MOVE alongside a pair of canvas-sided combat boots, as the 
	wearer collects the most lively flowers from each grave in 
	sequence.

	TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW

	Cemetery DEFOCUSED b.g.  Large, glossy-black, the bird follows
	the arc of movement in the previous shot.  Ruffles its feathers
	as it begins to sprinkle rain.

	ANGLE - ELLY - RESUMING HER MOTION

	A dirty-blondish tenement KID of eleven, clad in a blend of cast-
	offs and hand-me-downs; her version of street punk chic.  She
	totes a skateboard under one arm (itself a berserk Jackson
	Pollock chaos of band stickers, silver marker and graffiti, with
	day-glo wheels), and transfers her impromptu bouquet so she may
	unzip a flap and hike up a ragged hood against the rain.  She 
	stops to watch the grave diggers pack up and EXIT b.g.

				ELLY
		Guess the picnic got rained out.

	She looks down o.s. at --

	ANGLE - SHELLY WEBSTER'S GRAVE

	as Elly places the gathered flowers down.  Almost reverent.

	RESUME CROW ANGLE - ELLY B.G.

	as Elly takes a single white rose and places it atop the grave
	near Shelly Webster's.

	ANGLE ON GRAVE - AS ELLY LEAVES

	TILT UP from rose to the name: ERIC DRAVEN. Rain spatters the 
	granite, darkening it.

	EXTREME CLOSE-UP - CROW's EYE

	It blinks in its alien way.

	WITH THE CROW

	as it takes wing from it's unseen perch.  Lands stop Eric's
	headstone.  It pecks tentatively at the top of the monument.

	ANGLE - ELLY NEAR ERIC'S GRAVE

	She hasn't gotten too far before she notices the bird.

				ELLY
		Oh, scary.

	The bird blinks at her from the headstone.
				ELLY
		What are you, like, the night
		watchman?

	Another blink from El Birdo.

	CAMERA WITH ELLY -  BOOMING BACK HIGH

	as she exits the iron gates of the cemetery without looking
	back.  Brutal building facades, like dead eyes, and bad
	alleyways, like hungry mouths, are gradually revealed as we
	continue PULLING BACK to unveil that the cemetery is smack in
	the middle of the city.

	EXT. MAXI-DOGS - TWILIGHT - RAIN CONTINUES

	CLOSE-UP of a foot-long hot dog being drowned in mustard.

				MICKEY (O.S.)
		What this place needs is a good
		natural catastrophe.  Earthquake,
		tornado...

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND MICKEY

	ALBRECHT is a black beat cop, 35, in a rain slicker.

	MICKEY is the grease-aproned entrepreneur of MAXI DOGS, a steamy
	open-front fast foodery.

				ALBRECHT
		You gotta put the mustard
		underneath first.

				MICKEY
		Maybe a flood, like in the Bible.

				ALBRECHT
		Here, let me do it.

	He grabs the dog from Mickey.  Mickey puffs his cigar while he
	cooks.  Albrecht methodically spreads a napkin and performs
	surgery on the hot dog, coating the bun with mustard, rolling
	the dog in the bun.  Flashes Mickey a "gimme" look. 

				ALBRECHT
		Come on... onion.  Don't cheap
		out on me.  Lotta onions.

	MOVING ANGLE - AS ELLY SKATEBOARDS TOWARDS MAXI DOGS

				MICKEY
		Heyyy -- it's the Elly monster.

				ALBRECHT
		How do you ride that thing on a 
		wet street?

				ELLY
		Talent. Hi.

				ALBRECHT
		Care for a hot dog?

				ELLY
		You buying?

				ALBRECHT
		I'm buying.

	Elly grabs the stool next to Albrecht.  They`ve done this routine before.

				ELLY
		No onions though, okay?

				ALBRECHT
			(horror)
		No onions?

				ELLY
		They make you fart.

	Mickey laughs.  Spots Elly a Coke.

				MICKEY
		What's goin' on, Elly?

				ELLY
		I went to see a friend of mine.

				MICKEY
		Well, how's your friend?

				ELLY
		She's still dead.

	Albrecht and Mickey exchange a look re:  Elly's matter-of-
	factness.

	EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT (RAIN)

	Thunder KABOOMS o.s.  The crow pecks the top of the stone again
	and a chip of granite flies off, bang!

	EXTREME CLOSE - THE HEADSTONE

	as the crow pecks again and draws blood from the rock.

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	A dot of blood on its ebony beak.

	LOW ANGLE - HEADSTONE

	A thin, watery trickle of blood wanders from the top of the
	stone towards the earth.  Rain does not interfere.  Lightning
	plays in the rolling cloud cover, b.g.

	RESUME THE CROW

	as it takes off from the gravestone, into the rain.

	CLOSE-UP - THE BLOOD

	It slowly fills the name Eric Draven into the rock.

	CLOSE-UP - FOOT TAPPER

	A LOW ANGLE like the SHOT introducing Elly's boot.  This time
	we see cowboy boots, leather chaps.  The foot taps.  Waiting.

	MEDIUM ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER

	as lightning strikes.  Just enough for us to see a figure in a 
	long duster and a cowboy hat.

	RESUME ERIC'S HEADSTONE

	DRAVEN fills with blood.  Blood continues groundward.

	NEW ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER

	Turning to meet FRAME as the crow alights on his outstretched 
	arm.  This is the SKULL COWBOY.  We glimpse the deathshead,
	beneath the brim of the cowboy hat.

	RESUME ERIC'S GRAVE

	as blood trickles into the turf at the base of the grave.

	TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW

	shaking off rain.  Watching intently.

	CLOSE-UP - THE SKULL COWBOY'S FREE HAND

	Black gloved.  It walks a flat silver throwing knife across it's
	knuckles, like a quarter somersaulting.

	RESUME ERIC'S GRAVE

	The turf stirs beneath the white rose.  Magically, a slim white
	parts the earth to grasp the rose.

	SKULL COWBOY POV - ERIC's GRAVE

	as the figure of Eric Draven stands up from behind his own
	headstone.

	LOW ANGLE (FROM GRAVE) - ERIC

	Pale.  Clad in cerements: cheap black burial suit, slit open in 
	back.  WHite shirt.  A nothing tie.  No shoes.  Rain sluices mud
	from his upturned face.  He looks to the sky.  Lightning.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - FOLLOW ERIC

	as he weaves to lean against a nearby tree.  Looks o.s.

	ERIC's POV - THE SKULL COWBOY

	water-blurred, through the rain, standing with the crow perched
	on his arm like a hunting falcon.  He releases it and it flies
	to the tree.

	ANGLE -  ERIC

	Watching this.  Wipes mud from his eyes, tries to clear vision.
	The crow lights in the tree and they meet eye-to-eye.  Eric
	looks back o.s. and we RACK to include the Skull Cowboy.

				ERIC
		What the hell are you?

				SKULL COWBOY
		Interested?  Follow the crow.

	NB.  The Skull Cowboy speaks in nicely distorted, buzzlike
	charnal house whisper.  Unsettling and hackle-raising.

	Eric turns back to the bird, which takes wing in the rain, His
	eyes follow it.  He looks back, disoriented, doubtful, but the 
	Skull Cowboy is gone.

	LOW DEEP ANGLE - THE CROW

	Taking wing in the rain, showing the way.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC

	alone in the cemetery.  After a moments hesitation, he lurches
	off, following the crow.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. ARCADE GAMES SUPPLY OFFICE - NIGHT - TO ESTABLISH:

	A candy-flaked muscle T-bird is parked at the curb.

	INT. ARCADE GAMES SUPPLY OFFICE - NIGHT

	A MOVING SHOT during o.s. lines.  Past dead video and pinball
	devices.  Pasta desk with an open briefcase, coffee cup,
	ashtray -- someone was just there.  Then past a WOMAN, trussed
	with duct tape to her office chair, gagged, hot fear in her 
	darting eyes.

	COMPLETE CAMERA MOVE to include SKANK, a blade-thin speed freak 
	with pattern baldness, always loud, jittery, a manic dust puppy.
	And T-BIRD, an arrogant Arayan, brush-cut iron pumper, who is
	prepping an incendiary.  He exhibits a small squeeze bottle of
	arson cocktail to Skank.

				T-BIRD
		Uncle T-Bird's 100-proof
		accelerator.  I squirt you with
		this, you could jump in the 
		Detroit river and burn all the way
		to the bottom.

	INSERT A CLOSE-UP of the bomb in his hands as he works.  Silver
	canisters, an LED timer, wires.

				T-BIRD (CONT'D)
		You know, Lake Erie actually
		caught on fire once, from all the
		crap in it.  Wish I coulda seen
		that.

	He CLICKS a switch.  PEEP.  LED countdown blurs.

				T-BIRD (CONT'D)
		We're ready to rock.

	Skank notices the captive woman's handbag on the floor.  Picks
	it up.  Looks through it for valuables.

				SKANK
		What about working girl?

	INTERCUT the woman's increasingly horrified reactions.

				T-BIRD
		What about her?

				SKANK
		I say we leave her here to fry,
		man.

	T-Bird looks casually at the woman.  Smiles hideously.

				T-BIRD
		No.  Let's take her with us.

	ANGLE - THE WOMAN

	Her eyes bug in a terrified NO!

	EXT. STREET - MOVING - NIGHT

	As the T-Bird fishtails wildly around the corner and eats street.

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

	TB drives.  One eye on his digital watch (doing an equally
	fast countdown).  Skank wrestles their captive, the woman, in
	the back seat.

				TB
			(pissed off)
		Skank, shut her the fuck up!

	SKank punches her and she sags.  Then he looks forward.

				SKANK
		Whoaaa -- T-Bird, red light, red
		light!

	EXT. STREET CORNER NEAR MAXI-DOGS - NIGHT

	As the T-Bird slews wide, cutting sidewalk, scattering
	nightwalkers, immediately attracting everybody's attention.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT - AT MAXI-DOGS

	Reacting, with a mouthful.

				ALBRECHT
		Goddammit.

	Mickey grabs the counter phone instantly.

				MICKEY
		Call it in?

	Albrecht is off and running for the corner already.

				ALBRECHT
		Yeah, do it!
			(to Elly)
		Stay right there!

	HOLD ON MICKEY.  He points at Albrecht's hot dog.  Yecch.

				MICKEY
			(yelling after)
		You want I should save this for
		you?

	EXT. MOUTH OF ALLEY ACROSS FROM CEMETERY - NIGHT

	The car slides to a nose-down panic stop.

				SKANK (O.S.)
		Dump her, man, dump her!

	The woman comes tumbling from the car, which blasts off with a
	war hoop from the guys inside.

	ANGLE - CORNER - ON ALBRECHT

	Gun out, hauling ass on wet pavement.  Aims at the departing
	car.  Gives it up.  Still too far away.  Pedestrians in the way.

	ANGLE - THE WOMAN

	hurting, cut, bleeding, tottering toward the dumpster.  Duct tape 
	stuck to her face but cut away around her mouth.  With her as
	she falls into the alley darkness... straight into the arms of

	CLOSE TWO-SHOT - ERIC AND THE WOMAN

	Their eyes lock.  Eric stiffens with his first FLASH.

	NB:  Eric's flashes of past memory are conditioned by the nature
	of things with which he makes physical contact.  Hints and
	fragments in fierce, super-saturated COLOR.  Puzzle pieces he
	must assemble.  Each flash keynoted by a BLOWBACK NOISE and 
	accompanied by a degree of pain.  It hurts to remember.

	FLASH:  INT. T-BIRD - WOMAN'S STRUGGLE

	The faces of Skank and T-Bird are murky, ephemeral, their voices
	hideous, distorted echoes.  A knife snaps open.  We see the 
	blade.  Blood.  Skank hits her, pow! and --

				FLASH ENDS.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND WOMAN

	An airborne crow POV spiralling up and away from them.

							MATCH WITH:

	ANGLE - THE CROW

	perched on a fire escape, high above, watching and waiting.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AND WOMAN

	She fades.  He lets her drop away, horrified.  And staggers back
	into the cover of the alley.  Her blood is on his hands.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT RUNNING

	Skidding in, spotting the woman.  Kneeling to her.

				ALBRECHT
		Here now!  You're gonna be okay!
		Can you understand me?  I'm a
		police officer...

	The woman is no longer in pain.  Deathly calm now.

				WOMAN
		He touched me and it stopped.  The
		pain.

				ALBRECHT
		What did you say?

				WOMAN
		I saw a ghost...

	Her eyes roll back and she dies in Albrecht's arms.

				ALBRECHT
		Oh no... don't go, darlin', you
		stay with me, now... shit!

	HIGH ANGLE CROW POV - THE ALLEY

	BOOMING BACK from Albrecht, the woman, onlookers, as police
	units screech up to assist.

	EXT. ALLEY BEHIND ARCADES GAMES SUPPLY HOUSE - ON ERIC - NIGHT

	Eric in lurching flight, panting.  Stops and steadies against
	the wall across from the backside of Arcade Games.

	ANGLE - THE CROW (FLYING)

	Circling, then lighting on the fire escape above Eric.

	BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES - ("CROWVISION")

	"CROWVISION" is what the crow "gives" Eric to see.  Visually 
	distinct and immediately identifiable.

	ERIC'S POV - BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES

	Which he's already seen through the crow's eyes.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	looking up at the crow.  Disoriented.  Doesn't understand.
	Suddenly he cottons, and covers his eyes just in time to shield
	from:

	ANGLE - BACK OF ARCADE GAMES

	The rear windows EXPLODING outward in a spray of fire and
	debris.

	ANGLE - WITH ERIC

	he reels back, crashes into a dumpster.  Falls.

	ANGLE - THE CROW

	landing on the dumpsters edge near a pair of discarded combat
	boots in the trash.  Flames.

	LOW ANGLE - ERIC

	The blood from his hands mars his burial shirt.  He tears the
	shirt away, leaving his tie absurdly intact.  Wipes his face
	with his shirt.  Discards it.  Stops, held by his discovery --

	PUSH IN ON ERIC

	as his fingers explore the five puckered bullet punctures in his
	chest.  Almost a circle.  Comically, he feels his back foe exit
	wounds.  Then hauls himself upright, coming level with the crow.
	His glance at the bird is almost accusatory.

	ANGLE - THe CROW

	Inscrutable.  We should get the idea that some silent
	communication is taking place.

	ANGLE - ERIC'S FEET 

	bare, muddied, frozen.  TILT to Eric.  His gaze moves from the
	crow to the boots in the trash.  He grabs them, pushes them onto
	his bare feet.  His eyes catch the firelight.  Distant o.s.
	SIRENS

				ERIC
		Fire.  In the rain.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. CLUB TRASH - NIGHT

	We are now within the neon techno-depths of Club Trash.  The BG
	music is hard, savage, primal:  a doom-laden Radio Werewolf band
	rules.  Cabaret Blitzkrieg, packed with Death-to-Yup
	trendazoids.  We'll see more of this circus later.  Right now
	the BG SOUND is our biggest clue to the flavor of this
	establishment since we are --

	TIGHT CLOSE-UP A FRAMED 8X10

	Thinly filmed in dust, mounted among dozens of other band shots.
	Visible among the posed members of a group called Diabolique is
	Eric, wielding guitar on the club stage.  ND BLUR as people 
	CROSS FRAME.

	GRANGE, 45-50, powerful, a seasoned assassin, cruel but loyal.
	His facade remains stony as he leads three other men briskly
	down the corridor.:  NGO NWA, 50ish, clad Chinese gangster style
	- white topcoat, white scarf, tinted shades - and two body guards
	supplying a power perimeter around him,lean, dark-haired Asian
	killers who would gladly die for Ngo Nwa, which they will in 
	just a minute.

	They have just passed the Diabolique 8X10.  Ngo Nwa's gloved
	fingers, in passing, leave little skid tracks in the dust that
	clear the eyes of Eric in the photo.

	As the foursome reaches the DOOR, Grange turns doubtfully -- 
	suspiciously -- to Nwa.

				NGO NWA
		He will see me... unannounced.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE DOOR

	As Grange keys in the enter code the door hisses open.  Without
	a word, Nwa passes inside and the door is pulled shut in
	Grange's face by the Bodyguards, who post themselves to either
	side.

	INT. LAO'S NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

	The door CLOSES and the BG NOISE is GONE.  Through a large window
	(mirrored on the club side) all sorts of activity is visible
	through automatic mini-blinds.  A fly-vision bank of 12 TV
	monitors is hot with surveillance.

	LAO, a painfully clean-cut, Armani-clad Asian, impeccable,
	almost dashing, but the dynamic here is crystal clear: Nwa is
	the King: Lao, the dark prince in this hierarchy.

	At the desk, Lao is startled from his contemplation of a tiny,
	perfect rat skeleton by Ngo Nwa's unheralded entry.  The desktop
	is bare except for and Arcane Vietnamese fighting knife, half a
	meter long with an ideogrammed blade, dramatically positioned
	beneath an Artemide lamp.  Lao rises and feigns servility.

	NB:  The following exchange will play FAST, and entirely in
	VIETNAMESE.

				LAO
		(formal greeting)

				NWA
		(dismissiveness, contempt, then
		chastizing anger as:)

	Nwa INDICATES the blade with some ridicule.

				LAO
		(phony assuagement)

				NWA
		(knows it's bullshit)

	Lao turns, staring out the blinds, fighting for control.  Deep
	breath.  He turns back to his "master."  Nwa gestures broadly at
	the oppulent office, indicating that Lao should be grateful, but 
	is somehow errant
	 
				NWA
		(respect is required)

				LAO
		(begrudging agreement)

	Lao sees the blade.  An idea.  He lifts it reverently, bears it
	the Nwa hilt-first in both hands, as if bestowing a thing of
	immeasurable worth.

				NGO NWA
		(why give me this?)

	Nonetheless, Nwa accepts the blade.  It gleams.  Hypnotic. Even
	Nwa has to admire it.  Turns it so the blade is pointed at his
	sternum.  His attitude indicates Lao is too far away to do
	anything untoward.

				LAO
		(sinister punchline)

	Lao spins through the air and HEEL-KICKS the blade THROUGH Nwa's
	chest, pinning him to the door.  It's over so fast the gasp of
	astonishment never escapes Nwa.  Lao is much more than merely 
	treacherous, he is extremely capable.

				LAO
			(in perfect English)
		When I spoke of an offering, I
		didn't mean an offering to you.

	INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

	Grange, standing out of arm's reach in the corridor, kills both
	Bodyguards with a double headshot as they turn in greeting as the
	door OPENS.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR - LAO, GRANGE, AND CORPSES

	Lao exchanges a look with his right arm; Grange nods
	affirmatively.

				GRANGE
		You gonna smoke his bones now, or
		however it is you do it?

	Lao smiles indulgently.  He wipes the blood from the blade on
	the jacket of his ex-lord.  Lao now bows to no one. 

	EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - ANOTHER ALLEY - NIGHT

	Eric, wearing the combat boots, climbs as the crow leads him.
	Up.  He jams his hand on a rusty wedge of metal.  Ouch.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S PALM

	Blood flows from the gash.  He vises his fist shut.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON FIRE ESCAPE

	Eye-to-eye with the crow.  Opens his hand.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S PALM

	The blood flows back into the wound, which closes itself, 
	leaving another scar.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	Vising the rail.  Speaks to the night.  Almost a mantra.

				ERIC
		"My kitten walks on velvet feet,
		and makes no sound at all.  And in
		the doorway nightly sits to watch
		the darkness fall.  I think
		he loves the lady night..."
			(to crow)
		Am I alive?  Am I dead?  Something
		else?  Something in between?

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	Inscrutable.  No answer here.

	RESUME ERIC

	Almost bemused.  Steadier.  A hint of friendliness.

				ERIC
		Thanks for sharing that.

	ETC. GIDEON`S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	As the T-Bird grumbles tp park curbside.  Menacing.

	INT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	A junkyard of loot and dusty discards.  Junkie thievings and
	other people's stereos.  Behind a wire-meshed security counter
	GIDEON reads a racing form, chain-smoking throughout the scene.  He
	is pear-shaped, stubbled, unkempt.  Food on his shirt.  JINGLE
	of doorbells.  Gideon lowers his paper to reveal Skank and
	T-Bird on approach.

				GIDEON
		Ahhh, jesus, the creatures of the 
		night, here they come.  Tweedledum
		and Tweedledummer.

	Skank riles

				SKANK
		Hey, blow me, fat boy!

	Just as quick, Gideon cocks and levels a Magnum at Skank.

				GIDEON
		Blow yourself, bigmouth.

				T-BIRD
			(interposing)
		Whoa, hey, whoa.
			(hands up)
		Business.

	He lifts a small carton onto the counter.

				GIDEON
		Whatcha got?

	NEW ANGLE - COUNTER

	Transaction time.  T-Bird passes items through the screen slot 
	and Gideon gives each one cursory, doubtful inspection.

				T-BIRD
		Coupla more rings... 24k.

				GIDEON
		18k.  Crap.

				T-BIRD
		...necklace... pearls...

				GIDEON
		Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,

				T-BIRD
		Leather purse...

	He hands though the bag rested from the woman.

				GIDEON
		What's this -- a little, ah,
		bloodstain, right?
			(doesn't matter)
		Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm
		doin' you a --

				T-BIRD
		Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a 
		favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.

				SKANK
		You wouldn't want Top Dollar not 
		to smile.

	Mention of Top Dollar clams Gideon efficiently up.  He hands
	over the cash to T-Bird with a grimace.

	EXT. ROOFTOP - ON ERIC - NIGHT

	Eric stares upward at the crow as it drops like a bomber from
	the night sky, flying past him, skimming the roof, leading him
	on.  Eric exhales, shrugs, feeling mocked by the bird.

				ERIC
		All right.

	And he takes off on a run.  Only to stumble and fall.  But the
	falls turns into a TUMBLING ROLL that lands Eric back on his feet
	still moving.  He looks back as if to ask: "Did I do that?" and
	runs out of the frame.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - PICKING UP ERIC ON THE RUN.

	as he squints towards the crow and does his best to keep up.
	TRACK WITH HIM to the edge of the roof, heavily misted in rain.

	He jumps a negligible gap to the next lower roof.  The next 
	roof-top is a one-story jump down.  Eric clears the jump with a
	WOOF of air.  Keeping his eyes on the flying crow; gaining
	strength.  His next leap is more like a broad-jump.  Athletic.

	FAST MOVING ANGLE - THE CROW

	keeping airborne, keeping ahead.

	MOVING ANGLE - ERIC

	Eyes confidently on the sky as he arches out into space...

	UP ANGLE FROM STREET - BUILDINGS

	As Eric is seen to jump across the gap at least three stories up
	where there is no connecting building.

	CLOSE ANGLE - TARGET BUILDING LEDGE

	as Eric smashes into it, just missing, hinging at the waist,
	grabbing for purchase, suddenly panicked, gravity pulling him 
	downward.

	ANGLE - AT ERIC FROM PHONE CABLE BRACKET

	Eric falls but manages to grab the bracket one-handed.  He hangs
	for another deadly moment, then slowly, to his own astonishment,
	executes a one-handed pull-up that will save his ass.
				ERIC
		Gotcha.

	He completes the pull-up, bringing his chin level with the 
	ledge.  As he reaches for it with his other hand the bracket
	rips from the wall and Eric plummets, with a howl of defeat.

	UP ANGLE FROM STREET - ERIC'S DOWNFALL

	It's a looooooong way down.

	ANGLE - ALLEYWAY

	as Eric lands and splits a trash can in two.  A beat as we wonder
	if any bones are left unpulped.  PUSH IN as Eric rolls from
	facedown to his back.

	TIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE

	as he completes the roll, gasping, amazed he's still in one 
	piece.

	ANGLE - TRASHCAN - ON THE CROW

	It flies easily down to inspect Eric as he slowly sits up,
	examining his hands.  Frustrated and pissed off.

				ERIC
		Thanks.

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	Not "your welcome", but other-worldly patience.  It waits.

	RESUME ERIC

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Where're we going next -- the
		sewer?

	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Still, dark silence until Eric lands from ABOVE FRAME, feline.
	The crow lands simultaneously b.g., perched near a roof access
	door with a shaded, dim-yellow bulb.

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	It just blinks at him. 

	INT. ABANDONED STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	as Eric yanks open the rusty rooftop door from the outside and
	sweeps down the steps in a swirl of night mist

	ANGLE - FOOT OF STAIRS

	Trash and detritus all around, clogging the arteries of the
	building, which is old, unoccupied, forsaken.  The crow lights
	on a scarred banister knob.  Eric's footsteps come down into frame.

	ANGLE ON LOFT DOOR - INCLUDE ERIC

	A year ago this door was sealed with police barricade tape...
	which now sags, faded.

	A sticker across the jam notifies potential trespassers that
	this is -- was -- a crime scene.  Eric slows, stops, his hand
	on the banister.

	ANGLE - THE CROW

	as is wafts ahead of Eric, arriving at the door first.

	ANGLE ON ERIC, THE DOOR, THE CROW

	Eric has had enough.

				ERIC
		Are we finished yet?

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND ON BANISTER
	sliding along, as he speaks, until it hits a cigarette burn.

	PUSH IN ON ERIC - TIGHT

	stiffening as he suffers his second --

	FLASH:  IMAGES and DIALOG are not linked.  A rapidfire MONTAGE set
	in the loft, a year earlier (it is decorated for Halloween).
	The broken door.  The stairwell is filled with cops and cop 
	noise; lab guys bustle.  Albrecht is there, making notes as a
	DETECTIVE steps over to him.

				ALBRECHT
		Victim's name is Shelly Webster.
		The guy who got tossed is, uh ...--
			(checks his notebook)

	Albrecht grinds out his smoke on the banister.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC ON THE STAIRS.

	He sits down hard, hurting from the flash.  His eyes seek the 
	crow.  He completes Albrecht's line:

				ERIC
		"Draven, Eric."

	EXT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	LOW DOLLY of Elly's little combat boots moving toward the
	entryway of the pit.  MUSIC gradually UP LOUDER O.s. as she
	nears.

	ANGLE - ELLY IN DOORWAY

	Luridly-lit.  A grown-up's place.  A burly BOUNCER appraises
	her, his tone jokey.  He knows Elly.

				BOUNCER
		Hey!  You got any ID?

				ELLY
		Very funny.  Ha.  Ha.  Oh my,
		sides.

	The Bouncer jerks a thumb.  Go on in. 

	INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	A grungy sawdust-floored shot-and-beer joint packed tight
	with urban BURNOUTS rushing to drink their lives away.  Hammering
	MUSIC and rude whorehouse lighting.  Each predator straining to
	be badder than the next.

	TRACK THROUGH this maze at Elly's eye level until we reach 
	DARLA, waitressing her heart out, the drug mileage on her 
	obvious.

				ELLY
		Mom --?

				DARLA
		I told you you're not supposed
		to come in here.

				ELLY
			(a quick lie)
		I lost my key.

	Disgustedly -- goddamn kids -- Darla fishes up a key and slaps
	it into Elly's hand.

				FUNBOY (O.S.)
		Hey, Darla -- before we die of old
		age, how about it --?

				DARLA
			(to Elly)
		Out.  Now.  I gotta work.

	RACK PAST Darla and MOVE IN CLOSE on a corner table -- where sit
	Funboy, Skank, T-Bird and a black, vested muscle gypsy, TIN-TIN. 

	INT. LOFT - NIGHT

	As Eric shoves the door open from the outside.  The lock, popped
	from the frame, spins on the wooden floor.  The barrier tape
	whisps and dust roils.  Dark, chilly, damp.  A rat's nest of
	disuse.

	PULL BACK THROUGH THE BROKEN PICTURE WINDOW

	as Eric enters.  Glass blown out.  Shards poking.  Jagged.

	NEW ANGLE - AS ERIC WALKS IN

	He scans the loft.  Sees reflecting golden eyes near the floor.

	ERIC'S POV - FLOOR NEAR WINDOW

	A white, long-haired cat walks into a pool of night light.

	ANGLE - ERIC AND THE CAT

	He kneels.  Extends his hand.  The cat nears; likes Eric.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND.

	as the cat makes contact.  Sudden white jolt - a FLASH.

	FLASH:  we HEAR Eric strumming his Strat o.s.  We see what he
	saw:  Shelly, holding the cat.

							FLASH ENDS.

	UP ANGLE - ERIC

	Wincing.  Recovering from the flash.  He purposefully gathers
	the cat into his arms and braces for more, harder, stronger...

	FLASH:  A MAN and a WOMAN make love on a big bed amidst a hundred
	points of candlelight.  Shelly and Eric, once upon a time.

							FLASH ENDS.

	REVERSE ANGLE FROM BEDROOM DOOR - ON ERIC

	as the cat, dropped, hits the floor and scrambles out of the way.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	vising his head, teary-eyed, his nose bleeding.

				ERIC
		No!  Don't look!  No! No!

	He whirls unexpectedly and punches his fist completely through
	the masonry wall.
	FLASH:  Eric and Shelly in a mock waltz.  He spins her and they
	collapse on the bed.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	slowly pulling his arm out of the wall.

				ERIC
			(whispering)
		Stop it.

	His eyes roll up and he slumps the length of the door frame like
	a drowning man.

	ANGLE - GABRIEL

	watching Eric.  He hits with an o.s. THUD.

	INT. THE PIT - ON FUNBOY'S TABLE - NIGHT

	As a gloved hand sets up four bullets next to four shots.

				FUNBOY (O.S.)
		Let's have some fun.

	Funboy pops the bullet, like a contact capsule and washes it down.
	T-Bird turns to Tin-Tin, the new guy.

				T-BIRD	You first.

				TIN-TIN
		You're outta your fuckin' mind.

	Into it, almost jazzed, Tin-Tin downs his bullet and shot, and
	T-Bird does likewise.  Points to Skank.

				T-BIRD
		No.  I'm not the lunatic.  He is.

	Skank riles, pulls a huge Auto Mag and sticks it in T-Bird's
	face, cocking.

				SKANK
		Fuck you, T-Bird.

	Just as lightning fast, T-Bird has his own gun out and jammed
	right under Skank's jawbone.  He makes a kissy face.

				T-BIRD
		I love you too, you madman.

	They all crack up laughing like ax murderers.  Skank drinks,
	Tin-Tin spot checks the satchell from Top Dollar's.  Darla
	delivers more shots and funboy feels her ass.

				FUNBOY
		Hey, pussycat.

	INT. LOFT - DOWN ANGLE (CROW POV) - ERIC ON FLOOR

	He's awake.  Pushes himself up.

	REVERSE ANGLE - THE CROW

	Is perched in a dead light fixture, monitoring Eric.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON FLOOR

	He's awake.  Pushes himself up.  Realizes he is in the center of a 
	faint chalk outline on the hardwood floor.  He reaches to touch
	the dark stain of old blood.

	FLASH:  Shelly spills into frame, mouth bloodied.  T-Bird
	instantly on top of her, rough.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - WITH ERIC

	as he abandons the outline and staggers to the window... where
	he cuts open his hand on jags of glass.

	FLASH:  Eric held firm in the grasp of T-Bird and Funboy, one
	arm each.  Five bloody bullet holes in Eric's chest.

	The thugs 1-2-3 and hurl Eric backwards through the window,
	which shatters.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - ERIC AT THE WINDOW

	Reeling backward, same trajectory as in the Flash, but toward
	the floor, in SLO-MO.  Overloaded.  Blacking out.

	AS ERIC FALLS - INTERCUT MONTAGE

	A jumble of good/bad images from the loft:  Tin-Tin embedding a
	page of paper in the loft wall with a throwing knife...
	Shelly's face as she lights a candle... a POPPING champagne
	cork... the echoing CANNONADE of the shots that killed Eric...
	Skank backhanding Shelly... Shelly blowing bubbles from a
	clawfoot tub full of suds... Eric catching Funboy's first slug 
	high in the chest... NEW ANGLE of the glass in the window
	blowing out as T-Bird and Funboy through Eric through...

	ANGLE - ERIC'S REAL TIME FALL

	He plummets to BLACK OUT FRAME.  THUMP.  Out cold.

	INT. PIT - RESUMING FUNBOY'S TABLE - NIGHT

	Funboy contemplates his drink as the previous scene reverbs.

				FUNBOY
		More fun than a torture chamber.

	Tin-Tin's pocket pager goes BEEP and startles them all.  Skank
	nearly shoots it, jumpy.  Tin-Tin pulls back on a black leather 
	trenchcoat after clicking off the pager.

				TIN-TIN
		I hate this goddamn thing...

	ANGLE - DARLA watching them from a distance as Tin exits.

	INT. LOFT - FLOOR LEVEL - NIGHT

	An enormous cockroach trundles past, large in FRAME.  RACK to
	show Eric lying on floor b.g. as his eyes pop open.  A flurry of
	dark motion as the crow flies past frame.

	ANGLE -- THE CROW -- Having snatched the bug in it's beak.  Eats
	it.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	rising from the floor.  Careful.  Stealthy.  Watches his fireplace.

				ERIC
		We have company.

	ANGLE ON FIREPLACE

	Huge.  Marble.  COld.  Eric's paper mache masks of Comedy and
	Tragedy still hang there.  The Skull Cowboy steps out of the
	dark and into the vague blue light.  Shadowy as ever.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Having fun yet?  No?
			(beat)
		I'll give you a hint.  Remember
		whatshername?

				ERIC
		Shelly?

				SKULL COWBOY
		Miss her?

				ERIC
		Yes.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Kill the men who killed you both,
		and the Day of the Dead will be
		your reunion.

	The Skull Cowboy prestidigitates a flat throwing knife(like Tin-
	Tin's).  Eric's gaze follow it closely.

				SKULL COWBOY (CONT'D)
		You must use your eyes.

	He points to the crow.

	ANGLE - THE COMING KNIFE - ("CROWVISION")

	Weirdly distorted, a shared vision between Eric and the crow.

	TIGHT ON ERIC

	As he DUCKS out of the path of the knife he sees through the
	bird's eyes.  He rolls.

	ON THE CROW

	It hops out of the way as the knife embeds in the wall.  Eric's
	ROLL finishes him up nearby.

				ERIC
		Goddammit.

	He grabs for the knife as if to use it on the Skull Cowboy, but
	the knife causes an unexpected painful FLASH.

	FLASH:  Eric bouncing off the bedroom doorframe, Tin-Tin's knife
	stuck in his shoulder.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC

	vising his head with his hands, in pain.  Too much pain.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Get it?

				ERIC
		Leave me alone -- !

	He looks up, the Skull Cowboy is still there.

				SKULL COWBOY
			(contempt)
		Do something about it.
	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND THE SKULL COWBOY.

	A horrible beat between them.  The Eric runs full tilt across
	the room, bounding to the open window and then leaping.

	ANGLE - SKULL COWBOY

	as close to surprise as he gets.  Steps out to watch as --

	ANGLE ON WINDOW - ERIC

	FLIES feet first out into space.

	CLOSE-UP - BRICKWORK ABOVE WINDOWFRAME

	Eric's fingers smash into grip the tiny mortared gaps!

	EXT. LOFT BUILDING - UP ANGLE FROM STREET - NIGHT

	High above, Eric's feet shoot out the window, knocking loose
	stray shards that fall toward frame.  He swings into an upside-
	down pose, impossibly holding himself rigid against the
	building's side, face down. by his quarter-inch finger grip.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	Every muscle rigid, quivering with tension.  Hold.  Then he
	relaxes, and swings back inside.

	INT. LOFT - AT WINDOW, PICKING UP ERIC - NIGHT

	He arches, flips, to land on his feet.  The Skull Cowboy is
	gone.  No knife either.  The crow watches.  O.S. "meow".

	ANGLE - WITH ERIC AS HE TURNS TO SEE THE CAT

				ERIC
		I guess I'm not ready to leave...
		just yet.

	He picks up the cat -- wary of flashes, which don't come this
	time -- and returns to the window.  Feeling safer.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		The last time we saw each other,
		I didn't do so well.
			(holds cat up)
		Huh, Gabriel?

	He moves to the fireplace.  With his free hand, lifts the
	Tragedy mask off its hook.  Puzzles it, fact-to-mask.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I bet you need some cat food...
		right?

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT -ESTABLISHING:

	Eric walking, the Tragedy mask hanging from his hip.  An
	occasional PEDESTRIAN passes without comment, brutalized
	by the city.  Eric, more confident, smells the night's bouquet.

	EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT ("CROWVISION")

	Two men around a trashcan fire.  We should recognize Tin-Tin by 
	his black leather trench coat.  A wonderfully rude Rap tune, "Got
	a White WOman Tied Up In My Closet, Gonna Jab Her With A Stick,"
	RAZZLES b.g.

	EXT. STREET - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

	As Eric reacts to what the crow has just seen.  Slows.  Stops.
	And directs his attention toward the mouth of the alley.

	EXT. ALLEY - TIGHT ON TIN-TIN - NIGHT

	He pulls the nickel plated revolver from the satchel.  FOLLOW as
	he hands it across to RATSO, who removes the suitcase-sized boom 
	box (the source of the music) from his shoulder to accept.
	Ratso is a feral skull-head; street trash.

				TIN-TIN
		Three hundred and your a 
		gunslinger.

	HIGH ANGLE - TIN-TIN and RATSO

	As the crow is still watching, yet perched.  A brief
	shove-and-standoff.  The gun deal has gone bad.

				RATSO
		Please, TIn-Tin, you know I'm good
		for the money, man, I promise,
		Leslie put me up to it, please,
		man, don't --
			(choking scream)

	Tin-Tin has just up-rammed a throwing knife into Ratso.

				TIN-TIN
		Ratty -- shut the fuck up.

	Tin-Tin lifts Ratso on the knife, gutting him.  Ratso goes
	slack, deader'n hell.  Tin-Tin reaches around to click OFF 
	the boom box... then let's Ratso`s corpse fall.

				ERIC (O.S.)
		Another satisfied customer?

	TIGHT ANGLE - TIN-TIN

	galvanized by the surprise voice.  He automatically draw a
	fresh knife from the bandolero of knives across his chest inside
	the coat.  Can't yet track the source of the voice.

				TIN-TIN
		Who the hell is that?
			(beat, venomous)
		Come on out man, I won't hurt
		you.

	ANGLE - ERIC IN ALLEY

	He steps out from behind another flaming trashcan.  Wearing a 
	long black scarf and the Tragedy mask.

				ERIC
		Hello, Tin-Tin.

	ANGLE ON TIN-TIN - AS HE RISES (FROM RATSO)

	trying to process what he sees.  And cover.  And buy time.

				TIN-TIN
		Little early from trick-or-treat,
		homie.
			(re: Ratso)
		This dick trying to bushwack me.

				ERIC
		Murderer.

	Tin-Tin blows out a breath.  No bluff.  Time to kill again.

				TIN-TIN
		Guess you got that goddamn right.

	He shrugs.  The shrug becomes the launch of a knife.

	TIGHT SHOT - MOVING - ERIC

	His black-gloved hand slaps away the incoming knife and inch from
	his nose.  It CLATTERS.  Eric continues striding toward Tin-TIn.

				ERIC
		Try harder.  Try again.

	SHIFTING ANGLE - ERIC NEARS TIN-TIN

	as Tin-TIn throws another knife.  Eric closing in.  He claps
	hand together, immobilizing the next knife.  Opens his hands,
	almost an "oops" gesture.  Keeps on coming.

	ANGLE - ERIC AND TIN-TIN

	As they meet.  Tin-Tin attempts a roundhouse.  Eric blocks it
	and smashes Tin-Tin into the alley wall.

				ERIC
		A year ago.  Halloween.  A man
		and a woman.  In a loft.  You
		helped to murder them.

				TIN-TIN
		Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...
			(beat)
		Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her
		too, I think.

				ERIC
		You cut her.  You raped her.
			(rage)
		You watched!

				TIN-TIN
		Hey, I got my rocks off, so
		fuck you in the ass, man.
		
	They're face-to-face now, sweaty and tense.  Eric peels off
	the Tragedy mask.

				ERIC
		I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.

				TIN-TIN
		I don't know you...

	But, as Eric bears down on Tin-TIn, Tin begins to recognize him.
	Fear.  Sweat.

	For the first time, Tin-Tin starts to loose control.

				TIN-TIN (CONT'D)
		Holy shit... you're dead, man...

	EXTREME CLOSE-UP - ERIC

				ERIC
		Victims.  Aren't we all.

	INT. LOFT - NIGHT

	TIGHT ANGLE - TABLETOP

	as Eric's hands place Ratso's boom box on the table and click on 
	suitable weird b.g. MUSIC.

	ANGLE - FLOOR LEVEL

	Eric's boots pass frame.  An open can of cat food CLANKS down
	big in f.g.  as Eric walks b.g. obviously wearing Tin-Tin's 
	trenchcoat.  Gabriel noses into to frame to eat from the can.

	INT. LOFT, BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

	Shelly's vanity.  Dusty, disused.  The mirror spiderwebbed with
	cracks but still hanging precariously in its frame.  Eric is 
	seated, his image crazily split into many.  He pulls on a long-
	sleeved, tight-knit, black shirt.

	WIDEN ANGLE to reveal the loft now lit with dozens of candle
	stubs.  Placed all around.  Ceremonial and weird.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

				ERIC
		Halloween is coming.  The Day of the Dead...

	In the mirror, multi Eric's.  He touches the glass, tightening up 
	as he realizes he's in for another --

	FLASH:  Shelly, sleeping on her divan, a year ago, wakes as Eric
	(O.S.) says "Boo".  She cracks an eye open.

				SHELLY
		Your scary quotient needs work.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AT VANITY

	Considering old cosmetics.  Everything he touches will hurt him.
	But he's ready to eat this pain.  He grabs a lipstick.

	FLASH:  Shelly at the vanity in happier times

				SHELLY
		I think red's my color, don't you?

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC

	wincing.  He drops the lipstick on the floor.  Grabs a
	hairbrush.

	FLASH:  Eric smashes into the street after his death-fall,
	trailing broken glass.

							FLASH ENDS.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC AT VANITY

	Later.  He's wearing white pancake makeup on his cheeks.  Shaky.

	FLASH:  Eric sucks up Funboy's gunshots in the chest.  1-2-3-4.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUMING ERIC AT VANITY

	his face a crazy warpaint maze of white streaks, not blended
	yet.  He looks at his own reflection.  In one cracked,
	triangular facet of the mirror is not a multiple of his face,
	but the Skull Cowboy.  Just one.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Glad to see you're finally with
		the program.

				ERIC
		Bugger off to the graveyard, skull-
		face, I'm busy.

				SKULL COWBOY
		You work for the dead.  Forget
		that, and you can forget it all.

	The Cowboy tips his hat and isn't there.  Eric sees the crow
	perched on the edge of the mirror now.

				ERIC
		Forget this.

	He smears the streaks until his face is uniformly grave-wave
	white.

	ANGLE - GABRIEL THE CAT

	coming in to sniff around the clutter at the foot of the vanity.
	Eric looks down towards him... and toward the lipstick he dropped.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND

	as it glides down to pick up the lipstick.  CONTACT, and --

	FLASH:  Eric, smashed on the street, T-Bird's car b.g., upside down
	in Eric's POV as he rolls over and blood courses from both
	corners of his mouth,  a definite foreshadow of the "Crow" face.

							FLASH ENDS.
	RESUMING ERIC AT VANITY - TIGHT

				ERIC
		She always red red was her color.

	EXTREME CLOSE - THE MIRROR

	We see only a reflected corner of Eric's mouth as he duplicates
	the blood trail in red lipstick, making one one half of a crow
	harlequin smile.

	EXT. LOFT BUILDING - LATER - NIGHT

	A MEDIUM SHOT as lightning strikes; a storm brews.

	EXT. LOFT - LATER - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S BOOTS

	crossing the floor.  Tin-Tin's knife slotted to the bucklework.

	CLOSE-UP - VANITY

	Eric's hands discard a hairbrush there.  He moves off.

	CLOSE-UP - GABRIEL

	looking up o.s., watching his master stalk around with purpose.
	Thunder rumbles long o.s.

	ANGLE - AT ERIC IN WINDOW FROM OUTSIDE

	The storm boils.  Eric framed in broken window.

	CLOSER ANGLE - ERIC IN WINDOW

	Eric all in black,  Firm-wrapped.  Tight-wired.  The trenchcoat
	flutters, cloak-like.  His shadowy face framed by the upturned
	collar, his hair punkish and spiky.

	SIDE ANGLE - ERIC

	as he moves forward in the light.  The crow lights on his shoulder.

				ERIC
		All right, bad guys...

	FRONT VIEW - ERIC

	Full crow regalia.  Face makeup streamlined.  Eric's eyes flash.

				ERIC
			(in drawn out yell)
		Here I commme -- !

	PULL BACK swiftly, vertiginously, as Eric swan dives from the
	window, his voice a howl.

	UP ANGLE FROM STREET - ERIC'S FALL

	Coat, wing-like.  MATCH his dive yell with o.s. crow SCREECH.
	SLOW MOTION as Eric fills the frame and we --

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. ALLEY - WHERE TIN-TIN GOT IT - NIGHT

	Cop lights bounce, competing with the trash fires.  Albrecht and
	several other UNIFORMS assess the double-death scene.  A
	detective, TORRES tries to appear in charge.

				TORRES
		Couldn't have happened to a nicer 
		couple.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND TORRES OVER DEAD TIN-TIN

	Tin-Tin frozen in deathshock, all of his knives sticking out of 
	him.  Dead Ratso, b.g., where he fell.

				ALBRECHT
		Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not
		here, neither is T-Bird -- none
		of Top Dollar's number ones.

				TORRES
		You know, you sure got a hard-on for
		a guy that's guilty of zip on
		paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime;
		what's the matter, don't you like
		adult entertainment?

				ALBRECHT
		This sack of shit is called Tin-
		Tin.

				TORRES
		Don't any of your little pals have
		real, grown up names?

				ALBRECHT
		He was a runner for Top Dollar.
		Just muscle.

				TORRES
		Was.
				ALBRECHT
			(sigh)
		This isn't Top Dollar's style
		anyway.  This was somebody else.
		Somebody new.

	Albrecht lights a fresh smoke.  Torres waves the smoke away.

				TORRES
		And you're gonna tell me who.

				ALBRECHT
		Who ever made that.

	Albrecht points.  CAMERA FOLLOWS to wall behind Tin-Tin.  A crow
	silhouette has been daubed in blood there, now dry.

				TORRES
		What in the hell... do you
		call that?

				ALBRECHT
		I call it blood, Detective.  If
		you want, you can call it graffiti.

	INT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP of Gideon's thick fingers shuffling grimy currency.
	Some scratchy 1920's TUNE plays throughout b.g., like a broadcast
	from another time and place.

	TIGHTER ANGLE - GIDEON

	looking up at a metallic SOUND, o.s.  Irritated.

				GIDEON
		Piss off, we're closed.

	As the outside security gate rattles, Gideon draws his magnum
	and approaches the front door.

				GIDEON
		Fucking creatures of the night;
		they never goddamn learn.

	Sudden surprise as he sees the silhouette of the gate SCREE back
	against the frosted glass of the front door.

				GIDEON (CONT'D)
		HEY!!

	And he hustles to close up the distance between himself and the
	door, gun up.  Before he can touch the door, the crowbar comes
	rocketing through the glass, pegging Gideon in the forehead and 
	knocking him flat on his ass.  He loses the pistol.
	Eric walks through the door, causing the fractured glass to
	disintegrate around him.  He disclaims, thespian.

				ERIC
		"Suddenly I heard a tapping, as of
		someone gently rapping, rapping at
		my chamber door."
			(pause)
		You heard me rapping, right?

	LOW ANGLE - GIDEON ON THE FLOOR

	reacting to Eric's weird appearance and looking for his gun.

				GIDEON
		Oh, bullshit!  You're trespassing
		asshole, you're breakin'
		and enterin' and you just bought me a
		fucking door!

	During Gideon's rant, Eric brushes glass cubes from his
	shoulders, nonplussed.  Now he flings Gideon across the room.

	Gideon crashes into the counter cage.  As Eric advances on him:

				ERIC
		I'm looking for something in an
		engagement ring.  Gold.

	As Eric comes up behind him, Gideon reaches through the open
	cage door and pulls a big combat knife from beneath the counter.

				GIDEON
		You're looking for a coroner,shit-
		for-brains!

	And he tries to nail Eric with the knife.

	NEW ANGLE - BEHIND GIDEON - AS GIDEON SWINGS

	No Eric behind him.  TILT to reveal Eric hanging off the cage
	above Gideon.  Eric slams the cage door against Gideon's head.
	Drops down like a spider and collects the knife.

				ERIC
		I repeat: a gold engagement ring.
		It was pawned here, a year ago, by
		another gentleman whose name, I
		believe was... "T-Bird"?

	IN TIGHT ON ERIC AND GIDEON

	Eric twists Gideon's sail-like shirt and Gideon turns bright red.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Cute nickname, don't you think?

				GIDEON
			(gasping)
		I ain't got no fuckin' ring.

				ERIC
		Wrong answer.

	Eric nails Gideon's hand to the counter top.  Gideon howls!

				GIDEON
		All's I got is in a box!  Behind
		the counter!

	Eric jumps through the cage door.  Gideon's eyes bug as he sees 
	his own pierced hand, immobilized.

	ANGLE - ON ERIC BEHIND THE COUNTER

	scans the shelves.  Rows of boxed ammo.  Kerosene tins.  A shotgun.  
	Knives and assorted knuckle duster curios.  And the ring box.

	CLOSE-UP - THE RING BOX IN ERIC'S HAND.

	Dozens of gold rings.  Eric's fingers sift through them.

	TIGHTER ON ERIC

	He brings each ring to his face.  INTERCUT with Gideon's feeble
	struggles and invective, o.s.

				ERIC
		No... no... no... no...

	He tosses each rejected ring over his shoulder.  Until:

	CLOSE-UP - THE RING IN ERIC'S HAND

	Obliterated by a stab of brilliant white light --

	FLASH:  Shelly's face.  A perfect vision...

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUMING ERIC

	He closes his fist tightly around the ring.  A moment of
	decision.  Then he draws the shotgun from beneath the counter.
	Uses the butt to knock the knife free of Gideon's hand.  It goes
	spinning across the countertop.  Eric shucks the shotgun and
	rams it into Gideon's nose as the big man slumps to the floor.

				ERIC
		Tin-Tin confided in me, before he
		ran out of breath.  You have one
		chance to live.
				GIDEON
		No fucking way.  He'll kill me.

				ERIC
		Who would waste time killing you...
		besides me?

	Gideon sweats, pants, contemplates the hole in his hand.

				GIDEON
			(cowed)
		Top Dollar.

				ERIC
		Another jolly nickname?

				GIDEON
		You want those assholes, you want 
		Top Dollar.

				ERIC
		T-Bird?

				GIDEON
		Like the car.  He hangs out with
		Skank. that little ass-hair, and
		they hang at the Pit -- hell,
		Funboy lives there.  Ask Top
		Dollar.

				ERIC
		A whole club of pirates, with
		pirate names...

	Eric seems to go berserk, SMASHING and PUNCTURING cans of
	flammables and powder while Gideon flinches, nursing his holed
	hand.  Blows just miss Gideon's head.  Soon he's cowering.

	LOW ANGLE - ERIC

	Looking down at Gideon in revulsion.

				ERIC
		You feed off the living.

	SMASH!  as another tin ceases to exist next to Gideon.  Then
	Eric is gone, past him without further word, ignoring him
	entirely.  As he exits, shotgun shouldered, he pauses to admire
	a white Fender Strat hanging among the pawnables.  He reaches 
	for it.

	ON GIDEON

	As he summons some last minute budget bravery.

				GIDEON
		You walk outta here Top Dollar
		will erase your ass!  Top Dollar
		owns the fucking street here and
		you can't dick with me, you son of
		a bitch! 

	RESUME ERIC - FRAMED IN DOORWAY

	The guitar now bowslung across his back, the shotgun levelled at
	Gideon's position.

				ERIC
		One chance to live.  Take it.

	MOVE IN TIGHT ON GIDEON

	as he realizes what Eric means.  Hauls ass and bangs through the
	rear door with a bleat of terror.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC IN DOOR  

	as he cuts loose with the shotgun.

	EXT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	as seen from across the street.  Eric silhouetted, unmoving as
	the whole store front blows hellaciously out around him, raining
	glass and debris.  Stirring his hair.  Eric is the black eye of
	the fireball.

	LOW ANGLE - FRONT OF PAWN SHOP - EMPHASIZE ERIC

	lit by flames and residual explosions.  He hurls the shotgun
	into the inferno.  Casually brushes flaming/smoking detritus
	from his own clothes.

				ALBRECHT (O.S.)
		Don't move! I said don't move.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC

	as he turns slowly, to see Albrecht, out of reach, gun drawn.
	Eric's attitude lightens; Albrecht is not the threat here.

				ERIC
		I thought the police always said
		"freeze:.

	Albrecht divides his attention, jumpy, between the odd sight of
	Eric (guitar on his back), and the raging instant inferno of
	Gideon's.

				ALBRECHT
		I'm the police and I say don't
		move, Snow White.  You're under
		arrest; I don't care what else is 
		wrong with you!  You move and
		you're dead.

	Eric has begun to pace towards Albrecht.  Palms up.  A gesture of
	submission.  Albrecht's battle calm begins to waiver.

				ERIC
		And I say I'm dead... and I move.

				ALBRECHT
		No further.  I'm serious.

	Eric bows, bringing his forehead in line with the gun's muzzle.

				ERIC
		Then shoot, if you will.

	TIGHT ANGLE - ALBRECHT

	He gives it up.  Can't shoot.  This is too weird for him.

				ALBRECHT
		Are you nuts, walking into a gun?

	NEW ANGLE - LESS THREATENING - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

				ERIC
		You must listen carefully:  the 
		Fire Department will be here soon.
		There is an injured man in the 
		alley who needs assistance.
			(meaningfully)
		As Shelly Webster once needed your 
		assistance, and as you are shortly 
		going to need my assistance.

	Albrecht gestures casually, almost comically, with his pointed
	gun.  B.g., the crow lands on a fire escape to monitor them.

				ALBRECHT
		You wanna run that back for me one
		time?

	SIRENS near, o.s.  Eric listens to them, to the night.

				ERIC
		Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the
		street here."  He will "erase
		my ass."

				ALBRECHT
		You don't say.

				ERIC
		I know Top Dollar has turned your 
		streets into his hell.

				ALBRECHT
		Fucking A, my friend.

				ERIC
		The others are called Skank, T-
		Bird.  Street names.  Funboy.
			(beat)
		Watch me, office Albrecht.

	Eric lifts a chunk of glass from the sidewalk.  Slow and easy.
	Albrecht doesn't completely trust him.  Up comes the gun.

				ALBRECHT
		Watch it...

	Eric slices open his palm.  Blood flows.  To his fingertips.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

	as Eric quickly daubs a crow silhouette in blood on the wall...
	then exhibits the gashed hand to Albrecht.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND

	as the blood retreats and the wound seals itself up.

	TIGHT ON ALBRECHT

	and the silhouette.  Mouth hangs.

				ALBRECHT
		You're the one who did Tin-Tin...

	PULL BACK FAST to reveal Eric is gone from the frame.  Albrecht does
	a quick 180.  No Eric.  Flashbars from incoming units begin
	to bounce red and blue off his face.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Great.  Good night.  Guy shows up
		looking like a mime from hell.
			(beat)
		Least he didn't do that "walking
		against the wind" shit;  I hate
		that.

	EXT. SHOWTIME - NIGHT - TO ESTABLISH.

	A night-owl pornucopia.  T-Bird enters beneath a garish theater
	marquee.  The 2-bill:  RUMP ROMP with BUTTBUSTERS II.

	INT. SHOWTIME LOBBY - NIGHT

	T-Bird approaches the snack bar.  Wet, breathy mating NOISES
	from the auditorium throughout, o.s.  Looking supremely bored,
	the counterman, DICKEY BIRD, thumbs a porn tabloid.  So what.

				DICKEY BIRD
		T-Bird.  Thrill me.

				T-BIRD
		Business.

	T-bird heads left through s steal door that Dickie buzzes
	open for him.

	INT.  SHOWTIME AUDITORIUM (BACKSTAGE) - NIGHT

	T-Bird walks past dust-covered boxy black speakers as we glimpse
	Lance and Angelique making history in reverse, on the back of the 
	movie screen: oratoria as good as porn films can make it.

				PORN QUEEN (O.S.)
		I don't know how to describe how
		I feel, Lance -- so restless --

				PORN KING (O.S.)
		You're my Moon Queen, Angelique.

				PORN QUEEN (o.S.)
		Oooh -- I want you're rocket right
		now in my Sea of Tranquility -- 
		Lance --

	ANGLE - CATWALK STAIRS

	As T-Bird approaches, the movie sounds dwindle o.s.  He ascends
	the skinny metal stairway two steps at a time.

	ANGLE - STEEL FACED DOOR AT TOP OF STAIRS.

	As T-Bird nears it, a viewplate SNAPS open to asses him.  By
	the time he reaches the top, the door unbolts to admit him.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	As T-Bird enters.  The room is organized around a long meeting
	table and flavored with a taste of everything illegal:  drug
	paraphernalia, weapons.

	Across the table are a couple of Sentries like the one that
	admits T-Bird to the room.  TRACK PAST them to a lank-haired
	silhouette as he turns away from a windowshade, backlit by
	Showtime's exterior neon.

	This is TOP DOLLAR.  Who looks like a Johnny Winter acid 
	casualty but is deadly cold, definitely the man in charge.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Wild fucking night.  I hear our
		pal Tin-Tin got himself very dead.

				T-BIRD
		And Gideon's just burned all the
		down to the foundation.

	Top's eyebrows go up.  Oh really?

				T-BIRD (CONT'D) 
		I didn't have nothin to do with
		that.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Bet that pisses you off, right?

				T-BIRD
		Top, what the fuck is going on
		tonight?

				TOP DOLLAR
		Stay normal, T.  Cops'll be all
		hotwired and aggressive.  No
		combat moves until I check this
		out.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT - (~CROWVISION") HIGH ANGLE

	Taking in the street, the Pit, and a little girl seated on an
	abandoned car.

	ANGLE - STREET LEVEL - ON ELLY.

	Seated on the looted wheelless car, playing with a small doll.

	CLOSER ANGLE - ON ELLY

	She doesn't notice someone is watching her yet.

	TIGHT ON DOLL, THEN ELLY

	She looks up o.s. at Eric, who is still out of the frame.

				ELLY
		What are you supposed to be?  A clown?

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	He smiles for what seems to be the first time.  Warm, even past
	his crow makeup.

				ERIC
		Sometimes.

	He glances back and logs the location of the Pit for later, not
	in a big hurry just now.  Turns back to Elly.

	WIDE ANGLE - ERIC AND ELLY

				ELLY
		You look like a rock star without a
		job.

				ERIC
		I dabble.  May I?

	He indicates the car hood, a "seat" next to Elly from which he
	may observe the Pit.

				ELLY
		If you're not some kinda child 
		molester.

	Eric looks behind himself.  Who, me?  Genuinely amused.  He 
	shakes his head no and sits down next to Elly. 

	INT. CLUB TRASH - NIGHT

	The music POUNDS and smoke is everywhere, like incense.
	INTERCUTS of the clientele, retro, robotic, clove cigarettes and
	rubber clothing; fetish casual wear.

	ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR

	right in the center of the noise, looking downscale and dirty
	in this milieu.

	ANGLE - ANOTHER CUSTOMER

	Passing Top, appraising him, finding him as boring as life
	itself.  Undertaker chic, she stares at Top.

				TOP DOLLAR
		I thought Halloween was tomorrow
		night.

	An Oriental bodyguard passes him in f.g., motioning to follow.

	INT. LAO'S NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

	Lao watches club activity on his flybank of TVs.  When Top
	Dollar shows up at the office door two Sentries try to bar his 
	passage.  He shoves through.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Get outta my way, you mooks.

	Lao's demeanor indicates that they should not kill Top.

				LAO
		An unexpected pleasure.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Bad news.  Alot of action on the
		streets tonight, and nobody
		bothered to clear it with me.  Tin-
		Tin got himself whacked.

				LAO
		Who got himself what?

				TOP DOLLAR
		One of mine.  And it wasn't a 
		standard hit.

				LAO
		I had heard something like this.
			(beat)
		Describe it for me.  The "hit".

				TOP DOLLAR
		I was wondering if you could tell
		me anything... about a wildcat
		operative.

				LAO
		I know of no one.
			(beat)
		But even if there is, I am sure it
		is nothing outside your capacity 
		to deal with?

				TOP DOLLAR
		Anybody violates my turf -- our 
		turf -- I'll rip out there heart 
		and show it to 'em.

				LAO
		To be sure.  Now tell how your 
		friend died.

	INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - NIGHT

	ANNABELLA, a comfortable large, spider-in-the-web deskworker,
	sits typing at a terminal.  Miked headphone in one ear, police
	scanner chatter o.s.  She blows and pops a pink bubble of gum.

				ALBRECHT (O.S.)
		Annie?

	ANGLE - ANNABELLA AND ALBRECHT

	Albrecht enters frame from across her countertop.

				ANNABELLA
		Whatever it is, the answer's no,
		Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.

				ALBRECHT
		Annie, I need a file.

	There is a desperate edge to Albrecht's voice.

				ANNABELLA
		Speak up.
			(beat; her guard up)
		Clear it with the Captain if you
		need a file.

				ALBRECHT
		This is special, darlin'.  Please?

	Annabella eyes Albrecht doubtfully.  Fatalistic sigh.

				ANNABELLA
		Just don't tell me you "owe me
		one."  What file?

				ALBRECHT
		Double homicide.  A year ago.
		Las Halloween.

	EXT. STREET NEAR THE PIT - ERIC AND ELLY - NIGHT

	Still hanging by the car, a bit more familiar with each other
	now.  A low-slung mirror-windowed LIMOUSINE hisses past them and
	curbs across the street from the Pit.

				ELLY
		My mom works over there.  I'm
		waiting for her, but she's
		probably with him, right now.

				ERIC
		Who?
				
				ELLY
		Mister Funboy.

				ERIC
		Mister Funboy lives there?

	TWO SHOT - ELLY AND ERIC - (PIT B.G.)

				ELLY
		He has a room, upstairs.  I don't
		like him very much.

	Elly is not happy about this.  B.G. we see Grange get out of the 
	car, heading to the Pit, and notice in passing a guy with the
	white face talking to the little girl down on the block.

				ELLY (CONT'D)
		Can you play that thing or do you
		just carry it around everywhere?

	Elly indicates the guitar strapped to Eric' back.

				ERIC
		I can pick out a tune now 
		and again.

				ELLY
		Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"
			(re: doll)
		It used to be her favorite.

				ERIC
		Does she have a name?

				ELLY
		No name.  You sure ask a lot of
		questions.

	Elly HANDS the doll to Eric and he experiences a wholly 
	unexpected flash.

	FLASH:  Elly and SHelly sitting as SHelly's vanity, goofing with
	makeup, test-driving lipstick, the doll visible on the vanity.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC - AS THE DOLL DROPS FROM HIS HAND

	Pain is trying to fight it's way out of Eric in surges. 

				ELLY (OS)
			(smart alec)
		Hel-lo?  Earth to anybody...?

	Eric snaps out of it.  Elly retrieves the doll.

				ELLY (CONT'D)
		Do you feel okay.

				ERIC
		No.

				ELLY
		You gotta go now, I bet.

				ERIC
		I have to go.

	Half-zomboid, half-determined, he exits.

	INT. PIT - NIGHT - WITH GRANGE

	As he circulates to the bar, unimpressed.  To the bouncer:

				GRANGE
		Top Dollar?

				BOUNCE
		Never heard of him.

				GRANGE
		Funboy?

				BOUNCER
		Oh, prob'ly upstairs bangin'
		Darla.  Pay for your own beer and
		they'll prob'ly be down before you 
		can drink it.

	INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP of an 8x10 of the loft slaughter in Albrecht's hands.
	Subject: a document pinned to the wall with a knife.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AT DESK.

	flipping through the file. Smoking.

	ANGLE - THE 8X10 IN ALBRECHT'S HAND

	Subject: Eric, dead in the street in front of the loft 
	building.  The blood on his face reminiscent of his crow face.

	As Albrecht's hand moves the photo we can see in the file
	several band shots of Eric as a member of Diabolique... 
	including the shot on Lao's wall gallery of past performers at
	Club Trash.

	A DOUGHUT on a paper plate suddenly touches down in the middle
	of all this research, startling Albrecht.

	ANGLE - ANNABELLA BEHIND HIM

				ANNABELLA
		Don't thank me.  Your ass is
		already in enough trouble for this shit.

				ALBRECHT
		I knew that.

	Albrecht holds a typewritten page closer to the the light.

	CLOSE-UP DOCUMENT, torn by the knife hole made by Tin-Tin.

	It reads:  We, the Undersigned tenants of 1929 Calderone Court
	Apartments...

				ALBRECHT
		Another nice white girl with a
		cause.  Like a big KICK ME sign.

	Albrecht takes up and 8x10 of Eric's face.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Shelly Webster.  And her nice 
		white boyfriend, Eric Draven.

	With a felt-tip pen he superimposes the crow smile, like the make-
	up, like the blood.

				ANNABELLA
		Your last little wild goose chase
		got you busted back to the Beat 
		Patrol, just like in a bad
		detective story, Eddie. Are we
		doing the wildgoose thing again?

	UNDER THIS Albrecht sketches in Eric's spiky Crow hairdo.

				ALBRECHT
		Could be.

				ANNABELLA
		You gonna wind up working at a school
		crosswalk.   that doughnut's 
		chocolate you, know.

	PUSH IN on the doctored photo.  It's Eric.  It's the Crow.

	PUSH IN on ALbrecht.

				ALBRECHT
		Well, hello there...chocolate,

				ANNABELLA
		Don't thank me.

				ALBRECHT
		Thanks, babe.

	INT. THE PIT (REAR) - ERIC ON FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

	Climbing.  The crow perched on his shoulder.  Not in a hurry.

				ERIC
		It's a Raymond Chandler evening
		And the pavements are all wet, And
		I'm lurking in the shadows, for it 
		hasn't happened ...

	TIGHT CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	Impish.  Clown killer.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		... yet.

	INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	Grange at a table.  SMoking and waiting.  No beer.  His back
	protected, he is stationed near the fire stair door and has a
	good overview of the room.

	INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP of a base pipe being lit and hit hard.

	EXT. THE PIT (REAR) - FIRE ESCAPE - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

	Eric's gloved hand slides sinuously up rusted railing.

	INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	A hypodermic needle rises into frame.  A nicotined fingernail
	flicks bubbles in the syringe.  FOLLOW needle down and BROADEN
	ANGLE: Funboy taps up a vein in Darla's arm and shoots her up.
	Both are naked in a shabby bed.  Bare lightbulb above.

				DARLA
		Ooh, baby -- gimme all of it.

	CLOSE-UP - THE NEEDLE

	As the plunger depresses.

	ANGLE - ON THE WINDOW

	As the crow quite unexpectedly arrives and perches on the sill,
	scaring the shit out of our two dopey friends.  Funboy pulls a
	giant auto pistol; mock aims, calms down, doesn't fire.

				DARLA
		It's a big fucking bird...

	She falls back against her pillow, eyes dreamily defocusing.
	Funboy giggles.  Relaxes the gun, which half-disappears into the 
	sheets at his side.

				FUNBOY
		It's a squab.  Here bird, Here,
		birdie...

	NEW ANGLE - DARLA AND FUNBOY

	Except that Eric now stands near their bed, across from the 
	bird's position, the guitar bowslung.

				ERIC
		Here Funboy.

	Contained panic as Funboy and Darla both startle.  The needle 
	flies and lands at Eric's feet.  Empty.  Funboy struggles to
	maintain against his high.

				FUNBOY
		Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do
		that, man.  I nearly had a fucking
		heart attack.

				DARLA
		Fun -- look at that guy...

				FUNBOY
		It's just the dope, don't worry

				DARLA
		Fun, he's not going away; he's 
		scaring the piss outta me!

				FUNBOY
		Not me.

	Funboy draws the gun from underneath the sheers.  Suddenly he seems
	totally focused.

				FUNBOY (CONT'D)
		Time for you to take your bird and 
		leave, freako.

	Eric rips open his shirtfront to reveal a circlet of bullet
	punctures.  This gives Funboy pause.
				ERIC
		Take your shot funboy.  You got 
		me, dead bang.

	Funboy tilts the gun off target.  Grins as Eric flat handedly
	past his chest, indicating where to shoot.

				FUNBOY
		You are seriously fucked up, man.
		Just look at yourself.

	In a blur, he sighs, and shoots Eric through the heart.

				FUNBOY (CONT'D)
		BANG!  He shoots, he scores!

	Then his expression drags a little bit.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	Looking down and daubing his hand in the bullet wound on his chest.

				ERIC
		Bull's eye.  Good shot.

	ANGLE - DARLA

	who starts scrambling to get out.  Grabbing clothes on the floor
	around herself. she runs right into Eric's outstretched hands.

				ERIC
		Stay.

	Eric twists her arm.

	CLOSE-UP - DARLA'S FOREARM.

	where we may clearly see the needle tracks.  

	UP ANGLE - ERIC 

				ERIC
		Morphine is bad for you.

	He holds her arm captive.  Tight, and we PUSH IN CLOSER to see
	the dope evacuating from the punctures, a reverse of Eric's,
	Blood trail.  The dope drips from Darla's arm to the floor.
	Darla's eyes roll up into the unconscious.  She slumps.

	ANGLE - ON FUNBOY - GAWPING

				FUNBOY
		How the hell did you do that?
		
				ERIC
		Magic.

	Funboy regards Eric's battlescars and guitar.

				FUNBOY
		Either die or do a solo.

	Eric looks briefly to his chest wound, wincing.  He can't seem
	to make it tie off fast enough.  He turns his attention back to
	Funboy.  But his strength is mysteriously ebbing.

				ERIC
		Neither.

				FUNBOY
		Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.

	Funboy lashes out and broadsides Eric across the temple with the
	gun.  Eric falls, rolls back to a stance, but Funboy is right on
	top of him, howling like a lunatic and pistol-whipping Eric
	relentlessly.

				FUNBOY
		I hate trespassers!
			(whack!)
		I hate prowlers!
			(whack!)
		I hate peeping toms!
			(whack!)
		And right now I hate you!

	ANGLE - WALL NEAR BATHROOM

	as Eric, caught off-guard by Funboy's hyper high and weakened by
	his wound, comes slamming into the wall, losing his footing.
	Here comes Funboy, and we TILT UP from Eric's position as he 
	looms, cocking the pistol, which now has Eric's blood on it.

				FUNBOY
		Ahh, the hell with it, I still got
		five shots left.

	In a blur, Eric grabs Funboy`s gun hand.  Twists to the 
	crunching of bones.  Funboy's skewed-around gun hand blows a
	hole in his own thigh.  Funboy fall back across the bed.

				FUNBOY
		Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what
		you did to my sheets, you lame
		piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!

				ERIC
		Does it hurt?

				FUNBOY
		Does it hurt?!  You dead-ass,
		clown-faced fuck, of course it
		fucking hurts!  What the shit are
		you gonna do about this?!

	Eric sits on the bed next to Funboy; inspects the ampule of
	morphine on the nightstand, the needle of the syringe already 
	inserted.

				ERIC
		I have some pain killer right here.

	And he fills the syringe all the way.

	ANGLE ON FUNBOY

	as he begins to see the light.  He can't get away.  Growing
	terror.

				FUNBOY
		No, wait, no WAIT, that's too
		much, man, that's like overkill,
		nobody can take that much, you're
		wasting it -- !

				ERIC
		Your pain ends now.

	And Eric rams the needle into Funboy's heart, driving home
	the full dose.  Funboy begins to convulse.

	Eric falls back on the bed, his force spent.  Darla COMES TO in
	the corner, shock-traumatized.  On O.S. COUGH, and Eric opens
	his eyes.

	The Skull Cowboy, standing in the room, tips his hat.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Howdy
			(beat)
		You look a mess.  Like an ole
		cooter dog.

	TIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE

	streaked with -- mostly -- his own blood.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE SKULL COWBOY AND ERIC

				SKULL COWBOY
		Getting a little ambitious and
		extracurricular, aren't we?

				ERIC
		Go away.

				SKULL COWBOY
		You need to learn to mind your own
		business or you'll never get where
		you think you're going.

				ERIC
		Shut up.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Maybe I was wrong about you.

	The Skull Cowboy seems saddened or disappointed.  All we get is
	a little shake of his skull-head.

	Darla makes a SOUND and Eric turns toward her.  She's really
	confused.  She's looking to Eric for some kind of answer.

				ERIC
		Your daughter is out there, on the
		street, waiting for you.

	She's stunned, utterly speechless.  All she can do is look in
	Eric's eyes, try to ponder the phantoms there.

				ERIC
		Go.  Now.

	Darla shoves helter-skelter past Eric and out the door without 
	a glance back at Funboy.

	Eric, recovering, follows slowly, staring at the open door,
	stooping to lift the guitar dropped during the fight with 
	Funboy.  The Skull Cowboy has vanished.  PUSH IN.  Grimly, Eric
	takes a syringe and begins to draw blood from the late Funboy.

	INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	As a hastily dressed Darla BANGS out through the fire stair door
	behind Grange and FLEES the Pit.

				BOUNCER
		Hey, g'night, Darla.
			(to Grange)
		That there is Darla.

				GRANGE
		Funboy?

	Bartender indicates UP with his thumb.  Grange moves to the fire
	stairs door.

	INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Grange has seen the door ajar and now ENTERS gun-first.  Freezes
	when he sees:

	GRANGE POV - FUNBOY

	Half-sheeted, bloody, a hypo hanging out of his heart.

	RESUME GRANGE

	Eyes darting, drawn to --

	GRANGE'S POV - THE WALL NEAR FUNBOY

	A crow silhouette spray-painted with a syringe of Funboy's
	blood.  A thin outline, drippy.

	RESUME GRANGE

	whirling with his gun to bring it to bear on --

	ANGLE - GRANGE SEES THE WINDOW

	The crow is no longer in the room.  Eric is perched on the sill,
	guitar and all, looking right at Grange as if waiting from him.
	He winks, holds a finger to his lips -- sshh --and jumps out
	into the night.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - GRANGE

	He almost fires, but doesn't.  We see instead the priceless
	expression on his face as we --

							CUT TO:

	INT. PRECINCT FOYER - NIGHT

	Albrecht lights another smoke, quitting for the night.  Waves to
	the late-working Annabella en route.

	EXT. PRECINCT HOUSE - NIGHT

	Albrecht hasn't gone three steps before Eric appears behind him,
	cat silent, matching pace.

	NB:  Eric has got a new black rock-n-roll shirt on... and a
	shell casing from Funboy's gun tied in his hair.

				ERIC
		Freeze.

	Albrecht startles; drops his file.  Nearly draws his gun.

				ALBRECHT
		Jeezus!  Don't ever do that, man!

	Albrecht pants, hysterical but calming down.  Eric waits.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		I told you cops don't say
		"freeze".

	He retrieves Eric's doctored photo from the spill of papers.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		You, my friend, are dead.  I saw
		your body.  You got buried.

				ERIC
		I saw it, too.

	Albrecht gathers up the file.  Eric stands there.  We realize he
	is hesitant about touching the file.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Walk with me.

	As Albrecht comes up with the file as they walk.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT ON THE STREET

				ALBRECHT
		You died, man.  I can't believe it
		but here you are.  Last year,
		you and your girlfriend --

				ERIC
		I need you to tell me what you
		remember.  What happened to us?

				ALBRECHT
		You went out the window.  She was
		beaten and raped.  She died in the 
		hospital.

	They stop.  Eric didn't know this.  Fixes Albrecht with a look.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Hey, you asked, man.
			(beat)
		She held on for thirty hours in 
		intensive care.  Hemorrhage,
		trauma.  He body just finally
		gave it up.
			(beat; regret)
		I saw it and couldn't do jack for 
		her.

	Eric has grown increasingly distraught over Albrecht's lines.
	Now he turns to Albrecht and, holding Albrecht's temples with
	his fingers, puts his thumbs over Albrecht's eyes.

	TIGHT ON ERIC - ALBRECHT AGAINST WALL

	We see Eric react to a brutal Flash... but we don't see the 
	Flash.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

	And Eric tears from Albrecht; staggers back, now holding his own
	head.  His crow face slacked in realized horror.

				ALBRECHT
		You okay, man?  I mean, what just
		happened.

				ERIC
		The venom of bad memories.  You
		were there; you saw her.  I saw
		you seeing her.

	Understandable nervous, Albrecht lights up a cigarette.

				ALBRECHT
		You gotta understand -- I was 
		hoping she'd talk, give me a lead,
		a clue, something to work with.
		But she only said one thing to me 
		before she died.

	Eric lowers his head, penitent.

				ERIC
		My name.

				ALBRECHT
			(fizzles)
		I'm sorry as hell, man.

				ERIC
		Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus
		change...

	TIGHT TWO-SHOT - ALBRECHT AND ERIC

	Eric plucks the cigarette from Albrecht's lips, taking a single
	contemplative puff from it.

				ERIC
		Halloween is coming, soon.  You
		will have Top Dollar if you watch
		for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.

				ALBRECHT
		I should be trying to stop you.

	Eric nods, keeping his eyes on the cigarette.

				ERIC
		Thank you.  For giving a damn.

				ALBRECHT
		My pleasure.
				ERIC
		Don't smoke these.

	As a bus grumbles past on the street, Eric pitches the butt and 
	simultaneously ducks out of frame.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT TURNS

	to see a blank building wall.  Fire escape.  Darkness.  No Eric.
	He does a full 360 degree turn.  Eric is gone again.

				ALBRECHT
		Damn, I wish he wouldn't do that.

	MOVING ANGLE - FROM BUS ROOF

	Coat flapping, Eric is standing on the bus roof as the bus moves
	away from Albrecht's position.

	INT. LAO NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

	Lao has the partially disassembled rat skeleton in front of him, 
	as well as a mortar and pestle with some bits of crushed bone, and
	is smoking powdered rat bone in a pipe and Grange reports to
	him.

				GRANGE
		The son of a bitch winked at me.
		The he jumped.  Three stories.

	Lao seems strangely unaffected by the bizarre nature of Grange's
	tale.

				LAO
		Did you see an animal of any kind?
		Did you see a bird?

				GRANGE
			(puzzled)
		No.  I saw a guitar.
			(beat; irritated)
		This isn't some rock-n-roller
		you forgot to pay, is it?
			(beat)
		There was a drawing on the wall 
		that looked like a bird.  In 
		blood.

	Lao's expression is one of sublime content.

				LAO
		Good.

				Grange
		It could've been a chicken...

	EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT - ("CROWVISION")

	A LONG SHOT of the T-Bird parked across the street from the
	store as two figures -- T-Bird and Skank -- approach on the
	store side.

				SKANK
		I wish to hell I had torched
		Gideon's, that fat fuck.

				T-BIRD
		I wish to hell I knew who it was
		that made Tin-Tin into a voodoo
		doll last night.

	ANGLE - CLOSER ON T-BIRD AND SKANK - STREET LEVEL

	They stop walking.  Look at each other and sanctimoniously cross 
	themselves.  Tin-Tin's big R.I.P. moment.  T-Bird indicates the
	liquor store.

				T-BIRD
		We need some smokes and some road
		beers.

				SKANK
		Got it.

	Skank hustles toward the store.  T-Bird crosses to the car.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD - THROUGH CAR WINDOWS

	WIDEN ANGLE to include the car as he nears it.  Behind him, two
	12-year-old KIDS, AXEL and CHOPPER, enter the store after Skank,
	one wearing a long duster.

	INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

	as the KIDS enter and split between the counter and magazine
	rack.  East Indian CLERK.  Two boys fight video game wars in the
	corner.  Skank browses, grabbing odds and ends.

	EXT. STREET / INT. CAR - LOWER ANGLE - NIGHT

	as T-Bird climbs in, digs the last cigarette from his pack, 
	snaps his Zippo and in the sudden orange light, sees:

	INSERT - REARVIEW MIRROR

	Eric's purloined Strat in the back sear reflecting the light.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD

	He tries to spin and draw his gun but Eric is upon him, nestling
	one of Tin-Tin's throwing knives right inside T-Bird's ear.
		
				T-BIRD
		What the fuck are you supposed to
		be, man?!

	INSERTS:  Eric liberates T-Bird's automatic from the shoulder 
	holster; Eric's hand closes T-Bird's door for him.

				ERIC
		I'm your passenger.  You drive.
		And stop talking.

	TIGHT ANGLE - T-BIRD'S HANDS

	on ignition key and gearshift, making ready.  As ordered.

	INT. LIQUOR STORE - ON SKANK AT COUNTER - NIGHT

	He looks outside and sees Eric as the car fires up, pipes and
	glasspacks grumbling.  Skank moves, BRISTLING.

				SKANK
		What's all this happy horseshit?

	And the car peels out maniacally!  Skank tries to pursue -- but
	the two KIDS draw weapons and freeze everyone in the store.

				AXEL
		Alright, alright, alright --
		everybody be cool and stay exactly
		where you are.

	Chopper hustles up to the counter and relieves Skank of a 
	gigantic Auto Mag.

				CHOPPER
		Whooooa, cowboy!  Cool gun.

	Off Skank's look of total outfoxed disgust.--

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELING FAST - NIGHT

	Vertiginous windshield POV of onrushing street, highspeed.

				ERIC (O.S.)
		Faster, T-Bird.  Faster.  You're
		a hell of a wheelman; you know you
		can drive faster.

	ANGLE - ERIC AND T-BIRD

	Eric now holds T-Bird's own gun on him.  Eyes locked on T-Bird.
	T-Bird's jump between Eric's nightmare visage and the roadway.

				T-BIRD
		You call it, blood -- you got the

		to go.

	Clearly T-Bird would relish bisecting Eric with a meat cleaver 
	as he says this.  He's nervous and needs to hold the road.

				ERIC
		That's good.  We're going 
		someplace you've never been
		before.

	EXT. STREET - HIGH ANGLE ON T-BIRD - NIGHT

	as the car burns up the obstacle course of pavement, kicking  
	wake of litter.  PEDESTRIANS scurry to clear the way.

	INT. POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT

	Parked in an alley, facing the street.  Two cops work on large
	styro cups of steaming coffee.  MJ (driver) and SPEEG.

				MJ
		Smells like rain.

				SPEEG
		Smells like a septic tank.  You
		got that cream stuff?

				MJ
		In the bag.

	Speeg rummages inside the takeout bag.

				SPEEG   
		I hate this cream stuff.  They
		can't even call it cream, legally.

	They snap to as the T-Bird blazes past, doing ninety.

				MJ
		What in the crap?

	MJ floors the pedal, drenching Speeg in coffee on takeoff.

				SPEEG
		Ow! Owowoowowoowo, goddammit!

	EXT. STREET - ON ALLEY - NIGHT

	as the cruiser roars out to give chase.

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELLING FAST - NIGHT

	Eric lends the chase car a backward look.

				ERIC
		You caught one.  Drive faster.

				T-BIRD
		Man, you gonna get us killed dead
		and I don't even know what you
		want!

	Eric cocks T_Bird's pistol and levels it at his face.

				ERIC
		I want you to stop talking.  And 
		drive.  Drive faster.

	Eric rifles the glove box, tossing items out the window: clips
	for the gun.  Sunglasses.  A giant dildo (brief eyebrows-up to
	T-Bird).  Then: a roll of (previously established) gaffer's
	tape.  What Eric needs.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD AND REARVIEW MIRROR

	as he sees a second cop car join the high speed pursuit, 

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		You're very popular.  Thought
		you could handle this thing.

	T-Bird macho calcifies.  He's going to win.

				T-BIRD
		To hell with you.

				ERIC
			(wry)
		Naturally.

	INSERT - SPEEDOMETER

	Climbing swiftly toward the 100 mark.


	EXT. CITY STREETS - VARIOUS ANGLES - THE CHASE - NIGHT

	A 3-way pursuit until the T-Bird reaches the outskirts of the
	city.

	EXT. DOCKSIDE STREET - NIGHT

	All quiet... until the T-Bird ZOOMS past frame.  The lead cop
	tries to duplicate the T-Bird's corner-cut and starts spinning.
	It clips a light pole.  Rebounds into the path of MJ's unit.

	INT. POLICE CRUISER - ON SPEEG AND MJ - TRAVELING - NIGHT

	as MJ stands on the brakes.  Collision imminent.  They howl.

	EXT. DOCKSIDE STREET - NIGHT

	as MJ's unit broadsides the first cop car.

	EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - NIGHT

	The T-bird careens through dockside silence, alone, then
	fishtails, SCREECHING, to a lung-compressing halt.

	INT. T-BIRD - ON ERIC AND T-BIRD - NIGHT

	T-bird respirating like a jackhammer.  Eric holds stoic.

				T-BIRD
		So what -- you gonna rape me now?

				ERIC
		Time for your reward, T.  Payback
		with interest earned.

	Eric rips a long strip of tape from the roll.

	EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - NIGHT

	A HIGH ANGLE of the car as Eric opens the trunk.

	ERIC'S POV - The Trunk.

	loaded with plastique, canisters, timers, arson paraphernalia.

	INT. T-BIRD - FAVOR T-BIRD - NIGHT

	SLOW TILT starting with T-Bird's foot, firmly taped to the
	pedal.  Mummified into his seat.  Hands taped to the wheel.
	Throat taped hard against the headrest.

	The car is now in gear, idling.

	ANGLE - ON ERIC FROM WINDOW

	He drops an incendiary right into T-Bird's lap.  T-Bird squirms.
	No go.  Eric reaches in with a bungie cord.

				ERIC
		A little restrictive?  Good.
			(chilling)
		You held her down and raped her.
		You were the first.  She burned
		while you were inside of her.
			(re: bomb)
		What's the lag on this?  About
		twenty seconds, would you say?

	T-bird thrashes, but he's immobilized.  Can't even budge the
	wheel.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I've comrades in hell, T-bird.
		Give them my best.

	Eric activates the timer.  Yanks up hard on the bungie cord.

	INSERT: T-BIRD FOOTWELL

	The bungie cord pulls T-Bird's foot all the way down on the
	pedal.

	ANGLE - ON CAR, FROM DOCKSIDE

	Eric steps back, plucks the guitar out as the car starts to move.  The
	car roars for the edge of the dock, about a distance of a
	football field.  Eric examines T-bird's auto pistol and pops the
	clip.

	INTERCUTS:  as the car speeds for the water's edge, Eric thumbs
	bullets from the clip, one by one.

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELING FAST - NIGHT

	T-bird's eyes bug in horror and he goes MMMMMMMMHHH!

	CLOSE-UP - THE CLIP IN ERIC'S HAND

	thumbing out the final bullet.

	EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

				ERIC
		All gone.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD REACHES DOCKSIDE

	Lifting off and blowing all to hell, a billion smithereens of
	phosphorescent firs pattering into the dark water.  It hits.
	Sinks.  Weird flare glow as the car quickly submerges.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	heaving the gun into the distant water.  Plosh.  He produces T-
	Bird's accelerator.  Squirts it into the ground.  He
	prestidigitates and T-Bird's Zippo appears in his hand.  He 
	flicks it and drops it into the flammable puddle.

	HIGH LONG SHOT - ERIC

	walking slowly out of the scene as the firepool coalesces into
	a burning crow shape. 

	INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAWN

	CLOSE-UP of a frying pan busy burning some pretty firebombed
	looking eggs.  Kind gross.

	ANGLE - DARLA AT THE STOVE.

	NOT THRILLED WITH HER OWN PROGRESS.

				DARLA
		I never was too good at this 
		domestic shit.

	ANGLE - ELLY AT LIVING ROOM WINDOW

	staring outside at nothing in particular.  Yet.

				ELLY
		Don't say "shit".
			(beat)
		That's okay.  Corn Flakes are
		okay.  Anything.

	She pauses as she hears a lilting, faraway GUITAR STRAIN.
	Across the street she can make out the figure of Eric on his 
	roof playing the guitar.

	EXT. ROOF OF LOFT BUILDING DAWN

	EXTREME CLOSE of a Pignose Amp.  More soft GUITAR strokes as
	CAMERA FOLLOWS a patchwork a taped-together, jerry-rigged
	cables to:

	ANGLE - ERIC ON ROOF -- shirtless, crosslegged, his Crow make-up
	streaked by the night's work.  His fingering is unsure and he 
	tries the tune again.

	INSERT - We she Shelly's engagement ring on a leather thong
	around Eric's neck.  Like an amulet.

	ANGLE - ERIC PLAYING

	He's got it right this time.  Strong, sure CHORDS.  Passionate.
	We can almost imagine him conjuring Shelly via musical sorcery.
	He holds a stroke, letting it ring.  Sun rises behind him.

				IRATE VOICE (O.S.)
		Hey, shut the fuck up!

	Eric's eyes, closed with the moment, dart left.  Funny.

	EXT. MAXI-DOGS - DAY

	Later.  Elly is seated on a stool..  Mickey gives her a chili
	dog.

				MICKEY
		Chili dog for breakfast... it's
		original.

				ELLY
		Mom tried to cook.

				MICKEY
		Oh.

				CUSTOMER (O.S.)
		Hey, Mickey, I need a special
		with everything.  No sawdust.

				MICKEY
			(to Elly)
		Everyone's a comedian.  Enjoy.

	Mickey EXITS FRAME.

				GRANGE (O.S.)
		You're Elly, right?  I know your
		mom.

	Elly turns.  Grange sits next to her.  Lao's mirrored-windowed car
	is parked across the street, b.g.

				ELLY
		A lot of people "know" my mom.

	Grange points o.s., indicating he wants coffee from Mickey.

				GRANGE
		I know your friend, too -- the one
		that looks like a rock star.

				ELLY
		I don't know you.

				GRANGE
			(easily)
		I'd like to get in touch with him.

	Elly sizes Grange up.

				ELLY
		You're not a cop, either.  What do
		you want him for?

				GRANGE
		I'm looking for a good guitar man.

				ELLY
		Right.

	Grange withdraws a $10 bill from his wallet and slides it across
	the countertop to Mickey.

				ELLY (CONT'D)
		You buying?
			(cuts him some slack)
		He kinda wanders around.  You'll
		see him if you pay attention.

				GRANGE
		I need to find him kind of soon,
		Elly.


	INT. LOFT - ON ERIC - DAY

	No shirt, the ring on the thong around his neck -- workout mode.

	He twirls and performs odd Crow moves of increasing complexity
	in the big open living room.  On purpose, he stretches hard
	against the bedroom doorframe.

	FLASH:  Shelly stands in the blue moonlight near the picture window
	wearing a rococo Victorian gown.  PUSH IN TIGHT as she is
	embraced by a nude Eric.  He undoes the last few remaining ties
	that hold the gown in place.  FOLLOW THE GOWN as it crumples
	down the length of Shelly's (also otherwise nude) body to the
	floor...

							FLASH ENDS.

	LOW ANGEL - FROM INSIDE THE BEDROOM - ON ERIC

	hanging there, inviting the pain the FLASHES bring.  Breathing
	as though he is pumping iron, pumping up.

	ANGLE - LATER - ERIC IN BEDROOM

	embracing a ragged full-length dress that used to be Shelly's.

	FLASH: Eric and Shelly (wearing the same dress), exchange an
	extremely passionate and intimate KISS in the moonlight.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC

	as he drops the dress.  Absorbing the pain and memories.

	ANGLE - LATER - ERIC IN LIVING ROOM

	executing a complex roll that winds him up at the windowsill.
	He grasps it with both hands.

	FLASH:  A series of CLOSE SHOTS of Eric and Shelly's HANDS, each
	moving along the other's body.  Curves and dips and contours.
	But Eric's gaze never leaves SHelly's eyes.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AT WINDOW

	His GAZE similarly FIXED.  Bringing his hands away and clapping
	them together, deep breath, fingertips pressed to his face, like
	Kung Fu prep.  When he opens his eyes, the crow is there before
	him on the sill.

				ERIC
		That's better.

	He wipes his torso down with a towel.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		It's almost time.

	He holds his hand in front of his face and he flexes it.  We can
	HEAR tendons CRACKLE like a harness.  Closes it into a powerful
	fist.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	TIGHT on Skank as he slams his fist down on the table.  He has
	a black eye and facial scuffs from his liquor store encounter.

				SKANK
		Top, I made the sumbitch!  Face
		all painted white like some kinda
		fuckin' kabuki homo!

	WIDE ANGLE to include all present:  Lao, Grange, Lao Guards #1 
	and #2, Top Dollar, and a Sentry.  Top dusts up a line and
	rinses his nostrils with brandy.

				LAO
		Sounds like our "Crow" is
		out-maneuvering you.

				TOP DOLLAR
		"Our" Crow...?

				LAO
		Come now.  You've seen the 
		graffiti -- all over the city in
		the few hors it has taken your
		men to drop like plague victims.
		What about your turf, Top?
			(mockingly)
		You don't seem to have ripped out
		anyone's heart yet.

				TOP DOLLAR
			(pissed off)
		The night is young.

				SKANK
			(hot)
		The found T-bird flash-fried to
		what was left of his fucking car!

	Top is angry too, but won't show it to Lao.  He rises and goes
	to the window.  Neon glow.  Top sees something outside, below,
	that really torques him off.

	EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SHOWTIME - NIGHT (TOP'S POV)

	A phantom GRAFFITI ARTIST is spray-painting a crow shape on the
	condemned building right across the street.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	Top whip-drawing an auto pistol and shooting below.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Hey, you little fuckweed!  That's
		against the law!

	His gun smoking.  Momentary empowerment.

				TOP DOLLAR (CONT'D)
		I don't give a shit what kinda
		bird this guy is.

	EXT. WINDOW - NIGHT

	As Top turns from the window,  PULL BACK to incorporate the
	chunky shadows where the lights don't fall.  Eric is there,
	perched on the narrow exterior ledge...but we don't know it
	until he opens his eyes, two dots of white in the blackness.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	LAO AT TABLE -- angered by this macho horseshit, annoyed at his
	time being frittered.

				LAO
		I am sitting over here.

	He SLAMS a palm on the table and the room goes silent.  Top
	looks sheepish.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Do you think this childish
		machismo impresses me?
			(regains composure)
		When I was a boy in Saigon I
		watched my country change one 
		block at a time,  one building at
		a time.  Whole lives erased.  A
		way of life, polluted.  Today, no 
		one forces me to move.  I use my
		powers to change your country, one
		block at a time,  one building at
		a time.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Nice speech.  What's it supposed
		to mean?

				LAO
		Your comprehension is not
		required.  Your cooperation and,
		indeed, your ability are the
		issues on the table.

	Top rallies to this.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Whatever you say, I can do.

	Skank looks around, nervous and jumpy, a contradiction to Top's
	guarantee.

				LAO
		That's reassuring.

	CLOSE-UP - TOP'S SHELL CASING IN ERIC'S HAND

	from the ledge.  Endstamp is for a .45 caliber.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON LEDGE

	He sniffs the cartridge.  We can see Funboy's cartridge in his
	hair.  He fists the shell casing tightly.

	ANGLE - DOWN-TABLE, AT SKANK

	Jittery, grabbing a clip for his own automatic.

				SKANK
		What was that -- !?

	It wasn't anything.  Skank loads, stands and jacks the action on
	his gun.  Lao looks questioningly to Top Dollar.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Too many poppers, Skank.  Relax.  Heel.

	ANGLE - WINDOW BEHIND TOP DOLLAR

	A black blur as Eric arches through, spilling Top.

	ANGLE - MEN SEATED AT TABLE

	Eric back flips the length of the table and kicks the gun from
	Skank's hand.  All react.  Weapons out.

	CLOSE-UP - SKANK'S GUN

	spinning mid-air to land in Eric's open hand!

	GENERAL ANGLE - BIG MOBY SHOOTOUT - (VARIOUS)

	Death cleans house.  Standing on the table, Eric fires rearward
	under his own arm to clip Lao Guard #1.  He pivots, shooting,
	and takes out Lao Guard #2 -- who slams backward into the steel
	door as it being opened by the Sentry outside.  Crash!  The
	door is shut again.

	ANGLE - GRANGE AND LAO

	Grange sprays the room with a Calico 950 Auto, shoving Lao
	beneath the table for cover.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	Bullets hit him and demolish everything behind him.  Skank hits
	the deck again.  Eric fires and Lao Guard #1 sucks three hits 
	across the chest, firing convulsively against the ceiling, blowing
	the lights.

	ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR

	springing up from behind table.  But Eric is gone from the field
	of fire and one shot strikes Skank, rising at the far end.

	ANGLE - LAO AND GRANGE

	making for the door, Grange as shield.  Lao draws a pistol.  The door
	opens and Lao shoots a Sentry to clear him out of the way.

	ANGLE - TIGHTER ON LAO

	A last look back toward Eric and Grange hustle Lao out.

	Door SLAM o.s.  Top is out of ammo as Eric lands from above
	frame right in front of him and slaps the gun from his hand.

				TOP DOLLAR
			(awed but maintained)
		You want my attention, man you
		got it.

	ANGLE - SKANK UNDER TABLE

	Wounded but clawing toward Eric just the same.

				SKANK
		It's him, Top!  He dusted T-Bird!

	ANGLE - ERIC AND TOP DOLLAR, FACE-TO-FACE

				ERIC
		You have to be SKank.
			(to Top Dollar)
		One moment.

	As he speaks, WIDEN FRAME as he turns and grabs the incoming
	Skank by the hair.

				ERIC
		Thank of a snappy comeback for me
		on your way down.

	Without a beat he pitches Skank right out the window!  Skank howls
	all the way down.

	EXT. STREET - ON POLICE CAR - NIGHT

	Damaged from the wreck, limping home, piloted by our pals Speeg
	and MJ.  Skank smashes down into the roof, imploding the
	flashbar and windshield.  MJ drenches his lap in fresh coffee.

				MJ
		OwwwAAHHH son of a BITCH!

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - RESUMING - NIGHT

	Just Top, Eric, corpses, and lazily drifting gunsmoke.

		Top Dollar, you're the only one

				TOP DOLLAR
		Five large, in the drawer right 
		over there.  I never saw you.

				ERIC
		Do you know what you destroyed?

				TOP DOLLAR
		Take the dope, too.

	Eric backhands Top into the wall.  Gets in his face, seething.

				ERIC
		A year ago.  A very nice lady
		circulated a petition.  She died.
		Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.

				TOP DOLLAR
		That's ancient history.

				ERIC
		It's yesterday!  Do you know what
		you destroyed?

	Top Dollar yells right back at Eric's anger.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Who gives a fuck!  I'm a
		businessman.  You gonna do me,
		then do me and shut you're face!

				ERIC
		You don't even remember...

				TOP DOLLAR
		I never forget anything, dickhead.
		That building was a sweep-and-
		clear; the bitch was a nuisance
		with her goddamned petition.  It
		got a little rowdy... end of
		story.

				ERIC
		Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps 
		for you.

	And he grabs Top's head the way he grabbed ALbrecht's earlier,
	slams Top into the wall.  Nose-to-nose.

	FLASH:  Shelly backing away from oncoming Funboy in the loft,
	trying to retreat, nowhere to run, her home invaded, scared.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC

	ANGLE - RESUMING TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC

	Viciously close, more intimate and lethal than anything.

				ERIC
		You're a detail man, Top -- you

	This time Top tries to twist from Eric's grasp but it's no good.

	FLASH: Shelly, comatose in ICU, eyes fixed and staring,

	Bloody, bruised and broken (from Albrecht;s memory)

	arching, stiffening in pain.

	CLOSE-UP - TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC

				ERIC
		All of her pain, Top.  Thirty

	Eric bears down on Top Dollar again.  Top screams.  Blood begins
	to leak from his eyes, nose, ears.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		...all for you.

	FLASH:  Rapidfire CLOSE-UPS.  A jagged compound fracture,
	jutting, Shelly's eye, blood-red sclera, purpled and sunken.

	Her scraped-raw hand clawing at air.  Icebox lighting.  A TIGHT
	SHOT of her monitor going flatline: eeeeeeeeeeeeee...

	TWO-SHOT - RESUMING ERIC AND TOP DOLLAR.

	as Top sags in Eric's grasp, terror fixing his wide-staring dead

	O.S. BANG of impact, heavy against the steel door.  Eric turns.

	ANGLE - STEEL DOOR

	All weapons snap up to bear on Eric.

	ANGLE - ERIC AS HE MOVES

	using his foot to shove the massive conference table at the 
	incoming SWATS while launching himself into the air, flipping
	toward the window and arching through cleanly as the cops open
	fire on command.  Bullets tear the room to pieces.

				LEAD SWAT
		The fire escape's covered.

	EXT. SHOWTIME - FRONT FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

		What're you boy scouts staring at!
		Let's Go!  Let's go!  Let's go!

	MOVING ANGLE - PICKING UP ERIC ON NEXT ROOF

	He sprints to the far edge and dives to the next lower rooftop.
	As he lands he is nailed by a helicopter spotlight, boring in 
	from behind and above the row of buildings.

	COPS below, COPS in the chopper, everyone rushing parallel to

	as well.

	WITH ERIC - AS HE RUNS TO THE EDGE.

	and finds a void waiting there.  No connecting building.

	ANOTHER MOVING ANGLE - ERIC

	staying ahead of the search light.  A fantastic series of artful
	moves that wind him up at the rear edge of the roof.

	ANGLE - SWAT MEN ON NEXT ROOF

	sighting Eric as the light picks him out.  Eric glances at 
	them... then jumps.

				CHOPPER PILOT (O.S./FILTERED)

	INT. ALBRECHT'S CAR - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

	Albrecht harried and frantic, but in control.

				ALBRECHT
		Keep your head down!

	He twists and turns the car, glancing rearward for pursuit.  

	Gradually he calms down.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		I figured you might need a ride 
		home.

	Eric looks up at him from his half-concealed crouch.

				ERIC
		It's done.
				ALBRECHT
		I figured as much.  Did you cap
		off Funboy.

				ERIC
		Funboy had to leave this mortal 
		coil.

				ALBRECHT
		Yeah, among others.
			(sees Eric's condition)
		Hey, man -- you're hit.

				ERIC
		It's only a flesh wound.

				ALBRECHT
		It's only fourteen or fifteen 
		flesh wounds.

	Eric sits up as the car gains distance.  Grabs the cigarette out 
	of ALbrecht's mouth.  Takes his single puff.

				ERIC
		You shouldn't smoke these.

	He pitches the smoke out the open car window.

				ALBRECHT
		Great.  Litterbug of the Living
		Dead.

	Eric turns back to Albrecht.

				ERIC
		I'm finished.

	Eric shoots him a doubtful look.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I mean, I've done what I came to
		do.  It shouldn't hurt this much.
		But it will pass...

				ALBRECHT
			(not buying it)
		Right.

		You sure I can't just take you to

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT - ON ALBRECHT'S CAR

	It hangs a turn and their escape is made.

	Eric is obviously fighting to stay centered, stay conscious.
	His last fight has caused him a great deal of damage, taken a
	lot out of him.  He needs to recharge.

				ERIC
		I have to prepare for an

	The TV flybank pulses with videotaped images of Club Trash's of
	various performers -- including Diabolique.  On several screens,
	one-by-one, various images of a guitar-playing Eric Draven
	FREEZE-FRAME as we PULL BACK to the desk.  Lao has the 8x10 from
	the corridor gallery.  He places it within eyeshot and resumes
	work on the desk BELOW FRAME;  we can't see it yet, among other
	scattered research and inconcubula.

	ANGLE - GRANGE

	Entering and crossing to the desk.  As he comes up to the desk,
	he DRAWS BACK.

				GRANGE
		What... the hell is that?

				LAO
			(calmly)
		This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes,
		it is real.

	NEW ANGLE - LAO AND GRANGE

	Revealing Lao with a sealed cage, holding a large, live cobra in
	his hands.  The killing blade is nearby.

				GRANGE
		That thing is poisonous.

				LAO
		Extremely so.
			(beat)
		You and I are the recipients of
		unwanted good fortune, in the form 
		of a man everyone is calling The Crow.

	Grange makes a face.  Can't keep his eyes off the cobra.

				GRANGE
		Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...

				LAO
		I intend no slight to you, but I
		cannot find the English to
		adequately express just what he
		is.  I suppose Western mythology
		would describe him as a Fury.
		
				GRANGE
		Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.

	Lao chuckles indulgently.

				LAO
		Do you know of spirit assassins?
		You do know the dead can rise?
		Properly motivated, of course.

				GRANGE
		Like some sort of zombie on a 
		revenge trip.

				LAO
		Mmm.  But tonight I can take what
		is his.

				GRANGE
		Only thing you'll get from that
		clown is a faster way to die.
				LAO
		To the contrary...

	ZZLIP!  Lao smoothly BEHEADS the snake with the Blade against
	the stone surface of the desk and discards the writhing body.
	He squeezes behind one of the eyes and a VENOM SAC protrudes
	like a dark pimento.

	LAO pulls it free of the milky, clinging tissue and EATS IT.
	Off Grange's stunned expression.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		...all the dying tonight will be 
		done by the former Eric Draven.

	Lao exhibits the blade to Grange as though it explains all.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Who is only invulnerable so long
		as he cares about the dead.  When
		he begins to care about the living,
		you'll find his heart can bleed...
		and I want it to bleed for me.

				GRANGE
		Kill a dead guy?

	Lao POPS the second venom sac; swallows it.  Pleased.

				LAO
		Truly kill him.  So I may crush
		his skull and smoke it.

	Lao SHRUGS.  Grange can handle it.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Let it suffice that I need him...
		and to get to him, we'll need his 
		little friend.

	Finally, an assignment Grange can comfortable understand. 

	INT. LOFT - DAY

	Eric, barechested, emotionally tapped, clean of makeup and blood
	but exhausted, his movements retarded and slack.  Staring
	fixedly into the fireplace,  where he burns everything he could
	find of his past:  the junk from the makeup table, the masques,
	photos of himself and Shelly.

	INT. LOFT - STAIRWELL - DAY

	Moving with Elly as she nears the open loft door.  She PEEKS
	cautiously inside.

	RESUME ERIC

	Without looking toward the door, he speaks.

				ELLY
		What's going on...?

				ERIC
		A remembrance.
			(beat)
		A closure.

	And Eric consigns to the fire the DRESS we saw earlier.

	Holds a photograph in a broken frame.  Cracked glass.  Subject:
	Eric and Shelly, goofing for the camera.

	He chucks it into the fire.  Draws a deep breath.

				ERIC
		Better now.  I feel good.  How are
		you, Elly, my friend?

	Elly is clearly uncomfortable, groping for an excuse just to see 
	Eric.  Eric is staring at her, intently.

				ERIC
		What is it?
				ELLY
		I knew.  I knew I knew you.  Even
		with the makeup and stuff you
		wore.
			(beat)
		You really loved her, didn't you?

	CLOSE-UP - FIREPLACE

	The photo burns and blackens in the grate.

				ERIC
		You brought flowers.  As long as 
		you don't forget her, Elly, she 
		lives.

				ELLY
			(upset)
		She's dead.  She's gone.  And now
		you're just gonna go away and
		never come back, too.  I hate this
		place; it isn't fair.

				ERIC
		Elly...

	He draws her close.  Wipes away an errant tear with his thumb.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Sometimes the people we care about
		are gone, for no reason.  Sometimes
		that's really tough.  I cry.  But if 
		the people we love are gone, we keep them --

	He taps Elly's temple, then his won.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		-- right here.  It's a big
		responsibility.  And that makes it 
		okay to mourn.
			(beat)
		I know that if you weren't here,
		I'd be very sad.

	Elly gives Eric a hug.

				ELLY
		You look funny without your white
		face on.  Like it's your day off
		or something.

	He quizzical expression amuses him.

				ERIC
		Somebody here wants to meet you. Gabriel?

	Gabriel the cat has wandered near the fireplace to join them.  
	Elly is immediately smitten.  Happy.
		
				ELLY
		I remember him!  Here, Gabriel...
		here kitty... Gabriel... Is he
		still yours?

				ERIC
		I think he's yours, now.

	The cat seems to like that idea.  Elly wraps him hugely up in
	her arms, talking to him: "How're you, Gabriel, whatcha doin'"

	ANOTHER ANGLE - TIGHTER ON ERIC

	While Elly is preoccupied with the cat, Eric gives up his last
	bit of Shelly to the fire - a portrait photo of her, small and 
	creased.  He puts it in the fire, watches it burn for a beat,
	then turns to Elly.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I have something else for you.

	BACK FOCUS as Eric lifts off his neck Shelly's ring for Elly's
	inspection.  The ring twirls large in f.g.

				ELLY
		Nobody ever gave me something like
		that before.  Ever.

	Eric places it around her neck.  Elly BEAMS.

				ERIC
		Shelly would've wanted you to have
		it.  This way, you'll think of her 
		every time you see it...

				ELLY
		And she'll be alive.  Up here.

	Elly TAPS her own temple with a smile, keeping one hand on the
	ring.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	Blowing wind.  TRICK-OR-TREATERS wisp past.  Ghosts, witches,
	demons out for Halloween.

	ANGLE - CEMETERY FENCE

	walking home with Gabriel zipped up inside her coat is Elly.  A
	fire engine wails past in the opposite direction.

	ANGLE - ELLY ON BROWNSTONE STEPS

	Strictly downscale building.  Elly to Gabriel"

				ELLY
		You're gonna like it here.

	A car curbs across the street as she enters the building.

	ANGLE - PUSH IN ON CAR

	as the window cranks down to reveal Grange at the wheel.

	INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Darla nervously smoking, doing her best to stay clean, but
	jittery.  Elly enters the shabby living room with Gabriel in her
	arms.

				DARLA
		I was wonderin' where you'd
		gotten to --
			(she sees Gabriel)
		Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?

				ELLY
		He was a present.  Besides, we're
		moving anyway.  You said.

				DARLA
		We'll discuss this later.
		Obviously.  You left the door open.

	DARLA points.  As Elly goes to close the door it opens.

	NEW ANGLE - FAVOR THE DOOR

	Grange enters accompanied by two Asian martial arts STRONGARMS
	(Lao Guards #3 & #4).  Grange looks around, bemused, his manner
	avuncular.

				GRANGE
		Hi, Elly.  Remember me?

	Elly's surprise is evident.  Darla is just plain pissed off.

				DARLA
		I don't remember you.  And I don't
		remember inviting...

				GRANGE
			(to his MEN)
		If she opens her face again, shoot
		her in the head.

	ANGLE - DARLA

	Mouth stalling in the ON position as Lao Guard #3 pulls a 
	gigantic gun, draws and cocks.

				ELLY
			(panicked)
		Mom -- !

	ANGLE - GUARD #4 AND ELLY

	as he scoops her up, captive.

	ANGLE - GRANGE AND GABRIEL

	He strolls the circuit of the room, stopping near the window.

				GRANGE
		You should listen to your mother.
		She said no cats.

	Grange pitches Gabriel right out the window.

				ELLY
		Gabriel!

	Grange pulls out a compact Polaroid camera.

				GRANGE
		Now that's the expression I want.

	ANGLE - ELLY AND GUARD #4

	As she struggle mightily, to no avail, as Grange moves in to
	snap his shot.

				GRANGE (CONT'D)
		Say cheese.

	He snaps.  On the SX-70 WHIRR and flash white-out, we --

	EXT. LOFT BUILDING ROOFTOP - SUNSET

	Dark clouds have gathered to highlight the sunset.  Eric plays
	the guitar - LOUD, the SHelly theme in a major key.  Where
	before it was wandering, uncertain, now it's bold and
	heartbreaking.  Definitive.  Pain replaced by strength and a
	sense of homecoming.

	As Eric gets to the end of it, the notes are flying out... At
	the climax, rips the guitar up over his head and brings it 
	down -- SMASH -- on the Pignose.  He's finished here.

	ROOF EDGE - FROM STREET

	as the broken guitar SAILS OUT over the building edge.

	INT. LOFT BUILDING STAIRWELL - DUSK

	As Eric comes down the stairs.  Notices the open door.

	INT. LOFT - DUSK

	He enters, cautiously, to find an envelope laying in the middle
	of the floor.  He opens it.

	INSERT - THE POLAROID OF ELLY

	with a note.

	UP ANGLE AT ERIC READING THE NOTE - FROM FLOOR

	The crow flies past behind him as his expression hardens.

	NEW ANGLE -  A MOMENT LATER - FAST AND HARD

	Eric brutally crisscrosses his arms with black vinyl tape.

	ANGLE - ERIC DRESSING

	Pulling on black night-fighting clothes, skintight.

	ANGLE - THE VANITY

	as Eric (seen in mirror) jabs his fingers into the white
	makeup and smears it on.

							SMASH CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET NEAR CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Eric marches along in plain view since everyone around him seems
	to be in costume.  The wind whips his coat.  KIDS bustle around
	him with trick-or-treat bags.  The crow perched on his shoulder.

	ERIC'S POV - CITY SKYLINE

	Somewhere, a few blocks over, a building is burning.

	ANGLE - ERIC WALKING

	A fire engine races past on the street.  He steps out in its
	wake and crosses over to --

	MEDIUM MOVING SHOT - THE CEMETERY

	waiting for him as he crosses to the fence.  Beyond the fence,
	in the distance, the church looms.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	He pauses.  A KID in a Creature from the Black Lagoon mask
	comes, passes Eric, then comes back for a touch.

				CREATURE KID
		Trick or treat!

	Eric smiles.  Not tonight.

	EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Eric is standing over the grave of Shelly Webster, looking down.
	He holds for a moment then moves on.

	EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT

	Eric ascends toward giant oak doors, tres Gothique.  The crow
	flaps past, leading him.

	NEW ANGLE - TOP OF STEPS -- where waits the Skull Cowboy.  As
	Eric approaches, the Skull Cowboy interposes himself between
	Eric and the huge double doors.

	Eric glares up, defiant.  Moves up the steps.  The Skull Cowboy
	extends a skeletal hand.  STOP.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Stop screwing around.

	TIGHT ON ERIC

	Angry, ready to battle:  You talking to me?

				SKULL COWBOY (CONT'D)
		Your job is done.  You interfere
		with the living again.

				ERIC
		Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I 
		might die.
			(beat)
		I've already done that.  I don't 
		need anyone's help.  Yours 
		included.

	STAIR ANGLE - ERIC AND SKULL COWBOY

	Eric lower, Skull Cowboy superior, the storm wild around them.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Do this thing and you will be
		vulnerable.  The blood will not
		return.
			(beat)
		No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.

				ERIC
		Fine with me.

	He ADVANCES a step up; the Skull Cowboy Hold fast.

				SKULL COWBOY
		You'll be alone.

				ERIC
		I'm already alone.

	INT. BELL TOWER - NIGHT

	Through a castle keep-like slit, Grange monitors Eric's
	arrival.  He speaks into a headset.

				GRANGE
		We've got company.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		Is he inside?

	GRANGE'S POV - ERIC

	Eric Talking to dead air.  Almost arguing with it.  Eerie.

	RESUME GRANGE

	As he talks into his mike he hefts a nightscoped, laser-sighted
	sniper's rifle.

				GRANGE
		He's just out front talking to
		himself.  You tell me. 

	EXT. CHURCH - RESUMING ERIC ON STEPS - NIGHT

	Eric, eyes steely, stares down the Skull Cowboy.

				ERIC
		Don't waste my time.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Very well, it's your ass.

	And the wind kicks up around them both, powerfully.

	ANGLE - SKULL COWBOY (EFFECT)

	As the force of the storm dust-devils around him and begins to
	disassemble him.  The fire in his eye sockets goes out.  His hat
	flies off an is pulverized by the wind.  The garments begin to
	disintegrate and blow around, rotten cerements falling apart in
	mid-air.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS -- transfixed by this unexpected
	development.  A shard of the Skull Cowboy blows past Eric's face 
	and transmutes to dust!

	RESUME SKULL COWBOY AT TOP OF STEPS (EFFECT)

	Transparent, ancient bones, crumbling and blowing away.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS

	As Eric lunges for what's left of his mysterious, smart-ass
	mentor
	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S LUNGING HAND

	Meeting only a swirl of vaporous dust where the Skull Cowboy's
	heart would have been.

	TIGHT ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS

	He has time to register the dust in his palm before it, too,
	renders down to nothingness,  leaving a vague green glow that
	dies.  And as he looks to the sky --

	UP ANGLE - THE CROW

	flapping down to land on Eric's shoulder.  Eric is astonished.

				ERIC
		But why are you still here?

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	No answer in the crow's eyes.

	RESUME AND FOLLOW ERIC

	That's good enough for Eric.  He marches to the double doors and
	shoves them back.

	INT. CHURCH - AS ERIC COMES THROUGH THE DOORS - NIGHT

	The high breeze blows in with him, disturbing dust in the
	disused Gothic dark.  Hollow cathedral ECHOES to sounds.  A
	giant 27" TV positioned on the alter, broadcasting static.

	LONG SHOT - ERIC AS HE APPROACHES THE ALTER - ("CROWVISION")

	Leery of potential danger from a thousand dark places.

	ANGLE - THE TV - AS ERIC ENTERS FRAME

	Onscreen:  Elly, gagged with duct tape and handcuffed to an iron
	ring bolted to a flagstone wall.  Could be anywhere inside the
	church.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		I believe our friend Elly call
		you Mister Crow.
			(beat)
		Please acknowledge; the mike
		will pick you up.
		
				ERIC
		I can see her.

				LAO
		Of course you can.
	ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY --  in darkness.  The running
	lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which
	THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light.

				LAO (CONT'D; O.S./FILTERED)
		Don't permit your rage to cloud
		the issue.  I believe in barter.
		I propose a simple trade.

	Grange sights his weapon.

	CROSSHAIR POV - ERIC AT THE ALTER

	Bluring as Grange resights.  Eric is not the target.  Blur
	FINDS the crow at the far end of the nave, perched in front of
	a giant stained glass window.

	NEW ANGLE - GRANGE -- squeezing off two quick, SILENCED shots.

	ANGLE - STAINED GLASS WINDOW -- the first shot blows a hole in
	some pastoral religious presentation.  TINKLE of glass.

	ANGLE - ERIC -- Spinning at the quiet !pfut! sound, to witness.

	ANGLE - INCOMING DART - ("CROWVISION")

	SPinning and hissing venomously.

	ANGLE - ERIC DUCKS

	As before, but the crow is not as fast.

	TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW

	As it catches the dart and goes down in a flurry of feathers.

	LOW ANGLE - ERIC AT ALTER - INCLUDE TV

	His knees buckle.  Sympathetic PAIN from the hit.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		You intended to finish this
		evening in the cemetery.  I am 
		here to help you on your way.

	ANGLE - RESUMING GRANGE IN GALLERY

	Swapping his tranquilizer gun for a more lethal rifle, similarly 
	scoped.  He sights the fallen Eric in a spray of green light.

	HIGH ANGLE - HAND HELD - ERIC AT ALTER

	Groping for support to drag himself back to standing.

				GRANGE (O.S.)
		I've got him if you want him.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		No shooting.

				GRANGE
			(into headset)
		Move in, guys.

	HIGH ANGLE - THE SANCTUARY -- as Lao Guards #3 and #4 move
	into light, closing on Eric's position in the center of isle.
	Both wield calico's and one bears a sword.

	CLOSE ANGLE - ALTER -- Lao makes his entrance from shadow
	wearing a brisk pugilist get-up, a practical fighting outfit.
	Makes a show of drawing the killing blade.

				LAO
		I wish to possess what you have now.

				ERIC
		I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.

				LAO
		I know.  That is why I will
		prevail.  Mr. Grange... ?

	Eric CRAMPS UP, CLUTCHING his throat in obvious pain.

	ANGLE - GRANGE AT STAINED GLASS WINDOW

	Holding the crow by the neck, TIGHTLY.  He plucks the tranq dart
	from the its body.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AS LAO MOVES IN CLOSER

	Crashing to one knee, invisibly bludgeoned, struggling to
	breathe.  Lao has no fear, walking around the stricken Eric.

				LAO
		Sooner or later, my action were
		destined to bring me a genuine
		Fury.  And it turned out to be you.
		At last.  I appreciate your
		abilities as few mortals can.
		That's why I desire them.

				ERIC
		You're too late.  There was a guy
		outside - on the stairs - you
		really need to talk to.  But he 
		turned to dust and blew away.
			(beat, gasping)
		I don't have any power for you to take.

				LAO
		I don't believe that.
	Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade.  Grange RELAXES
	his deathgrip on the crow.  MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may
	perceive a palpable degree of relief.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Time for you to die for me.
			 (beat)
		Funny, how the dead can still
		bleed.  How they need air.

	Eric IMMOBILIZED as Lao DRAWS BACK the Blade.  To Grange:

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Break its neck.

	ANGLE - RESUMING GRANGE AT WINDOW as he prepares to do dirty on
	the bird.

	Over his shoulder, we PUSH in to the BULLETHOLE from the first
	dart until we're in TIGHT CLOSE-UP of an eye watching through 
	the hole.

	EXT. CHURCH - OBVERSE OF WINDOW - NIGHT

	Albrecht digs through a sling bag of weaponry, trying to
	simultaneously monitor the peephole, muttering sotto to
	himself.

				ALBRECHT
		Had to go get yourself hip-deep in
		shit, didn't you, my friend.

	It begins to rain.  Albrecht glances resentfully toward the 
	sky.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Give it a rest, huh?

	A hefts a machinegun, clipped over and under.  CUTS LOOSE on
	full auto into the Madonna on the window.

	INT.  CHURCH NAVE - NIGHT

	As the window EXPLODES toward Grange and he sucks big hits from
	behind, DROPPING the crow.  The bird hits the ground, flapping
	weakly.

	LAO GUARDS #3 & #4 exchange a look and whip up their Calicos,
	RETURNING FIRE.

	EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT

	Albrecht takes cover as a lot of religious stuff is noisily
	destroyed all around his position.  Chunks of the window
	continue to disintegrate. 

	INT. CHURCH ALTER (NIGHT)

	Eric tuck-and-rolls out of the way as we go CLOSE on Lao, 
	screaming.

				LAO
		I said no shooting!

	Then he's ducking bullets himself as Albrecht STEPS IN through
	the blown out window, the machine gun stuttering on slugs.

	The sanctuary comes apart around Lao.  He RETREATS to the alter
	and EXITS whence he came.

	TIGHT ON PEW -- ERIC DIVES just as Guard #4 comes after him with
	the sword, which chomps into the wood and gets stuck there.
	Guard #4 releases it and cross draws his Calico as ERIC springs
	back into the frame -- STRAIGHT UP.

	TIGHT ON GUARD #4 as Eric's lancing foot propels him backward
	before he can fire.

	INTERCUTS -- ALBRECHT AND GUARD #3 scrambling to reload.  Guard
	changes magazine; Albrecht swaps clips.

	ANGLE - DOWN LENGTH OF PEW -- Guard #4 slides.  Sits up with his 
	gun as Eric, down-pew, grabs the sword.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AT WINDOW  firing now with a gun in each hand.

	RESUME ERIC AND GUARD #4, who eats it from Albrecht's gunfire,
	but not before he puts a round through Eric.

	Eric staggers back from the impact but keeps his feet.  

	RESUME ALBRECHT as he tosses away the dry pistol.  His machine
	gun jams, he fights to get the clip.

	ANGLE - GUARD #3 -- reloaded and rising, having caught Albrecht
	dead-bang in the open by the window.

	MOVING ANGLE - WITH ERIC --  A complex leap with the sword
	flashing.  He lands near Guard #3 and SLASHES UPWARDS, blade up.

	CLOSE-UP - GUARD #3 -- screaming in pain, gaping DOWN O.S.

	TIGHT ON ALBRECHT - looking UP, following the trajectory of
	something AIRBORNE toward him.

	CLOSE-UP - GUARD #3'S Calico spinning mid-air with Guard #3s
	HANDS still attached, severed mid-forearm by Eric's devastating
	strike.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT drops Guard #3 -- to REVEAL Eric in the
	background.  Eric salutes Albrecht with the tip of the sword.

	WITH ALBRECHT as he moves into the nave, which has been torn
	apart by gunfire.  Hazy smoke.  Two dead guys.  And Eric.

				ALBRECHT
		You sorta looked like you might
		need my help.

				ERIC
		This isn't your place.  This isn't
		your fight.  And I don't need
		your help.

				ALBRECHT
		You're welcome.

				ERIC
		Leave here.  Don't do this.  I
		don't want you here.

				ALBRECHT
		The hell you say.  This isn't just 
		about you any more.

	Eric stares dead-on at Albrecht, acidly, then BREAKS the Guard's 
	sword, dropping the pieces and turning his back on Albrecht, who
	pursues Eric to: 

	INT. SPIRAL STAIRCASE - TO BELL TOWER - NIGHT

	The crow FLAPS UPWARD through the void.  Eric grabs the thick
	bellrope, testing it.  A final look to Albrecht.

				ERIC
		Don't interfere.

				ALBRECHT
		You're bleeding, man.  You can't
		make it.

	Eric shinnies up the bellrope, ignoring Albrecht.

	ON ALBRECHT

	Watching as Eric dissappears from view, fast..  Grumbles.

				ALBRECHT
		You won't mind if I just take the
		stairs, then, smartass...

	He hefts his arsenal bag of hardware and begins to plod up the
	steps.

	ANGLE - MOVING WITH ERIC ON THE ROPE -- A weird perspective of
	speed climb.  Zip!  All the way to the top.

	EXT - CHURCH ROOF - NIGHT

	Slanted, shingled, slippery, dark.  Lightning deep in the turbid
	clouds.  The crow circles as Eric RISES INTO FRAME.

				ERIC
		Here I am.

	DOWNFRAME lightning STRIKES the ornate LIGHTNING ROD (large,
	Victorian, lance-like) at the far end of the roof from the bell
	tower.

	SILHOUETTING Lao and Elly standing in front of it.  Elly
	flinches at the strike.

				LAO
		Can you fly, Crow man?

	INT. BELLTOWER SPIRAL STAIRS - RESUMING ALBRECHT

	He stops his ascent to light a cigarette.

				ALBRECHT
		I ain't cut out for this superhero
		shit.

	EXT. CHURCH ROOF - RESUMING LAO - NIGHT

	Lao SNAPS Elly's free handcuff to the dimly glowing  lightning
	rod and advances, one foot on either side of the peak of the
	roof, his blade brandished.

	CLOSE MOVING SHOT - ERIC -- Hands up to grapple, but
	weaponless.  He spiders to meet Lao, suddenly PICKING UP SPEED
	and RUNNING along the precarious peak.

	Lao sees him coming, braces to strike, but Eric executes a BROAD
	FLYING LEAP right over Lao's head.

	ERIC LANDS, SLIPS, sprawls sideways, clinging to the peak of the
	roof.  Lao hurries in to slash with the blade, as Eric averts.
	The steel RINGS.  Eric converts his dodge into a low spin kick
	that DUMPS Lao.

	Eric SPREAD-EAGLES to keep from falling.  Distantly, Lao
	similarly saves himself.

	NEW ANGLE -- THE FIGHT -- Here comes Lao, crabbing back toward
	the peak.  Eric ROLLS to Elly's position, GRABS the lightning
	rod and tries to wrest it loose.

	SIZZLE OF FLESH as Eric's hands are scorched: the metal is still
	blue-hot.

	MOVING WITH LAO as Eric battles to free the lightning rod.  Lao
	closes up distance, gives a warcry and prepares to swing as - 

	Eric WRENCHES the rod loose and turns to deflect Lao's blow.
	The weapons spark as they meet... and there goes Elly, her
	handcuff freed, SLIDING DOWN THE ROOF SLOPE.

	ANGLE  -- ROOF SLOPE -- WITH ERIC  as he dodges Lao by using the
	lightning rod to vault down to where Elly is about to slip off
	the roof.

	With the rod embedded in the roof, Eric hangs on, and elly hangs 
	on to Eric.

	UP ANGLE -- LAO, a dark figure against the night sky, raising
	the sword.

				LAO
		Face me!

	Eric guides Elly to the top of one of the flying buttresses.
	When he looks up, Lao is gone.

	ANGLE - BELL TOWER -- Albrecht's head pokes up at last.  Looks
	around, finally spots Eric below and to the left.  YELLS, serio-comic.

				ALBRECHT
		Is he dead yet?

	INSERT - ALBRECHT'S HOLSTER as Lao's hand draws Albrecht's
	gun quickly.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND LAO --Lao has blindsided Albrecht.

				LAO
		No.  You are.

	He jams the gun into the base of ALbrecht's neck and fires three times.

	CLOSE ANGLE - ERIC - He's too far away to matter.  Shock.

	INSERT - ALBRECHT'S CIGARETTE as it rolls down the slope,
	trailing sparks, snuffing out.

	ANGLE - ERIC holding onto the lightning rod as lightning CUTS the
	night above him.

	ANGLE -- LAO AT BELL TOWER, triumphant and a bit wild, SHOUTING.
				LAO
		You've caused another death,
		Mister Draven!  The girl will die
		as well -- because of you!

	ANGLE - ELLY ON FLYING BUTTRESS

	The base of a triangle - Lao, Eric, Elly.

				ELLY
		You go to hell, you pervert!

	RESUME ERIC

	Rage over the loss of Albrecht.  He RISES, hurting but mad as
	hell.  GLARES UP toward Lao.

				ERIC
		And how many lives have you destroyed?

				LAO
		I took yours from you.  Your
		little girlfriend?  I took hers,
		too.  Your meaningless, petty
		life?  I took it so that tonight
		your existence might gain a
		purpose.  You're no avenger.
		You're mine.

	PUSH IN TIGHT ON ERIC.

	Eyes alight with hatred for Lao.

				ERIC
			 (to himself)
		You're right, I'm not an avenger. 
		Not any more.

	As lightning strikes, Eric Fires his gaze TOWARD THE SKY.

	HIGH ANGLE - LAO ON ROOFTOP - ("CROWVISION")

	SEEING the crash dive toward Lao through the row's eyes.

	ANGLE  - LAO ON ROOFTOP

	As the crow wings down INTO FRAME and lights on Lao's head, CLAWING!

	CLOSE-UP -- THE CROW ON LAO'S HEAD slashing with its claws.
	Pecking out Lao's eyes.

	WITH ERIC -- on the roofslope as he totters but maintains his
	climb, the crow/Lao UPFRAME B.G.

	RESUME LAO -- as the crow abandons him.  Lao STAGGERS AND FALLS
	down the roof - toward Eric.
	SLANTED ANGLE -- ERIC AND LAO -- Eric ARRESTS Lao's fall,
	fisting lapels and bringing him nose to nose.  Fury.

				ERIC
		Time for a sacrifice.

	Lao's face is a hideous bloody mask with black holes where the
	eyes used to be.  He smiles gruesomely.

				LAO
		I don't need eyes to take what I
		want from you.

	He EMBRACES Eric and RAMS the killing blade deep into Eric's
	back!

	ON ERIC as he looks down to see the blade protruding from his
	sternum.  Tight grimace.  A lot of pain.

				ERIC
		Can you fly?

	He pulls Lao into a BACKWARD ROLL down the roof, HOLDING HIM
	TIGHT.

	MOVING ANGLE -- INTERCUTS -- ERIC AND LAO FALL

	Eric lands on his back, forcing the blade THROUGH himself and
	INTO Lao.  Eric completes the roll and KICKS Lao off INTO SPACE,
	the killing blade still embedded in him!

	WITH LAO as crashes, sliding, sprawling down PAST Elly's
	position.  Gets to his knees atop the flying buttress.  Sees the
	blade in his own chest.

	CLOSE-UP - ELLY - she sees it all happen.

	RESUME LAO - a regretful look toward Eric.  He PLUMMETS off the 
	roof edge.

	ANGLE - ERIC SLIDES DOWN ROOF --  He slows, stopping when Elly
	is in frame.  He clutches his own chest.  Regards his own
	shaking hand, drenched in his won blood.  Glazed.

	ON ELLY, as she finally gets the duct tape off her mouth, trying
	to get to Eric.  She flails and cries out.

				ELLY
		Don't let me fall!

	CLOSE-UP -- their hands finally meet and GRASP TIGHT.

	EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT (LATER) (RAIN)

	A low angle TRACKING SHOT (as when we first met Elly).

	Eric's and Elly's feet pass graves.  Eric's pace is slow, crippled, 
	limping.  They STOP at a grave where elly BENDS INTO FRAME to steal 
	the flowers there.

	Eric is bloody and out of it.  She helps him walk.

				ELLY
		Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.

				ERIC
		In a better place.  I hope.

				ELLY
		You're not gonna come back, are you?

	Eric's response is halting and uncertain.  But he tries to give
	her hope.  He reaches for Shelly's ring around her neck, holds
	it up to her.

				ERIC
		I don't know if I can.  But you
		have this... and you know where to come.

				ELLY
		You mean you'll, like' dig your way
		out of the grave?  Euww.

	Eric is amused by this in spite of his grievous injuries.

	He grasps Elly's face in his hands and bends, painfully,to kiss
	her on the forehead.

				ERIC
		For you, I'll try.  Promise.

	MOVE WITH ERIC

	Spent, empty, he holds the rose determinedly, but he's never
	going to make it the few yards back to his own grave.  So close.

	His legs finally go and he collapses onto the humus.  One
	groping hand tries to drag him further.

				ERIC
		Leave me now.

	ANGLE - ELLY

	Tears on her face.  She can't watch this.  She TURNS and drops
	the flowers on Shelly's grave.

	ERIC'S POV - HIS OWN GRAVE

	Still too far away to matter.

	RESUME ERIC ON GROUND

	He gives it up, his face sinking into the wet grass for a beat
	before SHELLY'S HAND intrudes INTO FRAME to GRASP his hand.

	No ethereal glow, no heavenly choir... just a near-dead Eric's
	blank-faced astonishment, and he moves forward.

	ANGLE - ELLY - SHELLY'S GRAVE BG

	She struggles to get her hood up against the rain and roughly
	wipes the moisture from her face with her sleeve.  She turns
	toward Eric's grave.  Then, surprised, she looks close.

	ANGLE - ERIC'S GRAVE

	Eric is gone.  The white rose lies neatly on the top of the
	undisturbed  earth there.

	HIGH ANGLE - CEMETERY

	Emphasizing that Elly is now ALONE in the graveyard.

	LOW ANGLE on Elly, ROSE in the foreground --

	She walks OFF.  HOLD the rose.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAY (OVERCAST)

	A grey day but no rain.  Elly stands wistfully by the window,
	her doll on standby.  The apartment is in order and perhaps we
	notice a few new items.  Gabriel the cat, miraculously ALIVE, is
	sprawled on a chair, licking himself.  Darla BUSTLES INTO FRAME
	B.G.  Her wardrobe more upscale, her hair done.  Her manner is
	hectic but natural.

				DARLA
		Worktime, kiddo.  First day, new
		job, gotta go.

	This does not get the expected smile from Elly.

				DARLA (CONT'D)
		You sure you're gonna be okay?

	Elly turns from the window and NODS silently.

	ELLY'S POV - OUTSIDE

	The aforementioned grey day in the city.

	ANGLE - DARLA AND ELLY AT THE WINDOW.

	Darla comes up.  Arm around Elly.  Cheer up; he attitude much
	more connected and loving.  PUSH IN ON ELLY so we know she is
	clutching SHelly's ring tightly in her hand.  Darla looks past
	Elly, out the window.

				DARLA
		At least it finally stopped
		raining.

				ELLY
		It can't rain all the time.

	Darla kisses Elly on the temple and it out the door.  Elly OPENS
	her hand to consider the ring.  She looks back out the window --

	ANGLE - THE CROW ON THE LEDGE

	Elly is looking right at it.  Same crow.  We're positive.  So is
	Elly.  It TAKES WING and flies away.

	EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

	An UP ANGLE from Eric's grave toward the tree as the crow FLIES
	INTO FRAME and perches there, shucking water.  PUSH IN on the
	crow.  Watching.  Waiting.

	FADE IN:

	EXT. CEMETERY - LATE AFTERNOON

	BOOM!  A crack of lightning illuminates the silhouette of a
	perched crow large in the f.g.

	TIGHT ANGLE - FRESH GRAVE

	As a spade smooths the walls of a new double-decker plot.

				DIMITRI (O.S.)
		We're losing the light; let's pack
		it in.

	ANGLE - DIMITRI AND ALEXI

	TWO GRAVEDIGGERS.  Scoop digger parked f.g. towering gothic-
	style church b.g.  Rolls of astro turf.  They look up toward 
	the sky.

				ALEXI
		Snow, maybe?

				DIMITRI
		What, you gonna ski on this?

	He indicates the mound of fresh dirt.  Spits into the grave.

				DIMITRI (CONT'D)
		Come on, let's bag this.  It's
		beer time.

	Alexi nods and unfurls the tarp over the dirt.

	LOW ANGLE TRACKING SHOT - FLOWERS ON GRAVES

	As we MOVE alongside a pair of canvas-sided combat boots, as the 
	wearer collects the most lively flowers from each grave in 
	sequence.

	TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW

	Cemetery DEFOCUSED b.g.  Large, glossy-black, the bird follows
	the arc of movement in the previous shot.  Ruffles its feathers
	as it begins to sprinkle rain.

	ANGLE - ELLY - RESUMING HER MOTION

	A dirty-blondish tenement KID of eleven, clad in a blend of cast-
	offs and hand-me-downs; her version of street punk chic.  She
	totes a skateboard under one arm (itself a berserk Jackson
	Pollock chaos of band stickers, silver marker and graffiti, with
	day-glo wheels), and transfers her impromptu bouquet so she may
	unzip a flap and hike up a ragged hood against the rain.  She 
	stops to watch the grave diggers pack up and EXIT b.g.

				ELLY
		Guess the picnic got rained out.

	She looks down o.s. at --

	ANGLE - SHELLY WEBSTER'S GRAVE

	as Elly places the gathered flowers down.  Almost reverent.

	RESUME CROW ANGLE - ELLY B.G.

	as Elly takes a single white rose and places it atop the grave
	near Shelly Webster's.

	ANGLE ON GRAVE - AS ELLY LEAVES

	TILT UP from rose to the name: ERIC DRAVEN. Rain spatters the 
	granite, darkening it.

	EXTREME CLOSE-UP - CROW's EYE

	It blinks in its alien way.

	WITH THE CROW

	as it takes wing from it's unseen perch.  Lands stop Eric's
	headstone.  It pecks tentatively at the top of the monument.

	ANGLE - ELLY NEAR ERIC'S GRAVE

	She hasn't gotten too far before she notices the bird.

				ELLY
		Oh, scary.

	The bird blinks at her from the headstone.
				ELLY
		What are you, like, the night
		watchman?

	Another blink from El Birdo.

	CAMERA WITH ELLY -  BOOMING BACK HIGH

	as she exits the iron gates of the cemetery without looking
	back.  Brutal building facades, like dead eyes, and bad
	alleyways, like hungry mouths, are gradually revealed as we
	continue PULLING BACK to unveil that the cemetery is smack in
	the middle of the city.

	EXT. MAXI-DOGS - TWILIGHT - RAIN CONTINUES

	CLOSE-UP of a foot-long hot dog being drowned in mustard.

				MICKEY (O.S.)
		What this place needs is a good
		natural catastrophe.  Earthquake,
		tornado...

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND MICKEY

	ALBRECHT is a black beat cop, 35, in a rain slicker.

	MICKEY is the grease-aproned entrepreneur of MAXI DOGS, a steamy
	open-front fast foodery.

				ALBRECHT
		You gotta put the mustard
		underneath first.

				MICKEY
		Maybe a flood, like in the Bible.

				ALBRECHT
		Here, let me do it.

	He grabs the dog from Mickey.  Mickey puffs his cigar while he
	cooks.  Albrecht methodically spreads a napkin and performs
	surgery on the hot dog, coating the bun with mustard, rolling
	the dog in the bun.  Flashes Mickey a "gimme" look. 

				ALBRECHT
		Come on... onion.  Don't cheap
		out on me.  Lotta onions.

	MOVING ANGLE - AS ELLY SKATEBOARDS TOWARDS MAXI DOGS

				MICKEY
		Heyyy -- it's the Elly monster.

				ALBRECHT
		How do you ride that thing on a 
		wet street?

				ELLY
		Talent. Hi.

				ALBRECHT
		Care for a hot dog?

				ELLY
		You buying?

				ALBRECHT
		I'm buying.

	Elly grabs the stool next to Albrecht.  They`ve done this routine before.

				ELLY
		No onions though, okay?

				ALBRECHT
			(horror)
		No onions?

				ELLY
		They make you fart.

	Mickey laughs.  Spots Elly a Coke.

				MICKEY
		What's goin' on, Elly?

				ELLY
		I went to see a friend of mine.

				MICKEY
		Well, how's your friend?

				ELLY
		She's still dead.

	Albrecht and Mickey exchange a look re:  Elly's matter-of-
	factness.

	EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT (RAIN)

	Thunder KABOOMS o.s.  The crow pecks the top of the stone again
	and a chip of granite flies off, bang!

	EXTREME CLOSE - THE HEADSTONE

	as the crow pecks again and draws blood from the rock.

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	A dot of blood on its ebony beak.

	LOW ANGLE - HEADSTONE

	A thin, watery trickle of blood wanders from the top of the
	stone towards the earth.  Rain does not interfere.  Lightning
	plays in the rolling cloud cover, b.g.

	RESUME THE CROW

	as it takes off from the gravestone, into the rain.

	CLOSE-UP - THE BLOOD

	It slowly fills the name Eric Draven into the rock.

	CLOSE-UP - FOOT TAPPER

	A LOW ANGLE like the SHOT introducing Elly's boot.  This time
	we see cowboy boots, leather chaps.  The foot taps.  Waiting.

	MEDIUM ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER

	as lightning strikes.  Just enough for us to see a figure in a 
	long duster and a cowboy hat.

	RESUME ERIC'S HEADSTONE

	DRAVEN fills with blood.  Blood continues groundward.

	NEW ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER

	Turning to meet FRAME as the crow alights on his outstretched 
	arm.  This is the SKULL COWBOY.  We glimpse the deathshead,
	beneath the brim of the cowboy hat.

	RESUME ERIC'S GRAVE

	as blood trickles into the turf at the base of the grave.

	TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW

	shaking off rain.  Watching intently.

	CLOSE-UP - THE SKULL COWBOY'S FREE HAND

	Black gloved.  It walks a flat silver throwing knife across it's
	knuckles, like a quarter somersaulting.

	RESUME ERIC'S GRAVE

	The turf stirs beneath the white rose.  Magically, a slim white
	parts the earth to grasp the rose.

	SKULL COWBOY POV - ERIC's GRAVE

	as the figure of Eric Draven stands up from behind his own
	headstone.

	LOW ANGLE (FROM GRAVE) - ERIC

	Pale.  Clad in cerements: cheap black burial suit, slit open in 
	back.  WHite shirt.  A nothing tie.  No shoes.  Rain sluices mud
	from his upturned face.  He looks to the sky.  Lightning.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - FOLLOW ERIC

	as he weaves to lean against a nearby tree.  Looks o.s.

	ERIC's POV - THE SKULL COWBOY

	water-blurred, through the rain, standing with the crow perched
	on his arm like a hunting falcon.  He releases it and it flies
	to the tree.

	ANGLE -  ERIC

	Watching this.  Wipes mud from his eyes, tries to clear vision.
	The crow lights in the tree and they meet eye-to-eye.  Eric
	looks back o.s. and we RACK to include the Skull Cowboy.

				ERIC
		What the hell are you?

				SKULL COWBOY
		Interested?  Follow the crow.

	NB.  The Skull Cowboy speaks in nicely distorted, buzzlike
	charnal house whisper.  Unsettling and hackle-raising.

	Eric turns back to the bird, which takes wing in the rain, His
	eyes follow it.  He looks back, disoriented, doubtful, but the 
	Skull Cowboy is gone.

	LOW DEEP ANGLE - THE CROW

	Taking wing in the rain, showing the way.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC

	alone in the cemetery.  After a moments hesitation, he lurches
	off, following the crow.

	EXT. ARCADE GAMES SUPPLY OFFICE - NIGHT - TO ESTABLISH:

	A candy-flaked muscle T-bird is parked at the curb.

	INT. ARCADE GAMES SUPPLY OFFICE - NIGHT

	A MOVING SHOT during o.s. lines.  Past dead video and pinball
	devices.  Pasta desk with an open briefcase, coffee cup,
	ashtray -- someone was just there.  Then past a WOMAN, trussed
	with duct tape to her office chair, gagged, hot fear in her 
	darting eyes.

	COMPLETE CAMERA MOVE to include SKANK, a blade-thin speed freak 
	with pattern baldness, always loud, jittery, a manic dust puppy.
	And T-BIRD, an arrogant Arayan, brush-cut iron pumper, who is
	prepping an incendiary.  He exhibits a small squeeze bottle of
	arson cocktail to Skank.

				T-BIRD
		Uncle T-Bird's 100-proof
		accelerator.  I squirt you with
		this, you could jump in the 
		Detroit river and burn all the way
		to the bottom.

	INSERT A CLOSE-UP of the bomb in his hands as he works.  Silver
	canisters, an LED timer, wires.

				T-BIRD (CONT'D)
		You know, Lake Erie actually
		caught on fire once, from all the
		crap in it.  Wish I coulda seen
		that.

	He CLICKS a switch.  PEEP.  LED countdown blurs.

				T-BIRD (CONT'D)
		We're ready to rock.

	Skank notices the captive woman's handbag on the floor.  Picks
	it up.  Looks through it for valuables.

				SKANK
		What about working girl?

	INTERCUT the woman's increasingly horrified reactions.

				T-BIRD
		What about her?

				SKANK
		I say we leave her here to fry,
		man.

	T-Bird looks casually at the woman.  Smiles hideously.

				T-BIRD
		No.  Let's take her with us.

	ANGLE - THE WOMAN

	Her eyes bug in a terrified NO!

	EXT. STREET - MOVING - NIGHT

	As the T-Bird fishtails wildly around the corner and eats street.

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

	TB drives.  One eye on his digital watch (doing an equally
	fast countdown).  Skank wrestles their captive, the woman, in
	the back seat.

				TB
			(pissed off)
		Skank, shut her the fuck up!

	SKank punches her and she sags.  Then he looks forward.

				SKANK
		Whoaaa -- T-Bird, red light, red
		light!

	EXT. STREET CORNER NEAR MAXI-DOGS - NIGHT

	As the T-Bird slews wide, cutting sidewalk, scattering
	nightwalkers, immediately attracting everybody's attention.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT - AT MAXI-DOGS

	Reacting, with a mouthful.

				ALBRECHT
		Goddammit.

	Mickey grabs the counter phone instantly.

				MICKEY
		Call it in?

	Albrecht is off and running for the corner already.

				ALBRECHT
		Yeah, do it!

		Stay right there!

	HOLD ON MICKEY.  He points at Albrecht's hot dog.  Yecch.

	EXT. MOUTH OF ALLEY ACROSS FROM CEMETERY - NIGHT

	The car slides to a nose-down panic stop.

				SKANK (O.S.)
		Dump her, man, dump her!

	The woman comes tumbling from the car, which blasts off with a
	war hoop from the guys inside.

	ANGLE - CORNER - ON ALBRECHT

	Gun out, hauling ass on wet pavement.  Aims at the departing
	car.  Gives it up.  Still too far away.  Pedestrians in the way.

	ANGLE - THE WOMAN

	hurting, cut, bleeding, tottering toward the dumpster.  Duct tape 
	stuck to her face but cut away around her mouth.  With her as
	she falls into the alley darkness... straight into the arms of

	CLOSE TWO-SHOT - ERIC AND THE WOMAN

	Their eyes lock.  Eric stiffens with his first FLASH.

	NB:  Eric's flashes of past memory are conditioned by the nature
	of things with which he makes physical contact.  Hints and
	fragments in fierce, super-saturated COLOR.  Puzzle pieces he
	must assemble.  Each flash keynoted by a BLOWBACK NOISE and 
	accompanied by a degree of pain.  It hurts to remember.

	FLASH:  INT. T-BIRD - WOMAN'S STRUGGLE

	The faces of Skank and T-Bird are murky, ephemeral, their voices
	hideous, distorted echoes.  A knife snaps open.  We see the 
	blade.  Blood.  Skank hits her, pow! and --

				FLASH ENDS.

	An airborne crow POV spiralling up and away from them.

	perched on a fire escape, high above, watching and waiting.

	Skidding in, spotting the woman.  Kneeling to her.

				ALBRECHT
		Here now!  You're gonna be okay!
		Can you understand me?  I'm a

	The woman is no longer in pain.  Deathly calm now.

		I saw a ghost...

	Her eyes roll back and she dies in Albrecht's arms.

		Oh no... don't go, darlin', you

	BOOMING BACK from Albrecht, the woman, onlookers, as police

	EXT. ALLEY BEHIND ARCADES GAMES SUPPLY HOUSE - ON ERIC - NIGHT

	Eric in lurching flight, panting.  Stops and steadies against
	the wall across from the backside of Arcade Games.

	ANGLE - THE CROW (FLYING)

	Circling, then lighting on the fire escape above Eric.

	BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES - ("CROWVISION")

	"CROWVISION" is what the crow "gives" Eric to see.  Visually 
	distinct and immediately identifiable.

	ERIC'S POV - BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES

	Which he's already seen through the crow's eyes.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	looking up at the crow.  Disoriented.  Doesn't understand.
	Suddenly he cottons, and covers his eyes just in time to shield
	from:

	ANGLE - BACK OF ARCADE GAMES

	The rear windows EXPLODING outward in a spray of fire and
	debris.

	ANGLE - WITH ERIC

	he reels back, crashes into a dumpster.  Falls.

	ANGLE - THE CROW

	landing on the dumpsters edge near a pair of discarded combat
	boots in the trash.  Flames.

	LOW ANGLE - ERIC

	The blood from his hands mars his burial shirt.  He tears the
	shirt away, leaving his tie absurdly intact.  Wipes his face
	with his shirt.  Discards it.  Stops, held by his discovery --

	PUSH IN ON ERIC

	as his fingers explore the five puckered bullet punctures in his
	chest.  Almost a circle.  Comically, he feels his back foe exit
	wounds.  Then hauls himself upright, coming level with the crow.
	His glance at the bird is almost accusatory.

	ANGLE - THe CROW

	Inscrutable.  We should get the idea that some silent
	communication is taking place.

	ANGLE - ERIC'S FEET 

	bare, muddied, frozen.  TILT to Eric.  His gaze moves from the
	crow to the boots in the trash.  He grabs them, pushes them onto
	his bare feet.  His eyes catch the firelight.  Distant o.s.
	SIRENS

				ERIC
		Fire.  In the rain.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. CLUB TRASH - NIGHT

	We are now within the neon techno-depths of Club Trash.  The BG
	music is hard, savage, primal:  a doom-laden Radio Werewolf band
	rules.  Cabaret Blitzkrieg, packed with Death-to-Yup
	trendazoids.  We'll see more of this circus later.  Right now
	the BG SOUND is our biggest clue to the flavor of this
	establishment since we are --

	TIGHT CLOSE-UP A FRAMED 8X10

	Thinly filmed in dust, mounted among dozens of other band shots.
	Visible among the posed members of a group called Diabolique is
	Eric, wielding guitar on the club stage.  ND BLUR as people 
	CROSS FRAME.

	GRANGE, 45-50, powerful, a seasoned assassin, cruel but loyal.
	His facade remains stony as he leads three other men briskly
	down the corridor.:  NGO NWA, 50ish, clad Chinese gangster style
	- white topcoat, white scarf, tinted shades - and two body guards
	supplying a power perimeter around him,lean, dark-haired Asian
	killers who would gladly die for Ngo Nwa, which they will in 
	just a minute.

	They have just passed the Diabolique 8X10.  Ngo Nwa's gloved
	fingers, in passing, leave little skid tracks in the dust that
	clear the eyes of Eric in the photo.

	As the foursome reaches the DOOR, Grange turns doubtfully -- 
	suspiciously -- to Nwa.

				NGO NWA
		He will see me... unannounced.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE DOOR

	As Grange keys in the enter code the door hisses open.  Without
	a word, Nwa passes inside and the door is pulled shut in
	Grange's face by the Bodyguards, who post themselves to either
	side.

	INT. LAO'S NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

	The door CLOSES and the BG NOISE is GONE.  Through a large window
	(mirrored on the club side) all sorts of activity is visible
	through automatic mini-blinds.  A fly-vision bank of 12 TV
	monitors is hot with surveillance.

	LAO, a painfully clean-cut, Armani-clad Asian, impeccable,
	almost dashing, but the dynamic here is crystal clear: Nwa is
	the King: Lao, the dark prince in this hierarchy.

	At the desk, Lao is startled from his contemplation of a tiny,
	perfect rat skeleton by Ngo Nwa's unheralded entry.  The desktop
	is bare except for and Arcane Vietnamese fighting knife, half a
	meter long with an ideogrammed blade, dramatically positioned
	beneath an Artemide lamp.  Lao rises and feigns servility.

	NB:  The following exchange will play FAST, and entirely in
	VIETNAMESE.

				LAO
		(formal greeting)

				NWA
		(dismissiveness, contempt, then
		chastizing anger as:)

	Nwa INDICATES the blade with some ridicule.

				LAO
		(phony assuagement)

				NWA
		(knows it's bullshit)

	Lao turns, staring out the blinds, fighting for control.  Deep
	breath.  He turns back to his "master."  Nwa gestures broadly at
	the oppulent office, indicating that Lao should be grateful, but 
	is somehow errant
	 
				NWA
		(respect is required)

				LAO
		(begrudging agreement)

	Lao sees the blade.  An idea.  He lifts it reverently, bears it
	the Nwa hilt-first in both hands, as if bestowing a thing of
	immeasurable worth.

				NGO NWA
		(why give me this?)

	Nonetheless, Nwa accepts the blade.  It gleams.  Hypnotic. Even
	Nwa has to admire it.  Turns it so the blade is pointed at his
	sternum.  His attitude indicates Lao is too far away to do
	anything untoward.

				LAO
		(sinister punchline)

	Lao spins through the air and HEEL-KICKS the blade THROUGH Nwa's
	chest, pinning him to the door.  It's over so fast the gasp of
	astonishment never escapes Nwa.  Lao is much more than merely 
	treacherous, he is extremely capable.

				LAO
			(in perfect English)
		When I spoke of an offering, I
		didn't mean an offering to you.

	INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

	Grange, standing out of arm's reach in the corridor, kills both
	Bodyguards with a double headshot as they turn in greeting as the
	door OPENS.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR - LAO, GRANGE, AND CORPSES

	Lao exchanges a look with his right arm; Grange nods
	affirmatively.

				GRANGE
		You gonna smoke his bones now, or
		however it is you do it?

	Lao smiles indulgently.  He wipes the blood from the blade on
	the jacket of his ex-lord.  Lao now bows to no one. 

	EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - ANOTHER ALLEY - NIGHT

	Eric, wearing the combat boots, climbs as the crow leads him.
	Up.  He jams his hand on a rusty wedge of metal.  Ouch.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S PALM

	Blood flows from the gash.  He vises his fist shut.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON FIRE ESCAPE

	Eye-to-eye with the crow.  Opens his hand.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S PALM

	The blood flows back into the wound, which closes itself, 
	leaving another scar.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	Vising the rail.  Speaks to the night.  Almost a mantra.

				ERIC
		"My kitten walks on velvet feet,
		and makes no sound at all.  And in
		the doorway nightly sits to watch
		the darkness fall.  I think
		he loves the lady night..."
			(to crow)
		Am I alive?  Am I dead?  Something
		else?  Something in between?

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	Inscrutable.  No answer here.

	RESUME ERIC

	Almost bemused.  Steadier.  A hint of friendliness.

				ERIC
		Thanks for sharing that.

	ETC. GIDEON`S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	As the T-Bird grumbles tp park curbside.  Menacing.

	INT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	A junkyard of loot and dusty discards.  Junkie thievings and
	other people's stereos.  Behind a wire-meshed security counter
	GIDEON reads a racing form, chain-smoking throughout the scene.  He
	is pear-shaped, stubbled, unkempt.  Food on his shirt.  JINGLE
	of doorbells.  Gideon lowers his paper to reveal Skank and
	T-Bird on approach.

				GIDEON
		Ahhh, jesus, the creatures of the 
		night, here they come.  Tweedledum
		and Tweedledummer.

	Skank riles

				SKANK
		Hey, blow me, fat boy!

	Just as quick, Gideon cocks and levels a Magnum at Skank.

				GIDEON
		Blow yourself, bigmouth.

				T-BIRD
			(interposing)
		Whoa, hey, whoa.
			(hands up)
		Business.

	He lifts a small carton onto the counter.

				GIDEON
		Whatcha got?

	NEW ANGLE - COUNTER

	Transaction time.  T-Bird passes items through the screen slot 
	and Gideon gives each one cursory, doubtful inspection.

				T-BIRD
		Coupla more rings... 24k.

				GIDEON
		18k.  Crap.

				T-BIRD
		...necklace... pearls...

				GIDEON
		Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,

				T-BIRD
		Leather purse...

	He hands though the bag rested from the woman.

				GIDEON
		What's this -- a little, ah,
		bloodstain, right?
			(doesn't matter)
		Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm
		doin' you a --

				T-BIRD
		Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a 
		favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.

				SKANK
		You wouldn't want Top Dollar not 
		to smile.

	Mention of Top Dollar clams Gideon efficiently up.  He hands
	over the cash to T-Bird with a grimace.

	EXT. ROOFTOP - ON ERIC - NIGHT

	Eric stares upward at the crow as it drops like a bomber from
	the night sky, flying past him, skimming the roof, leading him
	on.  Eric exhales, shrugs, feeling mocked by the bird.

				ERIC
		All right.

	And he takes off on a run.  Only to stumble and fall.  But the
	falls turns into a TUMBLING ROLL that lands Eric back on his feet
	still moving.  He looks back as if to ask: "Did I do that?" and
	runs out of the frame.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - PICKING UP ERIC ON THE RUN.

	as he squints towards the crow and does his best to keep up.
	TRACK WITH HIM to the edge of the roof, heavily misted in rain.

	He jumps a negligible gap to the next lower roof.  The next 
	roof-top is a one-story jump down.  Eric clears the jump with a
	WOOF of air.  Keeping his eyes on the flying crow; gaining
	strength.  His next leap is more like a broad-jump.  Athletic.

	FAST MOVING ANGLE - THE CROW

	keeping airborne, keeping ahead.

	MOVING ANGLE - ERIC

	Eyes confidently on the sky as he arches out into space...

	UP ANGLE FROM STREET - BUILDINGS

	As Eric is seen to jump across the gap at least three stories up
	where there is no connecting building.

	CLOSE ANGLE - TARGET BUILDING LEDGE

	as Eric smashes into it, just missing, hinging at the waist,
	grabbing for purchase, suddenly panicked, gravity pulling him 
	downward.

	ANGLE - AT ERIC FROM PHONE CABLE BRACKET

	Eric falls but manages to grab the bracket one-handed.  He hangs
	for another deadly moment, then slowly, to his own astonishment,
	executes a one-handed pull-up that will save his ass.
				ERIC
		Gotcha.

	He completes the pull-up, bringing his chin level with the 
	ledge.  As he reaches for it with his other hand the bracket
	rips from the wall and Eric plummets, with a howl of defeat.

	UP ANGLE FROM STREET - ERIC'S DOWNFALL

	It's a looooooong way down.

	ANGLE - ALLEYWAY

	as Eric lands and splits a trash can in two.  A beat as we wonder
	if any bones are left unpulped.  PUSH IN as Eric rolls from
	facedown to his back.

	TIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE

	as he completes the roll, gasping, amazed he's still in one 
	piece.

	ANGLE - TRASHCAN - ON THE CROW

	It flies easily down to inspect Eric as he slowly sits up,
	examining his hands.  Frustrated and pissed off.

				ERIC
		Thanks.

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	Not "your welcome", but other-worldly patience.  It waits.

	RESUME ERIC

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Where're we going next -- the
		sewer?

	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Still, dark silence until Eric lands from ABOVE FRAME, feline.
	The crow lands simultaneously b.g., perched near a roof access
	door with a shaded, dim-yellow bulb.

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	It just blinks at him. 

	INT. ABANDONED STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	as Eric yanks open the rusty rooftop door from the outside and
	sweeps down the steps in a swirl of night mist

	ANGLE - FOOT OF STAIRS

	Trash and detritus all around, clogging the arteries of the
	building, which is old, unoccupied, forsaken.  The crow lights
	on a scarred banister knob.  Eric's footsteps come down into frame.

	ANGLE ON LOFT DOOR - INCLUDE ERIC

	A year ago this door was sealed with police barricade tape...
	which now sags, faded.

	A sticker across the jam notifies potential trespassers that
	this is -- was -- a crime scene.  Eric slows, stops, his hand
	on the banister.

	ANGLE - THE CROW

	as is wafts ahead of Eric, arriving at the door first.

	ANGLE ON ERIC, THE DOOR, THE CROW

	Eric has had enough.

				ERIC
		Are we finished yet?

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND ON BANISTER
	sliding along, as he speaks, until it hits a cigarette burn.

	PUSH IN ON ERIC - TIGHT

	stiffening as he suffers his second --

	FLASH:  IMAGES and DIALOG are not linked.  A rapidfire MONTAGE set
	in the loft, a year earlier (it is decorated for Halloween).
	The broken door.  The stairwell is filled with cops and cop 
	noise; lab guys bustle.  Albrecht is there, making notes as a
	DETECTIVE steps over to him.

				ALBRECHT
		Victim's name is Shelly Webster.
		The guy who got tossed is, uh ...--
			(checks his notebook)

	Albrecht grinds out his smoke on the banister.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC ON THE STAIRS.

	He sits down hard, hurting from the flash.  His eyes seek the 
	crow.  He completes Albrecht's line:

				ERIC
		"Draven, Eric."

	EXT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	LOW DOLLY of Elly's little combat boots moving toward the
	entryway of the pit.  MUSIC gradually UP LOUDER O.s. as she
	nears.

	ANGLE - ELLY IN DOORWAY

	Luridly-lit.  A grown-up's place.  A burly BOUNCER appraises
	her, his tone jokey.  He knows Elly.

				BOUNCER
		Hey!  You got any ID?

				ELLY
		Very funny.  Ha.  Ha.  Oh my,
		sides.

	The Bouncer jerks a thumb.  Go on in. 

	INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	A grungy sawdust-floored shot-and-beer joint packed tight
	with urban BURNOUTS rushing to drink their lives away.  Hammering
	MUSIC and rude whorehouse lighting.  Each predator straining to
	be badder than the next.

	TRACK THROUGH this maze at Elly's eye level until we reach 
	DARLA, waitressing her heart out, the drug mileage on her 
	obvious.

				ELLY
		Mom --?

				DARLA
		I told you you're not supposed
		to come in here.

				ELLY
			(a quick lie)
		I lost my key.

	Disgustedly -- goddamn kids -- Darla fishes up a key and slaps
	it into Elly's hand.

				FUNBOY (O.S.)
		Hey, Darla -- before we die of old
		age, how about it --?

				DARLA
			(to Elly)
		Out.  Now.  I gotta work.

	RACK PAST Darla and MOVE IN CLOSE on a corner table -- where sit
	Funboy, Skank, T-Bird and a black, vested muscle gypsy, TIN-TIN. 

	INT. LOFT - NIGHT

	As Eric shoves the door open from the outside.  The lock, popped
	from the frame, spins on the wooden floor.  The barrier tape
	whisps and dust roils.  Dark, chilly, damp.  A rat's nest of
	disuse.

	PULL BACK THROUGH THE BROKEN PICTURE WINDOW

	as Eric enters.  Glass blown out.  Shards poking.  Jagged.

	NEW ANGLE - AS ERIC WALKS IN

	He scans the loft.  Sees reflecting golden eyes near the floor.

	ERIC'S POV - FLOOR NEAR WINDOW

	A white, long-haired cat walks into a pool of night light.

	ANGLE - ERIC AND THE CAT

	He kneels.  Extends his hand.  The cat nears; likes Eric.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND.

	as the cat makes contact.  Sudden white jolt - a FLASH.

	FLASH:  we HEAR Eric strumming his Strat o.s.  We see what he
	saw:  Shelly, holding the cat.

							FLASH ENDS.

	UP ANGLE - ERIC

	Wincing.  Recovering from the flash.  He purposefully gathers
	the cat into his arms and braces for more, harder, stronger...

	FLASH:  A MAN and a WOMAN make love on a big bed amidst a hundred
	points of candlelight.  Shelly and Eric, once upon a time.

							FLASH ENDS.

	REVERSE ANGLE FROM BEDROOM DOOR - ON ERIC

	as the cat, dropped, hits the floor and scrambles out of the way.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	vising his head, teary-eyed, his nose bleeding.

				ERIC
		No!  Don't look!  No! No!

	He whirls unexpectedly and punches his fist completely through
	the masonry wall.
	FLASH:  Eric and Shelly in a mock waltz.  He spins her and they
	collapse on the bed.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	slowly pulling his arm out of the wall.

				ERIC
			(whispering)
		Stop it.

	His eyes roll up and he slumps the length of the door frame like
	a drowning man.

	ANGLE - GABRIEL

	watching Eric.  He hits with an o.s. THUD.

	INT. THE PIT - ON FUNBOY'S TABLE - NIGHT

	As a gloved hand sets up four bullets next to four shots.

				FUNBOY (O.S.)
		Let's have some fun.

	Funboy pops the bullet, like a contact capsule and washes it down.
	T-Bird turns to Tin-Tin, the new guy.

				T-BIRD	You first.

				TIN-TIN
		You're outta your fuckin' mind.

	Into it, almost jazzed, Tin-Tin downs his bullet and shot, and
	T-Bird does likewise.  Points to Skank.

				T-BIRD
		No.  I'm not the lunatic.  He is.

	Skank riles, pulls a huge Auto Mag and sticks it in T-Bird's
	face, cocking.

				SKANK
		Fuck you, T-Bird.

	Just as lightning fast, T-Bird has his own gun out and jammed
	right under Skank's jawbone.  He makes a kissy face.

				T-BIRD
		I love you too, you madman.

	They all crack up laughing like ax murderers.  Skank drinks,
	Tin-Tin spot checks the satchell from Top Dollar's.  Darla
	delivers more shots and funboy feels her ass.

				FUNBOY
		Hey, pussycat.

	INT. LOFT - DOWN ANGLE (CROW POV) - ERIC ON FLOOR

	He's awake.  Pushes himself up.

	REVERSE ANGLE - THE CROW

	Is perched in a dead light fixture, monitoring Eric.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON FLOOR

	He's awake.  Pushes himself up.  Realizes he is in the center of a 
	faint chalk outline on the hardwood floor.  He reaches to touch
	the dark stain of old blood.

	FLASH:  Shelly spills into frame, mouth bloodied.  T-Bird
	instantly on top of her, rough.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - WITH ERIC

	as he abandons the outline and staggers to the window... where
	he cuts open his hand on jags of glass.

	FLASH:  Eric held firm in the grasp of T-Bird and Funboy, one
	arm each.  Five bloody bullet holes in Eric's chest.

	The thugs 1-2-3 and hurl Eric backwards through the window,
	which shatters.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - ERIC AT THE WINDOW

	Reeling backward, same trajectory as in the Flash, but toward
	the floor, in SLO-MO.  Overloaded.  Blacking out.

	AS ERIC FALLS - INTERCUT MONTAGE

	A jumble of good/bad images from the loft:  Tin-Tin embedding a
	page of paper in the loft wall with a throwing knife...
	Shelly's face as she lights a candle... a POPPING champagne
	cork... the echoing CANNONADE of the shots that killed Eric...
	Skank backhanding Shelly... Shelly blowing bubbles from a
	clawfoot tub full of suds... Eric catching Funboy's first slug 
	high in the chest... NEW ANGLE of the glass in the window
	blowing out as T-Bird and Funboy through Eric through...

	ANGLE - ERIC'S REAL TIME FALL

	He plummets to BLACK OUT FRAME.  THUMP.  Out cold.

	INT. PIT - RESUMING FUNBOY'S TABLE - NIGHT

	Funboy contemplates his drink as the previous scene reverbs.

				FUNBOY
		More fun than a torture chamber.

	Tin-Tin's pocket pager goes BEEP and startles them all.  Skank
	nearly shoots it, jumpy.  Tin-Tin pulls back on a black leather 
	trenchcoat after clicking off the pager.

				TIN-TIN
		I hate this goddamn thing...

	ANGLE - DARLA watching them from a distance as Tin exits.

	INT. LOFT - FLOOR LEVEL - NIGHT

	An enormous cockroach trundles past, large in FRAME.  RACK to
	show Eric lying on floor b.g. as his eyes pop open.  A flurry of
	dark motion as the crow flies past frame.

	ANGLE -- THE CROW -- Having snatched the bug in it's beak.  Eats
	it.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	rising from the floor.  Careful.  Stealthy.  Watches his fireplace.

				ERIC
		We have company.

	ANGLE ON FIREPLACE

	Huge.  Marble.  COld.  Eric's paper mache masks of Comedy and
	Tragedy still hang there.  The Skull Cowboy steps out of the
	dark and into the vague blue light.  Shadowy as ever.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Having fun yet?  No?
			(beat)
		I'll give you a hint.  Remember
		whatshername?

				ERIC
		Shelly?

				SKULL COWBOY
		Miss her?

				ERIC
		Yes.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Kill the men who killed you both,
		and the Day of the Dead will be
		your reunion.

	The Skull Cowboy prestidigitates a flat throwing knife(like Tin-
	Tin's).  Eric's gaze follow it closely.

				SKULL COWBOY (CONT'D)
		You must use your eyes.

	He points to the crow.

	ANGLE - THE COMING KNIFE - ("CROWVISION")

	Weirdly distorted, a shared vision between Eric and the crow.

	TIGHT ON ERIC

	As he DUCKS out of the path of the knife he sees through the
	bird's eyes.  He rolls.

	ON THE CROW

	It hops out of the way as the knife embeds in the wall.  Eric's
	ROLL finishes him up nearby.

				ERIC
		Goddammit.

	He grabs for the knife as if to use it on the Skull Cowboy, but
	the knife causes an unexpected painful FLASH.

	FLASH:  Eric bouncing off the bedroom doorframe, Tin-Tin's knife
	stuck in his shoulder.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC

	vising his head with his hands, in pain.  Too much pain.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Get it?

				ERIC
		Leave me alone -- !

	He looks up, the Skull Cowboy is still there.

				SKULL COWBOY
			(contempt)
		Do something about it.
	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND THE SKULL COWBOY.

	A horrible beat between them.  The Eric runs full tilt across
	the room, bounding to the open window and then leaping.

	ANGLE - SKULL COWBOY

	as close to surprise as he gets.  Steps out to watch as --

	ANGLE ON WINDOW - ERIC

	FLIES feet first out into space.

	CLOSE-UP - BRICKWORK ABOVE WINDOWFRAME

	Eric's fingers smash into grip the tiny mortared gaps!

	EXT. LOFT BUILDING - UP ANGLE FROM STREET - NIGHT

	High above, Eric's feet shoot out the window, knocking loose
	stray shards that fall toward frame.  He swings into an upside-
	down pose, impossibly holding himself rigid against the
	building's side, face down. by his quarter-inch finger grip.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	Every muscle rigid, quivering with tension.  Hold.  Then he
	relaxes, and swings back inside.

	INT. LOFT - AT WINDOW, PICKING UP ERIC - NIGHT

	He arches, flips, to land on his feet.  The Skull Cowboy is
	gone.  No knife either.  The crow watches.  O.S. "meow".

	ANGLE - WITH ERIC AS HE TURNS TO SEE THE CAT

				ERIC
		I guess I'm not ready to leave...
		just yet.

	He picks up the cat -- wary of flashes, which don't come this
	time -- and returns to the window.  Feeling safer.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		The last time we saw each other,
		I didn't do so well.
			(holds cat up)
		Huh, Gabriel?

	He moves to the fireplace.  With his free hand, lifts the
	Tragedy mask off its hook.  Puzzles it, fact-to-mask.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I bet you need some cat food...
		right?

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT -ESTABLISHING:

	Eric walking, the Tragedy mask hanging from his hip.  An
	occasional PEDESTRIAN passes without comment, brutalized
	by the city.  Eric, more confident, smells the night's bouquet.

	EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT ("CROWVISION")

	Two men around a trashcan fire.  We should recognize Tin-Tin by 
	his black leather trench coat.  A wonderfully rude Rap tune, "Got
	a White WOman Tied Up In My Closet, Gonna Jab Her With A Stick,"
	RAZZLES b.g.

	EXT. STREET - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

	As Eric reacts to what the crow has just seen.  Slows.  Stops.
	And directs his attention toward the mouth of the alley.

	EXT. ALLEY - TIGHT ON TIN-TIN - NIGHT

	He pulls the nickel plated revolver from the satchel.  FOLLOW as
	he hands it across to RATSO, who removes the suitcase-sized boom 
	box (the source of the music) from his shoulder to accept.
	Ratso is a feral skull-head; street trash.

				TIN-TIN
		Three hundred and your a 
		gunslinger.

	HIGH ANGLE - TIN-TIN and RATSO

	As the crow is still watching, yet perched.  A brief
	shove-and-standoff.  The gun deal has gone bad.

				RATSO
		Please, TIn-Tin, you know I'm good
		for the money, man, I promise,
		Leslie put me up to it, please,
		man, don't --
			(choking scream)

	Tin-Tin has just up-rammed a throwing knife into Ratso.

				TIN-TIN
		Ratty -- shut the fuck up.

	Tin-Tin lifts Ratso on the knife, gutting him.  Ratso goes
	slack, deader'n hell.  Tin-Tin reaches around to click OFF 
	the boom box... then let's Ratso`s corpse fall.

				ERIC (O.S.)
		Another satisfied customer?

	TIGHT ANGLE - TIN-TIN

	galvanized by the surprise voice.  He automatically draw a
	fresh knife from the bandolero of knives across his chest inside
	the coat.  Can't yet track the source of the voice.

				TIN-TIN
		Who the hell is that?
			(beat, venomous)
		Come on out man, I won't hurt
		you.

	ANGLE - ERIC IN ALLEY

	He steps out from behind another flaming trashcan.  Wearing a 
	long black scarf and the Tragedy mask.

				ERIC
		Hello, Tin-Tin.

	ANGLE ON TIN-TIN - AS HE RISES (FROM RATSO)

	trying to process what he sees.  And cover.  And buy time.

				TIN-TIN
		Little early from trick-or-treat,
		homie.
			(re: Ratso)
		This dick trying to bushwack me.

				ERIC
		Murderer.

	Tin-Tin blows out a breath.  No bluff.  Time to kill again.

				TIN-TIN
		Guess you got that goddamn right.

	He shrugs.  The shrug becomes the launch of a knife.

	TIGHT SHOT - MOVING - ERIC

	His black-gloved hand slaps away the incoming knife and inch from
	his nose.  It CLATTERS.  Eric continues striding toward Tin-TIn.

				ERIC
		Try harder.  Try again.

	SHIFTING ANGLE - ERIC NEARS TIN-TIN

	as Tin-TIn throws another knife.  Eric closing in.  He claps
	hand together, immobilizing the next knife.  Opens his hands,
	almost an "oops" gesture.  Keeps on coming.

	ANGLE - ERIC AND TIN-TIN

	As they meet.  Tin-Tin attempts a roundhouse.  Eric blocks it
	and smashes Tin-Tin into the alley wall.

				ERIC
		A year ago.  Halloween.  A man
		and a woman.  In a loft.  You
		helped to murder them.

				TIN-TIN
		Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...
			(beat)
		Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her
		too, I think.

				ERIC
		You cut her.  You raped her.
			(rage)
		You watched!

				TIN-TIN
		Hey, I got my rocks off, so
		fuck you in the ass, man.
		
	They're face-to-face now, sweaty and tense.  Eric peels off
	the Tragedy mask.

				ERIC
		I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.

				TIN-TIN
		I don't know you...

	But, as Eric bears down on Tin-TIn, Tin begins to recognize him.
	Fear.  Sweat.

	For the first time, Tin-Tin starts to loose control.

				TIN-TIN (CONT'D)
		Holy shit... you're dead, man...

	EXTREME CLOSE-UP - ERIC

				ERIC
		Victims.  Aren't we all.

	INT. LOFT - NIGHT

	TIGHT ANGLE - TABLETOP

	as Eric's hands place Ratso's boom box on the table and click on 
	suitable weird b.g. MUSIC.

	ANGLE - FLOOR LEVEL

	Eric's boots pass frame.  An open can of cat food CLANKS down
	big in f.g.  as Eric walks b.g. obviously wearing Tin-Tin's 
	trenchcoat.  Gabriel noses into to frame to eat from the can.

	INT. LOFT, BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

	Shelly's vanity.  Dusty, disused.  The mirror spiderwebbed with
	cracks but still hanging precariously in its frame.  Eric is 
	seated, his image crazily split into many.  He pulls on a long-
	sleeved, tight-knit, black shirt.

	WIDEN ANGLE to reveal the loft now lit with dozens of candle
	stubs.  Placed all around.  Ceremonial and weird.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

				ERIC
		Halloween is coming.  The Day of the Dead...

	In the mirror, multi Eric's.  He touches the glass, tightening up 
	as he realizes he's in for another --

	FLASH:  Shelly, sleeping on her divan, a year ago, wakes as Eric
	(O.S.) says "Boo".  She cracks an eye open.

				SHELLY
		Your scary quotient needs work.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AT VANITY

	Considering old cosmetics.  Everything he touches will hurt him.
	But he's ready to eat this pain.  He grabs a lipstick.

	FLASH:  Shelly at the vanity in happier times

				SHELLY
		I think red's my color, don't you?

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC

	wincing.  He drops the lipstick on the floor.  Grabs a
	hairbrush.

	FLASH:  Eric smashes into the street after his death-fall,
	trailing broken glass.

							FLASH ENDS.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC AT VANITY

	Later.  He's wearing white pancake makeup on his cheeks.  Shaky.

	FLASH:  Eric sucks up Funboy's gunshots in the chest.  1-2-3-4.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUMING ERIC AT VANITY

	his face a crazy warpaint maze of white streaks, not blended
	yet.  He looks at his own reflection.  In one cracked,
	triangular facet of the mirror is not a multiple of his face,
	but the Skull Cowboy.  Just one.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Glad to see you're finally with
		the program.

				ERIC
		Bugger off to the graveyard, skull-
		face, I'm busy.

				SKULL COWBOY
		You work for the dead.  Forget
		that, and you can forget it all.

	The Cowboy tips his hat and isn't there.  Eric sees the crow
	perched on the edge of the mirror now.

				ERIC
		Forget this.

	He smears the streaks until his face is uniformly grave-wave
	white.

	ANGLE - GABRIEL THE CAT

	coming in to sniff around the clutter at the foot of the vanity.
	Eric looks down towards him... and toward the lipstick he dropped.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND

	as it glides down to pick up the lipstick.  CONTACT, and --

	FLASH:  Eric, smashed on the street, T-Bird's car b.g., upside down
	in Eric's POV as he rolls over and blood courses from both
	corners of his mouth,  a definite foreshadow of the "Crow" face.

							FLASH ENDS.
	RESUMING ERIC AT VANITY - TIGHT

				ERIC
		She always red red was her color.

	EXTREME CLOSE - THE MIRROR

	We see only a reflected corner of Eric's mouth as he duplicates
	the blood trail in red lipstick, making one one half of a crow
	harlequin smile.

	EXT. LOFT BUILDING - LATER - NIGHT

	A MEDIUM SHOT as lightning strikes; a storm brews.

	EXT. LOFT - LATER - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S BOOTS

	crossing the floor.  Tin-Tin's knife slotted to the bucklework.

	CLOSE-UP - VANITY

	Eric's hands discard a hairbrush there.  He moves off.

	CLOSE-UP - GABRIEL

	looking up o.s., watching his master stalk around with purpose.
	Thunder rumbles long o.s.

	ANGLE - AT ERIC IN WINDOW FROM OUTSIDE

	The storm boils.  Eric framed in broken window.

	CLOSER ANGLE - ERIC IN WINDOW

	Eric all in black,  Firm-wrapped.  Tight-wired.  The trenchcoat
	flutters, cloak-like.  His shadowy face framed by the upturned
	collar, his hair punkish and spiky.

	SIDE ANGLE - ERIC

	as he moves forward in the light.  The crow lights on his shoulder.

				ERIC
		All right, bad guys...

	FRONT VIEW - ERIC

	Full crow regalia.  Face makeup streamlined.  Eric's eyes flash.

				ERIC
			(in drawn out yell)
		Here I commme -- !

	PULL BACK swiftly, vertiginously, as Eric swan dives from the
	window, his voice a howl.

	UP ANGLE FROM STREET - ERIC'S FALL

	Coat, wing-like.  MATCH his dive yell with o.s. crow SCREECH.
	SLOW MOTION as Eric fills the frame and we --

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. ALLEY - WHERE TIN-TIN GOT IT - NIGHT

	Cop lights bounce, competing with the trash fires.  Albrecht and
	several other UNIFORMS assess the double-death scene.  A
	detective, TORRES tries to appear in charge.

				TORRES
		Couldn't have happened to a nicer 
		couple.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND TORRES OVER DEAD TIN-TIN

	Tin-Tin frozen in deathshock, all of his knives sticking out of 
	him.  Dead Ratso, b.g., where he fell.

				ALBRECHT
		Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not
		here, neither is T-Bird -- none
		of Top Dollar's number ones.

				TORRES
		You know, you sure got a hard-on for
		a guy that's guilty of zip on
		paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime;
		what's the matter, don't you like
		adult entertainment?

				ALBRECHT
		This sack of shit is called Tin-
		Tin.

				TORRES
		Don't any of your little pals have
		real, grown up names?

				ALBRECHT
		He was a runner for Top Dollar.
		Just muscle.

				TORRES
		Was.
				ALBRECHT
			(sigh)
		This isn't Top Dollar's style
		anyway.  This was somebody else.
		Somebody new.

	Albrecht lights a fresh smoke.  Torres waves the smoke away.

				TORRES
		And you're gonna tell me who.

				ALBRECHT
		Who ever made that.

	Albrecht points.  CAMERA FOLLOWS to wall behind Tin-Tin.  A crow
	silhouette has been daubed in blood there, now dry.

				TORRES
		What in the hell... do you
		call that?

				ALBRECHT
		I call it blood, Detective.  If
		you want, you can call it graffiti.

	INT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP of Gideon's thick fingers shuffling grimy currency.
	Some scratchy 1920's TUNE plays throughout b.g., like a broadcast
	from another time and place.

	TIGHTER ANGLE - GIDEON

	looking up at a metallic SOUND, o.s.  Irritated.

				GIDEON
		Piss off, we're closed.

	As the outside security gate rattles, Gideon draws his magnum
	and approaches the front door.

				GIDEON
		Fucking creatures of the night;
		they never goddamn learn.

	Sudden surprise as he sees the silhouette of the gate SCREE back
	against the frosted glass of the front door.

				GIDEON (CONT'D)
		HEY!!

	And he hustles to close up the distance between himself and the
	door, gun up.  Before he can touch the door, the crowbar comes
	rocketing through the glass, pegging Gideon in the forehead and 
	knocking him flat on his ass.  He loses the pistol.
	Eric walks through the door, causing the fractured glass to
	disintegrate around him.  He disclaims, thespian.

				ERIC
		"Suddenly I heard a tapping, as of
		someone gently rapping, rapping at
		my chamber door."
			(pause)
		You heard me rapping, right?

	LOW ANGLE - GIDEON ON THE FLOOR

	reacting to Eric's weird appearance and looking for his gun.

				GIDEON
		Oh, bullshit!  You're trespassing
		asshole, you're breakin'
		and enterin' and you just bought me a
		fucking door!

	During Gideon's rant, Eric brushes glass cubes from his
	shoulders, nonplussed.  Now he flings Gideon across the room.

	Gideon crashes into the counter cage.  As Eric advances on him:

				ERIC
		I'm looking for something in an
		engagement ring.  Gold.

	As Eric comes up behind him, Gideon reaches through the open
	cage door and pulls a big combat knife from beneath the counter.

				GIDEON
		You're looking for a coroner,shit-
		for-brains!

	And he tries to nail Eric with the knife.

	NEW ANGLE - BEHIND GIDEON - AS GIDEON SWINGS

	No Eric behind him.  TILT to reveal Eric hanging off the cage
	above Gideon.  Eric slams the cage door against Gideon's head.
	Drops down like a spider and collects the knife.

				ERIC
		I repeat: a gold engagement ring.
		It was pawned here, a year ago, by
		another gentleman whose name, I
		believe was... "T-Bird"?

	IN TIGHT ON ERIC AND GIDEON

	Eric twists Gideon's sail-like shirt and Gideon turns bright red.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Cute nickname, don't you think?

				GIDEON
			(gasping)
		I ain't got no fuckin' ring.

				ERIC
		Wrong answer.

	Eric nails Gideon's hand to the counter top.  Gideon howls!

				GIDEON
		All's I got is in a box!  Behind
		the counter!

	Eric jumps through the cage door.  Gideon's eyes bug as he sees 
	his own pierced hand, immobilized.

	ANGLE - ON ERIC BEHIND THE COUNTER

	scans the shelves.  Rows of boxed ammo.  Kerosene tins.  A shotgun.  
	Knives and assorted knuckle duster curios.  And the ring box.

	CLOSE-UP - THE RING BOX IN ERIC'S HAND.

	Dozens of gold rings.  Eric's fingers sift through them.

	TIGHTER ON ERIC

	He brings each ring to his face.  INTERCUT with Gideon's feeble
	struggles and invective, o.s.

				ERIC
		No... no... no... no...

	He tosses each rejected ring over his shoulder.  Until:

	CLOSE-UP - THE RING IN ERIC'S HAND

	Obliterated by a stab of brilliant white light --

	FLASH:  Shelly's face.  A perfect vision...

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUMING ERIC

	He closes his fist tightly around the ring.  A moment of
	decision.  Then he draws the shotgun from beneath the counter.
	Uses the butt to knock the knife free of Gideon's hand.  It goes
	spinning across the countertop.  Eric shucks the shotgun and
	rams it into Gideon's nose as the big man slumps to the floor.

				ERIC
		Tin-Tin confided in me, before he
		ran out of breath.  You have one
		chance to live.
				GIDEON
		No fucking way.  He'll kill me.

				ERIC
		Who would waste time killing you...
		besides me?

	Gideon sweats, pants, contemplates the hole in his hand.

				GIDEON
			(cowed)
		Top Dollar.

				ERIC
		Another jolly nickname?

				GIDEON
		You want those assholes, you want 
		Top Dollar.

				ERIC
		T-Bird?

				GIDEON
		Like the car.  He hangs out with
		Skank. that little ass-hair, and
		they hang at the Pit -- hell,
		Funboy lives there.  Ask Top
		Dollar.

				ERIC
		A whole club of pirates, with
		pirate names...

	Eric seems to go berserk, SMASHING and PUNCTURING cans of
	flammables and powder while Gideon flinches, nursing his holed
	hand.  Blows just miss Gideon's head.  Soon he's cowering.

	LOW ANGLE - ERIC

	Looking down at Gideon in revulsion.

				ERIC
		You feed off the living.

	SMASH!  as another tin ceases to exist next to Gideon.  Then
	Eric is gone, past him without further word, ignoring him
	entirely.  As he exits, shotgun shouldered, he pauses to admire
	a white Fender Strat hanging among the pawnables.  He reaches 
	for it.

	ON GIDEON

	As he summons some last minute budget bravery.

				GIDEON
		You walk outta here Top Dollar
		will erase your ass!  Top Dollar
		owns the fucking street here and
		you can't dick with me, you son of
		a bitch! 

	RESUME ERIC - FRAMED IN DOORWAY

	The guitar now bowslung across his back, the shotgun levelled at
	Gideon's position.

				ERIC
		One chance to live.  Take it.

	MOVE IN TIGHT ON GIDEON

	as he realizes what Eric means.  Hauls ass and bangs through the
	rear door with a bleat of terror.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC IN DOOR  

	as he cuts loose with the shotgun.

	EXT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	as seen from across the street.  Eric silhouetted, unmoving as
	the whole store front blows hellaciously out around him, raining
	glass and debris.  Stirring his hair.  Eric is the black eye of
	the fireball.

	LOW ANGLE - FRONT OF PAWN SHOP - EMPHASIZE ERIC

	lit by flames and residual explosions.  He hurls the shotgun
	into the inferno.  Casually brushes flaming/smoking detritus
	from his own clothes.

				ALBRECHT (O.S.)
		Don't move! I said don't move.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC

	as he turns slowly, to see Albrecht, out of reach, gun drawn.
	Eric's attitude lightens; Albrecht is not the threat here.

				ERIC
		I thought the police always said
		"freeze:.

	Albrecht divides his attention, jumpy, between the odd sight of
	Eric (guitar on his back), and the raging instant inferno of
	Gideon's.

				ALBRECHT
		I'm the police and I say don't
		move, Snow White.  You're under
		arrest; I don't care what else is 
		wrong with you!  You move and
		you're dead.

	Eric has begun to pace towards Albrecht.  Palms up.  A gesture of
	submission.  Albrecht's battle calm begins to waiver.

				ERIC
		And I say I'm dead... and I move.

				ALBRECHT
		No further.  I'm serious.

	Eric bows, bringing his forehead in line with the gun's muzzle.

				ERIC
		Then shoot, if you will.

	TIGHT ANGLE - ALBRECHT

	He gives it up.  Can't shoot.  This is too weird for him.

				ALBRECHT
		Are you nuts, walking into a gun?

	NEW ANGLE - LESS THREATENING - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

				ERIC
		You must listen carefully:  the 
		Fire Department will be here soon.
		There is an injured man in the 
		alley who needs assistance.
			(meaningfully)
		As Shelly Webster once needed your 
		assistance, and as you are shortly 
		going to need my assistance.

	Albrecht gestures casually, almost comically, with his pointed
	gun.  B.g., the crow lands on a fire escape to monitor them.

				ALBRECHT
		You wanna run that back for me one
		time?

	SIRENS near, o.s.  Eric listens to them, to the night.

				ERIC
		Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the
		street here."  He will "erase
		my ass."

				ALBRECHT
		You don't say.

				ERIC
		I know Top Dollar has turned your 
		streets into his hell.

				ALBRECHT
		Fucking A, my friend.

				ERIC
		The others are called Skank, T-
		Bird.  Street names.  Funboy.
			(beat)
		Watch me, office Albrecht.

	Eric lifts a chunk of glass from the sidewalk.  Slow and easy.
	Albrecht doesn't completely trust him.  Up comes the gun.

				ALBRECHT
		Watch it...

	Eric slices open his palm.  Blood flows.  To his fingertips.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

	as Eric quickly daubs a crow silhouette in blood on the wall...
	then exhibits the gashed hand to Albrecht.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND

	as the blood retreats and the wound seals itself up.

	TIGHT ON ALBRECHT

	and the silhouette.  Mouth hangs.

				ALBRECHT
		You're the one who did Tin-Tin...

	PULL BACK FAST to reveal Eric is gone from the frame.  Albrecht does
	a quick 180.  No Eric.  Flashbars from incoming units begin
	to bounce red and blue off his face.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Great.  Good night.  Guy shows up
		looking like a mime from hell.
			(beat)
		Least he didn't do that "walking
		against the wind" shit;  I hate
		that.

	EXT. SHOWTIME - NIGHT - TO ESTABLISH.

	A night-owl pornucopia.  T-Bird enters beneath a garish theater
	marquee.  The 2-bill:  RUMP ROMP with BUTTBUSTERS II.

	INT. SHOWTIME LOBBY - NIGHT

	T-Bird approaches the snack bar.  Wet, breathy mating NOISES
	from the auditorium throughout, o.s.  Looking supremely bored,
	the counterman, DICKEY BIRD, thumbs a porn tabloid.  So what.

				DICKEY BIRD
		T-Bird.  Thrill me.

				T-BIRD
		Business.

	T-bird heads left through s steal door that Dickie buzzes
	open for him.

	INT.  SHOWTIME AUDITORIUM (BACKSTAGE) - NIGHT

	T-Bird walks past dust-covered boxy black speakers as we glimpse
	Lance and Angelique making history in reverse, on the back of the 
	movie screen: oratoria as good as porn films can make it.

				PORN QUEEN (O.S.)
		I don't know how to describe how
		I feel, Lance -- so restless --

				PORN KING (O.S.)
		You're my Moon Queen, Angelique.

				PORN QUEEN (o.S.)
		Oooh -- I want you're rocket right
		now in my Sea of Tranquility -- 
		Lance --

	ANGLE - CATWALK STAIRS

	As T-Bird approaches, the movie sounds dwindle o.s.  He ascends
	the skinny metal stairway two steps at a time.

	ANGLE - STEEL FACED DOOR AT TOP OF STAIRS.

	As T-Bird nears it, a viewplate SNAPS open to asses him.  By
	the time he reaches the top, the door unbolts to admit him.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	As T-Bird enters.  The room is organized around a long meeting
	table and flavored with a taste of everything illegal:  drug
	paraphernalia, weapons.

	Across the table are a couple of Sentries like the one that
	admits T-Bird to the room.  TRACK PAST them to a lank-haired
	silhouette as he turns away from a windowshade, backlit by
	Showtime's exterior neon.

	This is TOP DOLLAR.  Who looks like a Johnny Winter acid 
	casualty but is deadly cold, definitely the man in charge.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Wild fucking night.  I hear our
		pal Tin-Tin got himself very dead.

				T-BIRD
		And Gideon's just burned all the
		down to the foundation.

	Top's eyebrows go up.  Oh really?

				T-BIRD (CONT'D) 
		I didn't have nothin to do with
		that.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Bet that pisses you off, right?

				T-BIRD
		Top, what the fuck is going on
		tonight?

				TOP DOLLAR
		Stay normal, T.  Cops'll be all
		hotwired and aggressive.  No
		combat moves until I check this
		out.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT - (~CROWVISION") HIGH ANGLE

	Taking in the street, the Pit, and a little girl seated on an
	abandoned car.

	ANGLE - STREET LEVEL - ON ELLY.

	Seated on the looted wheelless car, playing with a small doll.

	CLOSER ANGLE - ON ELLY

	She doesn't notice someone is watching her yet.

	TIGHT ON DOLL, THEN ELLY

	She looks up o.s. at Eric, who is still out of the frame.

				ELLY
		What are you supposed to be?  A clown?

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	He smiles for what seems to be the first time.  Warm, even past
	his crow makeup.

				ERIC
		Sometimes.

	He glances back and logs the location of the Pit for later, not
	in a big hurry just now.  Turns back to Elly.

	WIDE ANGLE - ERIC AND ELLY

				ELLY
		You look like a rock star without a
		job.

				ERIC
		I dabble.  May I?

	He indicates the car hood, a "seat" next to Elly from which he
	may observe the Pit.

				ELLY
		If you're not some kinda child 
		molester.

	Eric looks behind himself.  Who, me?  Genuinely amused.  He 
	shakes his head no and sits down next to Elly. 

	INT. CLUB TRASH - NIGHT

	The music POUNDS and smoke is everywhere, like incense.
	INTERCUTS of the clientele, retro, robotic, clove cigarettes and
	rubber clothing; fetish casual wear.

	ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR

	right in the center of the noise, looking downscale and dirty
	in this milieu.

	ANGLE - ANOTHER CUSTOMER

	Passing Top, appraising him, finding him as boring as life
	itself.  Undertaker chic, she stares at Top.

				TOP DOLLAR
		I thought Halloween was tomorrow
		night.

	An Oriental bodyguard passes him in f.g., motioning to follow.

	INT. LAO'S NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

	Lao watches club activity on his flybank of TVs.  When Top
	Dollar shows up at the office door two Sentries try to bar his 
	passage.  He shoves through.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Get outta my way, you mooks.

	Lao's demeanor indicates that they should not kill Top.

				LAO
		An unexpected pleasure.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Bad news.  Alot of action on the
		streets tonight, and nobody
		bothered to clear it with me.  Tin-
		Tin got himself whacked.

				LAO
		Who got himself what?

				TOP DOLLAR
		One of mine.  And it wasn't a 
		standard hit.

				LAO
		I had heard something like this.
			(beat)
		Describe it for me.  The "hit".

				TOP DOLLAR
		I was wondering if you could tell
		me anything... about a wildcat
		operative.

				LAO
		I know of no one.
			(beat)
		But even if there is, I am sure it
		is nothing outside your capacity 
		to deal with?

				TOP DOLLAR
		Anybody violates my turf -- our 
		turf -- I'll rip out there heart 
		and show it to 'em.

				LAO
		To be sure.  Now tell how your 
		friend died.

	INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - NIGHT

	ANNABELLA, a comfortable large, spider-in-the-web deskworker,
	sits typing at a terminal.  Miked headphone in one ear, police
	scanner chatter o.s.  She blows and pops a pink bubble of gum.

				ALBRECHT (O.S.)
		Annie?

	ANGLE - ANNABELLA AND ALBRECHT

	Albrecht enters frame from across her countertop.

				ANNABELLA
		Whatever it is, the answer's no,
		Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.

				ALBRECHT
		Annie, I need a file.

	There is a desperate edge to Albrecht's voice.

				ANNABELLA
		Speak up.
			(beat; her guard up)
		Clear it with the Captain if you
		need a file.

				ALBRECHT
		This is special, darlin'.  Please?

	Annabella eyes Albrecht doubtfully.  Fatalistic sigh.

				ANNABELLA
		Just don't tell me you "owe me
		one."  What file?

				ALBRECHT
		Double homicide.  A year ago.
		Las Halloween.

	EXT. STREET NEAR THE PIT - ERIC AND ELLY - NIGHT

	Still hanging by the car, a bit more familiar with each other
	now.  A low-slung mirror-windowed LIMOUSINE hisses past them and
	curbs across the street from the Pit.

				ELLY
		My mom works over there.  I'm
		waiting for her, but she's
		probably with him, right now.

				ERIC
		Who?
				
				ELLY
		Mister Funboy.

				ERIC
		Mister Funboy lives there?

	TWO SHOT - ELLY AND ERIC - (PIT B.G.)

				ELLY
		He has a room, upstairs.  I don't
		like him very much.

	Elly is not happy about this.  B.G. we see Grange get out of the 
	car, heading to the Pit, and notice in passing a guy with the
	white face talking to the little girl down on the block.

				ELLY (CONT'D)
		Can you play that thing or do you
		just carry it around everywhere?

	Elly indicates the guitar strapped to Eric' back.

				ERIC
		I can pick out a tune now 
		and again.

				ELLY
		Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"
			(re: doll)
		It used to be her favorite.

				ERIC
		Does she have a name?

				ELLY
		No name.  You sure ask a lot of
		questions.

	Elly HANDS the doll to Eric and he experiences a wholly 
	unexpected flash.

	FLASH:  Elly and SHelly sitting as SHelly's vanity, goofing with
	makeup, test-driving lipstick, the doll visible on the vanity.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC - AS THE DOLL DROPS FROM HIS HAND

	Pain is trying to fight it's way out of Eric in surges. 

				ELLY (OS)
			(smart alec)
		Hel-lo?  Earth to anybody...?

	Eric snaps out of it.  Elly retrieves the doll.

				ELLY (CONT'D)
		Do you feel okay.

				ERIC
		No.

				ELLY
		You gotta go now, I bet.

				ERIC
		I have to go.

	Half-zomboid, half-determined, he exits.

	INT. PIT - NIGHT - WITH GRANGE

	As he circulates to the bar, unimpressed.  To the bouncer:

				GRANGE
		Top Dollar?

				BOUNCE
		Never heard of him.

				GRANGE
		Funboy?

				BOUNCER
		Oh, prob'ly upstairs bangin'
		Darla.  Pay for your own beer and
		they'll prob'ly be down before you 
		can drink it.

	INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP of an 8x10 of the loft slaughter in Albrecht's hands.
	Subject: a document pinned to the wall with a knife.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AT DESK.

	flipping through the file. Smoking.

	ANGLE - THE 8X10 IN ALBRECHT'S HAND

	Subject: Eric, dead in the street in front of the loft 
	building.  The blood on his face reminiscent of his crow face.

	As Albrecht's hand moves the photo we can see in the file
	several band shots of Eric as a member of Diabolique... 
	including the shot on Lao's wall gallery of past performers at
	Club Trash.

	A DOUGHUT on a paper plate suddenly touches down in the middle
	of all this research, startling Albrecht.

	ANGLE - ANNABELLA BEHIND HIM

				ANNABELLA
		Don't thank me.  Your ass is
		already in enough trouble for this shit.

				ALBRECHT
		I knew that.

	Albrecht holds a typewritten page closer to the the light.

	CLOSE-UP DOCUMENT, torn by the knife hole made by Tin-Tin.

	It reads:  We, the Undersigned tenants of 1929 Calderone Court
	Apartments...

				ALBRECHT
		Another nice white girl with a
		cause.  Like a big KICK ME sign.

	Albrecht takes up and 8x10 of Eric's face.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Shelly Webster.  And her nice 
		white boyfriend, Eric Draven.

	With a felt-tip pen he superimposes the crow smile, like the make-
	up, like the blood.

				ANNABELLA
		Your last little wild goose chase
		got you busted back to the Beat 
		Patrol, just like in a bad
		detective story, Eddie. Are we
		doing the wildgoose thing again?

	UNDER THIS Albrecht sketches in Eric's spiky Crow hairdo.

				ALBRECHT
		Could be.

				ANNABELLA
		You gonna wind up working at a school
		crosswalk.   that doughnut's 
		chocolate you, know.

	PUSH IN on the doctored photo.  It's Eric.  It's the Crow.

	PUSH IN on ALbrecht.

				ALBRECHT
		Well, hello there...chocolate,

				ANNABELLA
		Don't thank me.

				ALBRECHT
		Thanks, babe.

	INT. THE PIT (REAR) - ERIC ON FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

	Climbing.  The crow perched on his shoulder.  Not in a hurry.

				ERIC
		It's a Raymond Chandler evening
		And the pavements are all wet, And
		I'm lurking in the shadows, for it 
		hasn't happened ...

	TIGHT CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	Impish.  Clown killer.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		... yet.

	INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	Grange at a table.  SMoking and waiting.  No beer.  His back
	protected, he is stationed near the fire stair door and has a
	good overview of the room.

	INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP of a base pipe being lit and hit hard.

	EXT. THE PIT (REAR) - FIRE ESCAPE - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

	Eric's gloved hand slides sinuously up rusted railing.

	INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	A hypodermic needle rises into frame.  A nicotined fingernail
	flicks bubbles in the syringe.  FOLLOW needle down and BROADEN
	ANGLE: Funboy taps up a vein in Darla's arm and shoots her up.
	Both are naked in a shabby bed.  Bare lightbulb above.

				DARLA
		Ooh, baby -- gimme all of it.

	CLOSE-UP - THE NEEDLE

	As the plunger depresses.

	ANGLE - ON THE WINDOW

	As the crow quite unexpectedly arrives and perches on the sill,
	scaring the shit out of our two dopey friends.  Funboy pulls a
	giant auto pistol; mock aims, calms down, doesn't fire.

				DARLA
		It's a big fucking bird...

	She falls back against her pillow, eyes dreamily defocusing.
	Funboy giggles.  Relaxes the gun, which half-disappears into the 
	sheets at his side.

				FUNBOY
		It's a squab.  Here bird, Here,
		birdie...

	NEW ANGLE - DARLA AND FUNBOY

	Except that Eric now stands near their bed, across from the 
	bird's position, the guitar bowslung.

				ERIC
		Here Funboy.

	Contained panic as Funboy and Darla both startle.  The needle 
	flies and lands at Eric's feet.  Empty.  Funboy struggles to
	maintain against his high.

				FUNBOY
		Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do
		that, man.  I nearly had a fucking
		heart attack.

				DARLA
		Fun -- look at that guy...

				FUNBOY
		It's just the dope, don't worry

				DARLA
		Fun, he's not going away; he's 
		scaring the piss outta me!

				FUNBOY
		Not me.

	Funboy draws the gun from underneath the sheers.  Suddenly he seems
	totally focused.

				FUNBOY (CONT'D)
		Time for you to take your bird and 
		leave, freako.

	Eric rips open his shirtfront to reveal a circlet of bullet
	punctures.  This gives Funboy pause.
				ERIC
		Take your shot funboy.  You got 
		me, dead bang.

	Funboy tilts the gun off target.  Grins as Eric flat handedly
	past his chest, indicating where to shoot.

				FUNBOY
		You are seriously fucked up, man.
		Just look at yourself.

	In a blur, he sighs, and shoots Eric through the heart.

				FUNBOY (CONT'D)
		BANG!  He shoots, he scores!

	Then his expression drags a little bit.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	Looking down and daubing his hand in the bullet wound on his chest.

				ERIC
		Bull's eye.  Good shot.

	ANGLE - DARLA

	who starts scrambling to get out.  Grabbing clothes on the floor
	around herself. she runs right into Eric's outstretched hands.

				ERIC
		Stay.

	Eric twists her arm.

	CLOSE-UP - DARLA'S FOREARM.

	where we may clearly see the needle tracks.  

	UP ANGLE - ERIC 

				ERIC
		Morphine is bad for you.

	He holds her arm captive.  Tight, and we PUSH IN CLOSER to see
	the dope evacuating from the punctures, a reverse of Eric's,
	Blood trail.  The dope drips from Darla's arm to the floor.
	Darla's eyes roll up into the unconscious.  She slumps.

	ANGLE - ON FUNBOY - GAWPING

				FUNBOY
		How the hell did you do that?
		
				ERIC
		Magic.

	Funboy regards Eric's battlescars and guitar.

				FUNBOY
		Either die or do a solo.

	Eric looks briefly to his chest wound, wincing.  He can't seem
	to make it tie off fast enough.  He turns his attention back to
	Funboy.  But his strength is mysteriously ebbing.

				ERIC
		Neither.

				FUNBOY
		Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.

	Funboy lashes out and broadsides Eric across the temple with the
	gun.  Eric falls, rolls back to a stance, but Funboy is right on
	top of him, howling like a lunatic and pistol-whipping Eric
	relentlessly.

				FUNBOY
		I hate trespassers!
			(whack!)
		I hate prowlers!
			(whack!)
		I hate peeping toms!
			(whack!)
		And right now I hate you!

	ANGLE - WALL NEAR BATHROOM

	as Eric, caught off-guard by Funboy's hyper high and weakened by
	his wound, comes slamming into the wall, losing his footing.
	Here comes Funboy, and we TILT UP from Eric's position as he 
	looms, cocking the pistol, which now has Eric's blood on it.

				FUNBOY
		Ahh, the hell with it, I still got
		five shots left.

	In a blur, Eric grabs Funboy`s gun hand.  Twists to the 
	crunching of bones.  Funboy's skewed-around gun hand blows a
	hole in his own thigh.  Funboy fall back across the bed.

				FUNBOY
		Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what
		you did to my sheets, you lame
		piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!

				ERIC
		Does it hurt?

				FUNBOY
		Does it hurt?!  You dead-ass,
		clown-faced fuck, of course it
		fucking hurts!  What the shit are
		you gonna do about this?!

	Eric sits on the bed next to Funboy; inspects the ampule of
	morphine on the nightstand, the needle of the syringe already 
	inserted.

				ERIC
		I have some pain killer right here.

	And he fills the syringe all the way.

	ANGLE ON FUNBOY

	as he begins to see the light.  He can't get away.  Growing
	terror.

				FUNBOY
		No, wait, no WAIT, that's too
		much, man, that's like overkill,
		nobody can take that much, you're
		wasting it -- !

				ERIC
		Your pain ends now.

	And Eric rams the needle into Funboy's heart, driving home
	the full dose.  Funboy begins to convulse.

	Eric falls back on the bed, his force spent.  Darla COMES TO in
	the corner, shock-traumatized.  On O.S. COUGH, and Eric opens
	his eyes.

	The Skull Cowboy, standing in the room, tips his hat.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Howdy
			(beat)
		You look a mess.  Like an ole
		cooter dog.

	TIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE

	streaked with -- mostly -- his own blood.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE SKULL COWBOY AND ERIC

				SKULL COWBOY
		Getting a little ambitious and
		extracurricular, aren't we?

				ERIC
		Go away.

				SKULL COWBOY
		You need to learn to mind your own
		business or you'll never get where
		you think you're going.

				ERIC
		Shut up.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Maybe I was wrong about you.

	The Skull Cowboy seems saddened or disappointed.  All we get is
	a little shake of his skull-head.

	Darla makes a SOUND and Eric turns toward her.  She's really
	confused.  She's looking to Eric for some kind of answer.

				ERIC
		Your daughter is out there, on the
		street, waiting for you.

	She's stunned, utterly speechless.  All she can do is look in
	Eric's eyes, try to ponder the phantoms there.

				ERIC
		Go.  Now.

	Darla shoves helter-skelter past Eric and out the door without 
	a glance back at Funboy.

	Eric, recovering, follows slowly, staring at the open door,
	stooping to lift the guitar dropped during the fight with 
	Funboy.  The Skull Cowboy has vanished.  PUSH IN.  Grimly, Eric
	takes a syringe and begins to draw blood from the late Funboy.

	INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	As a hastily dressed Darla BANGS out through the fire stair door
	behind Grange and FLEES the Pit.

				BOUNCER
		Hey, g'night, Darla.
			(to Grange)
		That there is Darla.

				GRANGE
		Funboy?

	Bartender indicates UP with his thumb.  Grange moves to the fire
	stairs door.

	INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Grange has seen the door ajar and now ENTERS gun-first.  Freezes
	when he sees:

	GRANGE POV - FUNBOY

	Half-sheeted, bloody, a hypo hanging out of his heart.

	RESUME GRANGE

	Eyes darting, drawn to --

	GRANGE'S POV - THE WALL NEAR FUNBOY

	A crow silhouette spray-painted with a syringe of Funboy's
	blood.  A thin outline, drippy.

	RESUME GRANGE

	whirling with his gun to bring it to bear on --

	ANGLE - GRANGE SEES THE WINDOW

	The crow is no longer in the room.  Eric is perched on the sill,
	guitar and all, looking right at Grange as if waiting from him.
	He winks, holds a finger to his lips -- sshh --and jumps out
	into the night.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - GRANGE

	He almost fires, but doesn't.  We see instead the priceless
	expression on his face as we --

							CUT TO:

	INT. PRECINCT FOYER - NIGHT

	Albrecht lights another smoke, quitting for the night.  Waves to
	the late-working Annabella en route.

	EXT. PRECINCT HOUSE - NIGHT

	Albrecht hasn't gone three steps before Eric appears behind him,
	cat silent, matching pace.

	NB:  Eric has got a new black rock-n-roll shirt on... and a
	shell casing from Funboy's gun tied in his hair.

				ERIC
		Freeze.

	Albrecht startles; drops his file.  Nearly draws his gun.

				ALBRECHT
		Jeezus!  Don't ever do that, man!

	Albrecht pants, hysterical but calming down.  Eric waits.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		I told you cops don't say
		"freeze".

	He retrieves Eric's doctored photo from the spill of papers.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		You, my friend, are dead.  I saw
		your body.  You got buried.

				ERIC
		I saw it, too.

	Albrecht gathers up the file.  Eric stands there.  We realize he
	is hesitant about touching the file.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Walk with me.

	As Albrecht comes up with the file as they walk.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT ON THE STREET

				ALBRECHT
		You died, man.  I can't believe it
		but here you are.  Last year,
		you and your girlfriend --

				ERIC
		I need you to tell me what you
		remember.  What happened to us?

				ALBRECHT
		You went out the window.  She was
		beaten and raped.  She died in the 
		hospital.

	They stop.  Eric didn't know this.  Fixes Albrecht with a look.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Hey, you asked, man.
			(beat)
		She held on for thirty hours in 
		intensive care.  Hemorrhage,
		trauma.  He body just finally
		gave it up.
			(beat; regret)
		I saw it and couldn't do jack for 
		her.

	Eric has grown increasingly distraught over Albrecht's lines.
	Now he turns to Albrecht and, holding Albrecht's temples with
	his fingers, puts his thumbs over Albrecht's eyes.

	TIGHT ON ERIC - ALBRECHT AGAINST WALL

	We see Eric react to a brutal Flash... but we don't see the 
	Flash.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

	And Eric tears from Albrecht; staggers back, now holding his own
	head.  His crow face slacked in realized horror.

				ALBRECHT
		You okay, man?  I mean, what just
		happened.

				ERIC
		The venom of bad memories.  You
		were there; you saw her.  I saw
		you seeing her.

	Understandable nervous, Albrecht lights up a cigarette.

				ALBRECHT
		You gotta understand -- I was 
		hoping she'd talk, give me a lead,
		a clue, something to work with.
		But she only said one thing to me 
		before she died.

	Eric lowers his head, penitent.

				ERIC
		My name.

				ALBRECHT
			(fizzles)
		I'm sorry as hell, man.

				ERIC
		Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus
		change...

	TIGHT TWO-SHOT - ALBRECHT AND ERIC

	Eric plucks the cigarette from Albrecht's lips, taking a single
	contemplative puff from it.

				ERIC
		Halloween is coming, soon.  You
		will have Top Dollar if you watch
		for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.

				ALBRECHT
		I should be trying to stop you.

	Eric nods, keeping his eyes on the cigarette.

				ERIC
		Thank you.  For giving a damn.

				ALBRECHT
		My pleasure.
				ERIC
		Don't smoke these.

	As a bus grumbles past on the street, Eric pitches the butt and 
	simultaneously ducks out of frame.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT TURNS

	to see a blank building wall.  Fire escape.  Darkness.  No Eric.
	He does a full 360 degree turn.  Eric is gone again.

				ALBRECHT
		Damn, I wish he wouldn't do that.

	MOVING ANGLE - FROM BUS ROOF

	Coat flapping, Eric is standing on the bus roof as the bus moves
	away from Albrecht's position.

	INT. LAO NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

	Lao has the partially disassembled rat skeleton in front of him, 
	as well as a mortar and pestle with some bits of crushed bone, and
	is smoking powdered rat bone in a pipe and Grange reports to
	him.

				GRANGE
		The son of a bitch winked at me.
		The he jumped.  Three stories.

	Lao seems strangely unaffected by the bizarre nature of Grange's
	tale.

				LAO
		Did you see an animal of any kind?
		Did you see a bird?

				GRANGE
			(puzzled)
		No.  I saw a guitar.
			(beat; irritated)
		This isn't some rock-n-roller
		you forgot to pay, is it?
			(beat)
		There was a drawing on the wall 
		that looked like a bird.  In 
		blood.

	Lao's expression is one of sublime content.

				LAO
		Good.

				Grange
		It could've been a chicken...

	EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT - ("CROWVISION")

	A LONG SHOT of the T-Bird parked across the street from the
	store as two figures -- T-Bird and Skank -- approach on the
	store side.

				SKANK
		I wish to hell I had torched
		Gideon's, that fat fuck.

				T-BIRD
		I wish to hell I knew who it was
		that made Tin-Tin into a voodoo
		doll last night.

	ANGLE - CLOSER ON T-BIRD AND SKANK - STREET LEVEL

	They stop walking.  Look at each other and sanctimoniously cross 
	themselves.  Tin-Tin's big R.I.P. moment.  T-Bird indicates the
	liquor store.

				T-BIRD
		We need some smokes and some road
		beers.

				SKANK
		Got it.

	Skank hustles toward the store.  T-Bird crosses to the car.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD - THROUGH CAR WINDOWS

	WIDEN ANGLE to include the car as he nears it.  Behind him, two
	12-year-old KIDS, AXEL and CHOPPER, enter the store after Skank,
	one wearing a long duster.

	INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

	as the KIDS enter and split between the counter and magazine
	rack.  East Indian CLERK.  Two boys fight video game wars in the
	corner.  Skank browses, grabbing odds and ends.

	EXT. STREET / INT. CAR - LOWER ANGLE - NIGHT

	as T-Bird climbs in, digs the last cigarette from his pack, 
	snaps his Zippo and in the sudden orange light, sees:

	INSERT - REARVIEW MIRROR

	Eric's purloined Strat in the back sear reflecting the light.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD

	He tries to spin and draw his gun but Eric is upon him, nestling
	one of Tin-Tin's throwing knives right inside T-Bird's ear.
		
				T-BIRD
		What the fuck are you supposed to
		be, man?!

	INSERTS:  Eric liberates T-Bird's automatic from the shoulder 
	holster; Eric's hand closes T-Bird's door for him.

				ERIC
		I'm your passenger.  You drive.
		And stop talking.

	TIGHT ANGLE - T-BIRD'S HANDS

	on ignition key and gearshift, making ready.  As ordered.

	INT. LIQUOR STORE - ON SKANK AT COUNTER - NIGHT

	He looks outside and sees Eric as the car fires up, pipes and
	glasspacks grumbling.  Skank moves, BRISTLING.

				SKANK
		What's all this happy horseshit?

	And the car peels out maniacally!  Skank tries to pursue -- but
	the two KIDS draw weapons and freeze everyone in the store.

				AXEL
		Alright, alright, alright --
		everybody be cool and stay exactly
		where you are.

	Chopper hustles up to the counter and relieves Skank of a 
	gigantic Auto Mag.

				CHOPPER
		Whooooa, cowboy!  Cool gun.

	Off Skank's look of total outfoxed disgust.--

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELING FAST - NIGHT

	Vertiginous windshield POV of onrushing street, highspeed.

				ERIC (O.S.)
		Faster, T-Bird.  Faster.  You're
		a hell of a wheelman; you know you
		can drive faster.

	ANGLE - ERIC AND T-BIRD

	Eric now holds T-Bird's own gun on him.  Eyes locked on T-Bird.
	T-Bird's jump between Eric's nightmare visage and the roadway.

				T-BIRD
		You call it, blood -- you got the
		gun. You just tell me where you want
		to go.

	Clearly T-Bird would relish bisecting Eric with a meat cleaver 
	as he says this.  He's nervous and needs to hold the road.

				ERIC
		That's good.  We're going 
		someplace you've never been
		before.

	EXT. STREET - HIGH ANGLE ON T-BIRD - NIGHT

	as the car burns up the obstacle course of pavement, kicking  
	wake of litter.  PEDESTRIANS scurry to clear the way.

	INT. POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT

	Parked in an alley, facing the street.  Two cops work on large
	styro cups of steaming coffee.  MJ (driver) and SPEEG.

				MJ
		Smells like rain.

				SPEEG
		Smells like a septic tank.  You
		got that cream stuff?

				MJ
		In the bag.

	Speeg rummages inside the takeout bag.

				SPEEG   
		I hate this cream stuff.  They
		can't even call it cream, legally.

	They snap to as the T-Bird blazes past, doing ninety.

				MJ
		What in the crap?

	MJ floors the pedal, drenching Speeg in coffee on takeoff.

				SPEEG
		Ow! Owowoowowoowo, goddammit!

	EXT. STREET - ON ALLEY - NIGHT

	as the cruiser roars out to give chase.

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELLING FAST - NIGHT

	Eric lends the chase car a backward look.

				ERIC
		You caught one.  Drive faster.

				T-BIRD
		Man, you gonna get us killed dead
		and I don't even know what you
		want!

	Eric cocks T_Bird's pistol and levels it at his face.

				ERIC
		I want you to stop talking.  And 
		drive.  Drive faster.

	Eric rifles the glove box, tossing items out the window: clips
	for the gun.  Sunglasses.  A giant dildo (brief eyebrows-up to
	T-Bird).  Then: a roll of (previously established) gaffer's
	tape.  What Eric needs.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD AND REARVIEW MIRROR

	as he sees a second cop car join the high speed pursuit, 

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		You're very popular.  Thought
		you could handle this thing.

	T-Bird macho calcifies.  He's going to win.

				T-BIRD
		To hell with you.

				ERIC
			(wry)
		Naturally.

	INSERT - SPEEDOMETER

	Climbing swiftly toward the 100 mark.


	EXT. CITY STREETS - VARIOUS ANGLES - THE CHASE - NIGHT

	A 3-way pursuit until the T-Bird reaches the outskirts of the
	city.

	EXT. DOCKSIDE STREET - NIGHT

	All quiet... until the T-Bird ZOOMS past frame.  The lead cop
	tries to duplicate the T-Bird's corner-cut and starts spinning.
	It clips a light pole.  Rebounds into the path of MJ's unit.

	INT. POLICE CRUISER - ON SPEEG AND MJ - TRAVELING - NIGHT

	as MJ stands on the brakes.  Collision imminent.  They howl.

	EXT. DOCKSIDE STREET - NIGHT

	as MJ's unit broadsides the first cop car.

	EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - NIGHT

	The T-bird careens through dockside silence, alone, then
	fishtails, SCREECHING, to a lung-compressing halt.

	INT. T-BIRD - ON ERIC AND T-BIRD - NIGHT

	T-bird respirating like a jackhammer.  Eric holds stoic.

				T-BIRD
		So what -- you gonna rape me now?

				ERIC
		Time for your reward, T.  Payback
		with interest earned.

	Eric rips a long strip of tape from the roll.

	EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - NIGHT

	A HIGH ANGLE of the car as Eric opens the trunk.

	ERIC'S POV - The Trunk.

	loaded with plastique, canisters, timers, arson paraphernalia.

	INT. T-BIRD - FAVOR T-BIRD - NIGHT

	SLOW TILT starting with T-Bird's foot, firmly taped to the
	pedal.  Mummified into his seat.  Hands taped to the wheel.
	Throat taped hard against the headrest.

	The car is now in gear, idling.

	ANGLE - ON ERIC FROM WINDOW

	He drops an incendiary right into T-Bird's lap.  T-Bird squirms.
	No go.  Eric reaches in with a bungie cord.

				ERIC
		A little restrictive?  Good.
			(chilling)
		You held her down and raped her.
		You were the first.  She burned
		while you were inside of her.
			(re: bomb)
		What's the lag on this?  About
		twenty seconds, would you say?

	T-bird thrashes, but he's immobilized.  Can't even budge the
	wheel.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I've comrades in hell, T-bird.
		Give them my best.

	Eric activates the timer.  Yanks up hard on the bungie cord.

	INSERT: T-BIRD FOOTWELL

	The bungie cord pulls T-Bird's foot all the way down on the
	pedal.

	ANGLE - ON CAR, FROM DOCKSIDE

	Eric steps back, plucks the guitar out as the car starts to move.  The
	car roars for the edge of the dock, about a distance of a
	football field.  Eric examines T-bird's auto pistol and pops the
	clip.

	INTERCUTS:  as the car speeds for the water's edge, Eric thumbs
	bullets from the clip, one by one.

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELING FAST - NIGHT

	T-bird's eyes bug in horror and he goes MMMMMMMMHHH!

	CLOSE-UP - THE CLIP IN ERIC'S HAND

	thumbing out the final bullet.

	EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

				ERIC
		All gone.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD REACHES DOCKSIDE

	Lifting off and blowing all to hell, a billion smithereens of
	phosphorescent firs pattering into the dark water.  It hits.
	Sinks.  Weird flare glow as the car quickly submerges.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	heaving the gun into the distant water.  Plosh.  He produces T-
	Bird's accelerator.  Squirts it into the ground.  He
	prestidigitates and T-Bird's Zippo appears in his hand.  He 
	flicks it and drops it into the flammable puddle.

	HIGH LONG SHOT - ERIC

	walking slowly out of the scene as the firepool coalesces into
	a burning crow shape. 

	INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAWN

	CLOSE-UP of a frying pan busy burning some pretty firebombed
	looking eggs.  Kind gross.

	ANGLE - DARLA AT THE STOVE.

	NOT THRILLED WITH HER OWN PROGRESS.

				DARLA
		I never was too good at this 
		domestic shit.

	ANGLE - ELLY AT LIVING ROOM WINDOW

	staring outside at nothing in particular.  Yet.

				ELLY
		Don't say "shit".
			(beat)
		That's okay.  Corn Flakes are
		okay.  Anything.

	She pauses as she hears a lilting, faraway GUITAR STRAIN.
	Across the street she can make out the figure of Eric on his 
	roof playing the guitar.

	EXT. ROOF OF LOFT BUILDING DAWN

	EXTREME CLOSE of a Pignose Amp.  More soft GUITAR strokes as
	CAMERA FOLLOWS a patchwork a taped-together, jerry-rigged
	cables to:

	ANGLE - ERIC ON ROOF -- shirtless, crosslegged, his Crow make-up
	streaked by the night's work.  His fingering is unsure and he 
	tries the tune again.

	INSERT - We she Shelly's engagement ring on a leather thong
	around Eric's neck.  Like an amulet.

	ANGLE - ERIC PLAYING

	He's got it right this time.  Strong, sure CHORDS.  Passionate.
	We can almost imagine him conjuring Shelly via musical sorcery.
	He holds a stroke, letting it ring.  Sun rises behind him.

				IRATE VOICE (O.S.)
		Hey, shut the fuck up!

	Eric's eyes, closed with the moment, dart left.  Funny.

	EXT. MAXI-DOGS - DAY

	Later.  Elly is seated on a stool..  Mickey gives her a chili
	dog.

				MICKEY
		Chili dog for breakfast... it's
		original.

				ELLY
		Mom tried to cook.

				MICKEY
		Oh.

				CUSTOMER (O.S.)
		Hey, Mickey, I need a special
		with everything.  No sawdust.

				MICKEY
			(to Elly)
		Everyone's a comedian.  Enjoy.

	Mickey EXITS FRAME.

				GRANGE (O.S.)
		You're Elly, right?  I know your
		mom.

	Elly turns.  Grange sits next to her.  Lao's mirrored-windowed car
	is parked across the street, b.g.

				ELLY
		A lot of people "know" my mom.

	Grange points o.s., indicating he wants coffee from Mickey.

				GRANGE
		I know your friend, too -- the one
		that looks like a rock star.

				ELLY
		I don't know you.

				GRANGE
			(easily)
		I'd like to get in touch with him.

	Elly sizes Grange up.

				ELLY
		You're not a cop, either.  What do
		you want him for?

				GRANGE
		I'm looking for a good guitar man.

				ELLY
		Right.

	Grange withdraws a $10 bill from his wallet and slides it across
	the countertop to Mickey.

				ELLY (CONT'D)
		You buying?
			(cuts him some slack)
		He kinda wanders around.  You'll
		see him if you pay attention.

				GRANGE
		I need to find him kind of soon,
		Elly.


	INT. LOFT - ON ERIC - DAY

	No shirt, the ring on the thong around his neck -- workout mode.

	He twirls and performs odd Crow moves of increasing complexity
	in the big open living room.  On purpose, he stretches hard
	against the bedroom doorframe.

	FLASH:  Shelly stands in the blue moonlight near the picture window
	wearing a rococo Victorian gown.  PUSH IN TIGHT as she is
	embraced by a nude Eric.  He undoes the last few remaining ties
	that hold the gown in place.  FOLLOW THE GOWN as it crumples
	down the length of Shelly's (also otherwise nude) body to the
	floor...

							FLASH ENDS.

	LOW ANGEL - FROM INSIDE THE BEDROOM - ON ERIC

	hanging there, inviting the pain the FLASHES bring.  Breathing
	as though he is pumping iron, pumping up.

	ANGLE - LATER - ERIC IN BEDROOM

	embracing a ragged full-length dress that used to be Shelly's.

	FLASH: Eric and Shelly (wearing the same dress), exchange an
	extremely passionate and intimate KISS in the moonlight.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC

	as he drops the dress.  Absorbing the pain and memories.

	ANGLE - LATER - ERIC IN LIVING ROOM

	executing a complex roll that winds him up at the windowsill.
	He grasps it with both hands.

	FLASH:  A series of CLOSE SHOTS of Eric and Shelly's HANDS, each
	moving along the other's body.  Curves and dips and contours.
	But Eric's gaze never leaves SHelly's eyes.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AT WINDOW

	His GAZE similarly FIXED.  Bringing his hands away and clapping
	them together, deep breath, fingertips pressed to his face, like
	Kung Fu prep.  When he opens his eyes, the crow is there before
	him on the sill.

				ERIC
		That's better.

	He wipes his torso down with a towel.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		It's almost time.

	He holds his hand in front of his face and he flexes it.  We can
	HEAR tendons CRACKLE like a harness.  Closes it into a powerful
	fist.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	TIGHT on Skank as he slams his fist down on the table.  He has
	a black eye and facial scuffs from his liquor store encounter.

				SKANK
		Top, I made the sumbitch!  Face
		all painted white like some kinda
		fuckin' kabuki homo!

	WIDE ANGLE to include all present:  Lao, Grange, Lao Guards #1 
	and #2, Top Dollar, and a Sentry.  Top dusts up a line and
	rinses his nostrils with brandy.

				LAO
		Sounds like our "Crow" is
		out-maneuvering you.

				TOP DOLLAR
		"Our" Crow...?

				LAO
		Come now.  You've seen the 
		graffiti -- all over the city in
		the few hors it has taken your
		men to drop like plague victims.
		What about your turf, Top?
			(mockingly)
		You don't seem to have ripped out
		anyone's heart yet.

				TOP DOLLAR
			(pissed off)
		The night is young.

				SKANK
			(hot)
		The found T-bird flash-fried to
		what was left of his fucking car!

	Top is angry too, but won't show it to Lao.  He rises and goes
	to the window.  Neon glow.  Top sees something outside, below,
	that really torques him off.

	EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SHOWTIME - NIGHT (TOP'S POV)

	A phantom GRAFFITI ARTIST is spray-painting a crow shape on the
	condemned building right across the street.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	Top whip-drawing an auto pistol and shooting below.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Hey, you little fuckweed!  That's
		against the law!

	His gun smoking.  Momentary empowerment.

				TOP DOLLAR (CONT'D)
		I don't give a shit what kinda
		bird this guy is.

	EXT. WINDOW - NIGHT

	As Top turns from the window,  PULL BACK to incorporate the
	chunky shadows where the lights don't fall.  Eric is there,
	perched on the narrow exterior ledge...but we don't know it
	until he opens his eyes, two dots of white in the blackness.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	LAO AT TABLE -- angered by this macho horseshit, annoyed at his
	time being frittered.

				LAO
		I am sitting over here.

	He SLAMS a palm on the table and the room goes silent.  Top
	looks sheepish.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Do you think this childish
		machismo impresses me?
			(regains composure)
		When I was a boy in Saigon I
		watched my country change one 
		block at a time,  one building at
		a time.  Whole lives erased.  A
		way of life, polluted.  Today, no 
		one forces me to move.  I use my
		powers to change your country, one
		block at a time,  one building at
		a time.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Nice speech.  What's it supposed
		to mean?

				LAO
		Your comprehension is not
		required.  Your cooperation and,
		indeed, your ability are the
		issues on the table.

	Top rallies to this.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Whatever you say, I can do.

	Skank looks around, nervous and jumpy, a contradiction to Top's
	guarantee.

				LAO
		That's reassuring.

	CLOSE-UP - TOP'S SHELL CASING IN ERIC'S HAND

	from the ledge.  Endstamp is for a .45 caliber.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON LEDGE

	He sniffs the cartridge.  We can see Funboy's cartridge in his
	hair.  He fists the shell casing tightly.

	ANGLE - DOWN-TABLE, AT SKANK

	Jittery, grabbing a clip for his own automatic.

				SKANK
		What was that -- !?

	It wasn't anything.  Skank loads, stands and jacks the action on
	his gun.  Lao looks questioningly to Top Dollar.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Too many poppers, Skank.  Relax.  Heel.

	ANGLE - WINDOW BEHIND TOP DOLLAR

	A black blur as Eric arches through, spilling Top.

	ANGLE - MEN SEATED AT TABLE

	Eric back flips the length of the table and kicks the gun from
	Skank's hand.  All react.  Weapons out.

	CLOSE-UP - SKANK'S GUN

	spinning mid-air to land in Eric's open hand!

	GENERAL ANGLE - BIG MOBY SHOOTOUT - (VARIOUS)

	Death cleans house.  Standing on the table, Eric fires rearward
	under his own arm to clip Lao Guard #1.  He pivots, shooting,
	and takes out Lao Guard #2 -- who slams backward into the steel
	door as it being opened by the Sentry outside.  Crash!  The
	door is shut again.

	ANGLE - GRANGE AND LAO

	Grange sprays the room with a Calico 950 Auto, shoving Lao
	beneath the table for cover.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	Bullets hit him and demolish everything behind him.  Skank hits
	the deck again.  Eric fires and Lao Guard #1 sucks three hits 
	across the chest, firing convulsively against the ceiling, blowing
	the lights.

	ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR

	springing up from behind table.  But Eric is gone from the field
	of fire and one shot strikes Skank, rising at the far end.

	ANGLE - LAO AND GRANGE

	making for the door, Grange as shield.  Lao draws a pistol.  The door
	opens and Lao shoots a Sentry to clear him out of the way.

	ANGLE - TIGHTER ON LAO

	A last look back toward Eric and Grange hustle Lao out.

	Door SLAM o.s.  Top is out of ammo as Eric lands from above
	frame right in front of him and slaps the gun from his hand.

				TOP DOLLAR
			(awed but maintained)
		You want my attention, man you
		got it.

	ANGLE - SKANK UNDER TABLE

	Wounded but clawing toward Eric just the same.

				SKANK
		It's him, Top!  He dusted T-Bird!

	ANGLE - ERIC AND TOP DOLLAR, FACE-TO-FACE

				ERIC
		You have to be SKank.
			(to Top Dollar)
		One moment.

	As he speaks, WIDEN FRAME as he turns and grabs the incoming
	Skank by the hair.

				ERIC
		Thank of a snappy comeback for me
		on your way down.

	Without a beat he pitches Skank right out the window!  Skank howls
	all the way down.

	EXT. STREET - ON POLICE CAR - NIGHT

	Damaged from the wreck, limping home, piloted by our pals Speeg
	and MJ.  Skank smashes down into the roof, imploding the
	flashbar and windshield.  MJ drenches his lap in fresh coffee.

				MJ
		OwwwAAHHH son of a BITCH!

	ANGLE - SIDEWALK ACROSS THE STREET - ON ALBRECHT

	who watches with slow marvel from the shadows
				ALBRECHT
		Jesus Christ...

	He runs to assist the demolished cruiser.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - RESUMING - NIGHT

	Just Top, Eric, corpses, and lazily drifting gunsmoke.

				ERIC
		Top Dollar, you're the only one
		here still wasting good air...

				TOP DOLLAR
		Five large, in the drawer right 
		over there.  I never saw you.

				ERIC
		Do you know what you destroyed?

				TOP DOLLAR
		Take the dope, too.

	Eric backhands Top into the wall.  Gets in his face, seething.

				ERIC
		A year ago.  A very nice lady
		circulated a petition.  She died.
		Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.

				TOP DOLLAR
		That's ancient history.

				ERIC
		It's yesterday!  Do you know what
		you destroyed?

	Top Dollar yells right back at Eric's anger.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Who gives a fuck!  I'm a
		businessman.  You gonna do me,
		then do me and shut you're face!

				ERIC
		You don't even remember...

				TOP DOLLAR
		I never forget anything, dickhead.
		That building was a sweep-and-
		clear; the bitch was a nuisance
		with her goddamned petition.  It
		got a little rowdy... end of
		story.

				ERIC
		Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps 
		for you.

	And he grabs Top's head the way he grabbed ALbrecht's earlier,
	slams Top into the wall.  Nose-to-nose.

	FLASH:  Shelly backing away from oncoming Funboy in the loft,
	trying to retreat, nowhere to run, her home invaded, scared.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC

	Top is quivering, almost helpless in Eric's hypnotic grasp.
	Eric winces, hard, and --

	FLASH:  Shelly cut, bleeding, struggling against T-Bird.  Wild.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - RESUMING TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC

	Viciously close, more intimate and lethal than anything.

				ERIC
		You're a detail man, Top -- you
		need to see more.

	This time Top tries to twist from Eric's grasp but it's no good.

	FLASH: Shelly, comatose in ICU, eyes fixed and staring, 
	hoses darting in and out, cold blue refrigerator light.

	Bloody, bruised and broken (from Albrecht;s memory)

							FLASH ENDS.

	CLOSE-UP - TOP DOLLAR

	arching, stiffening in pain.

	CLOSE-UP - TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC

				ERIC
		All of her pain, Top.  Thirty
		hours.  All at once...

	Eric bears down on Top Dollar again.  Top screams.  Blood begins
	to leak from his eyes, nose, ears.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		...all for you.

	FLASH:  Rapidfire CLOSE-UPS.  A jagged compound fracture,
	jutting, Shelly's eye, blood-red sclera, purpled and sunken.

	Her scraped-raw hand clawing at air.  Icebox lighting.  A TIGHT
	SHOT of her monitor going flatline: eeeeeeeeeeeeee...

	TWO-SHOT - RESUMING ERIC AND TOP DOLLAR.

	as Top sags in Eric's grasp, terror fixing his wide-staring dead
	eyes.  Eric lets him drop like a laundry sack.

				ERIC
		I didn't think you could handle it
		either.

	O.S. BANG of impact, heavy against the steel door.  Eric turns.

	ANGLE - STEEL DOOR

	as it is battered down by a squad of police using a power-ram.
	All weapons snap up to bear on Eric.

				LEAD SWAT
		That's all she wrote, Bozo!  You
		stand down now, and that's an
		order!

	ANGLE - ERIC AS HE MOVES

	using his foot to shove the massive conference table at the 
	incoming SWATS while launching himself into the air, flipping
	toward the window and arching through cleanly as the cops open
	fire on command.  Bullets tear the room to pieces.

				LEAD SWAT
		The fire escape's covered.

	EXT. SHOWTIME - FRONT FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

	Picking up Eric on his dive through the window, bullets chasing
	him.  Immediate police fire from below sparks off the ironwork.
	Eric ducks slugs balletically and scampers to the roof.

	ANGLE - SHOWTIME ROOFTOP EDGE

	Eric somersaults over.  Bullets chip brick in his wake.

	STREET LEVEL - UP ANGLE TOWARD ROOF.

	Showtime girded police cars and MARKSMEN, Eric a distant
	shadow figure above.  Here comes a TEAM LEADER with a bullhorn.

				TEAM LEADER (FILTERED)
		On the roof!  Keep firing!  Keep
		firing!

	A fury of law enforcement ordnance cuts loose all around him.

	RESUMING ERIC ON SHOWTIME ROOF EDGE

	A forearm up against the fusillade.  Below him --

	ANGLE - PIT FRONT FIRE ESCAPE 

	Here come Lead SWAT and his Merry MEN.

	MOVING ANGLE - WITH ERIC - ADJACENT ROOFTOP

	Eric runs for it.  Half a story higher.  He hits the wall and
	skitters up, gripping tiny cracks in the brickwork.

	ANGLE - RESUMING MEN ON FRONT SHOWTIME FIRE ESCAPE.

	Lead SWAT hesitates -- because of what he sees.

				LEAD SWAT
		Holy shit, it's spiderman.

	He tries to pull a bead and fires too late.

				LEAD SWAT (CONT'D)
		What're you boy scouts staring at!
		Let's Go!  Let's go!  Let's go!

	MOVING ANGLE - PICKING UP ERIC ON NEXT ROOF

	He sprints to the far edge and dives to the next lower rooftop.
	As he lands he is nailed by a helicopter spotlight, boring in 
	from behind and above the row of buildings.

	MOVING ANGLE - THE STREET BELOW

	COPS below, COPS in the chopper, everyone rushing parallel to 
	Eric, trying to keep up.

	ERIC'S POV - THE STREET, THE HELICOPTER

	PAN QUICK to the next ledge.  COPS right behind him on the roof
	as well.

	WITH ERIC - AS HE RUNS TO THE EDGE.

	and finds a void waiting there.  No connecting building.

	ANOTHER MOVING ANGLE - ERIC

	staying ahead of the search light.  A fantastic series of artful
	moves that wind him up at the rear edge of the roof.

	ANGLE - SWAT MEN ON NEXT ROOF

	sighting Eric as the light picks him out.  Eric glances at 
	them... then jumps.

				CHOPPER PILOT (O.S./FILTERED)
		He's off the roof.  We can't see
		him.

	CLOSE-UP - LEAD SWAT

	pulling his weapon off target, because there is not target.  

				LEAD SWAT
		Dammit to hell!
			(beat; to men)
		Come on.

	ANGLE - ALLEY - STREET LEVEL

	Eric lands like a falling safe, scattering garbage.  But he's 
	okay, up and running.

	ANGLE - ERIC'S RUNNING POV - END OF ALLEY

	as his escape is cut off by a police car that screeches to a 
	stop, blocking the exit.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC

	as he backpedals, scanning for an alternate escape.

				ALBRECHT
			(from car)
		Come on!

	CLOSER ANGLE  - POLICE CAR

	We can see Albrecht.  Eric dives inside and the car burns rubber.

	INT. ALBRECHT'S CAR - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

	Albrecht harried and frantic, but in control.

				ALBRECHT
		Keep your head down!

	He twists and turns the car, glancing rearward for pursuit.  

	Gradually he calms down.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		I figured you might need a ride 
		home.

	Eric looks up at him from his half-concealed crouch.

				ERIC
		It's done.
				ALBRECHT
		I figured as much.  Did you cap
		off Funboy.

				ERIC
		Funboy had to leave this mortal 
		coil.

				ALBRECHT
		Yeah, among others.
			(sees Eric's condition)
		Hey, man -- you're hit.

				ERIC
		It's only a flesh wound.

				ALBRECHT
		It's only fourteen or fifteen 
		flesh wounds.

	Eric sits up as the car gains distance.  Grabs the cigarette out 
	of ALbrecht's mouth.  Takes his single puff.

				ERIC
		You shouldn't smoke these.

	He pitches the smoke out the open car window.

				ALBRECHT
		Great.  Litterbug of the Living
		Dead.

	Eric turns back to Albrecht.

				ERIC
		I'm finished.

	Eric shoots him a doubtful look.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I mean, I've done what I came to
		do.  It shouldn't hurt this much.
		But it will pass...

				ALBRECHT
			(not buying it)
		Right.
			(beat)
		You sure I can't just take you to 
		the emergency ward?

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT - ON ALBRECHT'S CAR

	It hangs a turn and their escape is made.

				ERIC (O.S.)
		They couldn't do anything for me.

				ALBRECHT (O.S.)
		How 'bout the morgue?

				ERIC (O.S.)
		No.  I have one more thing to do.

	EXT. STREET - ANOTHER PART OF THE CITY - NIGHT

	Lonelier, less traffic, more deserted.

	ANGLE - ON ALBRECHT AND ERIC THROUGH WINDSHIELD - TRAVELLING

				ALBRECHT
		You're gonna kill somebody else.
			(beat; no response)
		We're gonna stop and get a shit-load
		of Band-Aids?

	Eric is obviously fighting to stay centered, stay conscious.
	His last fight has caused him a great deal of damage, taken a
	lot out of him.  He needs to recharge.

				ERIC
		I have to prepare for an 
		anniversary.  This coming night.

	HOLD on their two kinds of determination. as we

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY

	High blue sky.  It might even be pretty if it wasn't Detroit.

	INT. LAO'S CLUB OFFICE - DAY

	The TV flybank pulses with videotaped images of Club Trash's of
	various performers -- including Diabolique.  On several screens,
	one-by-one, various images of a guitar-playing Eric Draven
	FREEZE-FRAME as we PULL BACK to the desk.  Lao has the 8x10 from
	the corridor gallery.  He places it within eyeshot and resumes
	work on the desk BELOW FRAME;  we can't see it yet, among other
	scattered research and inconcubula.

	ANGLE - GRANGE

	Entering and crossing to the desk.  As he comes up to the desk,
	he DRAWS BACK.

				GRANGE
		What... the hell is that?

				LAO
			(calmly)
		This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes,
		it is real.

	NEW ANGLE - LAO AND GRANGE

	Revealing Lao with a sealed cage, holding a large, live cobra in
	his hands.  The killing blade is nearby.

				GRANGE
		That thing is poisonous.

				LAO
		Extremely so.
			(beat)
		You and I are the recipients of
		unwanted good fortune, in the form 
		of a man everyone is calling The Crow.

	Grange makes a face.  Can't keep his eyes off the cobra.

				GRANGE
		Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...

				LAO
		I intend no slight to you, but I
		cannot find the English to
		adequately express just what he
		is.  I suppose Western mythology
		would describe him as a Fury.
		
				GRANGE
		Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.

	Lao chuckles indulgently.

				LAO
		Do you know of spirit assassins?
		You do know the dead can rise?
		Properly motivated, of course.

				GRANGE
		Like some sort of zombie on a 
		revenge trip.

				LAO
		Mmm.  But tonight I can take what
		is his.

				GRANGE
		Only thing you'll get from that
		clown is a faster way to die.
				LAO
		To the contrary...

	ZZLIP!  Lao smoothly BEHEADS the snake with the Blade against
	the stone surface of the desk and discards the writhing body.
	He squeezes behind one of the eyes and a VENOM SAC protrudes
	like a dark pimento.

	LAO pulls it free of the milky, clinging tissue and EATS IT.
	Off Grange's stunned expression.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		...all the dying tonight will be 
		done by the former Eric Draven.

	Lao exhibits the blade to Grange as though it explains all.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Who is only invulnerable so long
		as he cares about the dead.  When
		he begins to care about the living,
		you'll find his heart can bleed...
		and I want it to bleed for me.

				GRANGE
		Kill a dead guy?

	Lao POPS the second venom sac; swallows it.  Pleased.

				LAO
		Truly kill him.  So I may crush
		his skull and smoke it.

	Lao SHRUGS.  Grange can handle it.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Let it suffice that I need him...
		and to get to him, we'll need his 
		little friend.

	Finally, an assignment Grange can comfortable understand. 

	INT. LOFT - DAY

	Eric, barechested, emotionally tapped, clean of makeup and blood
	but exhausted, his movements retarded and slack.  Staring
	fixedly into the fireplace,  where he burns everything he could
	find of his past:  the junk from the makeup table, the masques,
	photos of himself and Shelly.

	INT. LOFT - STAIRWELL - DAY

	Moving with Elly as she nears the open loft door.  She PEEKS
	cautiously inside.

	RESUME ERIC

	Without looking toward the door, he speaks.

				ELLY
		What's going on...?

				ERIC
		A remembrance.
			(beat)
		A closure.

	And Eric consigns to the fire the DRESS we saw earlier.

	Holds a photograph in a broken frame.  Cracked glass.  Subject:
	Eric and Shelly, goofing for the camera.

	He chucks it into the fire.  Draws a deep breath.

				ERIC
		Better now.  I feel good.  How are
		you, Elly, my friend?

	Elly is clearly uncomfortable, groping for an excuse just to see 
	Eric.  Eric is staring at her, intently.

				ERIC
		What is it?
				ELLY
		I knew.  I knew I knew you.  Even
		with the makeup and stuff you
		wore.
			(beat)
		You really loved her, didn't you?

	CLOSE-UP - FIREPLACE

	The photo burns and blackens in the grate.

				ERIC
		You brought flowers.  As long as 
		you don't forget her, Elly, she 
		lives.

				ELLY
			(upset)
		She's dead.  She's gone.  And now
		you're just gonna go away and
		never come back, too.  I hate this
		place; it isn't fair.

				ERIC
		Elly...

	He draws her close.  Wipes away an errant tear with his thumb.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Sometimes the people we care about
		are gone, for no reason.  Sometimes
		that's really tough.  I cry.  But if 
		the people we love are gone, we keep them --

	He taps Elly's temple, then his won.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		-- right here.  It's a big
		responsibility.  And that makes it 
		okay to mourn.
			(beat)
		I know that if you weren't here,
		I'd be very sad.

	Elly gives Eric a hug.

				ELLY
		You look funny without your white
		face on.  Like it's your day off
		or something.

	He quizzical expression amuses him.

				ERIC
		Somebody here wants to meet you. Gabriel?

	Gabriel the cat has wandered near the fireplace to join them.  
	Elly is immediately smitten.  Happy.
		
				ELLY
		I remember him!  Here, Gabriel...
		here kitty... Gabriel... Is he
		still yours?

				ERIC
		I think he's yours, now.

	The cat seems to like that idea.  Elly wraps him hugely up in
	her arms, talking to him: "How're you, Gabriel, whatcha doin'"

	ANOTHER ANGLE - TIGHTER ON ERIC

	While Elly is preoccupied with the cat, Eric gives up his last
	bit of Shelly to the fire - a portrait photo of her, small and 
	creased.  He puts it in the fire, watches it burn for a beat,
	then turns to Elly.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I have something else for you.

	BACK FOCUS as Eric lifts off his neck Shelly's ring for Elly's
	inspection.  The ring twirls large in f.g.

				ELLY
		Nobody ever gave me something like
		that before.  Ever.

	Eric places it around her neck.  Elly BEAMS.

				ERIC
		Shelly would've wanted you to have
		it.  This way, you'll think of her 
		every time you see it...

				ELLY
		And she'll be alive.  Up here.

	Elly TAPS her own temple with a smile, keeping one hand on the
	ring.

	INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Darla nervously smoking, doing her best to stay clean, but
	jittery.  Elly enters the shabby living room with Gabriel in her
	arms.

				DARLA
		I was wonderin' where you'd
		gotten to --
			(she sees Gabriel)
		Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?

				ELLY
		He was a present.  Besides, we're
		moving anyway.  You said.

				DARLA
		We'll discuss this later.
		Obviously.  You left the door open.

	DARLA points.  As Elly goes to close the door it opens.

	NEW ANGLE - FAVOR THE DOOR

	Grange enters accompanied by two Asian martial arts STRONGARMS
	(Lao Guards #3 & #4).  Grange looks around, bemused, his manner
	avuncular.

				GRANGE
		Hi, Elly.  Remember me?

	Elly's surprise is evident.  Darla is just plain pissed off.

				DARLA
		I don't remember you.  And I don't
		remember inviting...

	Grange pulls out a compact Polaroid camera.

		Now that's the expression I want.

	ANGLE - ELLY AND GUARD #4

	As she struggle mightily, to no avail, as Grange moves in to

	He snaps.  On the SX-70 WHIRR and flash white-out, we --

	EXT. LOFT BUILDING ROOFTOP - SUNSET

	Dark clouds have gathered to highlight the sunset.  Eric plays
	the guitar - LOUD, the SHelly theme in a major key.  Where
	before it was wandering, uncertain, now it's bold and
	heartbreaking.  Definitive.  Pain replaced by strength and a
	sense of homecoming.

	As Eric gets to the end of it, the notes are flying out... At
	the climax, rips the guitar up over his head and brings it 
	down -- SMASH -- on the Pignose.  He's finished here.

	EXT. STREET NEAR CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Eric marches along in plain view since everyone around him seems
	to be in costume.  The wind whips his coat.  KIDS bustle around
	him with trick-or-treat bags.  The crow perched on his shoulder.

	ERIC'S POV - CITY SKYLINE

	Somewhere, a few blocks over, a building is burning.

	ANGLE - ERIC WALKING

	A fire engine races past on the street.  He steps out in its
	wake and crosses over to --

	MEDIUM MOVING SHOT - THE CEMETERY

	waiting for him as he crosses to the fence.  Beyond the fence,
	in the distance, the church looms.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	He pauses.  A KID in a Creature from the Black Lagoon mask
	comes, passes Eric, then comes back for a touch.

				CREATURE KID
		Trick or treat!

	Eric smiles.  Not tonight.

	EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Eric is standing over the grave of Shelly Webster, looking down.
	He holds for a moment then moves on.

	EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT

	Eric ascends toward giant oak doors, tres Gothique.  The crow
	flaps past, leading him.

	NEW ANGLE - TOP OF STEPS -- where waits the Skull Cowboy.  As
	Eric approaches, the Skull Cowboy interposes himself between
	Eric and the huge double doors.

	Eric glares up, defiant.  Moves up the steps.  The Skull Cowboy
	extends a skeletal hand.  STOP.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Stop screwing around.

	TIGHT ON ERIC

	Angry, ready to battle:  You talking to me?

				SKULL COWBOY (CONT'D)
		Your job is done.  You interfere
		with the living again.

				ERIC
		Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I 
		might die.
			(beat)
		I've already done that.  I don't 
		need anyone's help.  Yours 
		included.

	STAIR ANGLE - ERIC AND SKULL COWBOY

	Eric lower, Skull Cowboy superior, the storm wild around them.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Do this thing and you will be
		vulnerable.  The blood will not
		return.
			(beat)
		No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.

				ERIC
		Fine with me.

	He ADVANCES a step up; the Skull Cowboy Hold fast.

				SKULL COWBOY
		You'll be alone.

				ERIC
		I'm already alone.

	INT. BELL TOWER - NIGHT

	Through a castle keep-like slit, Grange monitors Eric's
	arrival.  He speaks into a headset.

				GRANGE
		We've got company.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		Is he inside?

	GRANGE'S POV - ERIC

	Eric Talking to dead air.  Almost arguing with it.  Eerie.

	RESUME GRANGE

	As he talks into his mike he hefts a nightscoped, laser-sighted
	sniper's rifle.

				GRANGE
		He's just out front talking to
		himself.  You tell me. 

	EXT. CHURCH - RESUMING ERIC ON STEPS - NIGHT

	Eric, eyes steely, stares down the Skull Cowboy.

				ERIC
		Don't waste my time.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Very well, it's your ass.

	And the wind kicks up around them both, powerfully.

	ANGLE - SKULL COWBOY (EFFECT)

	As the force of the storm dust-devils around him and begins to
	disassemble him.  The fire in his eye sockets goes out.  His hat
	flies off an is pulverized by the wind.  The garments begin to
	disintegrate and blow around, rotten cerements falling apart in
	mid-air.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS -- transfixed by this unexpected
	development.  A shard of the Skull Cowboy blows past Eric's face 
	and transmutes to dust!

	RESUME SKULL COWBOY AT TOP OF STEPS (EFFECT)

	Transparent, ancient bones, crumbling and blowing away.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS

	As Eric lunges for what's left of his mysterious, smart-ass
	mentor
	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S LUNGING HAND

	Meeting only a swirl of vaporous dust where the Skull Cowboy's
	heart would have been.

	TIGHT ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS

	He has time to register the dust in his palm before it, too,
	renders down to nothingness,  leaving a vague green glow that
	dies.  And as he looks to the sky --

	UP ANGLE - THE CROW

	flapping down to land on Eric's shoulder.  Eric is astonished.

				ERIC
		But why are you still here?

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	No answer in the crow's eyes.

	RESUME AND FOLLOW ERIC

	That's good enough for Eric.  He marches to the double doors and
	shoves them back.

	INT. CHURCH - AS ERIC COMES THROUGH THE DOORS - NIGHT

	The high breeze blows in with him, disturbing dust in the
	disused Gothic dark.  Hollow cathedral ECHOES to sounds.  A
	giant 27" TV positioned on the alter, broadcasting static.

	LONG SHOT - ERIC AS HE APPROACHES THE ALTER - ("CROWVISION")

	Leery of potential danger from a thousand dark places.

	ANGLE - THE TV - AS ERIC ENTERS FRAME

	Onscreen:  Elly, gagged with duct tape and handcuffed to an iron
	ring bolted to a flagstone wall.  Could be anywhere inside the
	church.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		I believe our friend Elly call
		you Mister Crow.
			(beat)
		Please acknowledge; the mike
		will pick you up.
		
				ERIC
		I can see her.

				LAO
		Of course you can.
	ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY --  in darkness.  The running
	lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which
	THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light.

				LAO (CONT'D; O.S./FILTERED)
		Don't permit your rage to cloud
		the issue.  I believe in barter.
		I propose a simple trade.

	Grange sights his weapon.

	CROSSHAIR POV - ERIC AT THE ALTER

	Bluring as Grange resights.  Eric is not the target.  Blur
	FINDS the crow at the far end of the nave, perched in front of
	a giant stained glass window.

	NEW ANGLE - GRANGE -- squeezing off two quick, SILENCED shots.

	ANGLE - STAINED GLASS WINDOW -- the first shot blows a hole in
	some pastoral religious presentation.  TINKLE of glass.

	ANGLE - ERIC -- Spinning at the quiet !pfut! sound, to witness.

	ANGLE - INCOMING DART - ("CROWVISION")

	SPinning and hissing venomously.

	ANGLE - ERIC DUCKS

	As before, but the crow is not as fast.

	TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW

	As it catches the dart and goes down in a flurry of feathers.

	LOW ANGLE - ERIC AT ALTER - INCLUDE TV

	His knees buckle.  Sympathetic PAIN from the hit.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		You intended to finish this
		evening in the cemetery.  I am 
		here to help you on your way.

	ANGLE - RESUMING GRANGE IN GALLERY

	Swapping his tranquilizer gun for a more lethal rifle, similarly 
	scoped.  He sights the fallen Eric in a spray of green light.

	HIGH ANGLE - HAND HELD - ERIC AT ALTER

	Groping for support to drag himself back to standing.

				GRANGE (O.S.)
		I've got him if you want him.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		No shooting.

				GRANGE
			(into headset)
		Move in, guys.

	HIGH ANGLE - THE SANCTUARY -- as Lao Guards #3 and #4 move
	into light, closing on Eric's position in the center of isle.
	Both wield calico's and one bears a sword.

	CLOSE ANGLE - ALTER -- Lao makes his entrance from shadow
	wearing a brisk pugilist get-up, a practical fighting outfit.
	Makes a show of drawing the killing blade.

				LAO
		I wish to possess what you have now.

				ERIC
		I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.

				LAO
		I know.  That is why I will
		prevail.  Mr. Grange... ?

	Eric CRAMPS UP, CLUTCHING his throat in obvious pain.

	ANGLE - GRANGE AT STAINED GLASS WINDOW

	Holding the crow by the neck, TIGHTLY.  He plucks the tranq dart
	from the its body.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AS LAO MOVES IN CLOSER

	Crashing to one knee, invisibly bludgeoned, struggling to
	breathe.  Lao has no fear, walking around the stricken Eric.

				LAO
		Sooner or later, my action were
		destined to bring me a genuine
		Fury.  And it turned out to be you.
		At last.  I appreciate your
		abilities as few mortals can.
		That's why I desire them.

				ERIC
		You're too late.  There was a guy
		outside - on the stairs - you
		really need to talk to.  But he 
		turned to dust and blew away.
			(beat, gasping)
		I don't have any power for you to take.

				LAO
		I don't believe that.
	Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade.  Grange RELAXES
	his deathgrip on the crow.  MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may
	perceive a palpable degree of relief.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Time for you to die for me.
			 (beat)
		Funny, how the dead can still
		bleed.  How they need air.

	Eric IMMOBILIZED as Lao DRAWS BACK the Blade.  To Grange:

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Break its neck.

	ANGLE - RESUMING GRANGE AT WINDOW as he prepares to do dirty on
	the bird.

	Over his shoulder, we PUSH in to the BULLETHOLE from the first
	dart until we're in TIGHT CLOSE-UP of an eye watching through 
	the hole.

	EXT. CHURCH - OBVERSE OF WINDOW - NIGHT

	Albrecht digs through a sling bag of weaponry, trying to
	simultaneously monitor the peephole, muttering sotto to
	himself.

				ALBRECHT
		Had to go get yourself hip-deep in
		shit, didn't you, my friend.

	It begins to rain.  Albrecht glances resentfully toward the 
	sky.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Give it a rest, huh?

	A hefts a machinegun, clipped over and under.  CUTS LOOSE on
	full auto into the Madonna on the window.

	INT.  CHURCH NAVE - NIGHT

	As the window EXPLODES toward Grange and he sucks big hits from
	behind, DROPPING the crow.  The bird hits the ground, flapping
	weakly.

	LAO GUARDS #3 & #4 exchange a look and whip up their Calicos,
	RETURNING FIRE.

	EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT

	Albrecht takes cover as a lot of religious stuff is noisily
	destroyed all around his position.  Chunks of the window
	continue to disintegrate. 

	INT. CHURCH ALTER (NIGHT)

	Eric tuck-and-rolls out of the way as we go CLOSE on Lao, 
	screaming.

				LAO
		I said no shooting!

	Then he's ducking bullets himself as Albrecht STEPS IN through
	the blown out window, the machine gun stuttering on slugs.

	The sanctuary comes apart around Lao.  He RETREATS to the alter
	and EXITS whence he came.

	TIGHT ON PEW -- ERIC DIVES just as Guard #4 comes after him with
	the sword, which chomps into the wood and gets stuck there.
	Guard #4 releases it and cross draws his Calico as ERIC springs
	back into the frame -- STRAIGHT UP.

	TIGHT ON GUARD #4 as Eric's lancing foot propels him backward
	before he can fire.

	INTERCUTS -- ALBRECHT AND GUARD #3 scrambling to reload.  Guard
	changes magazine; Albrecht swaps clips.

	ANGLE - DOWN LENGTH OF PEW -- Guard #4 slides.  Sits up with his 
	gun as Eric, down-pew, grabs the sword.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AT WINDOW  firing now with a gun in each hand.

	RESUME ERIC AND GUARD #4, who eats it from Albrecht's gunfire,
	but not before he puts a round through Eric.

	Eric staggers back from the impact but keeps his feet.  

	RESUME ALBRECHT as he tosses away the dry pistol.  His machine
	gun jams, he fights to get the clip.

	ANGLE - GUARD #3 -- reloaded and rising, having caught Albrecht
	dead-bang in the open by the window.

	MOVING ANGLE - WITH ERIC --  A complex leap with the sword
	flashing.  He lands near Guard #3 and SLASHES UPWARDS, blade up.

	CLOSE-UP - GUARD #3 -- screaming in pain, gaping DOWN O.S.

	TIGHT ON ALBRECHT - looking UP, following the trajectory of
	something AIRBORNE toward him.

	CLOSE-UP - GUARD #3'S Calico spinning mid-air with Guard #3s
	HANDS still attached, severed mid-forearm by Eric's devastating
	strike.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT drops Guard #3 -- to REVEAL Eric in the
	background.  Eric salutes Albrecht with the tip of the sword.

	WITH ALBRECHT as he moves into the nave, which has been torn
	apart by gunfire.  Hazy smoke.  Two dead guys.  And Eric.

				ALBRECHT
		You sorta looked like you might
		need my help.

				ERIC
		This isn't your place.  This isn't
		your fight.  And I don't need
		your help.

				ALBRECHT
		You're welcome.

				ERIC
		Leave here.  Don't do this.  I
		don't want you here.

				ALBRECHT
		The hell you say.  This isn't just 
		about you any more.

	Eric stares dead-on at Albrecht, acidly, then BREAKS the Guard's 
	sword, dropping the pieces and turning his back on Albrecht, who
	pursues Eric to: 

	INT. SPIRAL STAIRCASE - TO BELL TOWER - NIGHT

	The crow FLAPS UPWARD through the void.  Eric grabs the thick
	bellrope, testing it.  A final look to Albrecht.

				ERIC
		Don't interfere.

				ALBRECHT
		You're bleeding, man.  You can't
		make it.

	Eric shinnies up the bellrope, ignoring Albrecht.

	ON ALBRECHT

	Watching as Eric dissappears from view, fast..  Grumbles.

				ALBRECHT
		You won't mind if I just take the
		stairs, then, smartass...

	He hefts his arsenal bag of hardware and begins to plod up the
	steps.

	ANGLE - MOVING WITH ERIC ON THE ROPE -- A weird perspective of
	speed climb.  Zip!  All the way to the top.

	EXT - CHURCH ROOF - NIGHT

	Slanted, shingled, slippery, dark.  Lightning deep in the turbid
	clouds.  The crow circles as Eric RISES INTO FRAME.

				ERIC
		Here I am.

	DOWNFRAME lightning STRIKES the ornate LIGHTNING ROD (large,
	Victorian, lance-like) at the far end of the roof from the bell
	tower.

	SILHOUETTING Lao and Elly standing in front of it.  Elly
	flinches at the strike.

				LAO
		Can you fly, Crow man?

	INT. BELLTOWER SPIRAL STAIRS - RESUMING ALBRECHT

	He stops his ascent to light a cigarette.

				ALBRECHT
		I ain't cut out for this superhero
		shit.

	EXT. CHURCH ROOF - RESUMING LAO - NIGHT

	Lao SNAPS Elly's free handcuff to the dimly glowing  lightning
	rod and advances, one foot on either side of the peak of the
	roof, his blade brandished.

	CLOSE MOVING SHOT - ERIC -- Hands up to grapple, but
	weaponless.  He spiders to meet Lao, suddenly PICKING UP SPEED
	and RUNNING along the precarious peak.

	Lao sees him coming, braces to strike, but Eric executes a BROAD
	FLYING LEAP right over Lao's head.

	ERIC LANDS, SLIPS, sprawls sideways, clinging to the peak of the
	roof.  Lao hurries in to slash with the blade, as Eric averts.
	The steel RINGS.  Eric converts his dodge into a low spin kick
	that DUMPS Lao.

	Eric SPREAD-EAGLES to keep from falling.  Distantly, Lao
	similarly saves himself.

	NEW ANGLE -- THE FIGHT -- Here comes Lao, crabbing back toward
	the peak.  Eric ROLLS to Elly's position, GRABS the lightning
	rod and tries to wrest it loose.

	SIZZLE OF FLESH as Eric's hands are scorched: the metal is still
	blue-hot.

	MOVING WITH LAO as Eric battles to free the lightning rod.  Lao
	closes up distance, gives a warcry and prepares to swing as - 

	Eric WRENCHES the rod loose and turns to deflect Lao's blow.
	The weapons spark as they meet... and there goes Elly, her
	handcuff freed, SLIDING DOWN THE ROOF SLOPE.

	ANGLE  -- ROOF SLOPE -- WITH ERIC  as he dodges Lao by using the
	lightning rod to vault down to where Elly is about to slip off
	the roof.

	With the rod embedded in the roof, Eric hangs on, and elly hangs 
	on to Eric.

	UP ANGLE -- LAO, a dark figure against the night sky, raising
	the sword.

				LAO
		Face me!

	Eric guides Elly to the top of one of the flying buttresses.
	When he looks up, Lao is gone.

	ANGLE - BELL TOWER -- Albrecht's head pokes up at last.  Looks
	around, finally spots Eric below and to the left.  YELLS, serio-comic.

				ALBRECHT
		Is he dead yet?

	INSERT - ALBRECHT'S HOLSTER as Lao's hand draws Albrecht's
	gun quickly.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND LAO --Lao has blindsided Albrecht.

				LAO
		No.  You are.

	He jams the gun into the base of ALbrecht's neck and fires three times.

	CLOSE ANGLE - ERIC - He's too far away to matter.  Shock.

	INSERT - ALBRECHT'S CIGARETTE as it rolls down the slope,
	trailing sparks, snuffing out.

	ANGLE - ERIC holding onto the lightning rod as lightning CUTS the
	night above him.

	ANGLE -- LAO AT BELL TOWER, triumphant and a bit wild, SHOUTING.
				LAO
		You've caused another death,
		Mister Draven!  The girl will die
		as well -- because of you!

	ANGLE - ELLY ON FLYING BUTTRESS

	The base of a triangle - Lao, Eric, Elly.

				ELLY
		You go to hell, you pervert!

	RESUME ERIC

	Rage over the loss of Albrecht.  He RISES, hurting but mad as
	hell.  GLARES UP toward Lao.

				ERIC
		And how many lives have you destroyed?

				LAO
		I took yours from you.  Your
		little girlfriend?  I took hers,
		too.  Your meaningless, petty
		life?  I took it so that tonight
		your existence might gain a
		purpose.  You're no avenger.
		You're mine.

	PUSH IN TIGHT ON ERIC.

	Eyes alight with hatred for Lao.

				ERIC
			 (to himself)
		You're right, I'm not an avenger. 
		Not any more.

	As lightning strikes, Eric Fires his gaze TOWARD THE SKY.

	HIGH ANGLE - LAO ON ROOFTOP - ("CROWVISION")

	SEEING the crash dive toward Lao through the row's eyes.

	ANGLE  - LAO ON ROOFTOP

	As the crow wings down INTO FRAME and lights on Lao's head, CLAWING!

	CLOSE-UP -- THE CROW ON LAO'S HEAD slashing with its claws.
	Pecking out Lao's eyes.

	WITH ERIC -- on the roofslope as he totters but maintains his
	climb, the crow/Lao UPFRAME B.G.

	RESUME LAO -- as the crow abandons him.  Lao STAGGERS AND FALLS
	down the roof - toward Eric.
	SLANTED ANGLE -- ERIC AND LAO -- Eric ARRESTS Lao's fall,
	fisting lapels and bringing him nose to nose.  Fury.

				ERIC
		Time for a sacrifice.

	Lao's face is a hideous bloody mask with black holes where the
	eyes used to be.  He smiles gruesomely.

				LAO
		I don't need eyes to take what I
		want from you.

	He EMBRACES Eric and RAMS the killing blade deep into Eric's
	back!

	ON ERIC as he looks down to see the blade protruding from his
	sternum.  Tight grimace.  A lot of pain.

				ERIC
		Can you fly?

	He pulls Lao into a BACKWARD ROLL down the roof, HOLDING HIM
	TIGHT.

	MOVING ANGLE -- INTERCUTS -- ERIC AND LAO FALL

	Eric lands on his back, forcing the blade THROUGH himself and
	INTO Lao.  Eric completes the roll and KICKS Lao off INTO SPACE,
	the killing blade still embedded in him!

	WITH LAO as crashes, sliding, sprawling down PAST Elly's
	position.  Gets to his knees atop the flying buttress.  Sees the
	blade in his own chest.

	CLOSE-UP - ELLY - she sees it all happen.

	RESUME LAO - a regretful look toward Eric.  He PLUMMETS off the 
	roof edge.

	ANGLE - ERIC SLIDES DOWN ROOF --  He slows, stopping when Elly
	is in frame.  He clutches his own chest.  Regards his own
	shaking hand, drenched in his won blood.  Glazed.

	ON ELLY, as she finally gets the duct tape off her mouth, trying
	to get to Eric.  She flails and cries out.

				ELLY
		Don't let me fall!

	CLOSE-UP -- their hands finally meet and GRASP TIGHT.

	EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT (LATER) (RAIN)

	A low angle TRACKING SHOT (as when we first met Elly).

	Eric's and Elly's feet pass graves.  Eric's pace is slow, crippled, 
	limping.  They STOP at a grave where elly BENDS INTO FRAME to steal 
	the flowers there.

	Eric is bloody and out of it.  She helps him walk.

				ELLY
		Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.

				ERIC
		In a better place.  I hope.

				ELLY
		You're not gonna come back, are you?

	Eric's response is halting and uncertain.  But he tries to give
	her hope.  He reaches for Shelly's ring around her neck, holds
	it up to her.

				ERIC
		I don't know if I can.  But you
		have this... and you know where to come.

				ELLY
		You mean you'll, like' dig your way
		out of the grave?  Euww.

	Eric is amused by this in spite of his grievous injuries.

	He grasps Elly's face in his hands and bends, painfully,to kiss
	her on the forehead.

				ERIC
		For you, I'll try.  Promise.

	MOVE WITH ERIC

	Spent, empty, he holds the rose determinedly, but he's never
	going to make it the few yards back to his own grave.  So close.

	His legs finally go and he collapses onto the humus.  One
	groping hand tries to drag him further.

				ERIC
		Leave me now.

	ANGLE - ELLY

	Tears on her face.  She can't watch this.  She TURNS and drops
	the flowers on Shelly's grave.

	ERIC'S POV - HIS OWN GRAVE

	Still too far away to matter.

	RESUME ERIC ON GROUND

	He gives it up, his face sinking into the wet grass for a beat
	before SHELLY'S HAND intrudes INTO FRAME to GRASP his hand.

	No ethereal glow, no heavenly choir... just a near-dead Eric's
	blank-faced astonishment, and he moves forward.

	ANGLE - ELLY - SHELLY'S GRAVE BG

	She struggles to get her hood up against the rain and roughly
	wipes the moisture from her face with her sleeve.  She turns
	toward Eric's grave.  Then, surprised, she looks close.

	ANGLE - ERIC'S GRAVE

	Eric is gone.  The white rose lies neatly on the top of the
	undisturbed  earth there.

	HIGH ANGLE - CEMETERY

	Emphasizing that Elly is now ALONE in the graveyard.

	LOW ANGLE on Elly, ROSE in the foreground --

	She walks OFF.  HOLD the rose.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAY (OVERCAST)

	A grey day but no rain.  Elly stands wistfully by the window,
	her doll on standby.  The apartment is in order and perhaps we
	notice a few new items.  Gabriel the cat, miraculously ALIVE, is
	sprawled on a chair, licking himself.  Darla BUSTLES INTO FRAME
	B.G.  Her wardrobe more upscale, her hair done.  Her manner is
	hectic but natural.

				DARLA
		Worktime, kiddo.  First day, new
		job, gotta go.

	This does not get the expected smile from Elly.

				DARLA (CONT'D)
		You sure you're gonna be okay?

	Elly turns from the window and NODS silently.

	ELLY'S POV - OUTSIDE

	The aforementioned grey day in the city.

	ANGLE - DARLA AND ELLY AT THE WINDOW.

	Darla comes up.  Arm around Elly.  Cheer up; he attitude much
	more connected and loving.  PUSH IN ON ELLY so we know she is
	clutching SHelly's ring tightly in her hand.  Darla looks past
	Elly, out the window.

				DARLA
		At least it finally stopped
		raining.

				ELLY
		It can't rain all the time.

	Darla kisses Elly on the temple and it out the door.  Elly OPENS
	her hand to consider the ring.  She looks back out the window --

	ANGLE - THE CROW ON THE LEDGE

	Elly is looking right at it.  Same crow.  We're positive.  So is
	Elly.  It TAKES WING and flies away.

	EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

	An UP ANGLE from Eric's grave toward the tree as the crow FLIES
	INTO FRAME and perches there, shucking water.  PUSH IN on the
	crow.  Watching.  Waiting.

1    EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DAY                               1

     We circle around the island of Manhattan moving closer and
     closer till we're looking down on Fifth Avenue. As the
     melody continues to play we MOVE towards a building and ZOOM
     into a window.

2    INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY                              2

     A fifty-year old female therapist (DR. GREENBAUM) sits at
     her desk, frowning as she takes notes. Books of Jung and
     Freud line the shelves.

     A young man (SEBASTIAN VALMONT) sits in a chair in front
     of her looking impatient.

     The therapist continues to write notes.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Jesus. We've been at this for six
               months.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I know.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               And you haven't made an ounce of
               progress.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I know.

     Sebastian takes out a cigarette.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
                    (not looking up)
               There's no smoking in my office.

     Sebastian sneers at her then puts the cigarette away. Dr.
     Greenbaum finishes her notes and looks up at him, shaking
     her head.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What do you want me to say? That I'm
               supposed to feel remorse because I act
               the way I do? The truth is I don't.

     Dr. Greenbaum shakes her head and takes notes.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Look, I'm not like all the other kids
               in high school. I don't care about book
               reports and extra-credit. Teachers
               are idiots anyway. The only challenge
               out there for me is women. You see a
               girl you like. You pursue them. You
               conquer. You move on. It's exciting.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               But you said you have the worst
               reputation.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I do.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Don't you want to change that?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Let me tell you something, doctor.
               Chicks love a guy with a bad rap.
               They say they don't, but they don't
               mean it. They all think that they're
               the ones that are going to "save me."
               The trick is to let them think it's
               true.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               I think that's all the time we have
               for today.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Same time next week?

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               No. This is going to be our last
               session.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why? I like spending time with you.
               You know, you're quite attractive for
               a woman your age. You have killer legs.
               Killer.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a
               lot of money to send you here. I'm
               trying to help you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big
               help.

     Sebastian picks up a book of Freud.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               He was a coke addict, you know.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               You think you can come in here with that
               cute little smirk on your face and try
               and flirt with me. It doesn't work,
               Sebastian.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It works a little.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               No it doesn't. I see right through you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You do?

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               I hope for your sake you grow out of
               this immature phase. It's going to get
               you into trouble.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well, you don't have to get nasty about
               it.

     Sebastian approaches a photo on her desk and picks it up.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               My daughter, Rachel.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yummy.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Don't even think about it. Rachel is an
               exceptionally well rounded young
               woman, who happens to be attending
               Princeton this fall. She's way too
               smart to fall for your line of b.s.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Really? Care to make a wager on that?

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Good luck, Sebastian.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What, nervous I'm going to win?

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Would you please leave.

     Sebastian puts on his glasses and leaves.

                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)
               Asshole.

     The doctor stews for a moment, then reaches into her
     desk, sifts through some papers where she finds a pack of
     Benson & Hedges and lights one up. She looks at the photo
     of her daughter, then hits the speaker phone and dials.

                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)
               Rachel, it's mom.

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:

3    INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - DAY                                3

     RACHEL, Doctor Greenbaum's daughter sits at her desk,
     crying while holding the phone.

                              RACHEL
               Hi, mom.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Honey, is something wrong?

     Rachel cries for a moment.

                              RACHEL
               He told me he loved me and I believed
               him.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Who told you?

                              RACHEL
               You don't know him. I'm so stupid.

     She continues to cry.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep
               breath, and step out of the circle.

                              RACHEL
               Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit,
               mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.

     WE PAN OVER TO HER COMPUTER CONSOLE. CLOSE ON: COMPUTER
     MONITOR - A nudie web-sight. The title reads "Ivy League
     Bound." Beneath the caption is a photo of Rachel tied to
     a bed and smiling with a Princeton banner covering her
     privates.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               What kind of pictures?

                              RACHEL
               Nudie pictures, what do you think?

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Jesus Christ, how can you be so
               stupid?

                              RACHEL
               I don't know. He was just so charming.
               All he did was talk about how I had
               killer legs and how we wanted to
               photograph them. Things just got out
               of hand from there.
                    (she hears the phone drop)
               Mom? Are you there? Mom?
                    (screaming)
               Mother!!!!

4    INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY           4

     Doctor Greenbaum bolts out of her office and spots
     Sebastian standing in the elevator.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               You son of a bitch.

     Doctor Greenbaum races down the hall pushing several
     people out of her way. Sebastian stares at her
     expressionless as the elevator doors close.

                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)
               You're gonna pay for this you little
               shit. You hear me.

     A DENTIST peers outside of his office to see what's
     going on. He exchanges looks with Doctor Greenbaum.

                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)
               Fuck off, Harold.

     He gasps.

5    EXT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - DAY                               5

     A METER MAID is writing a ticket on a car when a Porsche
     pulls up in front of the townhouse and parks in a red
     zone. Sebastian steps out of the car and walks up the
     steps to the townhouse.

                              METER MAID
               You can't park there.

     Sebastian turns to her and sneers. He takes out a wad of
     money and shoves it in her breast pocket before entering
     the townhouse.

6    INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                     6

     A SERIES OF SHOTS

     CLOSE ON:  A tuna on a chopping board. WHACK! A butcher
     knife comes down on the tuna cutting it's head off.

     CLOSE ON: Two hands ripping open the fish.

     CLOSE ON: Two hands rolling a chunk of tuna into a rice
     roll.

7    INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                     7

     CLOSE ON: Two hands which carry a lavish tray of sushi
     through several doors until we enter the final door
     leading into -

8    INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 8

     A enormous living room by Manhattan standards, with a
     view that overlooks the park. Eclectic art from around
     the world emphasize the Valmont's passion for travel.

     SOOK-HEE, the Valmont's housekeeper sets a tray of sushi
     in front of -

     KATHRYN MERTEUIL, a seventeen year old porcelain
     skinned WASP with all the grooming you could want in an
     East Coast child. She sits with a forced smile on her
     face and listens attentively as -

     BUNNY CALDWELL, a forty year old nouveau-riche socialite
     talks incessantly. CECILE CALDWELL, her beautiful
     teenage daughter, sits by her side. She wears a T-shirt
     with a Koala Bear on it.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I can't tell you how happy we are that
               Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you
               this fall. You've always been an
               inspiration to Beau and I on raising
               her. We just hope she can rise to the
               high standards which you've set for
               her.

                              KATHRYN
               I'll do my best.

     Sook-Hee pours a dish of soy sauce in front of Kathryn.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
                    (to Sook-Hee, in Vietnamese)
               Thank you, Sook-Hee. That will be
               all.

     Sook-Hee leaves.

                              CECILE
               What was that?

                              KATHRYN
               I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a
               beautiful language.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               Kathryn is a straight A student at
               Oakwood as well as being President of
               the French Club. Listen to whatever
               she has to say and you'll go far.

                              KATHRYN
                    (in French)
               You're too kind.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring
               that goes on in high school. Where
               do you get your strength?

                              KATHRYN
               I know this sounds corny, but whenever
               I feel temptations of peer pressure,
               I...
                    (takes out her crucifix)
               turn to God and he helps me through the
               problem. Call me an anachronism, but
               it works.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               That's beautiful.

                              CECILE
               What are the boys like?

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Cecile, is that the best you can do?
                    (to Kathryn)
               You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never
               been in a co-educational atmosphere before.

                              KATHRYN
               Don't worry, it's totally understandable.
               Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood
               are very upstanding gentleman, however
               there are the occasional bad apples.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't
               believe they didn't expel him after what he
               did to the school nurse.

                              SEBASTIAN (O.S.)
               I hear she's recovering quite well.

     Mrs. Caldwell turns to see Sebastian standing in the
     doorway. He walks over and takes a seat.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Nice to see you again, Mrs. Caldwell.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               You remember my daughter, Cecile.

                              SEBASTIAN
               My, what an adorable shirt you're
               wearing.

                              CECILE
               My father just took me on a trip to Australia.

                              SEBASTIAN
               How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Outstanding.

                              CECILE
               What year are you in?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.

                              CECILE
               But I thought high school is only four years.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.

     He winks at Cecile.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I think we'll be going now.
                    (to Kathryn)
               Thanks for all your help.

     Kathryn stands and approaches Cecile.

                              KATHRYN
               I'll call you later and we'll get together
               and plan your curriculum.

                              CECILE
               Thanks.
                    (to Sebastian)
               Nice meeting you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ciao.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Let's go, Cecile. Now!

     Cecile follows Mrs. Caldwell out the door. Kathryn
     closes the door behind them.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash
               and her stupid daughter are doing in my
               house?

                              KATHRYN
               I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.

     Kathryn sits on the sofa next to Sebastian. She unscrews
     her crucifix. The top part becomes a small spoon and the
     bottom part a small vial of coke.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               The parental units called while you were out.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a
               mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my
               inheritance per usual?

                              KATHRYN
               Hopefully, though she suspects that your
               decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the
               maid.

     Kathryn uses her crucifix as a coke-spoon and snorts a
     bump.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               What's wrong with you today? Therapy not
               going well?

                              SEBASTIAN
               It was fine.

     He leaps off the sofa and starts to pace.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I'm sick of sleeping with these insipid
               Manhattan Debutantes.

     He walks over to the wall where nude Botticelli hangs.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Nothing shocks them anymore.

     He scratches the nude's pubic area.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I'm beginning to feel like I'm losing my
               touch.

     He kisses it.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have
               a mission for you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What?

9    EXT. PARK - DAY                                            9

     COURT REYNOLDS, an Aryan seventeen year old preppy, wears
     a Polo sweater with an American Flag.

                              KATHRYN (V.O.)
               You know Court Reynolds, son of Garret
               Reynolds?

     Kathryn steps into frame and embraces him. She is wearing
     the same sweater. He kisses her forehead and messes
     up her hair.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               You mean the Nazi who dumped you over Fourth
               Of July Weekend?

10   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 10

     Kathryn throws a sushi at him. Sebastian catches it.

                              KATHRYN
               He didn't dump me. We had a parting of
               the ways.

     Sebastian stares her down.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Alright he dumped me.

     He smiles, then swallows the sushi.

11   EXT. PUBLIC PARKING GARAGE/INT. COURT' S CAR - NIGHT       11

     A drunk Court sits in the driver's side and takes a final
     swig from his flask. He quickly passes out.

                              KATMRYN (V.O.)
               I went to great lengths to please Court.
               Huge sacrifices were made on my part to
               keep him happy.

     Kathryn rises up INTO FRAME, looks at Court and scowls.

                              SEBASTIAN(V.O.)
               Swallow?

     She spits on him, then wipes her mouth.

                              KATHRYN (V.O.)
               What do you think?

     Kathryn sprays her mouth with Binaca.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               Sorry.

12   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 12

                              KATHRYN
               In any event, my feelings were hurt when I
               learned that he had fallen for someone else.
               Someone chaste... pure... innocent.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You don't mean?

13   EXT. PARK - DAY                                            13

     Cecile turns toward the camera, while eating a double scoop
     ice cream cone and wearing a Mickey Mouse Club hat.

                              KATHRYN (V.O.)
               None other than Cecile Caldwell.

     She takes a lick of the ice cream, which falls off the cone.
     She mouths the word "shoot" and stomps her feet

14   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 14

     Sebastian snickers.

                              KATHRYN
               I don't find this very funny,

                              SEBASTIAN
               So that's what this is all about.
                    (imitating Kathryn)
               We'll get together and plan your
               curriculum.

                              KATHRYN
               Keep your friends close and your
               enemies closer. When I get through
               with her, she'll be the premier Blow
               Job Queen of the Tri-State area and
               poor little Court's heart will be
               shattered.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why go through Cecile? Why not just
               attack Court?

                              KATHRYN
               Because if there's an attack made on
               Court it could be traced back to me.
               I can't allow that to happen.
               Everybody loves me and I intend to
               keep it that way.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I see your point... though why should
               I care?

                              KATHRYN
               I need you to seduce our young Cecile.
               Introduce her to your world of
               decadence and debauchery.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sounds intriguing.

                              KATHRYN
               She's quite cute you know. Young
               supple breasts, a tight firm ass and
               an uncharted pootie.

     Sebastian watches Kathryn rub herself. He licks his
     lips.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Be her Captain Picard, Valmont.
               Boldly go where no man has gone
               before.

     Sebastian places his hand over Kathryn's as she continues
     to rub herself. He thinks for a moment, then:

                              SEBASTIAN
               I can't.

     Kathryn throws his hand off of hers.

                              KATHRYN
               Why not?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy.
               "But I thought high school was only
               four years." I mean, please. She knows
               nothing. She's seen nothing. I could
               have her under the table at Au Bar
               sucking me off before the appetizer
               arrived. Go get one of those moron
               friends of yours to do it. I have a
               reputation to uphold.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh but diddling the therapist's
               daughter is a challenge?

                              SEBASTIAN
               That was just simple revenge. What I
               have planned requires sheer genius.

     He takes a magazine and throws it on the table. Kathryn
     picks it up. It's the latest issue of "Seventeen."

                              KATHRYN
               I'm not interested in the latest dating
               tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Shut up and turn to page 64.

     She turns to the page. INSERT MAGAZINE ARTICLE: The title
     reads: A VIRGIN'S MANIFESTO. "Why I Plan To Wait
     Until Marriage," by Annette Harrison. Age 17. Kansas
     City, Missouri.

                              KATHRYN
               Jesus Christ, is she for real?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh yes. I've read it over and over again.
               This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little
               angel. A paradigm of chastity and
               virtue.

                              KATHRYN
               B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to
               Kansas and woo little Dorothy.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It just so happens we're not in Kansas
               anymore. Our little angel's father has
               accepted the new headmaster position at
               Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up
               in Connecticut while Daddy sells his
               house. Can you imagine what this would
               do for my reputation? Screwing the new
               headmaster's virginal daughter before
               school starts? It will be my greatest
               victory.

                              KATHRYN
               You don't stand a chance. Even this is
               out of your league.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Care to make a wager on that?

                              KATHRYN
               I'll think about it...

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another
               chapter to my work of art.

     He holds up a leather bound JOURNAL.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more
               queer?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Could you be more desperate to read it?

     Sebastian stands to leave and heads to the door.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh Sebastian. About that little wager
               of yours.

     He stops.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Count me in.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What are the terms?

                              KATHRYN
               If you lose, then that hot little Porsche
               of yours is mine.

                              SEBASTIAN
               And if I win?

     She approaches him.

                              KATHRYN
               I'll give you something you've been
               jerking off about ever since our parents
               got married.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Be more specific.

                              KATHRYN
               In English.
                    (whispers in his ear)
               I'll fuck your brains out.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What makes you think I'd go for that
               bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar
               car.

                              KATHRYN
               Because I'm the only person you can't
               control and it kills you.

     Sebastian sneers at her.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Do we have a deal?

                              SEBASTIAN
               No way, that car means everything to
               me.

     She kisses him and licks her tongue over his lips.

                              KATHRYN
                    (whispering)
               You can put it anywhere.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Even there?

                              KATHRYN
                    (baby talk)
               It would feel so yummy.

     Sebastian hesitates, then shakes her hand.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Happy hunting.

15   EXT. ROSEMOND ESTATE - AERIAL SHOT - DAY                   15

     WE MOVE across the sky looking down at lush greens and
     stately mansions till WE PASS over the ROSEMOND ESTATE.
     Enormous in size. WE SEE two riders on horseback.

16   EXT. ESTATE - MEADOW - DAY                                 16

     ANGLE ON: The two horseback riders. One, a woman of
     seventy. This is HELEN ROSEMOND, Sebastian's aunt.
     The other rider is a beautiful seventeen year old girl.
     The one and only ANNETTE HARRISON.

                              ANNETTE
               It's a beautiful home you have here
               Mrs. Rosemond.

                              AUNT HELEN
               Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been
               with my family for over sixty years.
               Does your family do much riding?

                              ANNETTE
               My mother and I used to ride a lot,
               before she got sick.

                              AUNT HELEN
               I'm sorry about that.

                              ANNETTE
               My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his
               farm so I would come over and ride all
               the time.

                              AUNT HELEN
               I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in
               the mid-west. What's his name?

                              ANNETTE
               Ben Schwarz.

                              AUNT HELEN
               Schwarz. Jewish?

                              ANNETTE
               German.

                              AUNT HELEN
               Doesn't ring a bell.

     Annette throws her a concerned look.

                              AUNT HELEN (cont'd)
               In any event, I want you to consider
               this your home for the time being.

                              ANNETTE
               Thank you. It's so peaceful and quiet
               around here.

     BANG! A shotgun sounds in the distance.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               What was that?

                              AUNT HELEN
               Sebastian must be here.

     Aunt Helen gallops down the ridge followed by Annette.

17   EXT. ESTATE - GARDEN - DAY                                 17

     Sebastian stands holding a shotgun. A groundskeeper,
     FRANKLIN stands by the trap.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Pull!

     The TARGET soars into the air,

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Die motherfucker!

     He fires the gun, missing the target.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Shit, shit, shit.

     Franklin shakes his head. WE HEAR a cat MEOW. Sebastian
     perks up.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Kitty. Kitty.

     He quietly reloads his rifle. WE HEAR the cat MEOW
     again. Sebastian searches for the cat.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Puss Puss Puss Puss Puss.

     He raises his rifle and takes aim.

                              AUNT HELEN (O.S.)
               Sebastian!

     He lowers his rifle and turns to SEE Aunt Helen and
     Annette riding over to him. He waves.

     Aunt Helen dismounts from her horse and they hug.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I've been looking all over for you.
               God, I've missed you.

                              AUNT HELEN
               I've missed you too. How are your
               parents?

                              SEBASTIAN
               They're coming back next week. I write
               them everyday.

     She strokes his cheek, lovingly.

                              AUNT HELEN
               Sebastian, this is Annette Harrison.
               She's going to be staying with me for
               a few weeks.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I guess that makes two of us. Welcome.

     He extends his hand and they shake.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
                    (to Aunt Helen)
               Why don't you head in and whip us up
               some of that ice tea of yours? We'll
               take care of the horses.

                              AUNT HELEN
               Anything for you, my dear.

     Sebastian climbs on Aunt Helen's horse.

                              AUNT HELEN (cont'd)
               Stay out of trouble you two.

                              SEBASTIAN & ANNETTE
               We will.

     He smiles at Annette and beckons her to follow.

18   INT. ESTATE - STABLE - DAY                                 18

     Sebastian and Annette put the riding gear away.

                              SEBASTIAN
               So what year are you going into?

                              ANNETTE
               Junior.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Got a boyfriend back home?

                              ANNETTE
               No.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why not?

                              ANNETTE
               I don't know. Relationships seem too
               distracting. I'd rather concentrate on
               my studies.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You a lesbo?

                              ANNETTE
                    (annoyed)
               No.

     She bends over to pick up the saddle.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Nice.

     She sighs, disgusted, then turns toward him.

                              ANNETTE
               Are you often this offensive on a first
               encounter?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I was just being honest. You happen to
               have a nice ass. Sorry.

     She shakes her head and continues with her chore.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I read your teen beat manifesto.

                              ANNETTE
               You did?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I must say I found it rather appalling.

                              ANNETTE
               That's a first. Most people praised me
               for it.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Most people are morons. I mean who are
               you to knock what you've never experienced?

                              ANNETTE
               I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my
               belief that people shouldn't actually
               experience the act of love until they are
               in love and that people our age are too
               immature to be in touch with those
               emotions.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh really?

                              ANNETTE
               Take yourself. You've slept with several
               women. Are you happier because of it?

                              SEBASTIAN
               How do you know I've been with several
               women?

                              ANNETTE
               A friend wrote me.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (pissed)
               Well maybe you should get to know the
               person before you judge them instead of
               listening to some bullshit gossip.

                              ANNETTE
               I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you...
               but you still didn't answer the question.

     An uncomfortable silence falls between them,

                              SEBASTIAN
               Who the hell is taking the time to write
               letters, spreading this shit about me?

                              ANNETTE
               It's not really important.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're
               not going to be friends.

                              ANNETTE
               Why are you being so dramatic?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm
               trying to deal with them and the last
               thing I need is people spreading shit
               about me.

                              ANNETTE
               Alright, I said I was sorry.
                    (beat)
               Can we start over again? I think we've
               gotten off on the wrong foot.

     She approaches him and they shake.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               Annette Harrison.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sebastian Valmont.

     She smiles, but before he releases her hand:

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               So tell me, Annette. I'm curious, since
               you've never had sex do you touch
               yourself?

     She whisks her hand away and storms out of the stable.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What did I say?

19   INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - STUDY - DAY                      19

     CLOSE ON: A hand stroking the bridge of a cello.

                              RONALD (O.S.)
               That's good, that's good.

     WE PULL BACK

     Cecile sits in front Of a cello. Next to her sits RONALD
     CLIFFORD, a well-mannered fifteen year old African
     American. Holding his own cello, he is giving her a
     music lesson.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Now let's try the A minor scale.

     Cecile attempts the A minor scale, fucking up badly.

     Kathryn enters and shudders in silence.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Once more, and remember the third note
               is flat.

     Cecile tries again and once again screws up.

                              CECILE
               Oh, I suck. I suck.

                              RONALD
               Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.

     Cecile takes a deep breath

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               You're concentrating too much on your
               bowing. Let it flow.

     He stands and sits behind her.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Here, let me help you.

     He places his hand over hers.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Now close your eyes and let's try again.

     She closes her eyes and they repeat the scale. It sounds
     much better. Ronald takes the moment to study Cecile's
     face. It's obvious he's smitten with her.

     ON KATHRYN: who watches from the door. A grin crosses
     her face.

     Ronald replaces her other hand and plays a beautiful Bach
     Sonata, with he and Cecile sharing the bowing. He closes
     his eyes as the music takes over him. Now Cecile opens
     her eyes and gazes into his. The feeling is mutual.

     ON KATHRYN: She accidentally bangs her hand onto a table
     which causes a metal tray to fall to the ground.

     Ronald and Cecile look up as Kathryn replaces the tray

                              KATHRYN
               I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.
               Your playing was beautiful.

     Ronald quickly stands and moves away from Cecile

                              CECILE
               Kathryn, this is Ronald Clifford. He's
               giving me music lessons over the
               summer.

     Ronald approaches and shakes Kathryn's hand.

                              RONALD
               Pleased to meet you.

                              KATHRYN
               Likewise I'm sure.

                              CECILE
               Ronald is one of the few high school
               students attending Juliard. He's
               composing his first opera.

                              RONALD
               It's based on the life of Doctor
               Martin Luther King.

                              CECILE
               Doctor King is my favorite.

     Ronald shakes his head, but laughs. Cecile looks at him
     and smiles. Kathryn rolls her eyes.

                              RONALD
               I guess our hour's up. Same time
               tomorrow?

     Cecile nods.

20   EXT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - DAY                                  20

     Another nice home in Connecticut. Sebastian's Porsche is
     parked outside.

21   INT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY                        21

     A typical teenagers bedroom, expect this one is a shrine
     to Herb Ritts homo-erotic art.

     BLAINE TUTTLE, Oakwood Prep's resident drug-dealer and
     open homosexual, sits at his desk separating pot seeds
     from his stash.

     Sebastian paces behind him.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -

                              BLAINE
               - none taken -

                              SEBASTIAN
               - wrote a letter to this chick and saying
               shit about me.

                              BLAINE
               Any ideas who it could be?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Blaine, if I knew who it was that person
               wouldn't be alive right now.

                              BLAINE
               Where did you say she's from?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?

                              BLAINE
               Greg McConnell.

                              SEBASTIAN
               The football stud?

                              BLAINE
               He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be
               surprised if he was your rat.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It would make sense. McConnell hates me.
               I fingered his girlfriend at the game
               last year.

                              BLAINE
               I don't think that bothered him.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What do you mean?

                              BLAINE
               Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight
               ends on and off the field.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Are you shitting me?

                              BLAINE
               I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak
               in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd
               go at it for a while, then as soon as
               he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You
               know -
                    (imitating Greg)
               "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag.
               I'll kick your ass if you say anything."
                    (beat)
               It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're
               gay, deal with it. The only reason why
               I let him continue with his charade is
               because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.

                              BLAINE
               Not anymore. Football team started
               practice last week. He's already called
               me to hook up.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Really. You think you could arrange a
               little get together with him tonight on
               my behalf?

                              BLAINE
               Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing
               Spartacus on television tonight.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Outstanding.

                              BLAINE
               Don't think it's not going to cost you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               No problem. Just make sure your front
               door is unlocked. Shall we say the
               "stroke of midnight" no pun intended?

     Sebastian hands Blaine two hundred dollar bills.

22   EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY                                    22

     Kathryn and Cecile sit on a blanket. A lavish picnic lies
     around them. Kathryn wears large sunglasses, a scarf and
     a hat to protect her from the sunlight. She sits behind
     Cecile and braids her hair.

                              KATHRYN
               So, rumor has it that you went on a date
               with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very
               nice.

                              CECILE
               He's alright.
                    (giggles)
               He kept talking about this bulimic
               headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.

                              KATHRYN
               Really? Bulimic headcase.

                              CECILE
               What a loser she must be.
                    (beat)
               Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons
               for Labor Day Weekend.

                              KATHRYN
               That's great.

                              CECILE
               You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm
               just scared.

                              KATHRYN
               What are you scared of?

                              CECILE
               Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to
               first base with a guy. What do I do?

                              KATHRYN
               Haven't you ever practiced with one of
               your girlfriends?

                              CECILE
               Eww. No. That's gross.

                              KATHRYN
               It's not gross. How else do you think
               girls learn? Here turn around and
               face me.

     Cecile turns and faces Kathryn, who removes her glasses.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Now close your eyes and wet your lips.

                              CECILE
               Are you for real?

                              KATHRYN
               Do you want to learn or not?

                              CECILE
               I guess. It still sounds gross.

     Cecile does as instructed. Kathryn leans in and kisses
     her on the mouth.

                              KATHRYN
               See that wasn't so bad.

                              CECILE
               It was nothing.

                              KATHRYN
               Let's try it again, only this time I'm
               going to stick my tongue in your
               mouth. When I do that I want you to
               massage my tongue with yours. That's
               what first base is.

                              CECILE
                    (reluctant)
               Okay.

                              KATHRYN
               Eyes closed.

     Cecile closes her eyes. Kathryn leans in and kisses her
     again, only this time longer. She continues to kiss her
     then gently pushes her tongue into Cecile's. Cecile does
     as instructed and they start to make out.

     Kathryn eyes look towards the ground where Cecile's hands
     are now clutching the grass. Kathryn smiles and
     continues her seduction.

     She places her hand on Cecile's thigh and moves it under
     her dress. Cecile lets out a soft sigh.

     Kathryn breaks from the kiss. They look at each other
     and smile.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Not bad.

                              CECILE
               That was cool.

                              KATHRYN
               Maybe you should try it on your friend
               Ronald sometime.

                              CECILE
               What are you saying?

                              KATHRYN
               Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about
               you.

                              CECILE
               Is it that obvious?

     Kathryn nods.

                              CECILE (cont'd)
               He sends me letters you know. Love
               letters.

                              KATHRYN
               That's so romantic. Have you
               responded?

                              CECILE
               No.

                              KATHRYN
               Well do you like him?

                              CECILE
               I don't know.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile, we just made out in the middle
               of Central Park. You can trust me.

                              CECILE
                    (beat)
               I do like him. I can't stop thinking
               about him.

     Cecile starts to cry. Kathryn hugs her.

                              CECILE (cont'd)
               What am I going to do? If my mother
               found out about Ronald she would kill
               me.

     Kathryn grabs her and looks her straight in the eye.

                              KATHRYN
               Listen to me. Your mother must never
               know. Never.

                              CECILE
               Okay.

                              KATHRYN
               Did you hide the letters?

                              CECILE
               Yes. They're in this antique doll house
               in my room.

                              KATHRYN
               I want you to make me copies of his
               letters and bring them to me.

                              CECILE
               Why?

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile if there's one thing I'm great
               at it's love letters. With my help,
               he'll be eating out of the palm of
               your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a
               little get together for the two of you
               at my house.

                              CECILE
               You'd do that for me?

                              KATHRYN
               Of course I would. We're friends,
               right?

                              CECILE
               Best friends.

     Cecile kisses her on the cheek and hugs Kathryn.

23   INT. ESTATE - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT                 23

     Little touches of Annette's life (photo of dead mother)
     adorn the room. Annette is reading The Fountainhead when
     she HEARS singing coming from outside. Unable to
     concentrate, she walks out onto the balcony.

24   EXT. ESTATE - ANNETTE'S BALCONY - NIGHT                    24

     Annette steps onto the balcony.

     HER P.O.V. - Sebastian lies in a floating pool chair
     sipping a cocktail and listening to his Walkman and
     singing Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" in German.

                              ANNETTE
                    (calling out)
               Excuse me. Excuse me!

                              SEBASTIAN
               You talking to me?

                              ANNETTE
               Look, I know this is your house and all,
               but do you think you couid keep it down?
               I'm trying to read.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What'cha reading?

                              ANNETTE
               The Fountainhead.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Great book.

                              ANNETTE
                    (skeptical)
               You've read The Fountainhead?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act,
               you know. When Howard Roark makes love
               to Dominique Francon... most romantic
               scene in all of literature.

                              ANNETTE
               Romantic? He rapes her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               That's a matter of opinion.

                              ANNETTE
               You need help.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why don't you come join me for a swim
               and we'll discuss it.

                              ANNETTE
               At this hour? I don't think so.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh come on. Quit acting like a
               geriatric and get in the pool.

                              ANNETTE
               Gee, with an invitation like that how
               could a girl refuse.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Please.

                              ANNETTE
               Give me a minute. I'll be right down.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Thank you.

     She re-enters the guest room. Sebastian's cell phone
     RINGS. He answers it.

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:

25   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT         25

     Kathryn sits in her bathrobe. One foot soaks in a small
     tub of water while Sook-Hee tends to her other foot.

                              KATHRYN
               Fuck her yet?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm working on it.

                              KATHRYN
               Loser.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Blow me.

                              KATHRYN
               Call me later.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Okay.

     She hangs up and lights a cigarette. Sook-Hee accidently
     jabs her toe.

                              KATHRYN
               Ow. That hurt you stupid bitch.

                              SOOK-HEE
               Sorry.

     Kathryn kicks some water in her face.

                              KATHRYN
               Oops.

26   EXT. ESTATE - SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT                        26

     Annette comes down, wearing a bathrobe. She sits by the
     pool as Sebastian treads water away from her.

                              ANNETTE
                    (holding out the letter)
               You know it amazes me that someone as
               bright as you can be so horrible.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What? Another letter from your friend?

                              ANNETTE
               This is my favorite part.
                    (reading the letter)
               Even more treacherous and dangerous than
               he is charming and fascinating. He has
               never taken a single step or spoken a
               single word without some dishonorable
               or criminal intention. Every young girl
               he has successfully pursued has
               regretted it.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You know you could at least have the
               decency of telling me who's badmouthing
               me so I might have the opportunity to
               confront them face to face. How do you
               know it's not some girl who's pissed
               off at me for breaking up with her?

                              ANNETTE
               I sincerely doubt it.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Give me the fucking letter.

     Annette smiles and tears the letter up.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Why did you do that?

                              ANNETTE
               The last thing I need is you going into
               my room searching for this while I'm
               away.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (mocking)
               Is that the last thing you need? My
               your clever.

     She takes pieces of paper and sticks it in her bathrobe. She
     then stands and takes off the robe, revealing a one piece
     bathing suit underneath.

                              ANNETTE
               How's the water?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Refreshing.

     She dives in the pool and surfaces.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               You're right you know.

                              ANNETTE
               About what?

                              SEBASTIAN
               About what you said today in the stable.
               I'm not a happy person.

                              ANNETTE
               I never said that.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You implied it.

                              ANNETTE
               Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard
               time.

                              SEBASTIAN
               No, it's okay. I mean I look at you
               with all your morals and values and
               well, YOU seem to be happy in your
               choices. I envy you. No bullshit.

                              ANNETTE
                    (caught off guard)
               Thank you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Seriously, you're amazing. You have
               everything going for you.
                    (counts with his fingers)
               You're smart, you're beautiful, you're
               determined. You're everything I want
               in a girlfriend.

                              ANNETTE
                    (jokingly)
               Shut up.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you
               out.

                              ANNETTE
               Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it
               could never work.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why not?

                              ANNETTE
               Because you act like a pig.

     He swims towards her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you deny that there's an attraction
               between us?

                              ANNETTE
               I don't... I don't want to answer that...
               look we're friends.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You don't find me cute? Come on, look
               at these muscles.

     He flexes for her. She laughs.

                              ANNETTE
               I'm sorry, but you're not my type.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Fine. Friends it is. I can live with
               that.

     He extends his arms out for a hug. She moves in and hugs
     him. Her smile turns to a look of horror.

                              ANNETTE
               You're naked.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It's my house.

     She pushes him off her.

                              ANNETTE
               That's repulsive.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What's the big deal? We're friends.
               Haven't you ever seen your friends
               naked before?

     Annette climbs out of the pool.

                              ANNETTE
               Get some manners.

     She walks into the house.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sorry, I didn't know you were peenaphobic.

     She flips him the bird as she heads into the house.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Oooooo, naughty naughty. Ten Hail
               Mary's for you.
                    (beat)
               Good night.

27   EXT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                27

     Sebastian's Porsche is parked outside.

28   INT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT                      28

     Sebastian presses his ear to the door.

                              GREG (O.S.)
                    (moaning)
               Oh baby... oh baby...

                              SEBASTIAN
               Baby?
                    (checks his watch)
               Right on time.

29   INT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                      29

     GREG McCONNELL, All-American star football player for
     Oakwood prep is busy getting his cock sucked by Blaine,
     who lies under the covers.

                              GREG
                    (near orgasm)
               Oh God... Oh God, I'm gonna cum. I'm
               gonna cum... I'm gonna...

     The door swings open and Sebastian enters.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy
               shit.

                              GREG
               Jesus!

     Greg throws the covers over his face. Sebastian smiles
     and sits. He lights a cigarette. No movement from under
     the covers.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Greg, is that you under the covers?

                              GREG
                    (from under the covers)
               Get out of here.

     Sebastian stands YANKS the covers off the bed, revealing
     Greg and Blaine.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Whoa!

                              GREG
               I told you to lock the door.

                              BLAINE
               I thought I did.

                              GREG
               Look Valmont. This was the first time
               I've ever done something like this. I
               was --

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (apathetic)
               -- really drunk and blah blah blah
               blah blah.

                              GREG
               Please don't tell anyone. This could
               ruin my career.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Your career? What about your family?
               Can you imagine the humiliation your
               father's going to feel when he finds
               out his pride and joy is a fudge-
               packer.

                              BLAINE
               Hey hey hey. Careful Valmont, he's
               not a fudge packer. Cum chugger yes
               but not a fudge packer.

                              GREG
                    (to Sebastian)
               Please. I'm begging you. I'll do
               anything. Let's just forget the whole
               thing.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Hmmmmmmm... nah. I can't help you
               there. It's too good to pass up.

     Greg starts to cry.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               After all, it is you who's bad-
               mouthing me to Annette Harrison.

                              GREG
               Annette Harrison? I don't know what
               you're talking about.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Come on Greg. You're the only one who
               knows her. The truth will save you.

                              GREG
                    (sobbing)
               I swear on my life, I never said a
               word to her about you.

                              BLAINE
               I think he's telling the truth
               Valmont. Greg couldn't write a
               grocery list let alone a letter.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Alright, I believe you. Stop crying.
               Your secret's safe with me.

     Greg wipes his eyes.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               However, this whole incident's kind of
               turned me on.

     Sebastian unzips his fly.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               You get my point.

     Greg, completely defeated, crawls off the bed and over to
     Sebastian. Blaine shakes his head and smiles.

     Greg places his hand on Sebastian's thigh when -

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Jesus Christ, I was only kidding.
               What do you think, I'm gay? My God,
               haven't you had enough for tonight.

                              BLAINE
               Our boy just can't get enough dick.

                              GREG
               You sick son of a bitch.

     Blaine and Sebastian laugh.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'll leave you guys alone.
                    (macho voice)
               Score one for the team, Greg.

     Sebastian leaves the room, then re-enters.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Come to think of it, there is
               something you can do for me.

30   EXT. ESTATE - ROAD - DAY                                   30

     Annette jogs up a dirt road on her morning run. THIRTY
     YARDS BEHIND HER - a golf cart drives off a meadow and
     lands on the road. Sebastian is driving.

     Annette looks back and scowls. Sebastian catches up to
     her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Need a lift?

                              ANNETTE
               No thank you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               How are you today?

                              ANNETTE
               Give it up.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh right, last night. I guess I owe
               you an apology.

                              ANNETTE
               I'm not going to speak to you till you
               realize that you can't intimidate me.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I said I was sorry.

     She continues her jog. Sebastian follows alongside.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Have a nice sleep last night?

                              ANNETTE
               It was fine.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I wish I could say the same for
               myself. I was up thinking about you
               all night.

                              ANNETTE
               I thought we agreed that we were going
               to be friends.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yes, well unfortunately I can't just
               switch the "on" button to "off." The
               sad fact of the matter is that you've
               unintentionally rubbed off on me.

     Annette stops running and turns to him.

                              ANNETTE
               And that's a bad thing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm trying to better myself, but the
               one person who can help me is the same
               one pushing me away.

                              ANNETTE
               I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your
               savior.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well try this one on for size. I think
               I'm falling in love with you.

                              ANNETTE
               You don't even know me.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Don't you believe in love at first sight?

                              ANNETTE
               Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this
               is far from mutual.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ouch. Do you think we could spend some
               time together this morning?

                              ANNETTE
               I can't. I'm seeing a friend.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Who?

                              ANNETTE
               That's none of your business.

                              SEBASTIAN
               How about tonight?

                              ANNETTE
               I'm busy.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Doing what?

                              ANNETTE
               That's also none of your business.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I
               win your heart. I'll do anything. I
               can't get you out of my mind.

                              ANNETTE
               You truly want to do something to make
               me happy?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yes.

                              ANNETTE
               And you promise to abide by it?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Without question.

                              ANNETTE
               Alright.
                    (beat)
               I want you to leave and go back to
               New York.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What?

                              ANNETTE
               If that's a problem, then I'll make
               arrangements to stay with some friends.

     Sebastian thinks for a moment. He's pissed.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?

                              ANNETTE
               It's not about being happy. You and I
               can't -

     He shifts the cart into reverse and backs away.

31   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                           31

     Annette and Greg walk along the beach and gaze out at the
     ocean.

                              GREG
               He told you he's failing in love
               with you? I've never known him to
               say those words before.

                              ANNETTE
               Really? I thought he said it all
               the time.

                              GREG
               That's not his style. one thing I can
               say about Valmont. He always speaks
               the truth.

     Annette looks lost.

                              GREG (cont'd)
               What's wrong?

                              ANNETTE
               Nothing.

                              GREG
               Is there a mutual feeling between you
               two?

                              ANNETTE
               No. I mean. I don't know.
                    (beat)
               What else do you know about him?

                              GREG
               Not a whole lot. We take some classes
               together. He's got a bad rep, but it's
               mostly bullshit.

                              ANNETTE
               What do you mean?

                              GREG
               Well, a lot of people are jealous cause
               he's loaded.

                              ANNETTE
                    (sighs)
               I don't know. I've been hearing some
               awful things about him.

                              GREG
               From who?

                              ANNETTE
               I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.

     Greg takes her hand.

                              GREG
               Annette, how long have we known each
               other?

                              ANNETTE
               Forever.

                              GREG
               Now it's my job to look out for you.
               You're like a kid sister to me. Do I
               look like some kind of gossip queen?

     Annette laughs.

                              ANNETTE
               You promise not to say anything?

                              GREG
               On my mother's life.

                              ANNETTE
                    (beat)
               Okay...

32   INT. PORSCHE - DAY                                         32

     Sebastian drives down the highway towards Manhattan. He holds
     his cell phone in one ear.

                              SEBASTIAN
               That nosey bitch. Are you sure?

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:

33   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                           33

     Greg talks on a pay phone, out of Annette's sight.

                              GREG
               Positive.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Did you do everything I asked you to?

                              GREG
               Yes.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You told her I never said I love you
               before?

                              GREG
               Yes!

                              SEBASTIAN
               You told her that people are jealous
               cause I'm loaded?

                              GREG
               Yes!

                              SEBASTIAN
               And you think she bought it?

                              GREG
               I'm pretty sure she did.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Pretty sure or sure sure?

                              GREG
               She bought it.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'll be in touch.

     Click. The line goes dead.

34   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 34

     Kathryn is sitting in front of the television, scowling.

     ON TV - A HIDDEN VIDEO OF RONALD AND CECILE IN THE
     VALMONT LIVING ROOM.

     Ronald plays Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata" at the piano
     while Cecile listens and sways to the music.

     ANGLE ON: LIVING ROOM -

                              KATHRYN
               Enough with the music. Fuck her
               already.

     She throws a magazine at the television. Sebastian bursts
     into the living room.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You would not believe what--

                              KATHRYN
               Shhh.

     ON TELEVISION - RONALD FINISHES THE SONG. CECILE STANDS
     AND APPLAUDS. RONALD TAKES A BOW.

                              CECILE (ON VIDEO)
               That was beautiful.

                              RONALD (ON VIDEO)
               Almost as beautiful as you.

     Cecile blushes. Ronald checks his watch.

                              RONALD (ON VIDEO)
               Well, I guess it's getting late.
               Please thank Kathryn for the use of
               her Steinway.

                              CECILE (ON VIDEO)
               I'll see you tomorrow.

                              RONALD (ON VIDEO)
               Absolutely.

     He approaches her, awkwardly then shakes her hand.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               Idiot!

     ANGLE ON: LIVING ROOM - Kathryn FREEZE FRAMES the image.

                              KATHRYN
               What's wrong with you?

                              SEBASTIAN
               You ready for this? I've recently
               discovered that our good friend Mrs.
               Caldwell is the one who sent the
               letter to Annette urging her to stay
               away from me.

                              KATHRYN
               Interesting.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I now plan to devote all my energies to
               destroying the douche bag. Any luck
               corrupting her daughter?

                              KATHRYN
               No.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Call Cecile up and get her to come over.
               I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.

     She walks over to the "freeze frame" image of Ronald and
     Cecile on the television.

                              KATHRYN
               The plot thickens. It appears that
               Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love
               that.

                              KATHRYN
               Not to mention Court Reynolds.
               Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the
               speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What's your plan of attack?

                              KATHRYN
               I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes
               ballistic and ends their relationship.
               Boo hoo.

                              SEBASTIAN
               But who will they turn to for help?

     Kathryn smiles and sits on Sebastian's lap.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile is planning to go away with Court
               next week. I'll need you to speed
               up her sexual awakenings.

     Sebastian rubs her shoulders.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm at your service.

                              KATHRYN
               Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh sis. You're so tense.

     Sebastian moves his hand down her shirt and under her bra.
     He's met with no resistance.

                              KATHRYN
               I hate when things don't go my way. It
               makes me so horny.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I hate it too.

     He takes his hand out from her shirt and slides it under her
     skirt.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
                    (baby talk)
               Oh baby, your soaking.

                              KATHRYN
               I know.

     She closes her eyes and rubs his crotch. She unzips his fly.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
                    (seductively)
               Any luck with your girl?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Moving along quite well.

                              KATHRYN
               Have you succeeded in your task?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Any day now.

                              KATHRYN
               Well, let me know when you do. Until
               then.

     She takes his hand out from under her pants.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               No pootie.

     Kathryn smiles.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Sorry.

35   EXT. TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT                                     35

     A meter maid writes a ticket on Sebastian's car when she
     grabs her neck in pain.

36   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       36

     Sebastian closes his window and sets down a bb rifle with
     an infrared scope.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Goodbye Mister Bond.

     He picks up the phone and dials.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Hi, it's Sebastian. I didn't wake you
               did I?

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:

37   INT. ESTATE - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT                 37

     Annette sits in bed talking on the other end of the
     phone.

                              ANNETTE
               No, not at all.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well, I was just calling to see how
               you're doing.

                              ANNETTE
               I'm... I'm alright.

                              SEBASTIAN
               How was your date?

                              ANNETTE
               It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.

     There's a moment of uncomfortable silence.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well, I was just calling to tell you
               I was thinking about you and I miss
               you. I'll let you go.

                              ANNETTE
               Wait, don't hang up.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Okay?

                              ANNETTE
               What are you doing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Reading.

     He crosses over to his circular bed where two scantily clad
     twins (GRETCHEN & MORA) are licking popsicles.

                              ANNETTE
               What are you reading?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Of Human Bondage.

                              ANNETTE
               Somerset Maugham.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering
               my situation.

                              ANNETTE
               You're not gonna start that again.

     He takes out a bottle of baby oil and pours it on the
     girls' butts.

                              SEBASTIAN
               No. I'm through with my childish
               games when it comes to you. Hold on,
               that's my other line.
                    (to the girls)
               Rub.

     They rub the oil on each other then turn to him and
     smile. He clicks the phone back on.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Annette that's my mom calling. Can I
               call you tomorrow?

                              ANNETTE
               Sure. Have a good night.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I will.

                                                       BACK TO:

38   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       38

                              GRETCHEN
               Of Human Bondage. You're such a
               bullshit artist.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Shut up, Gretchen. You don't even
               know what it is.

                              GRETCHEN
               Duh, it's a book.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you know what it's about?

                              MORA
               Who cares. Books are for fags.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Books are for fags. I weep for the
               future.

39   EXT. BOUTIQUE - DAY                                        39

     Establishing shot.

40   INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY                                        40

     A SALESWOMAN approaches Kathryn who's checking out an
     assortment of fur coats. The saleswoman holds up a
     beautiful dress.

                              SALESWOMAN
               Here's something you might like.

     Kathryn examines the label.

                              KATHRYN
               Do you carry any real fur?

                              SALESWOMAN
               No. All our fur is faux.

                              KATHRYN
               Of course. The animals. How silly of
               me.

     The saleswoman smiles, then walks away. Kathryn sneers
     then looks over at a small child, staring at her.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
                    (mouthing the words)
               Fuck off.

     She "shoos" the child away, when Mrs. Caldwell
     approaches.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I got your message and came as quick
               as I could.

                              KATHRYN
               I hope I didn't keep you from
               something.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Not at all. What's wrong?

                              KATHRYN
               It's Cecile.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               What about her?

                              KATHRYN
               Well... you promise you won't say
               anything to her. We've developed a
               friendship and...

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't
               drugs is it?

                              KATHRYN
               It's worse. I think there's something
               going on between Cecile and her music
               teacher.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Ronald? That's crazy.

                              KATHRYN
               I know. She's so young and he's so -

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Black.

     Kathryn reacts to her remark.

                              KATHRYN
               He's been sending her love letters that
               she hides under her doll house. I
               questioned whether or not to tell you,
               but something like this could destroy
               her reputation at Oakwood and I don't
               want to see her get hurt.

     Kathryn picks out an expensive suit and approaches the sales
     counter.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               I hope I did the right thing in telling
               you. I'd hate to see Cecile ruin things
               with Court.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I can't thank you enough.

                              KATHRYN
               You will be discreet about this?

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Absolutely.

                              SALESWOMAN
               Will that be cash or charge?

     Kathryn looks through her purse.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh poo. I left my credit cards at home.

     Mrs. Caldwell takes out her purse.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Let me get that for you.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh please. I can't have you do that.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               It's the least I can do.

     Mrs. Caldwell hands the credit card to the saleswoman.
     Kathryn turns to Mrs. Caldwell.

                              KATHRYN
               Thank you.

41   INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - STUDY - DAY                      41

     Ronald gives Cecile a cello lesson when Mrs. Caldwell
     bursts into the room.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Who the hell do you think you are?!

                              RONALD
               Excuse me.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I'm paying you to give cello lessons.
               Not to pervert my child.

                              RONALD
               Mrs. Caldwell I think you're
               misunderstanding something.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Is that so?

     Mrs. Caldwell holds up Ronald's letters.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               You care to explain this then?

     Ronald and Cecile exchange looks of worry.

                              CECILE
               Where did you find those?

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Margarita found them while cleaning
               your room.

                              CECILE
               Those are my letters!

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Don't you raise your voice at me. Go
               to your room, now.

     Cecile turns to Ronald.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               Now!

     Ronald nods and Cecile runs out of the room. Mrs.
     Caldwell turns to Ronald.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               How dare you treat me with such
               disrespect. I got you off the streets
               and this is how you repay me?

                              RONALD
               Got me off the streets? I live on
               59th and Park.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Whatever. You are never to set foot
               in this house again and you are never
               and I mean never to see my daughter
               again. Is that understood?!

     Ronald packs up his sheet music, while Mrs. Caldwell
     waits.

                              RONALD
               First of all, maam, I never touched
               your daughter and second, I would like
               to think that in these times someone
               of your status could look beyond
               racial lines.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Oh don't give me any of that racist
               crap. My husband and I gave money to
               Colin Powell.

                              RONALD
                    (sarcastic)
               I guess that puts me in my place.
               Thank you for the hospitality Mrs.
               Caldwell. It was a true awakening.

     He storms off.

42   INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - ELEVATOR - DAY                   42

     Ronald rides down in the elevator.

                              RONALD
                    (angry)
               Took me off the streets?

     The elevator stops and the doors open. Sebastian and
     Kathryn stand in the doorway, wearing shades. Kathryn
     hands Cecile's letter.

43   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         43

     Ronald sits in a chair and reads Cecile's letter.
     Sebastian and Kathryn watch.

                              RONALD
               Wow. I never knew she had these kind
               of feelings.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You're a lucky guy.

                              RONALD
                    (eyes tear up)
               She really loves me.

     Sebastian and Kathryn roll their eyes.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               What do I do?

                              KATHRYN
               What do you do? Tell her you love
               her.

                              RONALD
               But I can't even see her. She doesn't
               have her own phone, I don't even know
               her e-mail address.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and
               pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her
               another letter.

                              RONALD
               How will I get to her?

                              SEBASTIAN & KATHRYN
               We'll make sure she gets it.

                              RONALD
               Why are you being so good to me?

                              KATHRYN
               Because we want to see Cecile happy
               and we know you make her happy.

     She hands Ronald a pen and paper.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Now you just march yourself into the
               study and start writing. We'll be there
               to check on you in a minute.

     Ronald leaves the room. Sebastian closes the door while
     Kathryn picks up the phone and dials.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Who are you calling?

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile.

     Sebastian hangs up the phone.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               What are you doing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Before we go through with this, I just
               want you to be aware of the damage we're
               going to cause.

                              KATHRYN
               I'm aware.

     She picks up the phone and he hangs it up again.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Are you really? I mean, we've done some
               pretty fucked up shit in our time but
               this... I mean, we're destroying an
               innocent girl. You do realize that.

                              KATHRYN
               What is that? Oh my God, it's your
               conscience.

     She reaches out toward his temple, plucks a handful
     of something, throws it to the ground and STOMPS on
     it.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Court Renolds is going down and if you're
               not going to help me, someone else will.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You amaze me.

                              KATHRYN
               Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you
               to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl
               it's wrong. Well let me tell you
               something, I didn't ask to be a girl.
               Do you think I relish the fact that I
               have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty
               four seven, so I can be considered a
               "laaaady." Do you think I take great
               delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so
               wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child."
               "Kathryn is going to make an excellent
               wife one day."
                    (beat)
               I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the
               upper East Side and sometimes I want to
               kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy
               being a part of the weaker sex and for
               that reason everyone around me is going
               to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis
               Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you
               out?

     Sebastian says nothing. Kathryn picks up the phone and
     dials.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Hello, Cecile. It's Kathryn. Alright,
               stop crying. I understand. Hold on for
               Sebastian.

     She hands the phone to Sebastian.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Cecile. Now I need you to listen to me
               very carefully. I have a letter from
               Ronald that he asked me to give to
               you. Now I can't exactly bring it to
               your house, since your mother
               despises me so here's what we're going
               to do.

44   CALDWELL APARTMENT - CECILE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT              44

     The clock reads 1:30. A large collection of antiques
     and stuffed animals line the room and walls. Cecile
     lies in bed, eyes wide open. She crawls out of it,
     dressed in sweats.

45   MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT                                   45

     Cecile exits a building and steps into a waiting
     taxi.

46   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       46

     Cecile lies on Sebastian's bed. She finishes the letter
     while Sebastian fiddles with a camera.

                              CECILE
               Finished.

     She hands the letter to Sebastian, who looks it over.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Excellent.

                              CECILE
               You think he'll like it?

                              SEBASTIAN
               He'll love it.

     He points the camera at Cecile and snaps a photo.

                              CECILE
               What are you doing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Just taking your photo.

                              CECILE
               I look terrible.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes
               don't do you justice. Why don't you
               take them off.

     Cecile gasps.

                              CECILE
               I'm getting out of here.

     She stands to leave. Sebastian blocks her path.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm sorry that was out of line.

                              CECILE
                    (scared)
               I want to go home.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I was just kidding.

                              CECILE
                    (eyes watering)
               I want to go home.

     He moves toward the phone

                              SEBASTIAN
               Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom
               and have her come pick you up.

                              CECILE
               My mom? Don't call my mom.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why not? ... Oh wow, she doesn't 
               know you're here. In fact, you're
               grounded. Jesus, you could get in a
               shitload of trouble for this.
               I think I should call her anyway.

     Cecile runs over to him, sobbing, and wraps her arms
     around his legs.

                              CECILE
               Please please please. I'll do
               anything. Just don't call my mom.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Cecile, all I want to do is give you a
               kiss.

                              CECILE
               And then I can go home?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Of course. I'm not a monster.

     Cecile breathes a sigh of relief. He pulls her up to her
     feet.

                              CECILE
               Just a kiss, right?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I swear.

     She closes her eyes, then puckers up. Sebastian takes the
     string holding up her sweats and pulls it open.

     Cecile bolts up.

                              CECILE
               What are you doing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               You promised to let me kiss you.

                              CECILE
               But -

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (pointing at her lips)
               I don't want to kiss you here. I want
               to kiss you there.

     Sebastian points to her crotch. She moves her hands to
     her sweats and looks up at him. Sebastian shrugs.

     Cecile pulls the string to her sweats. They fall to the
     floor.

47   INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - CECILE'S BEDROOM - DAY           47

     Mrs. Caldwell enters the room.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Cecile are you up yet? We're gonna to
               be late for the -

     She notices the bed is empty.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               Cecile?

     She walks over the bathroom door and knocks.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               Cecile?

                              CECILE (O.S.)
               I'm in the bath, mom.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs.
               Rosemond's before lunch.

                              CECILE (O.S.)
               Okay.

48   INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - CECILE'S BATHROOM - DAY          48

     Cecile stands in front of her mirror, crying. She applies
     make-up to several hickeys on her neck. She XXX down
     her shirt and grimaces. She sticks her finger the make-
     up bottle, then puts her hand down her shirt.

49   EXT. ESTATE - TERRACE - DAY                                49

     Aunt Helen, Annette, Mrs. Caldwell and Cecile are having
     lunch. Cecile is wearing a turtle neck.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               It was nice of you to invite us up
               for the weekend, Helen.

                              AUNT HELEN
               More the merrier.
                    (to Cecile)
               Is everything alright my dear?

                              CECILE
               I'm just not feeling well.

     Sebastian enters carrying his tennis racket.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Afternoon ladies.

     Cecile is stunned that he's there. Sebastian takes a
     seat at the table.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I didn't know you'd be here,
               Sebastian.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I wasn't planning on it, but being
               such a lovely day, why waste it in the
               city. Anyone for tennis?

     He looks at Cecile and strokes the shaft of his racket.

     Cecile stands and rushes into the house.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What's wrong with her?

     No one knows.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               Would you excuse me for a minute?

     Mrs. Caldwell follows her into the house.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (concerned)
               I hope she's alright.

                              AUNT HELEN
               I better go check on them.

     Aunt Helen stands and enters the house.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Alone again.
                    (beat)
               What are you up to today?

                              ANNETTE
               I'm doing some volunteer work.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Need any company?

                              ANNETTE
               You? Volunteer? I don't think so.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm
               trying to change here. You could be
               supportive.

                              ANNETTE
                    (smiling)
               Okay.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Babe, you're looking at the next Mother
               Teresa.

     Annette shakes her head and laughs.

50   INT. ESTATE - CECILE'S GUEST ROOM - DAY                    50

     Cecile talks on the phone.

                              CECILE
               Please. I need you. I don't know what
               to do. You're the only one I can talk
               to.

51   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 51

     Kathryn listens on the other end of the conversation.

                              KATHRYN
               I'll be there in a few hours.

     She hangs up the phone and smiles.

52   EXT. RETIREMENT HOME - DAY                                 52

     Establishing shot.

53   INT. RETIREMENT HOME - HALLWAY - DAY                       53

     A NURSE escorts Sebastian and Annette down the hall.

                              NURSE
               It's really nice when the young people
               help out. Most of our patients don't
               have any family nearby.

     They stop at a door and open it. An OLD MAN sits in his
     hospital bed.

                              NURSE (cont'd)
               Mister Gottlieb, we have a visitor for
               you.

     Sebastian starts to enter the room, when the nurse stops
     him.

                              NURSE (cont'd)
               Actually Sebastian, you're going to be
               spending the hour with Mrs. Sugarman.

     The Nurse escorts an unhappy Sebastian down the
     hall. Annette waves "bye bye" to him.

54   INT. RETIREMENT HOME - MR. GOTTLIEB'S ROOM - DAY           54

     Annette sits by Mister Gottlieb's bed and reads from a book
     of poetry.

55   INT. RETIREMENT HOME - MRS. SUGARMAN'S ROOM - DAY          55

     A senile MRS. SUGARMAN sits in bed, while Sebastian does
     a newspaper crossword puzzle and ignores her. He smokes
     a cigarette and flicks the ash into her bedpan which lies
     next to her on the bed.

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               Did I ever tell you the time when my
               late husband sent me -

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yes, you already did.

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               I did?

     Sebastian never takes his eyes off the paper.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Right after we played backgammon.

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               We played backgammon?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Uh huh. You beat me three times.

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               I did?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               Excuse me?

     He turns to her and extinguishes his cigarette.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I said, do you want some water?

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               Oh... no thank you...

     There's a knock at the door.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Come in.

     Annette and the nurse enter.

                              NURSE
               How we doing in here?

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               I won three games of backgammon.

     Sebastian smiles at Annette, who smiles back.

56   INT. PORSCHE - DAY                                         56

     Sebastian and Annette drive towards the estate.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It's weird. I actually feel good about
               myself. Can we do this again next week?

                              ANNETTE
               Oh please.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What?

                              ANNETTE
               "I actually feel good about myself?"

                              SEBASTIAN
               I do.

                              ANNETTE
               You must take me for a real idiot.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I don't.

                              ANNETTE
               You're going to tell me that you had a
               good time with the old lady.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I did. We played three games of backgammon
               and...

     She throws him a look.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Alright. I was bored out of my fucking
               mind. I hate doing charity.

                              ANNETTE
               That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad
               person.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yes it does.

                              ANNETTE
               No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being
               honest with me.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (sighs)
               I can't win with you.

                              ANNETTE
               It's not about winning. You know what
               your problem is? You take yourself way
               too seriously.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I do not.

                              ANNETTE
               Lighten up.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I am lighten. Can we drop this?

                              ANNETTE
               Fine.

     They drive on in silence. A smile comes over Annette's
     face. She turns to him, crosses her eyes and makes a
     face. Sebastian looks over.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What are you doing? Stop it, it's
               distracting.

     She holds the face. Sebastian starts to laugh.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Cut it out.

     He continues to laugh. She stops making the face.

                              ANNETTE
               Oh dear, are you actually laughing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               No.

                              ANNETTE
               No?

     She makes the face again. He laughs.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Stop that.

     She laughs with him.

                              ANNETTE
               There's hope for you, yet.

     She reaches out and holds his hand. He squeezes it.

57   INT. ESTATE - CECILE'S GUEST ROOM - DAY                    57

     Cecile lies in the bed. There's a knock on the door.

                              CECILE
               Who is it?

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               It's Kathryn.

     Cecile bolts up and unlocks the door. Kathryn stands
     there with a worried look on her face.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Are you okay?

                              CECILE
               No.

     Kathryn enters and locks the door behind her. Cecile is
     crying.

                              KATHRYN
               Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.

                              CECILE
               Something awful happened last night.

                              KATHRYN
               What do you mean?!

                              CECILE
               I... I don't think you want to know.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile, you have to tell me.

                              CECILE
               It involves your brother. He... took
               advantage of me.

                              KATHRYN
               Does your mother know?

                              CECILE
               If she knew, she'd kill me. It
               happened at your house last night.

                              KATHRYN
               Why didn't you do something?

                              CECILE
               I don't know.

                              KATHRYN
               So, let me get this straight. You
               came over to our house late last night
               and he forced intercourse on you.

                              CECILE
               Well... not exactly.

                              KATHRYN
               He made you give him a blow job.

                              CECILE
               No.

                              KATHRYN
               Well what then?

     Cecile waits a moment, then whispers in her ear.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               He ate you out?

                              CECILE
               If that's what you call it.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile, I think you're going to have
               a hard time crying rape if that's all
               he did.

                              CECILE
               What do I do then?

                              KATHRYN
               Well did you like it?

                              CECILE
               Well... I don't know - it was weird.
               At first it felt icky, then it felt
               kind of okay. Then, I started getting
               really hot and then I started shaking
               and then like, I don't t know... it
               felt like an explosion, but a good one.

     Kathryn laughs.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile, you had an orgasm.

                              CECILE
               I did?

                              KATHRYN
               I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a
               woman.

                              CECILE
               I am?

     Kathryn nods. Cecile embraces her, happy.

                              KATHRYN
               Now listen. Now that you're on your
               way, it would be stupid of you to stop.
               Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him
               instruct you.

                              CECILE
               I don't love him. I love Ronald.

                              KATHRYN
               So? Don't you want to make Ronald a
               happy pappy? Practice makes perfect,
               Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as
               many people as possible.

                              CECILE
               But that would make me a slut.
                    (beat)
               Wouldn't it?

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile, everybody does it. It's just
               that nobody talks about it.

     Cecile takes the information in.

                              CECILE
               It's like a secret society.

                              KATHRYN
               That's one way of looking at it.

                              CECILE
               Cool.

58   EXT. ESTATE - GARDEN - DAY                                 58

     Annette sits on the grass reading Gabriel Garcia
     Marquez's Love In The Time Of Cholera. She puts the book
     down and wipes a tear from her eye.

59   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - DAY                       59

     Sebastian peers out his window with a pair of binoculars.
     Kathryn enters his room.

                              KATHRYN
               I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I
               don't think she'll be giving you
               anymore problems.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yippy.

                              KATHRYN
               Who are you spying on?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Take a look for yourself.

     He hands the binoculars to Kathryn, who looks out the
     window.

                              KATHRYN
               That her?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yeah.

                              KATHRYN
               Jesus, she reeks of Laura Ashley.
                    (sarcastic)
               Oh, she's crying. Wittle baby's upset
               by the big bad book.

     Sebastian grabs the binoculars from her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Shut up.

                              KATHRYN
               What's your problem?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Nothing.

                              KATHRYN
               She's really getting to you, isn't
               she?

                              SEBASTIAN
               If you must know, yes. I don't know
               what to do. I can't stand that holier
               than thou bullshit and yet, I'm
               completely infatuated with her.
                    (beat)
               She made me laugh.

                              KATHRYN
               And that's why you're losing your bet?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm not losing the bet. It's just
               taking longer than I expected.

                              KATHRYN
               Do you mind if I take my new Porsche
               for a ride?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Kathryn, the only thing you're going to
               be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse
               me, I have some work to do.

     He storms out of the room.

60   EXT. ESTATE - GARDEN - DAY                                 60

     Sebastian walks over to Annette, who continues to read her
     book. She notices him and sets the book down.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Am I bothering you?

                              ANNETTE
               Not at all. Have a seat.

     He sits down next to her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Don't tell me you finished The
               Fountainhead already?

     She nods. He points to her book.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Great book. What's the guy's name,
               Florentino...

                              ANNETTE
               Florentino Ariza.

     Sebastian sticks his hand in his pocket and fiddles
     around.

                              SEBASTIAN
               My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend
               of Florentino.

                              ANNETTE
               Who's Monsieur Philipe?

                              SEBASTIAN
               You don't know Monsieur Philipe?

     Sebastian takes out a SOCK PUPPET.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
                    (low voice)
               Bonjour mademoiselle.

                              ANNETTE
                    (laughs)
               Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (Monsieur Philipe voice)
               You are very pretty. I would like to
               kiss you.

     The puppet kisses her on the cheek.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
                    (Monsieur Philipe voice)
               Oooo, that felt good.

                              ANNETTE
               Thank you.

     He kisses her on the cheek.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (Monsieur Philipe voice)
               That felt good too. I will kiss you
               all over.

     The puppet attacks a laughing Annette. She playfully
     grabs Sebastian and starts to tickle him. Sebastian
     tickles her back.

     They roll around on the ground until Sebastian lands on
     top of her. A moment of tense silence passes and
     Sebastian kisses her. The kissing intensifies until she
     pushes him off her.

     Sebastian stands.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I'm sorry about that.

                              ANNETTE
               I am too.

     He paces for a moment and his mood turns to anger.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You know what? I don't take it back.

                              ANNETTE
               Why are you doing this?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Because I'm in love with you.

                              ANNETTE
               I thought you said we were going to be
               friends.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I can't handle it. I can't keep my
               feelings bottled up like you. Can you
               honestly tell me that you feel nothing
               for me? ... Tell me!

                              ANNETTE
               I have feelings for you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Then what's wrong? I love you Annette.
               It's not like you have a husband,
               unless your married to Jesus.

                              ANNETTE
               That's not fair.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why can't we be together?

     Annette's eyes well up with tears.

                              ANNETTE
               You really want to know?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yes.

                              ANNETTE
               It's because I don't trust myself with
               you.
                    (beat)
               I took a vow and because of you I'm
               tempted to break it. Don't destroy that
               for me. Please.

     She hurries off.

61   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - DAY                       61

     Sebastian enters the room and slams the door behind him.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (frustrated)
               Shit.

     He hears the shower running from the bathroom.

62   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S BATHROOM - DAY                   62

     Sebastian enters the room. Cecile sticks her head out
     from the shower curtain.

                              CECILE
               Want to join me?

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (indifferent)
               Some other time, Cecile.

     He leaves the room. Cecile looks confused. A moment
     passes and Sebastian re-enters taking off his clothes.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What am I, an idiot?

     Cecile smiles.

63   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - NIGHT                     63

     Sebastian and Cecile lie in bed. Sebastian smokes a
     cigarette and writes in his journal.

                              CECILE
               Am I suppose to be this sore?

                              SEBASTIAN
               For the first time, yes. It'll pass.

     A moment of silence.

                              CECILE
               I like it better when I'm on top.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Cecile. This is what I like to call
               quiet time. This is time when we
               reflect on what we've done.

                              CECILE
               I'm sorry.

     She looks at the troubled expression on Sebastian's face.

                              CECILE (cont'd)
               Something's bothering you?

                              SEBASTIAN
               You think?

                              CECILE
               Is it me?

                              SEBASTIAN
               No, you were fine.

     SEBASTIAN'S P.O.V. - He looks out on the balcony, where
     Kathryn is eavesdropping. They make eye contact and she
     waves.

                              CECILE
               It's that girl, Annette.

     He stands and walks over to the balcony, where he closes
     the blinds.

                              CECILE (cont'd)
               You love her, don't you? It's okay.
               I don't love you either. I love Ronald.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm getting out of here.

     Sebastian heads to the bathroom.

                              CECILE
               Where are you going?

                              SEBASTIAN (O.S.)
               I'm taking a shower.

                              CECILE
               Need any company?

                              SEBASTIAN (O.S.)
               No.

                              CECILE
               Want a blow job?

                              SEBASTIAN (O.S.)
               Good night Cecile.

                              CECILE
                    (under her breath)
               Prude.

64   INT. ESTATE - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT                 64

     Annette is reading in bed. There's a knock on the door.

                              ANNETTE
               Come in.

     Sebastian enters the room.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I just came to say goodbye.

                              ANNETTE
               Where are you going?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Back to the city. I may take off to
               Europe for the rest of the summer. I
               just can't handle it around here.

                              ANNETTE
               I think that's for the best.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Good for you.

                              ANNETTE
               Sebastian, please. I don't want us to
               end on bad terms.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well, I'm afraid you don't have a
               choice in the matter. You make me
               sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't
               associate with hypocrites.

     Annette's eyes well up with tears.

                              ANNETTE
               How am I a hypocrite?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh please Annette. You spend all your
               time preaching about waiting for love.
               Well here it is. Right in front of you,
               but you're going to turn your back on
               it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age
               where we can get married. If we were,
               I'd propose, but that's not going to
               happen. So I guess we're just fucked.
               I'll move on, but you... you're going
               to have to live with yourself knowing
               you've turned your back on love. And
               that makes you a hypocrite.

     Sebastian heads to the door.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Have a nice life.

     Annette races toward him and throws her arms around him.

                              ANNETTE
                    (sobbing)
               Please don't go.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Get off me.

     She kisses him passionately.

                              ANNETTE
               I... I want you.

     Sebastian embraces her and draws her over to the bed.

     She lies down and starts to unbutton her dress. Sebastian
     stands over her watches her. Her crying does not let up
     as she continues to undress.

     Sebastian stands, stunned and watches her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm sorry, I can't.

     A pained look crosses her face. Sebastian leaves the
     room and closes the door.

65   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - NIGHT                     65

     Sebastian closes the door and leans against it.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Shit.

     He wipes his eyes, which are starting to water. He goes
     over to a mirror at looks at himself.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Get it together you pussy.

     A stern look comes over his face. He smiles, then walks
     away.

66   EXT. ESTATE - FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY                         66

     A cab pulls up to the house. The front door opens and a
     crying Annette quickly leaves the house and climbs into
     the cab. She closes the door and the cab pulls away from
     the house. WE PAN up to a second story window where
     Kathryn is looking down and smiling.

67   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - DAY                       67

     Sebastian lies sleeping in his bed. His journal lies
     beside him. A FEATHER tickles his nose. He stirs awake
     and looks up to see Kathryn staring down at him.

                              KATHRYN
               Morning!

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (sarcastic)
               Morning.

                              KATHRYN
               So? How'd it go last night?

                              SEBASTIAN
               With who?

                              KATHRYN
               Well I know how it went with Cecile.
               She won't shut up about it. How'd it
               go with Mrs. Jesus?

     Sebastian sits up in bed.

                              SEBASTIAN
               If your asking if I nailed her the
               answer is no.

                              KATHRYN
               She shot you down.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Exactly the opposite.

                              KATHRYN
               So what went wrong?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I don't know. She was lying on the bed,
               ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I
               was... I just didn't feel right about
               it.

                              KATHRYN
               You're telling me you had the chance to
               fuck her and you didn't. God are you a
               chump.

                              SEBASTIAN
               A momentary lapse of judgment, soon to
               be rectified.

     He climbs out of bed and puts on his robe. He starts out
     the door, when -

                              KATHRYN
               If you're heading towards her room, you
               won't find her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Where is she?

                              KATHRYN
               You don't know?
                    (big smile)
               She left thirty minutes ago.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Where'd she go?

                              KATHRYN
               She wouldn't say. She apologized to
               your aunt and told her she was going
               to stay with some friends.
                    (beat)
               You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has
               come to her senses and she will never
               go near you again.

     Sebastian throws off the robe and starts to dress.

                              SEBASTIAN
               We'll see about that.

68   INT. GREG'S DORM ROOM - DAY                                68

     A shrine to hot babes, who's posters adorn the walls. Greg
     is busy dumping muscle magazines, several issues of Teen
     Beat and some Musical Theater CDs into a trash bag when the
     phone rings. He answers it.

                              GREG
               Hello.

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:

69   EXT. HIGHWAY/INT. PORSCHE - DAY                            69

     Sebastian is talking on his cell phone.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Is she with you?

                              GREG
               Who is this?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?

                              GREG
               No.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Where is she?!

                              GREG
               I don't know. Why don't you leave her
               alone.

                              SEBASTIAN
               McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in
               two seconds if you don't tell me where
               she is.

                              GREG
               I told you I don't know.

                              SEBASTIAN
               One.

                              GREG
               Alright. She's staying with some
               friends of her parents. The O'Sheas.
               She caught the train twenty minutes ago
               into Grand Central.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Grand Central. You better not be
               fucking with me cause it's your ass on
               the line.

     Sebastian clicks off his cell phone.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Motherfucker.

     He bangs on his dashboard.

70   EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY                                         70

     The Porsche weaves in and out of traffic on it's way to
     the city.

71   INT. TRAIN CONCOURSE - DAY                                 71

     A group of passengers exit the train. Annette is among
     them. She stops when she SEES -

     Sebastian, standing in the distance.

     Annette stops in her tracks. She drops her bag, rushes
     over to him and embraces him. Sebastian's cruel demeanor
     drops, when he realizes how happy she is to see him. He
     looks her in the eyes and smiles. They kiss.

72   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         72

     Sebastian carries a laughing Annette into the room. They
     continue to kiss and he carries her over to the table.

     He sets her down and accidentally knocks over a lamp.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ooops.

     They both laugh. They kiss some more, then start to
     unbutton each other's clothes. Sebastian struggles with
     her pants' button.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Fuck this.

     He picks her up again and moves to the bed. They
     collapse on the bed and he accidently falls off it.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Suave.

     Annette cracks up. Sebastian reaches up and YANKS her
     down on top of him. They both laugh, then kiss.

74   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       74

     Annette sits on the windowsill watching Sebastian as he
     sleeps. He slowly starts to wake and looks at her.

                              ANNETTE
               Hi.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Hi.

     She walks over to him and kisses him.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               You alright?

                              ANNETTE
               I'm fine. I have to get going to my
               friends' house.
                    (beat)
               Was it --

                              SEBASTIAN
               It was perfect.

     She smiles and holds her hand out. He takes her hand in
     his.

75   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT                   75

     Annette closes the door to the bedroom and walks down the
     hall passing a mirror on the wall. In the mirror's
     REFLECTION is Kathryn, looking very angry.

77   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                     77

     Sook-Hee carries a bundle of folded laundry down the
     hall. Sebastian enters the hallway from his bedroom. He
     grabs her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You work way to hard. Here.
                    (hands her a wad of money)
               Take the day off. Merry Christmas.

     Sook-Hee smiles and moves on. Sebastian continues down
     the hall. He passes Kathryn's door and hear noises.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               Slower.

     Sebastian leans against the door.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               A little to the left. Look, pretend
               like you're writing the alphabet.
               A... B... mmm, stay on B.

     Sebastian knocks on the door.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               One second.

     Sebastian hears some fumbling then a door close from
     inside the bedroom.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               Come in.

78   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - DAY           78

     Sebastian enters the room, to find Kathryn lying in bed,
     wearing only her bathrobe.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Bad time?

                              KATHRYN
               Kind of.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well, you obviously wanted me to
               witness your little adventure or else
               you wouldn't have invited me in.

     Sebastian walks toward the closet.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Who is our little friend so
               inexperienced that you have to resort
               to the alphabet game?

     He throws open the closet door. Ronald stands there
     covering his genitals with his hands.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Well, well, well.

                              RONALD
               It's not what it seems like.

     Ronald picks up his clothes. As he leaves:

                              SEBASTIAN
               Say hi to Cecile.

     Ronald's head drops as he closes the door behind him.

                              KATHRYN
                    (calling out)
               Call me.

     Sebastian throws Kathryn a look.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               You can't have all the fun.

     Sebastian sits on the bed.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               You seem to be in a good mood.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I am.

     A big grin appears on Sebastian's face

                              KATHRYN
               You didn't?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh yes.

                              KATHRYN
               Tell me all the details.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It was... Fantastic.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh come on. For her first time?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I know. That's the amazing part of
               it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du
               Soleil acrobatics, just standard
               missionary stuff, but it was... ah
               forget it. I'm going to sound like a
               Hallmark card.

                              KATHRYN
               No, tell me.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It was... it was like the emotional
               part outweighed the physical part.

                              KATHRYN
               Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear
               the birds chirping.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Mock, mock, mock.

     She places her hand on his crotch.

                              KATHRYN
               So I assume you've come here to make
               some arrangements.

     Sebastian stands.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Some other time.

                              KATHRYN
               Excuse me?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm not in the mood.

                              KATHRYN
               And that's why you're leaving?

                              SEBASTIAN
               It clearly is why.

                              KATHRYN
               I want to fuck.

                              SEBASTIAN
               And I don't.

     He leaves and slams the door behind him.

79   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         79

     Sebastian talks on the phone.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'll pick you up in an hour. I love
               you too.

     He hangs up the phone. Kathryn stands in the doorway.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.

                              SEBASTIAN
               No, I'm not.

                              KATHRYN
               P-whipped, p-whipped.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What's wrong with you? Why are you
               acting this way?

     Kathryn starts to cry.

                              KATHRYN
               I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're
               in love with her. You don't love me
               anymore.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a
               contest.

                              KATHRYN
               At first it was, but now it's become
               something bigger.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Kathryn, you know I love you. I've
               always loved you.

                              KATHRYN
               Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I can't believe you're reacting this
               way. You're just saying this because
               you lost the bet.

                              KATHRYN
               Is that what you think?

     He nods. Kathryn sits down on his bed. She slips her
     underwear off from under her bathrobe and tosses it
     aside, spreading her legs.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Alright, come on, let's get it over
               with. But mark my words, this is the
               only time it'll happen.

     She picks up the phone.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Whenever you're ready. Just stick it in
               me. While you're doing that I'm gonna
               make some phone calls.

                              SEBASTIAN
               That's not fair. You're taking all the
               fun out of it.

                              KATHRYN
               Then do me a favor and get rid of her.
               If not for me, then do it for you.
               Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's
               turned you into jelly. What do you want
               to be, one of those losers who walk
               down the halls holding hands and
               smiling. People used to respect you.
               They feared you and now you're going to
               throw that all away.

     Sebastian stares at her, lost in thought.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Poor Sebastian. He used to be cool, but
               now he's just another love-struck
               faggot. One of the many.

80   EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY                                80

     A taxi drives down the street.

81   INT. TAXI - DAY                                            81

     Kathryn and Sebastian sit in the back seat. Her arm is
     around his. Sebastian looks nervous.

                              KATHRYN
               Why so nervous?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I've never done this before.

                              KATHRYN
               How have you dumped girls in the past?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Screening calls. Any suggestions?

                              KATHRYN
               I knew this guy last summer in the
               Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the
               time were madly in love with each
               other. But she had this huge weight
               problem. His friends taunted him
               mercilessly about it. You know, "How
               do you breathe when she sits on your
               face?" "It's embarrassing for you to
               be seen with her." Finally he couldn't
               take it anymore and decided to dump
               her. She flipped and he went on the
               defensive. I distinctly remember him
               saying the same thing over and over
               again. "I'm completely fucked up."
               "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm
               completely fucked up."
                    (beat)
               Poor fatty never had a chance.

82   EXT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY                       82

     The cab pulls up to the curb. Sebastian gets out and
     heads into the building. Kathryn leans out the window.

                              KATHRYN
               Don't be weak.

     The cab drives off.

83   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY             83

     Sebastian rings the doorbell. A woman (MRS. O'SHEA)
     answers the door.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Hi. Is Annette at home?

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               You must be Sebastian. I've heard such
               nice things about you.

     He smiles.

                              MRS. O'SHEA (cont'd)
                    (calling out)
               Annette.
                    (to Sebastian)
               Come on in.

84   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - FOYER - DAY                        84

     Sebastian closes the door behind him. Annette enters the
     room.

                              ANNETTE
               Hi.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Hi.

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               Well, I'm going to head back to the
               kitchen. You two have fun.

     Mrs. O'Shea mouths "He's cute" to Annette. Annette
     smiles and nods. Mrs. O'Shea leaves the room.

                              ANNETTE
               Would you like a tour?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sure.

     She takes his hand and leads him down the hall.

85   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - DAY         85

     They enter a guest room.

                              ANNETTE
               And this is my room.

     She closes the door behind them. She smiles and kisses
     him.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               You think we can be quiet?

     She embraces him. Sebastian remains lifeless.

                              SEBASTIAN
               This isn't working out for me anymore.

                              ANNETTE
                    (smiling)
               Yeah, me neither.

     She looks him in the eye and can tell he's not joking.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               What's wrong?

                              SEBASTIAN
               It's not you, it's me. I'm completely
               fucked up.

                              ANNETTE
               What are you saying?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why aren't you understanding?

                              ANNETTE
               I love you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I know. I wish I felt the same.
               Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think
               it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm
               completely fucked up.

     Annette bursts into tears.

                              ANNETTE
               Why are you trying to hurt me?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm just being honest. I just wanted to
               see what you were like in bed.

     She attacks him but he grabs her hands and fends her off.
     He pushes her against the wall and covers her mouth with
     his hand.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Shh! Shh! I don't think Mrs. O'Shea
               would appreciate you acting like a
               total psychopath.

     She slinks to the ground and continues to sob.

                              ANNETTE
               You don't know how to love.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You don't even know me. The fact of the
               matter is there is some one I love.
               She's smarter, prettier... you don't
               even compare to her. The only reason I
               am here is because she wants us to be
               exclusive.

                              ANNETTE
               But you knew this was important to me.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What, your virginity? Well that's over
               now.

     Annette clutches her stomach and continues to sob. He moves
     towards her.

                              ANNETTE
               Please go.

     He opens the door.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sorry. I'm completely fucked up.

     He leaves and closes the door behind him. Annette
     continues to sob.

86   EXT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - DAY                               86

     A cab driver carries several shopping bags out of a cab.

87   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                     87

     Kathryn walks down the hallway and enters her room.

88   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - DAY           88

     The room is dark. Kathryn flips on the light.

                              KATHRYN
               Jesus.

     Sebastian is sitting in a chair, wearing his shades,
     journal in hand.

                              KATHRYN
               A little melodramatic, don't you think.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I have a flair for drama.

                              KATHRYN
               Mind if I ask what you're doing in my
               room?

                              SEBASTIAN
               You wanted an answer to your question.

                              KATHRYN
               Annette?

     He takes off his glasses. We can tell he has been
     crying.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Devastated beyond repair. I doubt
               she'll ever trust a man again.

                              KATHRYN
               Well done.

     He holds up a bottle of champagne.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I thought we should celebrate.

                              KATHRYN
               I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm
               expecting some company.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ronald?

                              KATHRYN
               Not that it's any of your business but
               yes.

     Sebastian holds up a letter.

                              SEBASTIAN
               From Ronald.

     Kathryn takes the letter.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I haven't had a chance to read it, but
               I'm sure it goes something like "yahdah
               yahdah yahdah you mean a lot to me.
               Yahdah yahdah yahdah I hope we can be
               friends. Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera."
               You see, I expected your sort of
               bullshit so I took the liberty of
               phoning Ronald and Cecile. Right now
               they're having a little get together
               in my love shack at the Grand Central
               Hyatt. I'm so sorry he chose Cecile
               over you, but I promised him I would
               see you through your crisis.

                              KATHRYN
               Well done.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Thank you. Now, where were we?

     POP goes the champagne cork.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Oh yeah, the celebration.

     He reaches down and picks up two glasses. He fills them
     and hands one to Kathryn.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What shall we toast to?

                              KATHRYN
               To my triumph, of course.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Not my choice of toast, but it's your
               call. To your triumph over Annette.

     Kathryn giggles.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What's so funny?

                              KATHRYN
               Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her.
               It's over you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Come again?

                              KATHRYN
               You were very much in love with her and
               you're still in love with her. But it
               amused me to make you ashamed of it.
               You gave up on the first person you
               ever loved because I called you names.
               Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that
               you chose me over her, but please
               understand, I never loved you,
               Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little
               toy I play with. And now you've
               completely blown it with her. I think
               that's the saddest thing I've ever
               heard.
                    (smiles)
               Cheers.

     She clicks his glass and drinks. Sebastian doesn't
     drink. He looks ill.

                              SEBASTIAN
               In any event, you still owe me my
               reward.

                              KATHRYN
               I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't
               fuck losers.

     Sebastian slaps her across the face.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               You motherfucker!

     She grabs him and starts throwing wild punches. They
     fall to the ground.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Nobody hits me.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Calm down.

     He rolls on top of her and pins her to the ground.

                              KATHRYN
               Get off me!

                              SEBASTIAN
               Will you calm down?

                              KATHRYN
               Fine! Get off me!

     He stands and gives her a hand up. They both catch their
     breaths.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.

                              KATHRYN
               I accept. Now get out.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Get out? We had an arrangement.

                              KATHRYN
               Didn't you hear what I said?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I don't care what you said, we had an
               agreement. You've slept with half of
               the borough so don't tell me you're
               being choosy.

                              KATHRYN
                    (screaming)
               Get out!

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm giving you to the count of three to
               plop your ass down on the bed.

                              KATHRYN
               And if I don't?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Then I will consider it a declaration
               of war. One. Two... three.

                              KATHRYN
               I think you have your answer.

                              SEBASTIAN
               War it is.

     He grabs his journal, leaves and SLAMS the door behind
     him.

89   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         89

     Sebastian paces while talking on the phone.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It's desperate that I talk to her.

                              MRS. O'SHEA (O.S.)
               I've already told you, she's not home.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well please leave a message that I
               called.

                              MRS. O'SHEA (O.S.)
               I'll do that.

     He hangs up the phone and THROWS it into a mirror, which
     SMASHES.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Shit.

     He collapses on his bed and buries his face in his hands.
     Exhausted he looks up and sees his journal lying on the
     floor. He picks it up and flips through it.

90   EXT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                     90

     Sebastian walks down the street carrying a small package.
     He enters an apartment building.

91   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT           91

     Sebastian rings the doorbell. Mrs. O'Shea answers the
     door.

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               What do you want?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I need to talk to Annette.

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               She's not here.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you know where she is?

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               She's out.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you know when she'll be back?

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               Later. Listen, we're entertaining
               some guests so -

                              SEBASTIAN
               Annette! Annette!

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               Young man, I already told you she's
               not here.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Fine. Could you please see that she
               gets this.

     He hands her the package.

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               I'll do that.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It's really important.

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               I understand. Good night.

     She closes the door.

92   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - FOYER - NIGHT                      92

     Mrs O'Shea turns away from the door towards Annette,
     who stands in the hallway.

93   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT         93

     Kathryn sits in a chair doing her nails. She checks her
     watch, takes a moment and makes herself upset. She picks
     up the phone and dials.

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:

94   INT. RONALD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              94

     Ronald is sleeping. The phone rings. He awakens and
     answers it.

                              RONALD
               Hello.

                              KATHRYN
                    (voice cracking)
               Ronald?

                              RONALD
               Yeah?

                              KATHRYN
               It's Kathryn.

     Ronald sits up, nervous.

                              RONALD
               Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?

                              KATHRYN
               No.

     She cries.

                              RONALD
               What's wrong?

                              KATHRYN
               It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.

                              RONALD
               What do you mean?

                              KATHRYN
               I think he's high on drugs. He hit me,
               then took off. I'm afraid to be alone.
               Please come over.

                              RONALD
               I'll be right there.

     He hangs up the phone and grabs his pants

                                                       BACK TO:

95   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - DAY           95

     Kathryn hangs up the phone. She instantly becomes calm and
     returns to doing her nails.

96   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT       96

     Annette sits and stares at Sebastian's package.

     She picks it up and opens it. She takes out a journal
     and a letter. She opens the letter and reads it.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               Dear Annette. Thank you for reading
               this letter. I don't know what I can
               possibly say to rectify the harm I have
               caused you. For once in my life I'm at
               a loss for words.

97   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       97

     Sebastian sits at his desk, writing the letter.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               The truth of the matter is that being
               with you was the only time I have ever
               been happy. My whole life has been a
               joke. I prided myself on taking joy in
               others' misery.

98   INT. MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT (MONTAGE)                    98

     Sebastian walks the streets of New York. He seems sad
     and lonely.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               Well, it finally backfired. I succeeded
               in hurting the first person I loved. I
               wish more than anything I could take it
               back, but I guess that's not possible.

99   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT       99

     Annette continues to read the letter.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               Enclosed is my most prized possession...
               my journal. For a long time I
               considered it my trophy. A sordid
               collection of my conquests. If you
               really want to know the truth, then
               please read it. No more lies.

100  EXT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                     100

     We PAN down the side of the building to the ground.
     Sebastian lies against the building waiting for Annette
     to return.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               A car is picking me up tomorrow and
               taking me to Martha's Vineyard, where
               we have a summer home. Nothing would
               make me happier than if you joined me.
               I'm a fucking wreck without you. If
               you're interested please meet me
               outside my building at nine. If not, I
               understand. Love, Sebastian.

101  INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT               101

     Ronald sits and listens as a grieving Kathryn tells her
     story.

                              KATHRYN
               And when I confronted him about his
               affair with Cecile he told me it was
               none of my business. Then when I said
               "Well what about Ronald," he said you
               were nothing more than a stupid... the
               n word and that you deserved what you
               got...

                              RONALD
               And this happened before you and I
               hooked up?

                              KATHRYN
               It's been going on for a while.
                    (beat)
               Then he called me a disgrace to our
               family and that's when he hit me.

                              RONALD
               Racist piece of shit.

                              KATHRYN
               I'd be careful if I were you. God knows
               what he's up to.

                              RONALD
               He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass
               in.

                              KATHRYN
               Will you stay here for the night? You
               can leave in the morning. That's when
               my parents get back and --

                              RONALD
               Don't worry about it. I'll stay.

     Kathryn hugs him.

                              KATHRYN
               Thanks Ronald. You're a good friend.

102  EXT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY                       102

     A STREET CLEANING MACHINE drives past the apartment

103  INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY               103

     Sebastian lies sleeping on a sofa in the lobby. The
     NIGHT DOORMAN taps him awake.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What time is it?

                              NIGHT DOORMAN
               Eight o'clock. You got to go.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Did she show up?

                              NIGHT DOORMAN
               Nope.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you mind if I check upstairs?

                              NIGHT DOORMAN
               I can't have you do that, nor can I
               have you hanging around the lobby all
               day.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I understand. Thanks for letting me
               crash here.

                              NIGHT DOORMAN
               Don't worry about it.

     Sebastian stands and staggers out of the building.

104  EXT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - DAY                               104

     Ronald walks out of the building and heads toward the
     corner.

     He stops when he SEES - Sebastian crossing the street.

                              RONALD
                    (under his breath)
               Son of a bitch.

     Sebastian walks toward Ronald, who blocks his path.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Sebastian!

     Sebastian looks up at Ronald.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (tired)
               Hey Ronald.

                              RONALD
               It seems that you and I have some
               talking to do.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Can we do it later. I've had a really
               bad night and -

     Ronald SHOVES Sebastian.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What's your problem?

                              RONALD
               Where the hell do you come off hitting
               women?

                              SEBASTIAN
               What are you talking about?

                              RONALD
               Kathryn. Did you hit her?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?

                              RONALD
               Did you hit her?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ronald, you don't know what you're
               talking about.

                              RONALD
               Don't know what I'm talking about? I
               know that you fucked Cecile.

     Sebastian says nothing.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               It's true, isn't it?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ronald, I'm sorry.

                              RONALD
               You bastard!

     Ronald TACKLES Sebastian to the ground. Ronald lands on
     top of him and hits in the mouth.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               I trusted you!

     Ronald hits him again. Blood pours out of Sebastian's
     mouth. Sebastian is dazed. Ronald grabs him by the
     collar.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               I trusted you!

     Sebastian takes a moment to catch his breath.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Fuck you.

     He knees Ronald in the groin. Ronald screams in pain and
     falls over. Sebastian climbs to his feet.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Why don't you give me a chance to
               explain.

     Sebastian kicks him in the ass. Ronald falls over.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Don't you get it? We were all part of
               her game.

     Sebastian pins him to the ground. Ronald struggles.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I'm gonna let you up, but you have to
               give me a chance to explain. Understood?

     Ronald nods. Sebastian releases him and Ronald catches
     his breath. Sebastian looks up and SEES -

     Annette, standing across the street, witnessing the
     event.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Annette!

     Sebastian stands and races over to her, blindly crossing
     the street.

     Annette notices a speeding cab and -

                              ANNETTE
                    (pointing)
               Sebastian!

     Sebastian looks up just as -- WHAM! The taxi HITS him
     dead on, sending him flying over the car and onto the
     street.

     Annette SCREAMS. The cab SKIDS to a stop. Annette runs
     into the street and over to Sebastian, who lies in shock,
     He sees her and grabs her hand. She starts to cry.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm okay. I'm okay.

     Ronald and the Cab driver run over to them.

                              ANNETTE
               Get an ambulance!

     The cab driver races back to his car. Sebastian looks up
     at Annette.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               We're getting you to a hospital.

     Sebastian nods.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Holy shit.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               You're gonna be fine.

     Sebastian nods.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm sorry.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               It's alright.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm okay. Everything's good.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

105  INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 105

     Blaine, twenty high-school girls and several friends of
     the family are dressed in black, making polite conversation
     and consoling Sebastian's parents and his Aunt Helen.

     Mrs. Caldwell stands in the corner with Cecile and her
     husband, MR. CALDWELL.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Sad, sad, sad. To think of the
               opportunities that boy had. This should
               be a lesson to us all that our children
               need constant supervision.

     She puts her arm around Cecile.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (CONT'D)
               It's all about quality time.

106  INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         106

     Annette enters Sebastian's room, now cleaned up. She
     walks around the room, taking it in, then approaches the
     window. She stares out of it for a moment.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               He loved that view.

     Annette turns and sees Kathryn at the door. She enters
     the room.

                              ANNETTE
               I can see why.

     Kathryn extends her hand.

                              KATHRYN
               I'm Kathryn.

                              ANNETTE
               Annette Harrison.

     They shake.

                              KATHRYN
               Have we met?

                              ANNETTE
               I don't think so.

                              KATHRYN
               Did you know Sebastian well?

                              ANNETTE
               You might say that.

                              KATHRYN
               Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your
               father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.

                              ANNETTE
               That's right.

                              KATHRYN
               I'm sure you're going to love it there.

     Annette nods.

                              KATHRYN
               Are you okay?

                              ANNETTE
               I'll be fine.

                              KATHRYN
                    (beat)
               Well, I'll leave you alone now. I just
               came in here to get something of mine.

     Kathryn walks over to Sebastian's desk and takes the keys
     to his Porsche. She goes to leave, when she turns back to
     Annette.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               You sure you're going to be alright?
               I'm here if you need a friend.

                              ANNETTE
               Thank you.

                              KATHRYN
               Look, I know this sounds corny, but
               whenever I feel like I can't go on I...
                    (takes out her crucifix)
               turn to Jesus and he helps me through
               the problem. Call me an anachronism,
               but -

                              ANNETTE
               Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.

                              KATHRYN
               Excuse me?

                              ANNETTE
               You heard me.

                              KATHRYN
               Who the hell do you think you are
               coming into my house and saying those
               things to me. My brother is dead, have
               some respect.

                              ANNETTE
               Kathryn, I know all about you and
               Sebastian.

                              KATHRYN
               Sebastian was a pathological liar. I
               wouldn't believe a word he -

                              ANNETTE
               I have his journal.

                              KATHRYN
               You what?

                              ANNETTE
               His journal. He sent it to me the day
               before he died. Everything about you is
               in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs,
               the menages, your bout with bulimia,
               the affair you had with your guidance
               counselor and how he gave you... eww.
               Let's see, then there's your coke
               problem... You still keep it in your
               crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.

                              KATHRYN
               You didn't show it to anybody?

                              ANNETTE
               Actually, I was planning on running
               down to Kinkos. Do you think you could
               give me ride?

                              KATHRYN
               You can't do this to me. It could ruin
               me.

                              ANNETTE
                    (smiling)
               I know.

     Kathryn starts to cry.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               Kathryn, please. Crying? Didn't you
               once say that crying is a sign of
               weakness? I'm very disappointed in you.

     Kathryn continues to sob.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               Alright, stop crying. There's a bright
               side to this you know.

     Annette puts a comforting arm around her.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               You're going to be my pet project next
               year. You're going to do what I tell
               you to do, wear what I tell you to
               wear. You're going to befriend the
               unpopular, sleep with the insecure.
               Think of the social ramifications it
               will cause. You and I are going to turn
               this school around. And do you know why
               you're going to do it?
                    (beat)
               Cause your ass is mine.

     Annette grabs Kathryn by the face, KISSES her forcefully
     on the mouth, then shoves her back. Kathryn looks at her
     in horror.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               We'll be in touch.

     She winks at Kathryn then leaves.

     CLOSE ON: Kathryn. She sits down on Sebastian's bed,
     utterly defeated.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               Forgot something.

     Annette steps back into frame and takes the car keys out
     of Kathryn's hands.

107  INT. PORSCHE - DAY                                         107

     Annette races down the highway. She opens up the glove
     compartment and rifles through some cassettes. She takes
     out The Carpenter's Greatest Hits and inserts it.

     CUE UP: The Carpenter's singing "Goodbye To Love."

     Annette reaches down and takes out Sebastian's
     sunglasses. She puts them on and checks herself out in
     the rear-view mirror. A grin crosses her face.

108  EXT. WESTSIDE HIGHWAY - AERIAL POV. - DAY                  108

     We MOVE off the Porsche and ascend into the air. The
     Porsche weaves through traffic as it disappears into a
     sea of cars. WE SEE the Manhattan skyline in the background
     as WE -

                                                       FADE OUT.

1    EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DAY                               1

     We circle around the island of Manhattan moving closer and
     closer till we're looking down on Fifth Avenue. As the
     melody continues to play we MOVE towards a building and ZOOM
     into a window.

2    INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY                              2

     A fifty-year old female therapist (DR. GREENBAUM) sits at
     her desk, frowning as she takes notes. Books of Jung and
     Freud line the shelves.

     A young man (SEBASTIAN VALMONT) sits in a chair in front
     of her looking impatient.

     The therapist continues to write notes.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Jesus. We've been at this for six
               months.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I know.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               And you haven't made an ounce of
               progress.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I know.

     Sebastian takes out a cigarette.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
                    (not looking up)
               There's no smoking in my office.

     Sebastian sneers at her then puts the cigarette away. Dr.
     Greenbaum finishes her notes and looks up at him, shaking
     her head.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What do you want me to say? That I'm
               supposed to feel remorse because I act
               the way I do? The truth is I don't.

     Dr. Greenbaum shakes her head and takes notes.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Look, I'm not like all the other kids
               in high school. I don't care about book
               reports and extra-credit. Teachers
               are idiots anyway. The only challenge
               out there for me is women. You see a
               girl you like. You pursue them. You
               conquer. You move on. It's exciting.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               But you said you have the worst
               reputation.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I do.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Don't you want to change that?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Let me tell you something, doctor.
               Chicks love a guy with a bad rap.
               They say they don't, but they don't
               mean it. They all think that they're
               the ones that are going to "save me."
               The trick is to let them think it's
               true.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               I think that's all the time we have
               for today.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Same time next week?

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               No. This is going to be our last
               session.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why? I like spending time with you.
               You know, you're quite attractive for
               a woman your age. You have killer legs.
               Killer.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a
               lot of money to send you here. I'm
               trying to help you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big
               help.

     Sebastian picks up a book of Freud.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               He was a coke addict, you know.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               You think you can come in here with that
               cute little smirk on your face and try
               and flirt with me. It doesn't work,
               Sebastian.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It works a little.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               No it doesn't. I see right through you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You do?

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               I hope for your sake you grow out of
               this immature phase. It's going to get
               you into trouble.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well, you don't have to get nasty about
               it.

     Sebastian approaches a photo on her desk and picks it up.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               My daughter, Rachel.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yummy.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Don't even think about it. Rachel is an
               exceptionally well rounded young
               woman, who happens to be attending
               Princeton this fall. She's way too
               smart to fall for your line of b.s.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Really? Care to make a wager on that?

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Good luck, Sebastian.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What, nervous I'm going to win?

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Would you please leave.

     Sebastian puts on his glasses and leaves.

                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)
               Asshole.

     The doctor stews for a moment, then reaches into her
     desk, sifts through some papers where she finds a pack of
     Benson & Hedges and lights one up. She looks at the photo
     of her daughter, then hits the speaker phone and dials.

                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)
               Rachel, it's mom.

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:

3    INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - DAY                                3

     RACHEL, Doctor Greenbaum's daughter sits at her desk,
     crying while holding the phone.

                              RACHEL
               Hi, mom.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Honey, is something wrong?

     Rachel cries for a moment.

                              RACHEL
               He told me he loved me and I believed
               him.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Who told you?

                              RACHEL
               You don't know him. I'm so stupid.

     She continues to cry.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep
               breath, and step out of the circle.

                              RACHEL
               Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit,
               mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.

     WE PAN OVER TO HER COMPUTER CONSOLE. CLOSE ON: COMPUTER
     MONITOR - A nudie web-sight. The title reads "Ivy League
     Bound." Beneath the caption is a photo of Rachel tied to
     a bed and smiling with a Princeton banner covering her
     privates.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               What kind of pictures?

                              RACHEL
               Nudie pictures, what do you think?

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Jesus Christ, how can you be so
               stupid?

                              RACHEL
               I don't know. He was just so charming.
               All he did was talk about how I had
               killer legs and how we wanted to
               photograph them. Things just got out
               of hand from there.
                    (she hears the phone drop)
               Mom? Are you there? Mom?
                    (screaming)
               Mother!!!!

4    INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY           4

     Doctor Greenbaum bolts out of her office and spots
     Sebastian standing in the elevator.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               You son of a bitch.

     Doctor Greenbaum races down the hall pushing several
     people out of her way. Sebastian stares at her
     expressionless as the elevator doors close.

                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)
               You're gonna pay for this you little
               shit. You hear me.

     A DENTIST peers outside of his office to see what's
     going on. He exchanges looks with Doctor Greenbaum.

                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)
               Fuck off, Harold.

     He gasps.

5    EXT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - DAY                               5

     A METER MAID is writing a ticket on a car when a Porsche
     pulls up in front of the townhouse and parks in a red
     zone. Sebastian steps out of the car and walks up the
     steps to the townhouse.

                              METER MAID
               You can't park there.

     Sebastian turns to her and sneers. He takes out a wad of
     money and shoves it in her breast pocket before entering
     the townhouse.

6    INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                     6

     A SERIES OF SHOTS

     CLOSE ON:  A tuna on a chopping board. WHACK! A butcher
     knife comes down on the tuna cutting it's head off.

     CLOSE ON: Two hands ripping open the fish.

     CLOSE ON: Two hands rolling a chunk of tuna into a rice
     roll.

7    INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                     7

     CLOSE ON: Two hands which carry a lavish tray of sushi
     through several doors until we enter the final door
     leading into -

8    INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 8

     A enormous living room by Manhattan standards, with a
     view that overlooks the park. Eclectic art from around
     the world emphasize the Valmont's passion for travel.

     SOOK-HEE, the Valmont's housekeeper sets a tray of sushi
     in front of -

     KATHRYN MERTEUIL, a seventeen year old porcelain
     skinned WASP with all the grooming you could want in an
     East Coast child. She sits with a forced smile on her
     face and listens attentively as -

     BUNNY CALDWELL, a forty year old nouveau-riche socialite
     talks incessantly. CECILE CALDWELL, her beautiful
     teenage daughter, sits by her side. She wears a T-shirt
     with a Koala Bear on it.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I can't tell you how happy we are that
               Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you
               this fall. You've always been an
               inspiration to Beau and I on raising
               her. We just hope she can rise to the
               high standards which you've set for
               her.

                              KATHRYN
               I'll do my best.

     Sook-Hee pours a dish of soy sauce in front of Kathryn.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
                    (to Sook-Hee, in Vietnamese)
               Thank you, Sook-Hee. That will be
               all.

     Sook-Hee leaves.

                              CECILE
               What was that?

                              KATHRYN
               I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a
               beautiful language.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               Kathryn is a straight A student at
               Oakwood as well as being President of
               the French Club. Listen to whatever
               she has to say and you'll go far.

                              KATHRYN
                    (in French)
               You're too kind.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring
               that goes on in high school. Where
               do you get your strength?

                              KATHRYN
               I know this sounds corny, but whenever
               I feel temptations of peer pressure,
               I...
                    (takes out her crucifix)
               turn to God and he helps me through the
               problem. Call me an anachronism, but
               it works.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               That's beautiful.

                              CECILE
               What are the boys like?

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Cecile, is that the best you can do?
                    (to Kathryn)
               You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never
               been in a co-educational atmosphere before.

                              KATHRYN
               Don't worry, it's totally understandable.
               Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood
               are very upstanding gentleman, however
               there are the occasional bad apples.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't
               believe they didn't expel him after what he
               did to the school nurse.

                              SEBASTIAN (O.S.)
               I hear she's recovering quite well.

     Mrs. Caldwell turns to see Sebastian standing in the
     doorway. He walks over and takes a seat.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Nice to see you again, Mrs. Caldwell.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               You remember my daughter, Cecile.

                              SEBASTIAN
               My, what an adorable shirt you're
               wearing.

                              CECILE
               My father just took me on a trip to Australia.

                              SEBASTIAN
               How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Outstanding.

                              CECILE
               What year are you in?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.

                              CECILE
               But I thought high school is only four years.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.

     He winks at Cecile.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I think we'll be going now.
                    (to Kathryn)
               Thanks for all your help.

     Kathryn stands and approaches Cecile.

                              KATHRYN
               I'll call you later and we'll get together
               and plan your curriculum.

                              CECILE
               Thanks.
                    (to Sebastian)
               Nice meeting you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ciao.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Let's go, Cecile. Now!

     Cecile follows Mrs. Caldwell out the door. Kathryn
     closes the door behind them.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash
               and her stupid daughter are doing in my
               house?

                              KATHRYN
               I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.

     Kathryn sits on the sofa next to Sebastian. She unscrews
     her crucifix. The top part becomes a small spoon and the
     bottom part a small vial of coke.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               The parental units called while you were out.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a
               mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my
               inheritance per usual?

                              KATHRYN
               Hopefully, though she suspects that your
               decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the
               maid.

     Kathryn uses her crucifix as a coke-spoon and snorts a
     bump.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               What's wrong with you today? Therapy not
               going well?

                              SEBASTIAN
               It was fine.

     He leaps off the sofa and starts to pace.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I'm sick of sleeping with these insipid
               Manhattan Debutantes.

     He walks over to the wall where nude Botticelli hangs.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Nothing shocks them anymore.

     He scratches the nude's pubic area.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I'm beginning to feel like I'm losing my
               touch.

     He kisses it.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have
               a mission for you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What?

9    EXT. PARK - DAY                                            9

     COURT REYNOLDS, an Aryan seventeen year old preppy, wears
     a Polo sweater with an American Flag.

                              KATHRYN (V.O.)
               You know Court Reynolds, son of Garret
               Reynolds?

     Kathryn steps into frame and embraces him. She is wearing
     the same sweater. He kisses her forehead and messes
     up her hair.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               You mean the Nazi who dumped you over Fourth
               Of July Weekend?

10   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 10

     Kathryn throws a sushi at him. Sebastian catches it.

                              KATHRYN
               He didn't dump me. We had a parting of
               the ways.

     Sebastian stares her down.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Alright he dumped me.

     He smiles, then swallows the sushi.

11   EXT. PUBLIC PARKING GARAGE/INT. COURT' S CAR - NIGHT       11

     A drunk Court sits in the driver's side and takes a final
     swig from his flask. He quickly passes out.

                              KATMRYN (V.O.)
               I went to great lengths to please Court.
               Huge sacrifices were made on my part to
               keep him happy.

     Kathryn rises up INTO FRAME, looks at Court and scowls.

                              SEBASTIAN(V.O.)
               Swallow?

     She spits on him, then wipes her mouth.

                              KATHRYN (V.O.)
               What do you think?

     Kathryn sprays her mouth with Binaca.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               Sorry.

12   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 12

                              KATHRYN
               In any event, my feelings were hurt when I
               learned that he had fallen for someone else.
               Someone chaste... pure... innocent.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You don't mean?

13   EXT. PARK - DAY                                            13

     Cecile turns toward the camera, while eating a double scoop
     ice cream cone and wearing a Mickey Mouse Club hat.

                              KATHRYN (V.O.)
               None other than Cecile Caldwell.

     She takes a lick of the ice cream, which falls off the cone.
     She mouths the word "shoot" and stomps her feet

14   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 14

     Sebastian snickers.

                              KATHRYN
               I don't find this very funny,

                              SEBASTIAN
               So that's what this is all about.
                    (imitating Kathryn)
               We'll get together and plan your
               curriculum.

                              KATHRYN
               Keep your friends close and your
               enemies closer. When I get through
               with her, she'll be the premier Blow
               Job Queen of the Tri-State area and
               poor little Court's heart will be
               shattered.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why go through Cecile? Why not just
               attack Court?

                              KATHRYN
               Because if there's an attack made on
               Court it could be traced back to me.
               I can't allow that to happen.
               Everybody loves me and I intend to
               keep it that way.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I see your point... though why should
               I care?

                              KATHRYN
               I need you to seduce our young Cecile.
               Introduce her to your world of
               decadence and debauchery.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sounds intriguing.

                              KATHRYN
               She's quite cute you know. Young
               supple breasts, a tight firm ass and
               an uncharted pootie.

     Sebastian watches Kathryn rub herself. He licks his
     lips.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Be her Captain Picard, Valmont.
               Boldly go where no man has gone
               before.

     Sebastian places his hand over Kathryn's as she continues
     to rub herself. He thinks for a moment, then:

                              SEBASTIAN
               I can't.

     Kathryn throws his hand off of hers.

                              KATHRYN
               Why not?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy.
               "But I thought high school was only
               four years." I mean, please. She knows
               nothing. She's seen nothing. I could
               have her under the table at Au Bar
               sucking me off before the appetizer
               arrived. Go get one of those moron
               friends of yours to do it. I have a
               reputation to uphold.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh but diddling the therapist's
               daughter is a challenge?

                              SEBASTIAN
               That was just simple revenge. What I
               have planned requires sheer genius.

     He takes a magazine and throws it on the table. Kathryn
     picks it up. It's the latest issue of "Seventeen."

                              KATHRYN
               I'm not interested in the latest dating
               tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Shut up and turn to page 64.

     She turns to the page. INSERT MAGAZINE ARTICLE: The title
     reads: A VIRGIN'S MANIFESTO. "Why I Plan To Wait
     Until Marriage," by Annette Harrison. Age 17. Kansas
     City, Missouri.

                              KATHRYN
               Jesus Christ, is she for real?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh yes. I've read it over and over again.
               This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little
               angel. A paradigm of chastity and
               virtue.

                              KATHRYN
               B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to
               Kansas and woo little Dorothy.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It just so happens we're not in Kansas
               anymore. Our little angel's father has
               accepted the new headmaster position at
               Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up
               in Connecticut while Daddy sells his
               house. Can you imagine what this would
               do for my reputation? Screwing the new
               headmaster's virginal daughter before
               school starts? It will be my greatest
               victory.

                              KATHRYN
               You don't stand a chance. Even this is
               out of your league.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Care to make a wager on that?

                              KATHRYN
               I'll think about it...

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another
               chapter to my work of art.

     He holds up a leather bound JOURNAL.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more
               queer?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Could you be more desperate to read it?

     Sebastian stands to leave and heads to the door.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh Sebastian. About that little wager
               of yours.

     He stops.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Count me in.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What are the terms?

                              KATHRYN
               If you lose, then that hot little Porsche
               of yours is mine.

                              SEBASTIAN
               And if I win?

     She approaches him.

                              KATHRYN
               I'll give you something you've been
               jerking off about ever since our parents
               got married.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Be more specific.

                              KATHRYN
               In English.
                    (whispers in his ear)
               I'll fuck your brains out.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What makes you think I'd go for that
               bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar
               car.

                              KATHRYN
               Because I'm the only person you can't
               control and it kills you.

     Sebastian sneers at her.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Do we have a deal?

                              SEBASTIAN
               No way, that car means everything to
               me.

     She kisses him and licks her tongue over his lips.

                              KATHRYN
                    (whispering)
               You can put it anywhere.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Even there?

                              KATHRYN
                    (baby talk)
               It would feel so yummy.

     Sebastian hesitates, then shakes her hand.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Happy hunting.

15   EXT. ROSEMOND ESTATE - AERIAL SHOT - DAY                   15

     WE MOVE across the sky looking down at lush greens and
     stately mansions till WE PASS over the ROSEMOND ESTATE.
     Enormous in size. WE SEE two riders on horseback.

16   EXT. ESTATE - MEADOW - DAY                                 16

     ANGLE ON: The two horseback riders. One, a woman of
     seventy. This is HELEN ROSEMOND, Sebastian's aunt.
     The other rider is a beautiful seventeen year old girl.
     The one and only ANNETTE HARRISON.

                              ANNETTE
               It's a beautiful home you have here
               Mrs. Rosemond.

                              AUNT HELEN
               Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been
               with my family for over sixty years.
               Does your family do much riding?

                              ANNETTE
               My mother and I used to ride a lot,
               before she got sick.

                              AUNT HELEN
               I'm sorry about that.

                              ANNETTE
               My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his
               farm so I would come over and ride all
               the time.

                              AUNT HELEN
               I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in
               the mid-west. What's his name?

                              ANNETTE
               Ben Schwarz.

                              AUNT HELEN
               Schwarz. Jewish?

                              ANNETTE
               German.

                              AUNT HELEN
               Doesn't ring a bell.

     Annette throws her a concerned look.

                              AUNT HELEN (cont'd)
               In any event, I want you to consider
               this your home for the time being.

                              ANNETTE
               Thank you. It's so peaceful and quiet
               around here.

     BANG! A shotgun sounds in the distance.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               What was that?

                              AUNT HELEN
               Sebastian must be here.

     Aunt Helen gallops down the ridge followed by Annette.

17   EXT. ESTATE - GARDEN - DAY                                 17

     Sebastian stands holding a shotgun. A groundskeeper,
     FRANKLIN stands by the trap.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Pull!

     The TARGET soars into the air,

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Die motherfucker!

     He fires the gun, missing the target.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Shit, shit, shit.

     Franklin shakes his head. WE HEAR a cat MEOW. Sebastian
     perks up.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Kitty. Kitty.

     He quietly reloads his rifle. WE HEAR the cat MEOW
     again. Sebastian searches for the cat.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Puss Puss Puss Puss Puss.

     He raises his rifle and takes aim.

                              AUNT HELEN (O.S.)
               Sebastian!

     He lowers his rifle and turns to SEE Aunt Helen and
     Annette riding over to him. He waves.

     Aunt Helen dismounts from her horse and they hug.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I've been looking all over for you.
               God, I've missed you.

                              AUNT HELEN
               I've missed you too. How are your
               parents?

                              SEBASTIAN
               They're coming back next week. I write
               them everyday.

     She strokes his cheek, lovingly.

                              AUNT HELEN
               Sebastian, this is Annette Harrison.
               She's going to be staying with me for
               a few weeks.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I guess that makes two of us. Welcome.

     He extends his hand and they shake.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
                    (to Aunt Helen)
               Why don't you head in and whip us up
               some of that ice tea of yours? We'll
               take care of the horses.

                              AUNT HELEN
               Anything for you, my dear.

     Sebastian climbs on Aunt Helen's horse.

                              AUNT HELEN (cont'd)
               Stay out of trouble you two.

                              SEBASTIAN & ANNETTE
               We will.

     He smiles at Annette and beckons her to follow.

18   INT. ESTATE - STABLE - DAY                                 18

     Sebastian and Annette put the riding gear away.

                              SEBASTIAN
               So what year are you going into?

                              ANNETTE
               Junior.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Got a boyfriend back home?

                              ANNETTE
               No.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why not?

                              ANNETTE
               I don't know. Relationships seem too
               distracting. I'd rather concentrate on
               my studies.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You a lesbo?

                              ANNETTE
                    (annoyed)
               No.

     She bends over to pick up the saddle.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Nice.

     She sighs, disgusted, then turns toward him.

                              ANNETTE
               Are you often this offensive on a first
               encounter?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I was just being honest. You happen to
               have a nice ass. Sorry.

     She shakes her head and continues with her chore.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I read your teen beat manifesto.

                              ANNETTE
               You did?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I must say I found it rather appalling.

                              ANNETTE
               That's a first. Most people praised me
               for it.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Most people are morons. I mean who are
               you to knock what you've never experienced?

                              ANNETTE
               I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my
               belief that people shouldn't actually
               experience the act of love until they are
               in love and that people our age are too
               immature to be in touch with those
               emotions.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh really?

                              ANNETTE
               Take yourself. You've slept with several
               women. Are you happier because of it?

                              SEBASTIAN
               How do you know I've been with several
               women?

                              ANNETTE
               A friend wrote me.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (pissed)
               Well maybe you should get to know the
               person before you judge them instead of
               listening to some bullshit gossip.

                              ANNETTE
               I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you...
               but you still didn't answer the question.

     An uncomfortable silence falls between them,

                              SEBASTIAN
               Who the hell is taking the time to write
               letters, spreading this shit about me?

                              ANNETTE
               It's not really important.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're
               not going to be friends.

                              ANNETTE
               Why are you being so dramatic?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm
               trying to deal with them and the last
               thing I need is people spreading shit
               about me.

                              ANNETTE
               Alright, I said I was sorry.
                    (beat)
               Can we start over again? I think we've
               gotten off on the wrong foot.

     She approaches him and they shake.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               Annette Harrison.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sebastian Valmont.

     She smiles, but before he releases her hand:

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               So tell me, Annette. I'm curious, since
               you've never had sex do you touch
               yourself?

     She whisks her hand away and storms out of the stable.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What did I say?

19   INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - STUDY - DAY                      19

     CLOSE ON: A hand stroking the bridge of a cello.

                              RONALD (O.S.)
               That's good, that's good.

     WE PULL BACK

     Cecile sits in front Of a cello. Next to her sits RONALD
     CLIFFORD, a well-mannered fifteen year old African
     American. Holding his own cello, he is giving her a
     music lesson.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Now let's try the A minor scale.

     Cecile attempts the A minor scale, fucking up badly.

     Kathryn enters and shudders in silence.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Once more, and remember the third note
               is flat.

     Cecile tries again and once again screws up.

                              CECILE
               Oh, I suck. I suck.

                              RONALD
               Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.

     Cecile takes a deep breath

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               You're concentrating too much on your
               bowing. Let it flow.

     He stands and sits behind her.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Here, let me help you.

     He places his hand over hers.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Now close your eyes and let's try again.

     She closes her eyes and they repeat the scale. It sounds
     much better. Ronald takes the moment to study Cecile's
     face. It's obvious he's smitten with her.

     ON KATHRYN: who watches from the door. A grin crosses
     her face.

     Ronald replaces her other hand and plays a beautiful Bach
     Sonata, with he and Cecile sharing the bowing. He closes
     his eyes as the music takes over him. Now Cecile opens
     her eyes and gazes into his. The feeling is mutual.

     ON KATHRYN: She accidentally bangs her hand onto a table
     which causes a metal tray to fall to the ground.

     Ronald and Cecile look up as Kathryn replaces the tray

                              KATHRYN
               I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.
               Your playing was beautiful.

     Ronald quickly stands and moves away from Cecile

                              CECILE
               Kathryn, this is Ronald Clifford. He's
               giving me music lessons over the
               summer.

     Ronald approaches and shakes Kathryn's hand.

                              RONALD
               Pleased to meet you.

                              KATHRYN
               Likewise I'm sure.

                              CECILE
               Ronald is one of the few high school
               students attending Juliard. He's
               composing his first opera.

                              RONALD
               It's based on the life of Doctor
               Martin Luther King.

                              CECILE
               Doctor King is my favorite.

     Ronald shakes his head, but laughs. Cecile looks at him
     and smiles. Kathryn rolls her eyes.

                              RONALD
               I guess our hour's up. Same time
               tomorrow?

     Cecile nods.

20   EXT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - DAY                                  20

     Another nice home in Connecticut. Sebastian's Porsche is
     parked outside.

21   INT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY                        21

     A typical teenagers bedroom, expect this one is a shrine
     to Herb Ritts homo-erotic art.

     BLAINE TUTTLE, Oakwood Prep's resident drug-dealer and
     open homosexual, sits at his desk separating pot seeds
     from his stash.

     Sebastian paces behind him.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -

                              BLAINE
               - none taken -

                              SEBASTIAN
               - wrote a letter to this chick and saying
               shit about me.

                              BLAINE
               Any ideas who it could be?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Blaine, if I knew who it was that person
               wouldn't be alive right now.

                              BLAINE
               Where did you say she's from?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?

                              BLAINE
               Greg McConnell.

                              SEBASTIAN
               The football stud?

                              BLAINE
               He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be
               surprised if he was your rat.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It would make sense. McConnell hates me.
               I fingered his girlfriend at the game
               last year.

                              BLAINE
               I don't think that bothered him.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What do you mean?

                              BLAINE
               Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight
               ends on and off the field.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Are you shitting me?

                              BLAINE
               I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak
               in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd
               go at it for a while, then as soon as
               he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You
               know -
                    (imitating Greg)
               "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag.
               I'll kick your ass if you say anything."
                    (beat)
               It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're
               gay, deal with it. The only reason why
               I let him continue with his charade is
               because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.

                              BLAINE
               Not anymore. Football team started
               practice last week. He's already called
               me to hook up.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Really. You think you could arrange a
               little get together with him tonight on
               my behalf?

                              BLAINE
               Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing
               Spartacus on television tonight.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Outstanding.

                              BLAINE
               Don't think it's not going to cost you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               No problem. Just make sure your front
               door is unlocked. Shall we say the
               "stroke of midnight" no pun intended?

     Sebastian hands Blaine two hundred dollar bills.

22   EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY                                    22

     Kathryn and Cecile sit on a blanket. A lavish picnic lies
     around them. Kathryn wears large sunglasses, a scarf and
     a hat to protect her from the sunlight. She sits behind
     Cecile and braids her hair.

                              KATHRYN
               So, rumor has it that you went on a date
               with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very
               nice.

                              CECILE
               He's alright.
                    (giggles)
               He kept talking about this bulimic
               headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.

                              KATHRYN
               Really? Bulimic headcase.

                              CECILE
               What a loser she must be.
                    (beat)
               Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons
               for Labor Day Weekend.

                              KATHRYN
               That's great.

                              CECILE
               You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm
               just scared.

                              KATHRYN
               What are you scared of?

                              CECILE
               Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to
               first base with a guy. What do I do?

                              KATHRYN
               Haven't you ever practiced with one of
               your girlfriends?

                              CECILE
               Eww. No. That's gross.

                              KATHRYN
               It's not gross. How else do you think
               girls learn? Here turn around and
               face me.

     Cecile turns and faces Kathryn, who removes her glasses.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Now close your eyes and wet your lips.

                              CECILE
               Are you for real?

                              KATHRYN
               Do you want to learn or not?

                              CECILE
               I guess. It still sounds gross.

     Cecile does as instructed. Kathryn leans in and kisses
     her on the mouth.

                              KATHRYN
               See that wasn't so bad.

                              CECILE
               It was nothing.

                              KATHRYN
               Let's try it again, only this time I'm
               going to stick my tongue in your
               mouth. When I do that I want you to
               massage my tongue with yours. That's
               what first base is.

                              CECILE
                    (reluctant)
               Okay.

                              KATHRYN
               Eyes closed.

     Cecile closes her eyes. Kathryn leans in and kisses her
     again, only this time longer. She continues to kiss her
     then gently pushes her tongue into Cecile's. Cecile does
     as instructed and they start to make out.

     Kathryn eyes look towards the ground where Cecile's hands
     are now clutching the grass. Kathryn smiles and
     continues her seduction.

     She places her hand on Cecile's thigh and moves it under
     her dress. Cecile lets out a soft sigh.

     Kathryn breaks from the kiss. They look at each other
     and smile.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Not bad.

                              CECILE
               That was cool.

                              KATHRYN
               Maybe you should try it on your friend
               Ronald sometime.

                              CECILE
               What are you saying?

                              KATHRYN
               Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about
               you.

                              CECILE
               Is it that obvious?

     Kathryn nods.

                              CECILE (cont'd)
               He sends me letters you know. Love
               letters.

                              KATHRYN
               That's so romantic. Have you
               responded?

                              CECILE
               No.

                              KATHRYN
               Well do you like him?

                              CECILE
               I don't know.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile, we just made out in the middle
               of Central Park. You can trust me.

                              CECILE
                    (beat)
               I do like him. I can't stop thinking
               about him.

     Cecile starts to cry. Kathryn hugs her.

                              CECILE (cont'd)
               What am I going to do? If my mother
               found out about Ronald she would kill
               me.

     Kathryn grabs her and looks her straight in the eye.

                              KATHRYN
               Listen to me. Your mother must never
               know. Never.

                              CECILE
               Okay.

                              KATHRYN
               Did you hide the letters?

                              CECILE
               Yes. They're in this antique doll house
               in my room.

                              KATHRYN
               I want you to make me copies of his
               letters and bring them to me.

                              CECILE
               Why?

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile if there's one thing I'm great
               at it's love letters. With my help,
               he'll be eating out of the palm of
               your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a
               little get together for the two of you
               at my house.

                              CECILE
               You'd do that for me?

                              KATHRYN
               Of course I would. We're friends,
               right?

                              CECILE
               Best friends.

     Cecile kisses her on the cheek and hugs Kathryn.

23   INT. ESTATE - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT                 23

     Little touches of Annette's life (photo of dead mother)
     adorn the room. Annette is reading The Fountainhead when
     she HEARS singing coming from outside. Unable to
     concentrate, she walks out onto the balcony.

24   EXT. ESTATE - ANNETTE'S BALCONY - NIGHT                    24

     Annette steps onto the balcony.

     HER P.O.V. - Sebastian lies in a floating pool chair
     sipping a cocktail and listening to his Walkman and
     singing Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" in German.

                              ANNETTE
                    (calling out)
               Excuse me. Excuse me!

                              SEBASTIAN
               You talking to me?

                              ANNETTE
               Look, I know this is your house and all,
               but do you think you couid keep it down?
               I'm trying to read.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What'cha reading?

                              ANNETTE
               The Fountainhead.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Great book.

                              ANNETTE
                    (skeptical)
               You've read The Fountainhead?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act,
               you know. When Howard Roark makes love
               to Dominique Francon... most romantic
               scene in all of literature.

                              ANNETTE
               Romantic? He rapes her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               That's a matter of opinion.

                              ANNETTE
               You need help.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why don't you come join me for a swim
               and we'll discuss it.

                              ANNETTE
               At this hour? I don't think so.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh come on. Quit acting like a
               geriatric and get in the pool.

                              ANNETTE
               Gee, with an invitation like that how
               could a girl refuse.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Please.

                              ANNETTE
               Give me a minute. I'll be right down.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Thank you.

     She re-enters the guest room. Sebastian's cell phone
     RINGS. He answers it.

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:

25   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT         25

     Kathryn sits in her bathrobe. One foot soaks in a small
     tub of water while Sook-Hee tends to her other foot.

                              KATHRYN
               Fuck her yet?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm working on it.

                              KATHRYN
               Loser.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Blow me.

                              KATHRYN
               Call me later.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Okay.

     She hangs up and lights a cigarette. Sook-Hee accidently
     jabs her toe.

                              KATHRYN
               Ow. That hurt you stupid bitch.

                              SOOK-HEE
               Sorry.

     Kathryn kicks some water in her face.

                              KATHRYN
               Oops.

26   EXT. ESTATE - SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT                        26

     Annette comes down, wearing a bathrobe. She sits by the
     pool as Sebastian treads water away from her.

                              ANNETTE
                    (holding out the letter)
               You know it amazes me that someone as
               bright as you can be so horrible.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What? Another letter from your friend?

                              ANNETTE
               This is my favorite part.
                    (reading the letter)
               Even more treacherous and dangerous than
               he is charming and fascinating. He has
               never taken a single step or spoken a
               single word without some dishonorable
               or criminal intention. Every young girl
               he has successfully pursued has
               regretted it.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You know you could at least have the
               decency of telling me who's badmouthing
               me so I might have the opportunity to
               confront them face to face. How do you
               know it's not some girl who's pissed
               off at me for breaking up with her?

                              ANNETTE
               I sincerely doubt it.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Give me the fucking letter.

     Annette smiles and tears the letter up.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Why did you do that?

                              ANNETTE
               The last thing I need is you going into
               my room searching for this while I'm
               away.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (mocking)
               Is that the last thing you need? My
               your clever.

     She takes pieces of paper and sticks it in her bathrobe. She
     then stands and takes off the robe, revealing a one piece
     bathing suit underneath.

                              ANNETTE
               How's the water?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Refreshing.

     She dives in the pool and surfaces.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               You're right you know.

                              ANNETTE
               About what?

                              SEBASTIAN
               About what you said today in the stable.
               I'm not a happy person.

                              ANNETTE
               I never said that.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You implied it.

                              ANNETTE
               Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard
               time.

                              SEBASTIAN
               No, it's okay. I mean I look at you
               with all your morals and values and
               well, YOU seem to be happy in your
               choices. I envy you. No bullshit.

                              ANNETTE
                    (caught off guard)
               Thank you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Seriously, you're amazing. You have
               everything going for you.
                    (counts with his fingers)
               You're smart, you're beautiful, you're
               determined. You're everything I want
               in a girlfriend.

                              ANNETTE
                    (jokingly)
               Shut up.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you
               out.

                              ANNETTE
               Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it
               could never work.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why not?

                              ANNETTE
               Because you act like a pig.

     He swims towards her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you deny that there's an attraction
               between us?

                              ANNETTE
               I don't... I don't want to answer that...
               look we're friends.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You don't find me cute? Come on, look
               at these muscles.

     He flexes for her. She laughs.

                              ANNETTE
               I'm sorry, but you're not my type.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Fine. Friends it is. I can live with
               that.

     He extends his arms out for a hug. She moves in and hugs
     him. Her smile turns to a look of horror.

                              ANNETTE
               You're naked.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It's my house.

     She pushes him off her.

                              ANNETTE
               That's repulsive.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What's the big deal? We're friends.
               Haven't you ever seen your friends
               naked before?

     Annette climbs out of the pool.

                              ANNETTE
               Get some manners.

     She walks into the house.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sorry, I didn't know you were peenaphobic.

     She flips him the bird as she heads into the house.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Oooooo, naughty naughty. Ten Hail
               Mary's for you.
                    (beat)
               Good night.

27   EXT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                27

     Sebastian's Porsche is parked outside.

28   INT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT                      28

     Sebastian presses his ear to the door.

                              GREG (O.S.)
                    (moaning)
               Oh baby... oh baby...

                              SEBASTIAN
               Baby?
                    (checks his watch)
               Right on time.

29   INT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                      29

     GREG McCONNELL, All-American star football player for
     Oakwood prep is busy getting his cock sucked by Blaine,
     who lies under the covers.

                              GREG
                    (near orgasm)
               Oh God... Oh God, I'm gonna cum. I'm
               gonna cum... I'm gonna...

     The door swings open and Sebastian enters.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy
               shit.

                              GREG
               Jesus!

     Greg throws the covers over his face. Sebastian smiles
     and sits. He lights a cigarette. No movement from under
     the covers.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Greg, is that you under the covers?

                              GREG
                    (from under the covers)
               Get out of here.

     Sebastian stands YANKS the covers off the bed, revealing
     Greg and Blaine.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Whoa!

                              GREG
               I told you to lock the door.

                              BLAINE
               I thought I did.

                              GREG
               Look Valmont. This was the first time
               I've ever done something like this. I
               was --

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (apathetic)
               -- really drunk and blah blah blah
               blah blah.

                              GREG
               Please don't tell anyone. This could
               ruin my career.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Your career? What about your family?
               Can you imagine the humiliation your
               father's going to feel when he finds
               out his pride and joy is a fudge-
               packer.

                              BLAINE
               Hey hey hey. Careful Valmont, he's
               not a fudge packer. Cum chugger yes
               but not a fudge packer.

                              GREG
                    (to Sebastian)
               Please. I'm begging you. I'll do
               anything. Let's just forget the whole
               thing.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Hmmmmmmm... nah. I can't help you
               there. It's too good to pass up.

     Greg starts to cry.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               After all, it is you who's bad-
               mouthing me to Annette Harrison.

                              GREG
               Annette Harrison? I don't know what
               you're talking about.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Come on Greg. You're the only one who
               knows her. The truth will save you.

                              GREG
                    (sobbing)
               I swear on my life, I never said a
               word to her about you.

                              BLAINE
               I think he's telling the truth
               Valmont. Greg couldn't write a
               grocery list let alone a letter.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Alright, I believe you. Stop crying.
               Your secret's safe with me.

     Greg wipes his eyes.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               However, this whole incident's kind of
               turned me on.

     Sebastian unzips his fly.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               You get my point.

     Greg, completely defeated, crawls off the bed and over to
     Sebastian. Blaine shakes his head and smiles.

     Greg places his hand on Sebastian's thigh when -

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Jesus Christ, I was only kidding.
               What do you think, I'm gay? My God,
               haven't you had enough for tonight.

                              BLAINE
               Our boy just can't get enough dick.

                              GREG
               You sick son of a bitch.

     Blaine and Sebastian laugh.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'll leave you guys alone.
                    (macho voice)
               Score one for the team, Greg.

     Sebastian leaves the room, then re-enters.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Come to think of it, there is
               something you can do for me.

30   EXT. ESTATE - ROAD - DAY                                   30

     Annette jogs up a dirt road on her morning run. THIRTY
     YARDS BEHIND HER - a golf cart drives off a meadow and
     lands on the road. Sebastian is driving.

     Annette looks back and scowls. Sebastian catches up to
     her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Need a lift?

                              ANNETTE
               No thank you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               How are you today?

                              ANNETTE
               Give it up.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh right, last night. I guess I owe
               you an apology.

                              ANNETTE
               I'm not going to speak to you till you
               realize that you can't intimidate me.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I said I was sorry.

     She continues her jog. Sebastian follows alongside.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Have a nice sleep last night?

                              ANNETTE
               It was fine.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I wish I could say the same for
               myself. I was up thinking about you
               all night.

                              ANNETTE
               I thought we agreed that we were going
               to be friends.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yes, well unfortunately I can't just
               switch the "on" button to "off." The
               sad fact of the matter is that you've
               unintentionally rubbed off on me.

     Annette stops running and turns to him.

                              ANNETTE
               And that's a bad thing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm trying to better myself, but the
               one person who can help me is the same
               one pushing me away.

                              ANNETTE
               I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your
               savior.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well try this one on for size. I think
               I'm falling in love with you.

                              ANNETTE
               You don't even know me.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Don't you believe in love at first sight?

                              ANNETTE
               Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this
               is far from mutual.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ouch. Do you think we could spend some
               time together this morning?

                              ANNETTE
               I can't. I'm seeing a friend.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Who?

                              ANNETTE
               That's none of your business.

                              SEBASTIAN
               How about tonight?

                              ANNETTE
               I'm busy.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Doing what?

                              ANNETTE
               That's also none of your business.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I
               win your heart. I'll do anything. I
               can't get you out of my mind.

                              ANNETTE
               You truly want to do something to make
               me happy?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yes.

                              ANNETTE
               And you promise to abide by it?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Without question.

                              ANNETTE
               Alright.
                    (beat)
               I want you to leave and go back to
               New York.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What?

                              ANNETTE
               If that's a problem, then I'll make
               arrangements to stay with some friends.

     Sebastian thinks for a moment. He's pissed.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?

                              ANNETTE
               It's not about being happy. You and I
               can't -

     He shifts the cart into reverse and backs away.

31   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                           31

     Annette and Greg walk along the beach and gaze out at the
     ocean.

                              GREG
               He told you he's failing in love
               with you? I've never known him to
               say those words before.

                              ANNETTE
               Really? I thought he said it all
               the time.

                              GREG
               That's not his style. one thing I can
               say about Valmont. He always speaks
               the truth.

     Annette looks lost.

                              GREG (cont'd)
               What's wrong?

                              ANNETTE
               Nothing.

                              GREG
               Is there a mutual feeling between you
               two?

                              ANNETTE
               No. I mean. I don't know.
                    (beat)
               What else do you know about him?

                              GREG
               Not a whole lot. We take some classes
               together. He's got a bad rep, but it's
               mostly bullshit.

                              ANNETTE
               What do you mean?

                              GREG
               Well, a lot of people are jealous cause
               he's loaded.

                              ANNETTE
                    (sighs)
               I don't know. I've been hearing some
               awful things about him.

                              GREG
               From who?

                              ANNETTE
               I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.

     Greg takes her hand.

                              GREG
               Annette, how long have we known each
               other?

                              ANNETTE
               Forever.

                              GREG
               Now it's my job to look out for you.
               You're like a kid sister to me. Do I
               look like some kind of gossip queen?

     Annette laughs.

                              ANNETTE
               You promise not to say anything?

                              GREG
               On my mother's life.

                              ANNETTE
                    (beat)
               Okay...

     Sebastian drives down the highway towards Manhattan. He holds
     his cell phone in one ear.

                              SEBASTIAN
               That nosey bitch. Are you sure?

     Greg talks on a pay phone, out of Annette's sight.

                              GREG
               Positive.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Did you do everything I asked you to?

                              GREG
               Yes.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You told her I never said I love you
               before?

                              GREG
               Yes!

                              SEBASTIAN
               You told her that people are jealous

                              GREG
               Yes!

                              SEBASTIAN
               And you think she bought it?

                              GREG
               I'm pretty sure she did.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Pretty sure or sure sure?

                              GREG
               She bought it.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'll be in touch.

     Click. The line goes dead.

34   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 34

     Kathryn is sitting in front of the television, scowling.

     ON TV - A HIDDEN VIDEO OF RONALD AND CECILE IN THE
     VALMONT LIVING ROOM.

     Ronald plays Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata" at the piano
     while Cecile listens and sways to the music.

     ANGLE ON: LIVING ROOM -

                              KATHRYN
               Enough with the music. Fuck her
               already.

     She throws a magazine at the television. Sebastian bursts
     into the living room.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You would not believe what--

                              KATHRYN
               Shhh.

     ON TELEVISION - RONALD FINISHES THE SONG. CECILE STANDS
     AND APPLAUDS. RONALD TAKES A BOW.

                              CECILE (ON VIDEO)
               That was beautiful.

                              RONALD (ON VIDEO)
               Almost as beautiful as you.

     Cecile blushes. Ronald checks his watch.

                              RONALD (ON VIDEO)
               Well, I guess it's getting late.
               Please thank Kathryn for the use of
               her Steinway.

                              CECILE (ON VIDEO)
               I'll see you tomorrow.

                              RONALD (ON VIDEO)
               Absolutely.

     He approaches her, awkwardly then shakes her hand.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               Idiot!

     ANGLE ON: LIVING ROOM - Kathryn FREEZE FRAMES the image.

                              KATHRYN
               What's wrong with you?

                              SEBASTIAN
               You ready for this? I've recently
               discovered that our good friend Mrs.
               Caldwell is the one who sent the
               letter to Annette urging her to stay
               away from me.

                              KATHRYN
               Interesting.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I now plan to devote all my energies to
               destroying the douche bag. Any luck
               corrupting her daughter?

                              KATHRYN
               No.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Call Cecile up and get her to come over.
               I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.

     She walks over to the "freeze frame" image of Ronald and
     Cecile on the television.

                              KATHRYN
               The plot thickens. It appears that
               Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love
               that.

                              KATHRYN
               Not to mention Court Reynolds.
               Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the
               speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What's your plan of attack?

                              KATHRYN
               I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes
               ballistic and ends their relationship.
               Boo hoo.

                              SEBASTIAN
               But who will they turn to for help?

     Kathryn smiles and sits on Sebastian's lap.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile is planning to go away with Court
               next week. I'll need you to speed
               up her sexual awakenings.

     Sebastian rubs her shoulders.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm at your service.

                              KATHRYN
               Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh sis. You're so tense.

     Sebastian moves his hand down her shirt and under her bra.
     He's met with no resistance.

                              KATHRYN
               I hate when things don't go my way. It
               makes me so horny.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I hate it too.

     He takes his hand out from her shirt and slides it under her
     skirt.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
                    (baby talk)
               Oh baby, your soaking.

                              KATHRYN
               I know.

     She closes her eyes and rubs his crotch. She unzips his fly.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
                    (seductively)
               Any luck with your girl?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Moving along quite well.

                              KATHRYN
               Have you succeeded in your task?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Any day now.

                              KATHRYN
               Well, let me know when you do. Until
               then.

     She takes his hand out from under her pants.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               No pootie.

     Kathryn smiles.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Sorry.

36   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       36

     Sebastian closes his window and sets down a bb rifle with
     an infrared scope.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Goodbye Mister Bond.

     He picks up the phone and dials.

                              ANNETTE
               No, not at all.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well, I was just calling to see how
               you're doing.

                              ANNETTE
               I'm... I'm alright.

                              SEBASTIAN
               How was your date?

                              ANNETTE
               It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.

     There's a moment of uncomfortable silence.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well, I was just calling to tell you
               I was thinking about you and I miss
               you. I'll let you go.

                              ANNETTE
               Wait, don't hang up.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Okay?

                              ANNETTE
               What are you doing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Reading.

     He crosses over to his circular bed where two scantily clad
     twins (GRETCHEN & MORA) are licking popsicles.

                              ANNETTE
               What are you reading?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Of Human Bondage.

                              ANNETTE
               Somerset Maugham.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering
               my situation.

                              ANNETTE
               You're not gonna start that again.

     He takes out a bottle of baby oil and pours it on the
     girls' butts.

                              SEBASTIAN
               No. I'm through with my childish
               games when it comes to you. Hold on,
               that's my other line.
                    (to the girls)

     They rub the oil on each other then turn to him and
     smile. He clicks the phone back on.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Annette that's my mom calling. Can I
               call you tomorrow?

                              ANNETTE
               Sure. Have a good night.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I will.

                                                       BACK TO:

38   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       38

                              GRETCHEN
               Of Human Bondage. You're such a
               bullshit artist.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Shut up, Gretchen. You don't even
               know what it is.

                              GRETCHEN
               Duh, it's a book.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you know what it's about?

                              MORA
               Who cares. Books are for fags.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Books are for fags. I weep for the
               future.

     Establishing shot.

40   INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY                                        40

     A SALESWOMAN approaches Kathryn who's checking out an
     assortment of fur coats. The saleswoman holds up a
     beautiful dress.

                              SALESWOMAN
               Here's something you might like.

     Kathryn examines the label.

                              KATHRYN
               Do you carry any real fur?

                              SALESWOMAN
               No. All our fur is faux.

                              KATHRYN
               Of course. The animals. How silly of
               me.

     The saleswoman smiles, then walks away. Kathryn sneers
     then looks over at a small child, staring at her.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
                    (mouthing the words)
               Fuck off.

     She "shoos" the child away, when Mrs. Caldwell
     approaches.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I got your message and came as quick
               as I could.

                              KATHRYN
               I hope I didn't keep you from
               something.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Not at all. What's wrong?

                              KATHRYN
               It's Cecile.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               What about her?

                              KATHRYN
               Well... you promise you won't say
               anything to her. We've developed a
               friendship and...

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't
               drugs is it?

                              KATHRYN
               It's worse. I think there's something
               going on between Cecile and her music
               teacher.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Ronald? That's crazy.

                              KATHRYN
               I know. She's so young and he's so -

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Black.

     Kathryn reacts to her remark.

                              KATHRYN
               He's been sending her love letters that
               she hides under her doll house. I
               questioned whether or not to tell you,
               but something like this could destroy
               her reputation at Oakwood and I don't
               want to see her get hurt.

     Kathryn picks out an expensive suit and approaches the sales
     counter.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               I hope I did the right thing in telling
               you. I'd hate to see Cecile ruin things
               with Court.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I can't thank you enough.

                              KATHRYN
               You will be discreet about this?

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Absolutely.

                              SALESWOMAN
               Will that be cash or charge?

     Kathryn looks through her purse.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh poo. I left my credit cards at home.

     Mrs. Caldwell takes out her purse.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Let me get that for you.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh please. I can't have you do that.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               It's the least I can do.

     Mrs. Caldwell hands the credit card to the saleswoman.
     Kathryn turns to Mrs. Caldwell.

                              KATHRYN
               Thank you.

41   INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - STUDY - DAY                      41

     Ronald gives Cecile a cello lesson when Mrs. Caldwell
     bursts into the room.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Who the hell do you think you are?!

                              RONALD
               Excuse me.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I'm paying you to give cello lessons.
               Not to pervert my child.

                              RONALD
               Mrs. Caldwell I think you're
               misunderstanding something.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Is that so?

     Mrs. Caldwell holds up Ronald's letters.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               You care to explain this then?

     Ronald and Cecile exchange looks of worry.

                              CECILE
               Where did you find those?

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Margarita found them while cleaning
               your room.

                              CECILE
               Those are my letters!

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Don't you raise your voice at me. Go
               to your room, now.

     Cecile turns to Ronald.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               Now!

     Ronald nods and Cecile runs out of the room. Mrs.
     Caldwell turns to Ronald.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               How dare you treat me with such
               disrespect. I got you off the streets
               and this is how you repay me?

                              RONALD
               Got me off the streets? I live on
               59th and Park.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Whatever. You are never to set foot
               in this house again and you are never
               and I mean never to see my daughter
               again. Is that understood?!

     Ronald packs up his sheet music, while Mrs. Caldwell
     waits.

                              RONALD
               First of all, maam, I never touched
               your daughter and second, I would like
               to think that in these times someone
               of your status could look beyond
               racial lines.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Oh don't give me any of that racist
               crap. My husband and I gave money to
               Colin Powell.

                              RONALD
                    (sarcastic)
               I guess that puts me in my place.
               Thank you for the hospitality Mrs.
               Caldwell. It was a true awakening.

     He storms off.

42   INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - ELEVATOR - DAY                   42

     Ronald rides down in the elevator.

                              RONALD
                    (angry)
               Took me off the streets?

     The elevator stops and the doors open. Sebastian and
     Kathryn stand in the doorway, wearing shades. Kathryn
     hands Cecile's letter.

43   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         43

     Ronald sits in a chair and reads Cecile's letter.
     Sebastian and Kathryn watch.

                              RONALD
               Wow. I never knew she had these kind
               of feelings.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You're a lucky guy.

                              RONALD
                    (eyes tear up)
               She really loves me.

     Sebastian and Kathryn roll their eyes.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               What do I do?

                              KATHRYN
               What do you do? Tell her you love
               her.

                              RONALD
               But I can't even see her. She doesn't
               have her own phone, I don't even know
               her e-mail address.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and
               pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her
               another letter.

                              RONALD
               How will I get to her?

                              SEBASTIAN & KATHRYN
               We'll make sure she gets it.

                              RONALD
               Why are you being so good to me?

                              KATHRYN
               Because we want to see Cecile happy
               and we know you make her happy.

     She hands Ronald a pen and paper.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Now you just march yourself into the
               study and start writing. We'll be there
               to check on you in a minute.

     Ronald leaves the room. Sebastian closes the door while
     Kathryn picks up the phone and dials.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Who are you calling?

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile.

     Sebastian hangs up the phone.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               What are you doing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Before we go through with this, I just
               want you to be aware of the damage we're
               going to cause.

                              KATHRYN
               I'm aware.

     She picks up the phone and he hangs it up again.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Are you really? I mean, we've done some
               pretty fucked up shit in our time but
               this... I mean, we're destroying an
               innocent girl. You do realize that.

                              KATHRYN
               What is that? Oh my God, it's your
               conscience.

     She reaches out toward his temple, plucks a handful
     of something, throws it to the ground and STOMPS on
     it.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Court Renolds is going down and if you're
               not going to help me, someone else will.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You amaze me.

                              KATHRYN
               Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you
               to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl
               it's wrong. Well let me tell you
               something, I didn't ask to be a girl.
               Do you think I relish the fact that I
               have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty
               four seven, so I can be considered a
               "laaaady." Do you think I take great
               delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so
               wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child."
               "Kathryn is going to make an excellent
               wife one day."
                    (beat)
               I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the
               upper East Side and sometimes I want to
               kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy
               being a part of the weaker sex and for
               that reason everyone around me is going
               to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis
               Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you
               out?

     Sebastian says nothing. Kathryn picks up the phone and
     dials.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Hello, Cecile. It's Kathryn. Alright,
               stop crying. I understand. Hold on for
               Sebastian.

     She hands the phone to Sebastian.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Cecile. Now I need you to listen to me
               very carefully. I have a letter from
               Ronald that he asked me to give to
               you. Now I can't exactly bring it to
               your house, since your mother
               despises me so here's what we're going
               to do.

44   CALDWELL APARTMENT - CECILE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT              44

     The clock reads 1:30. A large collection of antiques
     and stuffed animals line the room and walls. Cecile
     lies in bed, eyes wide open. She crawls out of it,
     dressed in sweats.

45   MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT                                   45

     Cecile exits a building and steps into a waiting
     taxi.

46   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       46

     Cecile lies on Sebastian's bed. She finishes the letter
     while Sebastian fiddles with a camera.

                              CECILE
               Finished.

     She hands the letter to Sebastian, who looks it over.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Excellent.

                              CECILE
               You think he'll like it?

                              SEBASTIAN
               He'll love it.

     He points the camera at Cecile and snaps a photo.

                              CECILE
               What are you doing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Just taking your photo.

                              CECILE
               I look terrible.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes
               don't do you justice. Why don't you
               take them off.

     Cecile gasps.

                              CECILE
               I'm getting out of here.

     She stands to leave. Sebastian blocks her path.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm sorry that was out of line.

                              CECILE
                    (scared)
               I want to go home.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I was just kidding.

                              CECILE
                    (eyes watering)
               I want to go home.

     He moves toward the phone

                              SEBASTIAN
               Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom
               and have her come pick you up.

                              CECILE
               My mom? Don't call my mom.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why not? ... Oh wow, she doesn't 
               know you're here. In fact, you're
               grounded. Jesus, you could get in a
               shitload of trouble for this.
               I think I should call her anyway.

     Cecile runs over to him, sobbing, and wraps her arms
     around his legs.

                              CECILE
               Please please please. I'll do
               anything. Just don't call my mom.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Cecile, all I want to do is give you a
               kiss.

                              CECILE
               And then I can go home?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Of course. I'm not a monster.

     Cecile breathes a sigh of relief. He pulls her up to her
     feet.

                              CECILE
               Just a kiss, right?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I swear.

     She closes her eyes, then puckers up. Sebastian takes the
     string holding up her sweats and pulls it open.

     Cecile bolts up.

                              CECILE
               What are you doing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               You promised to let me kiss you.

                              CECILE
               But -

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (pointing at her lips)
               I don't want to kiss you here. I want
               to kiss you there.

     Sebastian points to her crotch. She moves her hands to
     her sweats and looks up at him. Sebastian shrugs.

     Cecile pulls the string to her sweats. They fall to the
     floor.

47   INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - CECILE'S BEDROOM - DAY           47

     Mrs. Caldwell enters the room.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Cecile are you up yet? We're gonna to
               be late for the -

     She notices the bed is empty.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               Cecile?

     She walks over the bathroom door and knocks.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               Cecile?

                              CECILE (O.S.)
               I'm in the bath, mom.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs.
               Rosemond's before lunch.

                              CECILE (O.S.)
               Okay.

48   INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - CECILE'S BATHROOM - DAY          48

     Cecile stands in front of her mirror, crying. She applies
     make-up to several hickeys on her neck. She XXX down
     her shirt and grimaces. She sticks her finger the make-
     up bottle, then puts her hand down her shirt.

49   EXT. ESTATE - TERRACE - DAY                                49

     Aunt Helen, Annette, Mrs. Caldwell and Cecile are having
     lunch. Cecile is wearing a turtle neck.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               It was nice of you to invite us up
               for the weekend, Helen.

                              AUNT HELEN
               More the merrier.
                    (to Cecile)
               Is everything alright my dear?

                              CECILE
               I'm just not feeling well.

     Sebastian enters carrying his tennis racket.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Afternoon ladies.

     Cecile is stunned that he's there. Sebastian takes a
     seat at the table.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I didn't know you'd be here,
               Sebastian.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I wasn't planning on it, but being
               such a lovely day, why waste it in the
               city. Anyone for tennis?

     He looks at Cecile and strokes the shaft of his racket.

     Cecile stands and rushes into the house.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What's wrong with her?

     No one knows.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               Would you excuse me for a minute?

     Mrs. Caldwell follows her into the house.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (concerned)
               I hope she's alright.

                              AUNT HELEN
               I better go check on them.

     Aunt Helen stands and enters the house.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Alone again.
                    (beat)
               What are you up to today?

                              ANNETTE
               I'm doing some volunteer work.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Need any company?

                              ANNETTE
               You? Volunteer? I don't think so.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm
               trying to change here. You could be
               supportive.

                              ANNETTE
                    (smiling)
               Okay.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Babe, you're looking at the next Mother
               Teresa.

     Annette shakes her head and laughs.

50   INT. ESTATE - CECILE'S GUEST ROOM - DAY                    50

     Cecile talks on the phone.

                              CECILE
               Please. I need you. I don't know what
               to do. You're the only one I can talk
               to.

51   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 51

     Kathryn listens on the other end of the conversation.

                              KATHRYN
               I'll be there in a few hours.

     She hangs up the phone and smiles.

52   EXT. RETIREMENT HOME - DAY                                 52

     Establishing shot.

53   INT. RETIREMENT HOME - HALLWAY - DAY                       53

     A NURSE escorts Sebastian and Annette down the hall.

                              NURSE
               It's really nice when the young people
               help out. Most of our patients don't
               have any family nearby.

     They stop at a door and open it. An OLD MAN sits in his
     hospital bed.

                              NURSE (cont'd)
               Mister Gottlieb, we have a visitor for
               you.

     Sebastian starts to enter the room, when the nurse stops
     him.

                              NURSE (cont'd)
               Actually Sebastian, you're going to be
               spending the hour with Mrs. Sugarman.

     The Nurse escorts an unhappy Sebastian down the
     hall. Annette waves "bye bye" to him.

54   INT. RETIREMENT HOME - MR. GOTTLIEB'S ROOM - DAY           54

     Annette sits by Mister Gottlieb's bed and reads from a book
     of poetry.

55   INT. RETIREMENT HOME - MRS. SUGARMAN'S ROOM - DAY          55

     A senile MRS. SUGARMAN sits in bed, while Sebastian does
     a newspaper crossword puzzle and ignores her. He smokes
     a cigarette and flicks the ash into her bedpan which lies
     next to her on the bed.

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               Did I ever tell you the time when my
               late husband sent me -

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yes, you already did.

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               I did?

     Sebastian never takes his eyes off the paper.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Right after we played backgammon.

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               We played backgammon?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Uh huh. You beat me three times.

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               I did?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               Excuse me?

     He turns to her and extinguishes his cigarette.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I said, do you want some water?

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               Oh... no thank you...

     There's a knock at the door.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Come in.

     Annette and the nurse enter.

                              NURSE
               How we doing in here?

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               I won three games of backgammon.

     Sebastian smiles at Annette, who smiles back.

56   INT. PORSCHE - DAY                                         56

     Sebastian and Annette drive towards the estate.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It's weird. I actually feel good about
               myself. Can we do this again next week?

                              ANNETTE
               Oh please.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What?

                              ANNETTE
               "I actually feel good about myself?"

                              SEBASTIAN
               I do.

                              ANNETTE
               You must take me for a real idiot.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I don't.

                              ANNETTE
               You're going to tell me that you had a
               good time with the old lady.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I did. We played three games of backgammon
               and...

     She throws him a look.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Alright. I was bored out of my fucking
               mind. I hate doing charity.

                              ANNETTE
               That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad
               person.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yes it does.

                              ANNETTE
               No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being
               honest with me.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (sighs)
               I can't win with you.

                              ANNETTE
               It's not about winning. You know what
               your problem is? You take yourself way
               too seriously.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I do not.

                              ANNETTE
               Lighten up.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I am lighten. Can we drop this?

                              ANNETTE
               Fine.

     They drive on in silence. A smile comes over Annette's
     face. She turns to him, crosses her eyes and makes a
     face. Sebastian looks over.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What are you doing? Stop it, it's
               distracting.

     She holds the face. Sebastian starts to laugh.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Cut it out.

     He continues to laugh. She stops making the face.

                              ANNETTE
               Oh dear, are you actually laughing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               No.

                              ANNETTE
               No?

     She makes the face again. He laughs.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Stop that.

     She laughs with him.

                              ANNETTE
               There's hope for you, yet.

     She reaches out and holds his hand. He squeezes it.

57   INT. ESTATE - CECILE'S GUEST ROOM - DAY                    57

     Cecile lies in the bed. There's a knock on the door.

                              CECILE
               Who is it?

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               It's Kathryn.

     Cecile bolts up and unlocks the door. Kathryn stands
     there with a worried look on her face.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Are you okay?

                              CECILE
               No.

     Kathryn enters and locks the door behind her. Cecile is
     crying.

                              KATHRYN
               Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.

                              CECILE
               Something awful happened last night.

                              KATHRYN
               What do you mean?!

                              CECILE
               I... I don't think you want to know.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile, you have to tell me.

                              CECILE
               It involves your brother. He... took
               advantage of me.

                              KATHRYN
               Does your mother know?

                              CECILE
               If she knew, she'd kill me. It
               happened at your house last night.

                              KATHRYN
               Why didn't you do something?

                              CECILE
               I don't know.

                              KATHRYN
               So, let me get this straight. You
               came over to our house late last night
               and he forced intercourse on you.

                              CECILE
               Well... not exactly.

                              KATHRYN
               He made you give him a blow job.

                              CECILE
               No.

                              KATHRYN
               Well what then?

     Cecile waits a moment, then whispers in her ear.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               He ate you out?

                              CECILE
               If that's what you call it.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile, I think you're going to have
               a hard time crying rape if that's all
               he did.

                              CECILE
               What do I do then?

                              KATHRYN
               Well did you like it?

                              CECILE
               Well... I don't know - it was weird.
               At first it felt icky, then it felt
               kind of okay. Then, I started getting
               really hot and then I started shaking
               and then like, I don't t know... it
               felt like an explosion, but a good one.

     Kathryn laughs.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile, you had an orgasm.

                              CECILE
               I did?

                              KATHRYN
               I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a
               woman.

                              CECILE
               I am?

     Kathryn nods. Cecile embraces her, happy.

                              KATHRYN
               Now listen. Now that you're on your
               way, it would be stupid of you to stop.
               Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him
               instruct you.

                              CECILE
               I don't love him. I love Ronald.

                              KATHRYN
               So? Don't you want to make Ronald a
               happy pappy? Practice makes perfect,
               Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as
               many people as possible.

                              CECILE
               But that would make me a slut.
                    (beat)
               Wouldn't it?

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile, everybody does it. It's just
               that nobody talks about it.

     Cecile takes the information in.

                              CECILE
               It's like a secret society.

                              KATHRYN
               That's one way of looking at it.

                              CECILE
               Cool.

58   EXT. ESTATE - GARDEN - DAY                                 58

     Annette sits on the grass reading Gabriel Garcia
     Marquez's Love In The Time Of Cholera. She puts the book
     down and wipes a tear from her eye.

59   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - DAY                       59

     Sebastian peers out his window with a pair of binoculars.
     Kathryn enters his room.

                              KATHRYN
               I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I
               don't think she'll be giving you
               anymore problems.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yippy.

                              KATHRYN
               Who are you spying on?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Take a look for yourself.

     He hands the binoculars to Kathryn, who looks out the
     window.

                              KATHRYN
               That her?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yeah.

                              KATHRYN
               Jesus, she reeks of Laura Ashley.
                    (sarcastic)
               Oh, she's crying. Wittle baby's upset
               by the big bad book.

     Sebastian grabs the binoculars from her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Shut up.

                              KATHRYN
               What's your problem?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Nothing.

                              KATHRYN
               She's really getting to you, isn't
               she?

                              SEBASTIAN
               If you must know, yes. I don't know
               what to do. I can't stand that holier
               than thou bullshit and yet, I'm
               completely infatuated with her.
                    (beat)
               She made me laugh.

                              KATHRYN
               And that's why you're losing your bet?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm not losing the bet. It's just
               taking longer than I expected.

                              KATHRYN
               Do you mind if I take my new Porsche
               for a ride?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Kathryn, the only thing you're going to
               be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse
               me, I have some work to do.

     He storms out of the room.

60   EXT. ESTATE - GARDEN - DAY                                 60

     Sebastian walks over to Annette, who continues to read her
     book. She notices him and sets the book down.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Am I bothering you?

                              ANNETTE
               Not at all. Have a seat.

     He sits down next to her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Don't tell me you finished The
               Fountainhead already?

     She nods. He points to her book.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Great book. What's the guy's name,
               Florentino...

                              ANNETTE
               Florentino Ariza.

     Sebastian sticks his hand in his pocket and fiddles
     around.

                              SEBASTIAN
               My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend
               of Florentino.

                              ANNETTE
               Who's Monsieur Philipe?

                              SEBASTIAN
               You don't know Monsieur Philipe?

     Sebastian takes out a SOCK PUPPET.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
                    (low voice)
               Bonjour mademoiselle.

                              ANNETTE
                    (laughs)
               Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (Monsieur Philipe voice)
               You are very pretty. I would like to
               kiss you.

     The puppet kisses her on the cheek.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
                    (Monsieur Philipe voice)
               Oooo, that felt good.

                              ANNETTE
               Thank you.

     He kisses her on the cheek.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (Monsieur Philipe voice)
               That felt good too. I will kiss you
               all over.

     The puppet attacks a laughing Annette. She playfully
     grabs Sebastian and starts to tickle him. Sebastian
     tickles her back.

     They roll around on the ground until Sebastian lands on
     top of her. A moment of tense silence passes and
     Sebastian kisses her. The kissing intensifies until she
     pushes him off her.

     Sebastian stands.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I'm sorry about that.

                              ANNETTE
               I am too.

     He paces for a moment and his mood turns to anger.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You know what? I don't take it back.

                              ANNETTE
               Why are you doing this?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Because I'm in love with you.

                              ANNETTE
               I thought you said we were going to be
               friends.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I can't handle it. I can't keep my
               feelings bottled up like you. Can you
               honestly tell me that you feel nothing
               for me? ... Tell me!

                              ANNETTE
               I have feelings for you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Then what's wrong? I love you Annette.
               It's not like you have a husband,
               unless your married to Jesus.

                              ANNETTE
               That's not fair.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why can't we be together?

     Annette's eyes well up with tears.

                              ANNETTE
               You really want to know?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yes.

                              ANNETTE
               It's because I don't trust myself with
               you.
                    (beat)
               I took a vow and because of you I'm
               tempted to break it. Don't destroy that
               for me. Please.

     She hurries off.

61   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - DAY                       61

     Sebastian enters the room and slams the door behind him.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (frustrated)
               Shit.

     He hears the shower running from the bathroom.

62   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S BATHROOM - DAY                   62

     Sebastian enters the room. Cecile sticks her head out
     from the shower curtain.

                              CECILE
               Want to join me?

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (indifferent)
               Some other time, Cecile.

     He leaves the room. Cecile looks confused. A moment
     passes and Sebastian re-enters taking off his clothes.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What am I, an idiot?

     Cecile smiles.

63   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - NIGHT                     63

     Sebastian and Cecile lie in bed. Sebastian smokes a
     cigarette and writes in his journal.

                              CECILE
               Am I suppose to be this sore?

                              SEBASTIAN
               For the first time, yes. It'll pass.

     A moment of silence.

                              CECILE
               I like it better when I'm on top.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Cecile. This is what I like to call
               quiet time. This is time when we
               reflect on what we've done.

                              CECILE
               I'm sorry.

     She looks at the troubled expression on Sebastian's face.

                              CECILE (cont'd)
               Something's bothering you?

                              SEBASTIAN
               You think?

                              CECILE
               Is it me?

                              SEBASTIAN
               No, you were fine.

     SEBASTIAN'S P.O.V. - He looks out on the balcony, where
     Kathryn is eavesdropping. They make eye contact and she
     waves.

                              CECILE
               It's that girl, Annette.

     He stands and walks over to the balcony, where he closes
     the blinds.

                              CECILE (cont'd)
               You love her, don't you? It's okay.
               I don't love you either. I love Ronald.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm getting out of here.

     Sebastian heads to the bathroom.

                              CECILE
               Where are you going?

                              SEBASTIAN (O.S.)
               I'm taking a shower.

                              CECILE
               Need any company?

                              SEBASTIAN (O.S.)
               No.

                              CECILE
               Want a blow job?

                              SEBASTIAN (O.S.)
               Good night Cecile.

                              CECILE
                    (under her breath)
               Prude.

64   INT. ESTATE - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT                 64

     Annette is reading in bed. There's a knock on the door.

                              ANNETTE
               Come in.

     Sebastian enters the room.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I just came to say goodbye.

                              ANNETTE
               Where are you going?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Back to the city. I may take off to
               Europe for the rest of the summer. I
               just can't handle it around here.

                              ANNETTE
               I think that's for the best.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Good for you.

                              ANNETTE
               Sebastian, please. I don't want us to
               end on bad terms.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well, I'm afraid you don't have a
               choice in the matter. You make me
               sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't
               associate with hypocrites.

     Annette's eyes well up with tears.

                              ANNETTE
               How am I a hypocrite?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh please Annette. You spend all your
               time preaching about waiting for love.
               Well here it is. Right in front of you,
               but you're going to turn your back on
               it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age
               where we can get married. If we were,
               I'd propose, but that's not going to
               happen. So I guess we're just fucked.
               I'll move on, but you... you're going
               to have to live with yourself knowing
               you've turned your back on love. And
               that makes you a hypocrite.

     Sebastian heads to the door.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Have a nice life.

     Annette races toward him and throws her arms around him.

                              ANNETTE
                    (sobbing)
               Please don't go.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Get off me.

     She kisses him passionately.

                              ANNETTE
               I... I want you.

     Sebastian embraces her and draws her over to the bed.

     She lies down and starts to unbutton her dress. Sebastian
     stands over her watches her. Her crying does not let up
     as she continues to undress.

     Sebastian stands, stunned and watches her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm sorry, I can't.

     A pained look crosses her face. Sebastian leaves the
     room and closes the door.

65   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - NIGHT                     65

     Sebastian closes the door and leans against it.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Shit.

     He wipes his eyes, which are starting to water. He goes
     over to a mirror at looks at himself.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Get it together you pussy.

     A stern look comes over his face. He smiles, then walks
     away.

66   EXT. ESTATE - FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY                         66

     A cab pulls up to the house. The front door opens and a
     crying Annette quickly leaves the house and climbs into
     the cab. She closes the door and the cab pulls away from
     the house. WE PAN up to a second story window where
     Kathryn is looking down and smiling.

67   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - DAY                       67

     Sebastian lies sleeping in his bed. His journal lies
     beside him. A FEATHER tickles his nose. He stirs awake
     and looks up to see Kathryn staring down at him.

                              KATHRYN
               Morning!

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (sarcastic)
               Morning.

                              KATHRYN
               So? How'd it go last night?

                              SEBASTIAN
               With who?

                              KATHRYN
               Well I know how it went with Cecile.
               She won't shut up about it. How'd it
               go with Mrs. Jesus?

     Sebastian sits up in bed.

                              SEBASTIAN
               If your asking if I nailed her the
               answer is no.

                              KATHRYN
               She shot you down.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Exactly the opposite.

                              KATHRYN
               So what went wrong?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I don't know. She was lying on the bed,
               ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I
               was... I just didn't feel right about
               it.

                              KATHRYN
               You're telling me you had the chance to
               fuck her and you didn't. God are you a
               chump.

                              SEBASTIAN
               A momentary lapse of judgment, soon to
               be rectified.

     He climbs out of bed and puts on his robe. He starts out
     the door, when -

                              KATHRYN
               If you're heading towards her room, you
               won't find her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Where is she?

                              KATHRYN
               You don't know?
                    (big smile)
               She left thirty minutes ago.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Where'd she go?

                              KATHRYN
               She wouldn't say. She apologized to
               your aunt and told her she was going
               to stay with some friends.
                    (beat)
               You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has
               come to her senses and she will never
               go near you again.

     Sebastian throws off the robe and starts to dress.

                              SEBASTIAN
               We'll see about that.

68   INT. GREG'S DORM ROOM - DAY                                68

     A shrine to hot babes, who's posters adorn the walls. Greg
     is busy dumping muscle magazines, several issues of Teen
     Beat and some Musical Theater CDs into a trash bag when the
     phone rings. He answers it.

                              GREG
               Hello.

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:

69   EXT. HIGHWAY/INT. PORSCHE - DAY                            69

     Sebastian is talking on his cell phone.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Is she with you?

                              GREG
               Who is this?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?

                              GREG
               No.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Where is she?!

                              GREG
               I don't know. Why don't you leave her
               alone.

                              SEBASTIAN
               McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in
               two seconds if you don't tell me where
               she is.

                              GREG
               I told you I don't know.

                              SEBASTIAN
               One.

                              GREG
               Alright. She's staying with some
               friends of her parents. The O'Sheas.
               She caught the train twenty minutes ago
               into Grand Central.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Grand Central. You better not be
               fucking with me cause it's your ass on
               the line.

     Sebastian clicks off his cell phone.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Motherfucker.

     He bangs on his dashboard.

70   EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY                                         70

     The Porsche weaves in and out of traffic on it's way to
     the city.

71   INT. TRAIN CONCOURSE - DAY                                 71

     A group of passengers exit the train. Annette is among
     them. She stops when she SEES -

     Sebastian, standing in the distance.

     Annette stops in her tracks. She drops her bag, rushes
     over to him and embraces him. Sebastian's cruel demeanor
     drops, when he realizes how happy she is to see him. He
     looks her in the eyes and smiles. They kiss.

72   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         72

     Sebastian carries a laughing Annette into the room. They
     continue to kiss and he carries her over to the table.

     He sets her down and accidentally knocks over a lamp.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ooops.

     They both laugh. They kiss some more, then start to
     unbutton each other's clothes. Sebastian struggles with
     her pants' button.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Fuck this.

     He picks her up again and moves to the bed. They
     collapse on the bed and he accidently falls off it.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Suave.

     Annette cracks up. Sebastian reaches up and YANKS her
     down on top of him. They both laugh, then kiss.

74   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       74

     Annette sits on the windowsill watching Sebastian as he
     sleeps. He slowly starts to wake and looks at her.

                              ANNETTE
               Hi.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Hi.

     She walks over to him and kisses him.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               You alright?

                              ANNETTE
               I'm fine. I have to get going to my
               friends' house.
                    (beat)
               Was it --

                              SEBASTIAN
               It was perfect.

     She smiles and holds her hand out. He takes her hand in
     his.

75   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT                   75

     Annette closes the door to the bedroom and walks down the
     hall passing a mirror on the wall. In the mirror's
     REFLECTION is Kathryn, looking very angry.

77   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                     77

     Sook-Hee carries a bundle of folded laundry down the
     hall. Sebastian enters the hallway from his bedroom. He
     grabs her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You work way to hard. Here.
                    (hands her a wad of money)
               Take the day off. Merry Christmas.

     Sook-Hee smiles and moves on. Sebastian continues down
     the hall. He passes Kathryn's door and hear noises.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               Slower.

     Sebastian leans against the door.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               A little to the left. Look, pretend
               like you're writing the alphabet.
               A... B... mmm, stay on B.

     Sebastian knocks on the door.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               One second.

     Sebastian hears some fumbling then a door close from
     inside the bedroom.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               Come in.

78   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - DAY           78

     Sebastian enters the room, to find Kathryn lying in bed,
     wearing only her bathrobe.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Bad time?

                              KATHRYN
               Kind of.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well, you obviously wanted me to
               witness your little adventure or else
               you wouldn't have invited me in.

     Sebastian walks toward the closet.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Who is our little friend so
               inexperienced that you have to resort
               to the alphabet game?

     He throws open the closet door. Ronald stands there
     covering his genitals with his hands.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Well, well, well.

                              RONALD
               It's not what it seems like.

     Ronald picks up his clothes. As he leaves:

                              SEBASTIAN
               Say hi to Cecile.

     Ronald's head drops as he closes the door behind him.

                              KATHRYN
                    (calling out)
               Call me.

     Sebastian throws Kathryn a look.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               You can't have all the fun.

     Sebastian sits on the bed.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               You seem to be in a good mood.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I am.

     A big grin appears on Sebastian's face

                              KATHRYN
               You didn't?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh yes.

                              KATHRYN
               Tell me all the details.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It was... Fantastic.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh come on. For her first time?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I know. That's the amazing part of
               it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du
               Soleil acrobatics, just standard
               missionary stuff, but it was... ah
               forget it. I'm going to sound like a
               Hallmark card.

                              KATHRYN
               No, tell me.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It was... it was like the emotional
               part outweighed the physical part.

                              KATHRYN
               Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear
               the birds chirping.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Mock, mock, mock.

     She places her hand on his crotch.

                              KATHRYN
               So I assume you've come here to make
               some arrangements.

     Sebastian stands.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Some other time.

                              KATHRYN
               Excuse me?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm not in the mood.

                              KATHRYN
               And that's why you're leaving?

                              SEBASTIAN
               It clearly is why.

                              KATHRYN
               I want to fuck.

                              SEBASTIAN
               And I don't.

     He leaves and slams the door behind him.

79   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         79

     Sebastian talks on the phone.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'll pick you up in an hour. I love
               you too.

     He hangs up the phone. Kathryn stands in the doorway.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.

                              SEBASTIAN
               No, I'm not.

                              KATHRYN
               P-whipped, p-whipped.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What's wrong with you? Why are you
               acting this way?

     Kathryn starts to cry.

                              KATHRYN
               I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're
               in love with her. You don't love me
               anymore.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a
               contest.

                              KATHRYN
               At first it was, but now it's become
               something bigger.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Kathryn, you know I love you. I've
               always loved you.

                              KATHRYN
               Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I can't believe you're reacting this
               way. You're just saying this because
               you lost the bet.

                              KATHRYN
               Is that what you think?

     He nods. Kathryn sits down on his bed. She slips her
     underwear off from under her bathrobe and tosses it
     aside, spreading her legs.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Alright, come on, let's get it over
               with. But mark my words, this is the
               only time it'll happen.

     She picks up the phone.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Whenever you're ready. Just stick it in
               me. While you're doing that I'm gonna
               make some phone calls.

                              SEBASTIAN
               That's not fair. You're taking all the
               fun out of it.

                              KATHRYN
               Then do me a favor and get rid of her.
               If not for me, then do it for you.
               Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's
               turned you into jelly. What do you want
               to be, one of those losers who walk
               down the halls holding hands and
               smiling. People used to respect you.
               They feared you and now you're going to
               throw that all away.

     Sebastian stares at her, lost in thought.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Poor Sebastian. He used to be cool, but
               now he's just another love-struck
               faggot. One of the many.

80   EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY                                80

     A taxi drives down the street.

81   INT. TAXI - DAY                                            81

     Kathryn and Sebastian sit in the back seat. Her arm is
     around his. Sebastian looks nervous.

                              KATHRYN
               Why so nervous?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I've never done this before.

                              KATHRYN
               How have you dumped girls in the past?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Screening calls. Any suggestions?

                              KATHRYN
               I knew this guy last summer in the
               Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the
               time were madly in love with each
               other. But she had this huge weight
               problem. His friends taunted him
               mercilessly about it. You know, "How
               do you breathe when she sits on your
               face?" "It's embarrassing for you to
               be seen with her." Finally he couldn't
               take it anymore and decided to dump
               her. She flipped and he went on the
               defensive. I distinctly remember him
               saying the same thing over and over
               again. "I'm completely fucked up."
               "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm
               completely fucked up."
                    (beat)
               Poor fatty never had a chance.

82   EXT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY                       82

     The cab pulls up to the curb. Sebastian gets out and
     heads into the building. Kathryn leans out the window.

                              KATHRYN
               Don't be weak.

     The cab drives off.

83   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY             83

     Sebastian rings the doorbell. A woman (MRS. O'SHEA)
     answers the door.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Hi. Is Annette at home?

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               You must be Sebastian. I've heard such
               nice things about you.

     He smiles.

                              MRS. O'SHEA (cont'd)
                    (calling out)
               Annette.
                    (to Sebastian)
               Come on in.

84   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - FOYER - DAY                        84

     Sebastian closes the door behind him. Annette enters the
     room.

                              ANNETTE
               Hi.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Hi.

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               Well, I'm going to head back to the
               kitchen. You two have fun.

     Mrs. O'Shea mouths "He's cute" to Annette. Annette
     smiles and nods. Mrs. O'Shea leaves the room.

                              ANNETTE
               Would you like a tour?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sure.

     She takes his hand and leads him down the hall.

85   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - DAY         85

     They enter a guest room.

                              ANNETTE
               And this is my room.

     She closes the door behind them. She smiles and kisses
     him.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               You think we can be quiet?

     She embraces him. Sebastian remains lifeless.

                              SEBASTIAN
               This isn't working out for me anymore.

                              ANNETTE
                    (smiling)
               Yeah, me neither.

     She looks him in the eye and can tell he's not joking.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               What's wrong?

                              SEBASTIAN
               It's not you, it's me. I'm completely
               fucked up.

                              ANNETTE
               What are you saying?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why aren't you understanding?

                              ANNETTE
               I love you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I know. I wish I felt the same.
               Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think
               it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm
               completely fucked up.

     Annette bursts into tears.

                              ANNETTE
               Why are you trying to hurt me?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm just being honest. I just wanted to
               see what you were like in bed.

     She attacks him but he grabs her hands and fends her off.
     He pushes her against the wall and covers her mouth with
     his hand.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Shh! Shh! I don't think Mrs. O'Shea
               would appreciate you acting like a
               total psychopath.

     She slinks to the ground and continues to sob.

                              ANNETTE
               You don't know how to love.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You don't even know me. The fact of the
               matter is there is some one I love.
               She's smarter, prettier... you don't
               even compare to her. The only reason I
               am here is because she wants us to be
               exclusive.

                              ANNETTE
               But you knew this was important to me.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What, your virginity? Well that's over
               now.

     Annette clutches her stomach and continues to sob. He moves
     towards her.

                              ANNETTE
               Please go.

     He opens the door.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sorry. I'm completely fucked up.

     He leaves and closes the door behind him. Annette
     continues to sob.

86   EXT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - DAY                               86

     A cab driver carries several shopping bags out of a cab.

87   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                     87

     Kathryn walks down the hallway and enters her room.

88   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - DAY           88

     The room is dark. Kathryn flips on the light.

                              KATHRYN
               Jesus.

     Sebastian is sitting in a chair, wearing his shades,
     journal in hand.

                              KATHRYN
               A little melodramatic, don't you think.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I have a flair for drama.

                              KATHRYN
               Mind if I ask what you're doing in my
               room?

                              SEBASTIAN
               You wanted an answer to your question.

                              KATHRYN
               Annette?

     He takes off his glasses. We can tell he has been
     crying.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Devastated beyond repair. I doubt
               she'll ever trust a man again.

                              KATHRYN
               Well done.

     He holds up a bottle of champagne.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I thought we should celebrate.

                              KATHRYN
               I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm
               expecting some company.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ronald?

                              KATHRYN
               Not that it's any of your business but
               yes.

     Sebastian holds up a letter.

                              SEBASTIAN
               From Ronald.

     Kathryn takes the letter.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I haven't had a chance to read it, but
               I'm sure it goes something like "yahdah
               yahdah yahdah you mean a lot to me.
               Yahdah yahdah yahdah I hope we can be
               friends. Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera."
               You see, I expected your sort of
               bullshit so I took the liberty of
               phoning Ronald and Cecile. Right now
               they're having a little get together
               in my love shack at the Grand Central
               Hyatt. I'm so sorry he chose Cecile
               over you, but I promised him I would
               see you through your crisis.

                              KATHRYN
               Well done.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Thank you. Now, where were we?

     POP goes the champagne cork.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Oh yeah, the celebration.

     He reaches down and picks up two glasses. He fills them
     and hands one to Kathryn.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What shall we toast to?

                              KATHRYN
               To my triumph, of course.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Not my choice of toast, but it's your
               call. To your triumph over Annette.

     Kathryn giggles.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What's so funny?

                              KATHRYN
               Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her.
               It's over you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Come again?

                              KATHRYN
               You were very much in love with her and
               you're still in love with her. But it
               amused me to make you ashamed of it.
               You gave up on the first person you
               ever loved because I called you names.
               Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that
               you chose me over her, but please
               understand, I never loved you,
               Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little
               toy I play with. And now you've
               completely blown it with her. I think
               that's the saddest thing I've ever
               heard.
                    (smiles)
               Cheers.

     She clicks his glass and drinks. Sebastian doesn't
     drink. He looks ill.

                              SEBASTIAN
               In any event, you still owe me my
               reward.

                              KATHRYN
               I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't
               fuck losers.

     Sebastian slaps her across the face.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               You motherfucker!

     She grabs him and starts throwing wild punches. They
     fall to the ground.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Nobody hits me.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Calm down.

     He rolls on top of her and pins her to the ground.

                              KATHRYN
               Get off me!

                              SEBASTIAN
               Will you calm down?

                              KATHRYN
               Fine! Get off me!

     He stands and gives her a hand up. They both catch their
     breaths.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.

                              KATHRYN
               I accept. Now get out.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Get out? We had an arrangement.

                              KATHRYN
               Didn't you hear what I said?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I don't care what you said, we had an
               agreement. You've slept with half of
               the borough so don't tell me you're
               being choosy.

                              KATHRYN
                    (screaming)
               Get out!

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm giving you to the count of three to
               plop your ass down on the bed.

                              KATHRYN
               And if I don't?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Then I will consider it a declaration
               of war. One. Two... three.

                              KATHRYN
               I think you have your answer.

                              SEBASTIAN
               War it is.

     He grabs his journal, leaves and SLAMS the door behind
     him.

89   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         89

     Sebastian paces while talking on the phone.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It's desperate that I talk to her.

                              MRS. O'SHEA (O.S.)
               I've already told you, she's not home.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well please leave a message that I
               called.

                              MRS. O'SHEA (O.S.)
               I'll do that.

     He hangs up the phone and THROWS it into a mirror, which
     SMASHES.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Shit.

     He collapses on his bed and buries his face in his hands.
     Exhausted he looks up and sees his journal lying on the
     floor. He picks it up and flips through it.

90   EXT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                     90

     Sebastian walks down the street carrying a small package.
     He enters an apartment building.

91   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT           91

     Sebastian rings the doorbell. Mrs. O'Shea answers the
     door.

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               What do you want?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I need to talk to Annette.

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               She's not here.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you know where she is?

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               She's out.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you know when she'll be back?

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               Later. Listen, we're entertaining
               some guests so -

                              SEBASTIAN
               Annette! Annette!

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               Young man, I already told you she's
               not here.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Fine. Could you please see that she
               gets this.

     He hands her the package.

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               I'll do that.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It's really important.

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               I understand. Good night.

     She closes the door.

92   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - FOYER - NIGHT                      92

     Mrs O'Shea turns away from the door towards Annette,
     who stands in the hallway.

93   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT         93

     Kathryn sits in a chair doing her nails. She checks her
     watch, takes a moment and makes herself upset. She picks
     up the phone and dials.

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:

94   INT. RONALD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              94

     Ronald is sleeping. The phone rings. He awakens and
     answers it.

                              RONALD
               Hello.

                              KATHRYN
                    (voice cracking)
               Ronald?

                              RONALD
               Yeah?

                              KATHRYN
               It's Kathryn.

     Ronald sits up, nervous.

                              RONALD
               Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?

                              KATHRYN
               No.

     She cries.

                              RONALD
               What's wrong?

                              KATHRYN
               It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.

                              RONALD
               What do you mean?

                              KATHRYN
               I think he's high on drugs. He hit me,
               then took off. I'm afraid to be alone.
               Please come over.

                              RONALD
               I'll be right there.

     He hangs up the phone and grabs his pants

                                                       BACK TO:

95   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - DAY           95

     Kathryn hangs up the phone. She instantly becomes calm and
     returns to doing her nails.

96   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT       96

     Annette sits and stares at Sebastian's package.

     She picks it up and opens it. She takes out a journal
     and a letter. She opens the letter and reads it.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               Dear Annette. Thank you for reading
               this letter. I don't know what I can
               possibly say to rectify the harm I have
               caused you. For once in my life I'm at
               a loss for words.

97   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       97

     Sebastian sits at his desk, writing the letter.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               The truth of the matter is that being
               with you was the only time I have ever
               been happy. My whole life has been a
               joke. I prided myself on taking joy in
               others' misery.

98   INT. MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT (MONTAGE)                    98

     Sebastian walks the streets of New York. He seems sad
     and lonely.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               Well, it finally backfired. I succeeded
               in hurting the first person I loved. I
               wish more than anything I could take it
               back, but I guess that's not possible.

99   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT       99

     Annette continues to read the letter.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               Enclosed is my most prized possession...
               my journal. For a long time I
               considered it my trophy. A sordid
               collection of my conquests. If you
               really want to know the truth, then
               please read it. No more lies.

100  EXT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                     100

     We PAN down the side of the building to the ground.
     Sebastian lies against the building waiting for Annette
     to return.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               A car is picking me up tomorrow and
               taking me to Martha's Vineyard, where
               we have a summer home. Nothing would
               make me happier than if you joined me.
               I'm a fucking wreck without you. If
               you're interested please meet me
               outside my building at nine. If not, I
               understand. Love, Sebastian.

101  INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT               101

     Ronald sits and listens as a grieving Kathryn tells her
     story.

                              KATHRYN
               And when I confronted him about his
               affair with Cecile he told me it was
               none of my business. Then when I said
               "Well what about Ronald," he said you
               were nothing more than a stupid... the
               n word and that you deserved what you
               got...

                              RONALD
               And this happened before you and I
               hooked up?

                              KATHRYN
               It's been going on for a while.
                    (beat)
               Then he called me a disgrace to our
               family and that's when he hit me.

                              RONALD
               Racist piece of shit.

                              KATHRYN
               I'd be careful if I were you. God knows
               what he's up to.

                              RONALD
               He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass
               in.

                              KATHRYN
               Will you stay here for the night? You
               can leave in the morning. That's when
               my parents get back and --

                              RONALD
               Don't worry about it. I'll stay.

     Kathryn hugs him.

                              KATHRYN
               Thanks Ronald. You're a good friend.

102  EXT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY                       102

     A STREET CLEANING MACHINE drives past the apartment

103  INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY               103

     Sebastian lies sleeping on a sofa in the lobby. The
     NIGHT DOORMAN taps him awake.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What time is it?

                              NIGHT DOORMAN
               Eight o'clock. You got to go.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Did she show up?

                              NIGHT DOORMAN
               Nope.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you mind if I check upstairs?

                              NIGHT DOORMAN
               I can't have you do that, nor can I
               have you hanging around the lobby all
               day.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I understand. Thanks for letting me
               crash here.

                              NIGHT DOORMAN
               Don't worry about it.

     Sebastian stands and staggers out of the building.

104  EXT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - DAY                               104

     Ronald walks out of the building and heads toward the
     corner.

     He stops when he SEES - Sebastian crossing the street.

                              RONALD
                    (under his breath)
               Son of a bitch.

     Sebastian walks toward Ronald, who blocks his path.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Sebastian!

     Sebastian looks up at Ronald.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (tired)
               Hey Ronald.

                              RONALD
               It seems that you and I have some
               talking to do.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Can we do it later. I've had a really
               bad night and -

     Ronald SHOVES Sebastian.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What's your problem?

                              RONALD
               Where the hell do you come off hitting
               women?

                              SEBASTIAN
               What are you talking about?

                              RONALD
               Kathryn. Did you hit her?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?

                              RONALD
               Did you hit her?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ronald, you don't know what you're
               talking about.

                              RONALD
               Don't know what I'm talking about? I
               know that you fucked Cecile.

     Sebastian says nothing.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               It's true, isn't it?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ronald, I'm sorry.

                              RONALD
               You bastard!

     Ronald TACKLES Sebastian to the ground. Ronald lands on
     top of him and hits in the mouth.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               I trusted you!

     Ronald hits him again. Blood pours out of Sebastian's
     mouth. Sebastian is dazed. Ronald grabs him by the
     collar.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               I trusted you!

     Sebastian takes a moment to catch his breath.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Fuck you.

     He knees Ronald in the groin. Ronald screams in pain and
     falls over. Sebastian climbs to his feet.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Why don't you give me a chance to
               explain.

     Sebastian kicks him in the ass. Ronald falls over.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Don't you get it? We were all part of
               her game.

     Sebastian pins him to the ground. Ronald struggles.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I'm gonna let you up, but you have to
               give me a chance to explain. Understood?

     Ronald nods. Sebastian releases him and Ronald catches
     his breath. Sebastian looks up and SEES -

     Annette, standing across the street, witnessing the
     event.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Annette!

     Sebastian stands and races over to her, blindly crossing
     the street.

     Annette notices a speeding cab and -

                              ANNETTE
                    (pointing)
               Sebastian!

     Sebastian looks up just as -- WHAM! The taxi HITS him
     dead on, sending him flying over the car and onto the
     street.

     Annette SCREAMS. The cab SKIDS to a stop. Annette runs
     into the street and over to Sebastian, who lies in shock,
     He sees her and grabs her hand. She starts to cry.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm okay. I'm okay.

     Ronald and the Cab driver run over to them.

                              ANNETTE
               Get an ambulance!

     The cab driver races back to his car. Sebastian looks up
     at Annette.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               We're getting you to a hospital.

     Sebastian nods.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Holy shit.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               You're gonna be fine.

     Sebastian nods.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm sorry.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               It's alright.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm okay. Everything's good.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

105  INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 105

     Blaine, twenty high-school girls and several friends of
     the family are dressed in black, making polite conversation
     and consoling Sebastian's parents and his Aunt Helen.

     Mrs. Caldwell stands in the corner with Cecile and her
     husband, MR. CALDWELL.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Sad, sad, sad. To think of the
               opportunities that boy had. This should
               be a lesson to us all that our children
               need constant supervision.

     She puts her arm around Cecile.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (CONT'D)
               It's all about quality time.

106  INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         106

     Annette enters Sebastian's room, now cleaned up. She
     walks around the room, taking it in, then approaches the
     window. She stares out of it for a moment.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               He loved that view.

     Annette turns and sees Kathryn at the door. She enters
     the room.

                              ANNETTE
               I can see why.

     Kathryn extends her hand.

                              KATHRYN
               I'm Kathryn.

                              ANNETTE
               Annette Harrison.

     They shake.

                              KATHRYN
               Have we met?

                              ANNETTE
               I don't think so.

                              KATHRYN
               Did you know Sebastian well?

                              ANNETTE
               You might say that.

                              KATHRYN
               Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your
               father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.

                              ANNETTE
               That's right.

                              KATHRYN
               I'm sure you're going to love it there.

     Annette nods.

                              KATHRYN
               Are you okay?

                              ANNETTE
               I'll be fine.

                              KATHRYN
                    (beat)
               Well, I'll leave you alone now. I just
               came in here to get something of mine.

     Kathryn walks over to Sebastian's desk and takes the keys
     to his Porsche. She goes to leave, when she turns back to
     Annette.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               You sure you're going to be alright?
               I'm here if you need a friend.

                              ANNETTE
               Thank you.

                              KATHRYN
               Look, I know this sounds corny, but
               whenever I feel like I can't go on I...
                    (takes out her crucifix)
               turn to Jesus and he helps me through
               the problem. Call me an anachronism,
               but -

                              ANNETTE
               Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.

                              KATHRYN
               Excuse me?

                              ANNETTE
               You heard me.

                              KATHRYN
               Who the hell do you think you are
               coming into my house and saying those
               things to me. My brother is dead, have
               some respect.

                              ANNETTE
               Kathryn, I know all about you and
               Sebastian.

                              KATHRYN
               Sebastian was a pathological liar. I
               wouldn't believe a word he -

                              ANNETTE
               I have his journal.

                              KATHRYN
               You what?

                              ANNETTE
               His journal. He sent it to me the day
               before he died. Everything about you is
               in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs,
               the menages, your bout with bulimia,
               the affair you had with your guidance
               counselor and how he gave you... eww.
               Let's see, then there's your coke
               problem... You still keep it in your
               crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.

                              KATHRYN
               You didn't show it to anybody?

                              ANNETTE
               Actually, I was planning on running
               down to Kinkos. Do you think you could
               give me ride?

                              KATHRYN
               You can't do this to me. It could ruin
               me.

                              ANNETTE
                    (smiling)
               I know.

     Kathryn starts to cry.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               Kathryn, please. Crying? Didn't you
               once say that crying is a sign of
               weakness? I'm very disappointed in you.

     Kathryn continues to sob.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               Alright, stop crying. There's a bright
               side to this you know.

     Annette puts a comforting arm around her.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               You're going to be my pet project next
               year. You're going to do what I tell
               you to do, wear what I tell you to
               wear. You're going to befriend the
               unpopular, sleep with the insecure.
               Think of the social ramifications it
               will cause. You and I are going to turn
               this school around. And do you know why
               you're going to do it?
                    (beat)
               Cause your ass is mine.

     Annette grabs Kathryn by the face, KISSES her forcefully
     on the mouth, then shoves her back. Kathryn looks at her
     in horror.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               We'll be in touch.

     She winks at Kathryn then leaves.

     CLOSE ON: Kathryn. She sits down on Sebastian's bed,
     utterly defeated.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               Forgot something.

     Annette steps back into frame and takes the car keys out
     of Kathryn's hands.

107  INT. PORSCHE - DAY                                         107

     Annette races down the highway. She opens up the glove
     compartment and rifles through some cassettes. She takes
     out The Carpenter's Greatest Hits and inserts it.

     CUE UP: The Carpenter's singing "Goodbye To Love."

     Annette reaches down and takes out Sebastian's
     sunglasses. She puts them on and checks herself out in
     the rear-view mirror. A grin crosses her face.

108  EXT. WESTSIDE HIGHWAY - AERIAL POV. - DAY                  108

     We MOVE off the Porsche and ascend into the air. The
     Porsche weaves through traffic as it disappears into a
     sea of cars. WE SEE the Manhattan skyline in the background
     as WE -

                                                       FADE OUT.

    As all things do, it begins in the dark. EYES blink
    open. Blue eyes. The first thing they see is a WOMAN
    near 40, standing looking out a window, watching the wind
    blowing, rattling a window.

                            A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
              What are you looking at?

                            CAROLINE
              The wind, Mother... They say a
              hurricane is on its way... You've
              been asleep... I was waiting to
              see you...

1   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT          1

    Now we see we're in a hospital room with layers of white
    enamel paint trying without success to hide the years...
    An old WOMAN, past 80, withered, still regal with a green
    turban around her bald head is propped by pillows, her
    blue eyes looking out at us from her bed... She's
    connected to an intravenous for sustenance and a morphine
    drip... Her name, is DAISY FULLER. She speaks with a
    Southern lilt.

                            DAISY
              If it wasn't for hurricanes we
              wouldn't have a hurricane season.

                            CAROLINE
              I've forgotten what the weather
              can be like here. I've lived with
              four seasons so many years now.

    We see a young Black Woman, a "caregiver," DOROTHY BAKER,
    in a corner, thumbing a magazine, with one eye at the
    window...

                            DOROTHY BAKER
              I saw on the news they're
              predicting trouble...

                            DAISY
              1928 they stacked people like
              firewood to close a hole in a
              levee.

    But Daisy has other things on her mind... murmuring...

                               DAISY (CONT'D)
                 It all runs together... like a
                 fingerpainting... I feel like I'm
                 on a boat, drifting...

                               CAROLINE
                      (tenderly)
                 Can I do anything for you, Mother?
                 Make anything easier?

                                DAISY
                 Hmmm. There is nothing to do,
                 Caroline. This is what it is...
                 I'm finding it harder to keep my
                 eyes open... my mouth all filled
                 with cotton...

    And agitated, feeling confined, she scratches at her
    nightgown as if it were sticking to her... she starts to take
    it off... Dorothy gets up and straightens it for her.

                               DOROTHY BAKER
                 There, there, Miss Daisy... you'll
                 scratch yourself to ribbons...
                      (to Caroline)
                 It's their way of letting go...
                      (the finality)
                 ...prob'ly today.

    Caroline is well aware of it, but the words, her
    admonition of death being so close at hand, makes
    everything even more present...

                               CAROLINE
                 Do you want more medication,
                 Mother? The doctor said you can
                 have all you want.

    Daisy is quiet, looking into the distance. Caroline,
    seeking closure, sits on the bed with her and starts to
    cry. Daisy puts her thin arms around her daughter,
    comforting her.

                               CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                 A friend told me she never had a
                 chance to say goodbye to her
                 mother.
                      (grateful to have the
                       chance)
                 I wanted to thank you, Mother, for
                 bringing me into this world. For
                 raising me so well.

              I wanted to tell you how much
              you've meant to me. I'm going to
              miss you so much...

    They hold each other for some time... They separate...
    And there's an awkwardness they have nothing left to talk
    about... nothing left to say to each other... a hole in
    their relationship... Caroline fills it with the eternal
    question...

                            CAROLINE (CONT'D)
              Are you afraid?

                             DAISY
              Curious.   What comes next...

    She winces at some physical pain.

                            DOROTHY BAKER
              The pain's coming more steadily...
              Her breathing will falter soon...
              No need for her to suffer..

    She raises the morphine level... Daisy closes her eyes...
    drifting with the morphine... and a thought, a dream, a
    sound, crosses her mind... and she says...

                            DAISY
              They built that train station in
              1918. Your father was there the
              day it opened... He said a tuba
              band was playing...Oom-pah-pah...

2   EXT. THE NEW TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918         2

    And we see a TUBA BAND is playing while a ribbon cutting
    ceremony is taking place across the steps of the new
    TRAIN STATION...

                            DAISY
              Oom-pah-pah, oom-pah-pah...The
              finest clockmaker in all of the
              South built that clock...

3   INT. CLOCKMAKER'S SHOP, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1917           3

    We see an old French Quarter storefront with an endless
    array of clocks and watches...

                            DAISY'S (V.O.)
              His name was Mr. Gateau. Mr.
              Cake.

                                                                3A.



4   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT       4

    The slightest of smiles crosses Daisy's lips... saying to
    herself again... "Mr. Cake..."

5   INT. CLOCKMAKER'S SHOP, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT       5

    We see a diminutive man in a frock coat with small,
    delicate hands, "Mr. Cake," working in his downstairs
    workshop. More than a few clocks stroke midnight, a
    handsome Creole Woman comes into the workshop...




                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                                   4.

5   CONTINUED:                                                     5

                               DAISY'S (V.O.)
                 He was married to a Creole of
                 Evangeline Parish and they had a
                 son.

    Taking his arm, she helps him up to show him to his bed.

                               DAISY'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                 Did I mention, Mr. Gateau was from
                 birth, absolutely blind.

6   INT. CLOCKMAKER'S SHOP, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1917              6

    ...The clockmaker his fine hands blindly working...

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                 And when their son came of age,
                 like boys will do, he joined the
                 army. They saw him off at the old
                 train station.

7   EXT. OLD TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1917                7

    An old wooden barn of a building. Their son, hugging his
    parents, getting on a flatbed train crowded with other
    soldiers, pulling away... Mr. Gateau, blindly waving his
    hat goodbye to his son...

                               DAISY'S (V.O.)
                 Oh how he worked, for months he
                 did nothing but work on the clock
                 for the great train station.

8   INT. WORKSHOP BELOW THE CLOCKMAKER'S HOME - NIGHT, 1918        8

    The sound of clocks constant ticking. Mr. Gateau at
    work...

                               DAISY'S (V.O.)
                 One day a letter came...

    Blanche comes into the workshop... a letter in her
    hand... She reads to her blind husband...

                               BLANCHE DEVEREUX
                 "I am sorry to inform you that
                 your son was killed fighting for
                 his country, at the battle of the
                 Marne. In the death of Sgt.
                 Martin Gateau I lose one of my
                 most trusted men.

                                BLANCHE DEVEREUX (CONT'D)
                  When I informed members of our
                  company he had fallen, on every
                  face could be seen the mark of
                  sorrow... ...we were in hope the
                  Lord would spare him to return
                  home together... Alas this was not
                  to be. I send along his pants,
                  shirt, cavalry pin, kerchief, and
                  haircomb."

                                DAISY (V.O.)
                  Mr. Gateau, done for the night,
                  went up to his bed.

     Mr. Gateau, blindly feeling his way up the stairs...

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                  And their son came home.

9    EXT. OLD TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918                9

     We see "Mr. Cake" in his familiar hat, his wife holding
     his arm, standing among the rows of coffins.

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                  They buried him where the Gateau
                  family had been buried for a
                  hundred and seven years...

10   EXT. NEW ORLEANS CEMETERY - DAY, 1918                          10

     An old New Orleans cemetery, vines crawling the
     sepulchers.

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                  Mr. Cake went back to work on his
                  clock... laboring to finish...

11   INT. THE CLOCK WORKSHOP, NEW ORLEANS - LATE NIGHT, 1918        11

     Mr. Gateau blindly setting the last spring, closing up
     the clock back... finished at last.

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                  It was a morning to remember...
                  Papa said there were people
                  everywhere...

12   INT. THE NEW TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918            12

     And we see a large throng gathered to watch the unveiling
     of the clock. Politicians, citizens, and pickpockets
     alike...

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                  6.

12   CONTINUED:                                                  12

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                  Even Teddy Roosevelt had come.

     And we see the distinctive figure of Theodore Roosevelt,
     in overcoat and hat, the war heavy on his shoulders. We
     watch Mr. Cake, with the aid of an assistant, climbing
     the scaffolding to his clock covered by a velvet drape...
     He stands for a moment... and with a simple tug, releases
     the purple swath... People gasp at the magnificent
     clock... "Mr. Cake" winds the clock, which chimes a
     glorious chime... Pushed by an angel, the second-hand
     begins its eternal journey...going around... Everyone
     cheers... until they realize the clock is going the wrong
     way... traveling backwards in time... A man shouts, "It's
     running backwards!"

                                MONSIEUR GATEAU
                  I made it this way... so that
                  perhaps, the boys who were lost in
                  the war might stand and go home
                  again...

13   EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY, 1918                                13

     And we see just that... bullets leaving mens' wounds
     sailing back into the rifles from whence they came...
     limbs, whole again... cannon balls rocketing backwards
     into the cannons' breech... Fallen come to their feet, to
     live and breathe again.

                                MONSIEUR GATEAU (V.O.)
                  ... home to farm, to work, have
                  children, to live long, full
                  lives...

14   INT. THE NEW TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918         14

     Teddy Roosevelt, bereft, removes his hat...

                                MONSIEUR GATEAU
                  Perhaps, my own son might come
                  home again...

15   EXT. OLD TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, ANOTHER TIME     15

     And we see his own son, Martin, once again full of life
     hopping backward off the train to land where his journey
     started... back in the arms of his loving parents...

                                                                  7.



16   INT. TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918                  16

                             MONSIEUR GATEAU
               I'm sorry if I offended anybody. I
               hope you enjoy my clock.

     And his wife holding his arm, he makes his way across the
     terminal and exits... The crowd is motionless. They look
     to Teddy Roosevelt for guidance... but he simply puts his
     hat on, and with his guardians, is gone...

                             DAISY'S (V.O.)
               Mr Cake was never seen again.
               Some say he died of a broken
               heart. Some say he went to sea...

17   EXT. THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER - AT THE END OF A DAY             17

     Mr. Gateau, blindly rowing... away...

18   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT           18

                             DAISY
               He just rowed...rowed...away...

     The wind loudly rattles the window...they turn to look...

                              DOROTHY BAKER
               Do you mind if I make myself a
               call? I've got somebody watching
               my little boy.

                             CAROLINE
               No, please go call...

     It's quiet, Caroline sitting on the bed with her dying
     mother... with the wind knocking at the window... After
     some moments:

                             CAROLINE (CONT'D)
               I hope I haven't disappointed you,
               Mother.

                              DAISY
               Oh honey, you could never
               disappoint me.

                             CAROLINE
               I wished I had more to show for
               myself. I know you would have
               liked to have had grandchildren.

                  My life hasn't been all that...
                  normal...

     As if to say the pieces haven't all fit... trying to
     articulate it...

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                  I'm either a step ahead... or a

                  What's normal?     A hat full of
                  sand.

                                   CAROLINE
                  What?

                                DAISY
                       (going on)
                  I need my brown suitcase... The

                                   CAROLINE
                  An envelope?

     Caroline doing what she's asked goes over to one of the
     suitcases by the bed... She opens it... and among the
     clothes and the keepsakes, there is indeed an old
     envelope.

                                   CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                  This one?

                  I tried to read it a hundred

                                CAROLINE
                  What do you mean?

                                   DAISY
                  Read it to me.

     Daisy closes her eyes... Caroline takes out a sheath of
     papers... It's a journal of some kind written in
     longhand... Pages have come undone... scraps of paper,
     even some napkins...

                                DAISY (CONT'D)
                       (murmurs)

     And for her mother's sake she begins to read it... with
     no particular interest, like reading to someone a
     selection from a menu's choices...

                             CAROLINE
               It's dated "April 4, 1985." It
               says, "New Orleans."
                    (after a beat)
               "This is my last will and
               testament...
                    (which starts to
                     engage her)
               I don't have much to leave... few
               possessions, no money really... I
               will go out of this world the same
               way I came in, alone and with
               nothing.

               writing it now while I still
               remember it..."

     She's interested. She looks over at her mother.    But her
     mother's eyes are closed...

                             CAROLINE (CONT'D)
               "My name is Benjamin..."

     And Caroline's voice becomes a young MAN'S voice...

                             A MAN'S (V.O.)
               "Benjamin Button... and I was born

19   EXT. NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1918                                19

     THERE'S SUDDENLY AN EXPLOSION OF FIREWORKS.

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               The war to end all wars had ended.

     We see the streets of New Orleans are filled with
     drunken, singing revelers... cars jamming the
     cobblestones, people kissing, shouting joyful... Another
     burst of fireworks.

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               I was told it was an especially
               good night to be born...

     And we see in the fireworks' light, a young MAN in his
     early 30s, THOMAS BUTTON, running up to the gate of a
     fashionable town home. He nearly collides with a PRIEST
     who arrives there at the same time. Thomas runs past
     him, up the steps...

20   INT. BUTTON HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1918                20

     ...He runs past a solemn Maid and up a long staircase...
     barging into the MASTER BEDROOM...

                                                                    10.



21   INT. MASTER BEDROOM, BUTTON HOUSE - NIGHT 1918                 21

     ... where we see a young Woman is lying on a bloody bed,
     frantically being administered to by a DOCTOR with the
     help of the small domestic staff... the PRIEST enters...

                             THOMAS BUTTON
                    (seeing him)
               Why are you here?

                             THE DOCTOR
               Thomas, I'm afraid she's not going
               to survive...

     And the Priest bends to say last rites over the pretty
     young woman... and the maids, bringing bedsheets,
     futilely start to change her bloody linens...

                             THOMAS BUTTON
               That's enough...! All of you!

     They move out of the way... and Thomas kneels beside his
     wife... She's pale white, fear in her soft brown eyes...
     He takes her hand...

                             THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
               I came as quickly as I could...
               I'm sorry I took so long, the
               streets are filled with people...

     As if to underscore it, fireworks go off...

                             THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
               You are going to be alright, my
               dearest darling... I will not let
               anything happen to you...

                             HIS YOUNG WIFE
               Promise me, Thomas...

     And she is interrupted by the sudden CRY OF A BABY.    But
     Thomas can't take his eyes from his dying wife...

                             HIS YOUNG WIFE (CONT'D)
               Promise me, he has a place...

     He doesn't understand... She looks up at him... holds his
     hand tight... then she slips away... The Doctor listening
     for her pulse... He covers her... it's quiet... the
     Priest's murmured incantations... the housemaids
     crying...



                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                 11.

21   CONTINUED:                                                  21

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  She gave her life for me... And
                  for that I am forever grateful...

     Thomas, still holding her hand, is unable to let go...
     When we hear again the BABY CRYING... The BABY'S CRY is
     not quite right... It is not an infant's cry for succor,
     or a natural cry to exercise its new lungs... It's a
     deep, haunting cry from some primal soul... They all
     turn, and the room stills... listening as The BABY
     continues its mournful WAIL. Only Thomas goes to
     answer... The Baby in a basket, swaddled in a thick
     blanket, its face covered with cloth... Thomas goes to
     lift it, to see his son's face...

                                   MAID
                  Mr. Button...!

     He lifts the cloth anyway... He recoils... for he has
     seen some kind of horror... He makes the smallest of
     sounds, a whispered "Ohhhh." And then he suddenly
     snatches up the swaddled baby -- running with it out of
     the room... downstairs... outside...

22   EXT. NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1918                              22

     ... Thomas, tears on his face, carrying his CRYING BABY,
     through the streets... Pushing through crowds...

23   EXT. A BRIDGE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1918                    23

     ... he comes along an old bridge over a waterway... the
     air heavy with the haze of fireworks... the water dark...
     brokenhearted, he lifts the baby to throw it into the
     black water... He is just at the apex of this throw when,
     despite his sadness, he can't bring himself to do it...
     Instead, cradles the newborn...

                                THOMAS
                  I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

     A LANTERN lights his face... A POLICEMAN down the way...

                                POLICEMAN
                  What are you doing there!?

     The BABY starts to CRY...

                                POLICEMAN (CONT'D)
                  What do you have there?

     Thomas takes off... the Policeman after him... Thomas,
     carrying the CRYING BABY, running...

                                                                  12.



23A   EXT. NEW ORLEANS, GARDEN DISTRICT - NIGHT, 1918             23A

      Thomas, scuttling with the crying infant through narrow
      streets past the back porches and the back stairs of the
      large old moldering antebellum houses...

24    EXT. THE BACK OF AN OLD NEW ORLEANS HOUSE - NIGHT, 1918     24

      He comes to an old three-story house with a screened
      porch, VOICES from inside... PEOPLE TALKING and
      LAUGHING... The Baby, soothed by the soft yellow light,
      by the music of the voices, by the house itself -- stops
      its mournful cry. Thomas stops, catching his breath...
      He looks in through the back porch... the sounds of
      VOICES coming... Thomas quietly sets the baby on the back
      porch steps. He takes out every last dollar he has,
      tucking the money inside the Baby's blanket... We can
      just see the figures of two people coming from inside...
      Thomas knocks on the weathered screen door... And his
      decision made, he turns, moving away from the house,
      leaving his child behind.

                              A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
                I could've sworn I heard somebody
                knockin'...

      When a young Black Woman, in a green dress, comes onto
      the porch... A thin, attractive woman, in her late 20s,
      with the sultry eyes of a lounge singer -- She's known as
      QUEENIE. She's followed by a handsome Black man, MR.
      WEATHERS -- that everyone calls TIZZY. She looks out the
      door, and not seeing anything...

                                 QUEENIE
                I guess not...

      She stands for a moment taking in the night air...

                              QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                The air smells sweet...

      And she sings to herself... a song from the time...

                              TIZZY
                You look very handsome tonight,
                Ms. Queenie, handsome as I ever
                seen you... The green matches
                your eyes...

                              QUEENIE
                     (fingering dress)
                It isn't everyday a war's over,
                Mr. Weathers...
                              (MORE)
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                     13.

24   CONTINUED:                                                      24
                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  We have to mark it somehow... You
                  ain't no slouch yourself.

     He smiles, tips his hat... And they stand in the quiet...

                                TIZZY
                  Hambert's back in town... came
                  home legless, but he home... we're
                  gonna throw a party for him...
                  help get himself situated...
                       (beat)
                  I know you was sweet on him one
                  time...

                                QUEENIE
                  Sweeter than I shoulda been...
                  Lost his legs you say? "You never
                  know what's comin' for you."

     And if right on cue an older white Woman sticks her head
     out...

                                OLD WOMAN
                  Ms. Simone messed herself...

                                QUEENIE
                  She got to stop doing that, or
                  it's diapers for her... I'll be
                  right there, Mrs. Jameson...

     The woman disappears inside.    Queenie, not anxious to
     go...

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  It sure is nice out here, Mr.
                  Weathers...

                                TIZZY
                  Awful nice, Ms. Queenie... Come
                  out back for a moment... take your
                  mind away from things...

     He pushes open the porch screen door...

                                QUEENIE
                       (smiles)
                  Just a moment's time...

     He offers her his hand... She takes it... He backs out of
     the house, holding her hand, and he suddenly steps right
     on top of the Baby... The baby wails, Tizzy stumbles,
     nearly falls...


                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                 14.

24   CONTINUED: (2)                                              24

                             TIZZY
               What in God's name...?!!

                                QUEENIE
               What is that?     A fish crawl out of
               the river...?

     She moves to it... pushes aside the blanket, and freezes.

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
               God in heaven!

     IT IS THE VERY FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN THE BABY. What we
     see is the prominent bald head of any newborn... but it
     has the face, the wrinkled skin, the faded eyes, of an
     octogenarian. Indeed, if we didn't know any better, it
     would seem the newborn was a wrinkled decrepit sad-eyed
     old man...

                             QUEENIE (CONT'D)
               My Goodness, the Lord did
               something here...!

                             TIZZY
               Look like a milk wagon run over
               it... three times... and back...

     And they're both motionless, not quite sure what to do...

                             TIZZY (CONT'D)
               I didn't see it layin' there... I
               hope I didn't hurt it none...
               steppin' on it like that...

     The BABY won't stop its mournful cry...

                             TIZZY (CONT'D)
               We best leave it to the police...
               I'll go --

     Queenie hesitates... a longing.

                             QUEENIE
               It's for sure nobody wanted to
               keep it...

     And making up her mind, she suddenly grabs up the crying
     baby, taking it inside... Tizzy, anxiously whispering
     something, going in after her...

                                                                  15.



25   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1918              25

     A piano's playing a standard, people singing.... There's
     a myriad of old dark rooms... heavy furniture and
     carpets... an eclectic mixture of the possessions of
     those who have lived and died here over many years... and
     we see a parlor is crowded with Old People, from sixty to
     ninety-five, in various stages of health... various
     contraptions to keep them "afloat". An Old Age Home. We
     see Queenie moving quietly along a hallway, carrying the
     crying baby so as not to be seen. Tizzy, following her,
     still anxiously whispering after her...

                             A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
               Where are you, Queenie...?

                             QUEENIE
               Hold your water...
                    (and to Tizzy)
               Go see to them.

     He does what she asks. She hurries the baby into a small
     room, literally like a mouse house, under the stairs...

26   INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM, OLD HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1918     26

     A small room tucked under the staircase...

                             A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
               Queenie Apple... she went and
               messed herself all over again...

                             QUEENIE
               Jane Childress start her a bath...
               and mind your business, Mrs.
               Duprey... You'll be messing
               yourself soon enough too!

     There's a KNOCK on Queenie's door.

                             A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
                    (whispers)
               Somebody stole my necklace...

                             QUEENIE
               I'll be right with you, Mrs.
               Hollister...

     She whispers to The Baby, soothing it. And looking for a
     place to put it, she opens a dresser drawer...




                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                16.

26   CONTINUED:                                                 26

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  You may be as ugly as an old
                  pot... but you still a child of
                  God...

                                A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
                  Queenie, Apple... she won't go
                  take a bath wit'out you...

                                QUEENIE
                  Mercy, I'll be right there.

     And with that she puts The Baby into the top dresser
     drawer... with her unmentionables... and shuts it...
     leaving it open just a crack, enough to breathe...
     Turning, she sees an Old Woman, looking very lost,
     looking in the room...

                                MRS. HOLLISTER
                  My sister gave those pearls to
                  me... I can't find them
                  anywhere... People are stealing my
                  jewelry...!

                                 QUEENIE
                  They're right here, Mrs.
                  Hollister, right 'round your
                  pretty white neck...
                       (moving her)
                  Come on now...

     There's a sound of a door chime...

                                A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
                  Dr. Rose has arrived for his
                  visit...

     Queenie takes a concerned look back at the Baby, and
     closes the door... And we stay behind for a moment...
     inside Queenie's underwear drawer, with the smell of a
     lilac sachet... is the Baby with the face of an old
     man... looking up at the sliver of light coming into the
     dresser drawer...

27   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1918        27

     We see the Doctor, an older man in a tired suit, who has
     done this longer than he cares to remember, finishing
     examining one of the elderly boarders. He puts his
     things into his doctor's bag. Queenie comes beside him,
     saying something...

                                                                  17.



28   INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM - THAT NIGHT, 1918                       28

     The Baby is lying on Queenie's bed... Dr. Rose,
     stethoscope ever dangling, washes his hands in a sink.

                             DOCTOR ROSE
               ... He's nearly blind from
               cataracts... I'm not sure he can
               hear... His bones indicate severe
               arthritis... His skin has lost all
               elasticity... His hands and feet
               are ossified... He has all the
               deterioration, the infirmities,
               not of a newborn, but of a man
               well in his eighties on the way to
               his grave...

                             QUEENIE
               You mean to say he's dying?

                             DOCTOR ROSE
               Of old age. His body is failing
               him before his life's begun.

     They're still, looking at the strange baby.

                             DOCTOR ROSE (CONT'D)
               Where did he come from?

                             QUEENIE
                    (after a beat)
               It's my sister's child... From
               Lafayette. She had an unfortunate
               adventure.
                    (whispers)
               The poor child got the worse of
               it... came out white...

                             DOCTOR ROSE
               There are places for 'unwanted'
               babies like these, Queenie...
               There's no room for another mouth
               to feed here... The Nolan
               Foundation, despite their good
               intentions, thinks this place is a
               large nuisance as it is... A baby
               here --

                             QUEENIE
                    (appealing)
               You said he don't have long.



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                     18.

                                DOCTOR ROSE
                  Queenie -- some creatures aren't
                  meant to survive.

     She looks at the Baby, determined.

                                QUEENIE
                  He is a miracle, that's for
                  certain... just not the kind of
                  miracle one hopes to see...

29   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - THAT NIGHT, 1918                     29

     The Old People are sitting around the parlor talking,
     playing cards... Queenie brings the baby bundle into the
     room.

                                QUEENIE
                  You all listen...

     And they stop what they are doing...

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  We have a visitor that will be
                  staying with us for a little
                  while... My sister had a child but
                  couldn't see right by it... He's
                  known as...
                       (a hesitation naming him)
                  Benjamin...
                       (she likes the sound
                        of it)
                  Benjamin... He's not a well
                  child... so we need to take very
                  good care of him...

     We see Tizzy's come out of the kitchen , watching with an
     air of strong disapproval... And an OLD WOMAN says...

                                ONE OF THE WOMEN
                  I had ten children... there's not
                  a baby I can't care for... let me
                  see him...

     Queenie hesitates, and gives the Baby to her... The Old
     Woman pushes the blanket back from the baby's face...

                                THE OLD WOMAN
                       (startled)
                  God in heaven, he looks just like
                  my ex-husband...

     And there's laughter...

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                 19.

29   CONTINUED:                                                  29

                                QUEENIE
                  He's prematurely old... Doctor
                  Rose said he don't have much time
                  on this earth...

                                   A MAN
                  Join the club.

     They all laugh. Their laughter makes the baby seem to
     smile... the lonely smile of an old, dying man.

30   INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM - STILL LATER THAT NIGHT, 1918          30

     We see Queenie, unable to sleep, lying in bed, looking
     out a small window... there's a light KNOCK on the
     door... Tizzy...

                                TIZZY
                  Hambert sends his remembrance to
                  you.

     She nods... The baby cries out... and then it's quiet...

                                TIZZY (CONT'D)
                       (meaning the baby)
                  Are you right out of your mind? I
                  know you don't got all the parts
                  it takes to make one of your
                  own... but this isn't yours to
                  keep... this isn't even human
                  kind...

     With nothing left to be said, he starts to go...

                                QUEENIE
                       (whispers)
                  Mr. Weathers. Stay with me
                  tonight.

     He slows.    She's quiet.     And she whispers:

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  "You never know what's comin' for
                  you."

     And as they move to be with one another, to make love; we
     look over at the dresser drawer -- open just a crack...
     Benjamin lying among the unmentionables, looking out at
     the world...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  I found a home...

                                                                  20.



31   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT           31

     Caroline with the "journal" on her knees. Daisy, eyes
     closed... the wind gathered in strength... furiously
     knocking...

                             CAROLINE
               Is any of this true?

                             DAISY
               You have such a lovely voice.

     Caroline shrugs.   She looks through the "book..."

                             CAROLINE
               Some pages seem to be torn out
               here...

     She discovers inside...

                             CAROLINE (CONT'D)
               There's an old streetcar token.

     She gives it to her mother, folding her hand around it.
     But Daisy is somewhere else, looking out the window...

                             DAISY
               That clock... Just kept going,
               year after year after year...

32   INT. "NEW" TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - ANOTHER DAY, 1925    32

     And we see "Mr. Cake's" clock with its cherubs pushing
     the "hands of progress," still marking time backwards...
     The year is now, "1925..."

33   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE - DINING ROOM, NEW ORLEANS -            33
     EVENING, 1925

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               "...I didn't know I was a child.
               I thought I was like everyone else
               who lived there, an old man, in my
               "golden years."

     The boarders eating dinner. Queenie, in a white
     uniform... along with Tizzy, wearing a chef's hat and
     apron, helping her serve. We move across the ancient
     faces... until we come to one particular face... Wearing
     eyeglasses now... but the same wrinkled face we've come
     to know... the face of a very old man...



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                 21.

33   CONTINUED:                                                  33

     The face of Benjamin Button, when he should normally be a
     six-year-old. He's sitting in a wheelchair now... small,
     shrunken, hunched with age, legs and hands crippled with
     arthritis... Eyeglasses are just one addition... a
     hearing aid... a bulky apparatus of its time, is in one
     ear... But if we look even closer we can see there are
     sprouts of hair... wisps of white... what would be the
     last hair for some... seem to be growing in... As we
     watch him eat, he uses his fork like a child might,
     banging it just for the hell of it making noise...

                                QUEENIE
                  Stop bangin' that fork...
                       (fixing it in his
                        arthritic hand)
                  It's for eating, not for playin'
                  with... And use your napkin,
                  please Mr. Benjamin...

     And he does as he's told... A staff member helps one of
     the old men, feeding him... Benjamin just another old man
     having dinner with his contemporaries.

34   EXT. THE PORCH, NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1925      34

     A line of old people in rockers. Benjamin, like any six-
     year-old, bored, wheels his chair back and forth, between
     them... until one of the oldsters, who has had enough,
     sticks his cane in the spokes of his wheelchair, making
     him come to an abrupt stop... Benjamin, sitting with the
     other oldsters on the porch... the old people rocking...
     Sounds drift from the street beyond the wall... children
     playing... people talking...

                                  BENJAMIN BUTTON
                  What's there?

     Nobody says anything, rocking. Benjamin, eternally
     curious needing to know, suddenly wheels himself
     precariously to the very edge of the porch where the wall
     is lower and he just sees the street... children running
     on the street, playing... carriages dropping people off
     for a party... He leans forward to get an even better
     view... When Queenie suddenly grabs him...

                                QUEENIE
                  Benjamin! That's dangerous... Come
                  back here...!

     ...Rolling his wheelchair away from the edge to the
     safety of the old people... out of sight of the street...

                                                                  22.



35   INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM - NIGHT, 1925                            35

     The small room with the small window. We see Benjamin in
     a bed made on the floor... Queenie in her bed...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               I loved her very much. She was my
               mother.

     And he reaches to hold her hand. She generously takes
     his hand... And they lay like that holding hands, Queenie
     in bed, her "son", the "old man" on the floor...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON
               Somedays I feel like I'm different
               from the day before...

                             QUEENIE
               Everybody feels different about
               themselves one way or another.
               We're all goin' the same way, just
               taking different roads to get
               there... You're on your own road,
               Benjamin.

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON
               How much longer do I have to live,
               Mother?

                             QUEENIE
               Just be thankful you got what
               you're given. You already here
               longer than you supposed to be.

     We see the door quietly open, Tizzy coming in...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               Some nights, I would have to sleep
               alone.

     He looks at Benjamin, his signal to pick him up, carrying
     him out of the room, sitting him in his wheelchair, Tizzy
     going back down into the room to be with Queenie...
     shutting the door...

36   INT. THE PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE, LATE AT NIGHT, 1925            36

     An Old Woman's fallen fast asleep in an easy chair, a
     book on her lap. Benjamin sitting alone in his
     wheelchair, listening to the sounds of the house.

36   CONTINUED:                                                        36

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  I didn't mind. I would listen to
                  the house breathing. All the
                  people sleeping. I felt safe.

     Be he still wants to know "What's over there?" He wheels
     himself over to sit at the window looking outside...
     looking at the streetlights, the world beyond the gate...
     trying to see what's dangerous...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                  It was a place of great routine...
                  Every morning at 5:30, no matter
                  the weather... General Winslow,
                  U.S. Army Retired... raised the
                  flag...

37   EXT. THE FRONT LAWN, NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING, 1925                  37

     And we see the very elderly General Winslow, doing just
     that... raising the flag in a downpour, only... he's
     naked. And as Queenie comes running across the lawn with
     a coat for him. There's the sound of SOMEONE SINGING
     OPERA...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON (V.O.)
                  Mrs. Sybil Wagner, once a noted
                  opera singer... well, she'd sing,
                  Wagner...

38   INT. MRS. WAGNER'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING, 1925              38

     We see a Victrola playing, Mrs. Wagner in her nightgown
     at a window singing with the musical accompaniment at the
     top of her lungs... while, down the hall we see Queenie
     giving Benjamin a bath... massaging his poor crippled
     legs...

                                 QUEENIE
                  We're gonna put some life into
                  these old sticks for you... get
                  you walkin'...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  Breakfast was served promptly at
                  six.

39   INT. THE KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING, 1925                     39

     We see Benjamin in his wheelchair, under Tizzy's
     tutelage, learning to cook... and simultaneously, to
     read...

                  How we doin'?    What's that say
                  there?

                  Think. That's a 'v' not a 'b.'
                  Say it.

                                  BENJAMIN
                  Gravy.

                                TIZZY
                  Now you talkin'!

     Some staff come in getting platters of food...

                  How many parts flour?

                                  BENJAMIN
                  Two...

                                TIZZY
                  How much is four and two?

                                  BENJAMIN
                  Six.

     Tizzy smacks the back of his head.

                                TIZZY
                  You're a regular addin' machine...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  Dinner was served promptly at six.

                                                                  25.



40   INT. KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1925                      40

     Tizzy washing dishes...Benjamin working with him...
     putting away cans... reading from one of the labels...

                             BENJAMIN
               Tomato, brown sugar, salt,
               myasses...

     Tizzy swats at him with his dish towel...

                               TIZZY
               "Molasses"...

     And while washing the dishes...

                             TIZZY (CONT'D)
               I learned to read when I was five.
               My grandfather was a dresser for a
               famous actor. He'd bring home
               every play for me to read.
                    (Shakespeare)
               "Kind keepers of my weak decaying
               age, Let dying Mortimer here rest
               himself. Even like a man new
               haled from the rack. So fare my
               limbs with long imprisonment. And
               these gray locks, the pursuivants
               of death, Nestor-like aged in an
               age of care, Argue the end of
               Edmund Mortimer."

     Benjamin's mouth agape, awed, taken by him, his majesty.

                             TIZZY (CONT'D)
               You thought I was plain ignorant,
               didn't you?

     Benjamin never thought about it...

                             TIZZY (CONT'D)
               The actor my grandfather worked
               for was John Wilkes Booth. He
               killed Abraham Lincoln. You never
               know...

     An old man looks in...

                             A MAN
               When's dessert...?

                                                                      26.

                                TIZZY
                  When it's served. Now sit your
                  wrinkly butt back down, Mr. Lee.

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  On Saturday nights I would go to
                  Queenie's church...

41   INT. CHURCH TENT, NEW ORLEANS - A SATURDAY NIGHT, 1926           41

     A sweltering shout 'em up Negro gospel tent. Queenie
     pushes Benjamin in his wheelchair past a line of people
     looking to be healed, bringing him face to face with a
     mountain of a PREACHER, pouring sweat and full of fire...

                                THE PREACHER
                  What can I do for you, Sister?

     And Queenie whispers something to him.

                                THE PREACHER (CONT'D)
                  Her parts are all twisted up
                  inside so she can't have little
                  children...

     He puts his hand on her stomach...

                                PREACHER
                  Lord, if you could see clear to
                  forgive this woman her sins so she
                  can bear the fruit of the womb.
                       (and shouts)
                  Out damnable affliction!

     He presses on her stomach... making Queenie nearly fall
     over... held up by a "NURSE" in a crisp white uniform.
     And once she's regained her balance...

                                THE PREACHER
                       (at Benjamin)
                  And what's this old man's
                  irrediction?

                                QUEENIE
                  He's got the devil on his back...
                  trying to ride him into the grave
                  before his time...

                                THE PREACHER
                       (touches Benjamin)
                  Out, Zebuchar! Out, Beelzebub!
                       (after a beat)
                  How old are you?

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                      27.

41   CONTINUED:                                                       41

     And he says what is only true.

                                BENJAMIN
                  I'm seven, but I look a lot older.

                                   PREACHER
                       (laughs)
                  God bless you.    He's seven!

     The congregation laughs...

                                THE PREACHER
                  This is a man who has optimism in
                  his heart! Belief in his soul!
                  We are all children in the eyes of
                  God. Now we are going to get you
                  out of that chair... we're gonna
                  have you walk...
                       (his hands on Ben's
                        shoulders)
                  In the name of God's glory, rise
                  up!

     And Benjamin, doing what he's asked, barely able to, his
     legs akimbo, stands... The people all applaud...

                                THE PREACHER (CONT'D)
                  Now God is going to see you the
                  rest of the way... He's going to
                  see this little old man walk
                  without the use of a crutch or a
                  cane...! He's going walk by
                  himself on faith and divine
                  inspiration alone...! We'll show
                  that Devil where to go...! Walk
                  on...!

     And Benjamin takes two very precarious steps and his poor
     arthritic legs give out... and he sprawls to the floor...
     The Aides in white nurse's uniforms move to help, but:

                                THE PREACHER (CONT'D)
                  Don't touch him!
                       (kneeling to Benjamin)
                  Rise up, old man!

     But Benjamin stays crumpled on the floor... The Preacher
     comes to his feet, standing like a mountain over him...

                                THE PREACHER (CONT'D)
                  Rise up like Lazarus!

     Benjamin still lies on the floor...

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                   28.

41   CONTINUED: (2)                                                41

                             THE PREACHER (CONT'D)
               I said rise up!!

     And Benjamin, slowly but surely, makes his way to his
     feet...

                             THE PREACHER (CONT'D)
               Yes, and say hallelujah!
                    (Hallelujah!)
               Now walk, my old friend...
               Walk on...!

     And Benjamin, one crippled leg at a time, hobbles across
     the stage... The people urging him on... a string of
     "Hallelujahs...!" Queenie comes to join him... urging
     him...

                             QUEENIE
               Let the Lord carry you... ...

     ...The Preacher, walking along with him, more a dance
     than a walk, shouting the name of the Lord... Queenie and
     The Preacher walking Benjamin across the stage...
     Benjamin making it to the other end... to a roar of
     "Amens"!

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               Now, when I look back on it, it
               was kind of miraculous... But you
               know the saying, "...the Lord
               Giveth and the Lord Taketh
               away..."

     ... That mountain of a Preacher... in full exaltation to
     God...

                             THE PREACHER
               Praise be to the Lord on the
               highest...!

     Suddenly pitches over, flat on his face... Having had a
     spontaneous coronary... lying center-stage, deader than
     the proverbial doornail... The crisp uniformed "nurses"
     running to attend to him, and poor "old" Benjamin
     haplessly looking around.

42   INT. THE PARLOR ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY 1926          42

     The people are gathered...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               There were birthdays...

       A lit cake is being brought in celebrating General
       Winslow's birthday. He stares at the cake, unhappily
       gets up, mutters something... and leaves. The oldsters
       eye the cake, and without a moment's hesitation, dig
       in...

                                  BENJAMIN BUTTON (V.O.)
                    And mortality was a common visitor
                    to our house... People came and
                    went... Death was so frequent, I
                    was never afraid of it.

43     EXT. NOLAN HOUSE, ANOTHER MORNING, 1926                        43

       Mrs. Wagner's window open... and not a sound coming
       out...

                                  BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                    You could hear when someone left
                    us... there was a silence in the
                    house...

44     EXT. AN OLD NEW ORLEANS' CEMETERY - DAY, 1926                  44

       A small funeral at   an old cemetery... And while "DIE
       VALKYRIE" PLAYS on   her crank VICTROLA, an old man bangs
       cymbals as a grand   finale to the music... while we see
       SYBIL WAGNER, laid   to rest to sing in another choir:

45     EXT. THE FRONT PORCH, THE NOLAN HOUSE - DUSK, 1926             45

       Benjamin with his wondrous ancient face sitting in his
       wheelchair with the old people on the porch... watching
       the sun go down...

                                  BENJAMIN BUTTON (V.O.)
                    It was a wonderful place to grow
                    up. I was with people who had put
                    away all the inconsequences of
                    life, left in a state of purely
                    being...wondering about the
                    weather...the temperature of a
                    bath...the light at the end of the
                    day...

       And one of them, as if to underscore the point, farts...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                For everyone that died, someone
                would come to take their place...

      And we see Benjamin coming into the kitchen... Tizzy busy
      preparing lunch... Benjamin stops, seeing a tiny African
      man, his back to us, surrounded by old people standing on
      the lawn... He hears him telling them...

                              NGUNDA OTI
                ... My first wife and I are
                captured by neighbor tribe,
                cannibals...

      The old people shrink at the mention...

                              NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
                I escaped across the river...

                              AN OLD WOMAN
                     (wide eyed)
                You escaped cannibals?

                              NGUNDA OTI
                My wife, she can't swim, so she
                eaten.

                              TIZZY
                     (telling Benjamin)
                That's Mr. Oti... He's an
                acquaintance of an acquaintance of
                mine...he'll be stayin' with us in
                the staff quarters for awhile...

                              NGUNDA OTI
                     (telling old people)
                ...Second wife stepped on viper
                and dies... (jocular) It was bad
                luck to be married to Mr. Oti.

      They laugh.

                              NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
                I am captured with six others by
                Baschiele tribe. They sell us to a
                big white man...

      He instinctively turns and sees Benjamin standing in the
      window watching him. When Mr. Oti spots him he quickly
      moves out of the window out of sight.

                                                                   31.



47C   INT. THE PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER TIME, 1927            47C

      We see Benjamin lying on the floor by the stairs playing
      with some metal army men... when Mr. Oti's distinctive
      laugh, his voice, drifts up from under the stairs...
      Benjamin, getting his canes, goes to look... Mr. Oti,
      standing under the stairs in an alcove with some of the
      help, telling them his life story... but it's a
      completely different tone... a mockery of white people
      and their insanity...

                              NGUNDA OTI
                The Big White Man brings us to St.
                Louis, where they make our village
                at the 1904 World's Fair... They
                have us livin' in these little
                huts like we're livin' in
                Africa... people behind bars
                staring at us... we told not to
                look at them... to just go about
                our normal lives... what the hell
                they talkin' about... ?

      They all laugh...

                              NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
                At night we're done bein'
                "savages..." we go over the wall
                into The Rosebud... we drank and
                laughed until the sun come up...
                and then we savages again...

      They nod enjoying the idea... And as Mr. Oti senses
      Benjamin's presence, turning... Benjamin retreating on

      Benjamin sitting at the dining room table reading an
      oversized book of "Imaginary Beings..." He senses a
      presence... and Mr. Oti sits down across from him.

                              NGUNDA OTI
                I hear you not so old as you
                looking. You just foolin'
                everybody. What happen, you get
                Madjembe?




                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                      32.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   What's a madjembe?

                                    NGUNDA OTI
                   Worms.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I don't think so. This is just
                   how I am.

      Mr. Oti looks out at the street.

                                 NGUNDA OTI
                   You want to get a cold root beer?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (an echo)
                   It's dangerous.

                                    NGUNDA OTI
                   Who said that?

      He gets up ready to go. Benjamin hesitates. He can see
      Queenie busy leaning out a window banging dust from a
      rug.

                                 NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
                        (last chance)
                   ...Come on little man...

      Despite knowing the consequences he takes up his canes
      and follows Ngunda outside...

49    EXT. STREET, OUTSIDE NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1927       49

      They come outside. Children on the street playing.
      Seeing Benjamin, they come to a dead stop... staring at
      the freak from the old people's home, with another
      freak... Mr. Oti suddenly runs into the street...

                                    NGUNDA OTI
                   Hurry...

      Benjamin tries as best he can to keep up... Mr. Oti darts
      directly in front of a street car, waving his arms,
      making it come to an abrupt stop...

                   ...Another white man come to my
                   country and say he want to talk to
                   me...

50    INT. THE STREETCAR, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1927                 50

      We move along the aisle of a streetcar... the various
      people...

                                 NGUNDA OTI
                   Then I am in the monkey house at
                   "Philadelphia Zoological Park."
                   Three thousand people show up my
                   first day...

      Benjamin and Ngunda siting in the back of the streetcar
      behind a moveable metal bar that has "Coloreds" painted
      on it... Mr. Oti taking a slug from a flask... A group of
      school children nearby can't take their eyes off the two
      of them... Mr. Oti takes his wallet out, taking out a
      folded piece of newspaper, showing it to Benjamin...
      "Bushman shares cage with park apes."

                                 BENJAMIN
                   What's it like living in a cage?

                                 NGUNDA OTI
                   It stinks. The monkeys, they do
                   some tricks... I throw spear... I
                   wrestle with Kowali, she is
                   orangutan... They have me file my
                   teeth like a cannibal...

      He shows him his teeth filed into points like a
      cannibal...

                                 NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
                   When I'm not playing with monkeys -
                   - they want me to run to bars in
                   my cage with teeth to scare little
                   children...

      And he suddenly jumps up and does just that, charging
      with his teeth bared at the school children... They
      scream... Mr. Oti, taking his seat again, laughs with
      Benjamin...

50A   INT. (OR) EXT. THE STREETCAR, NEW ORLEANS - DAY             50A

      Benjamin, ecstatic, his head out the streetcar window,
      Mr. Oti holding onto the back of his breeches from
      falling... Benjamin feeling the wind and the city wash
      over him...

                                                                 34.



51   EXT. THE PERISTYLE, NEW ORLEANS - PARK - END OF DAY, 1927   51

     Benjamin and Mr. Oti sitting on a bench at the peristyle
     of a park. Benjamin takes his first slug of a coca cola,
     taking too big a hit, the coke pouring out of his nose...
     Mr. Oti gives him a handkerchief... after he's wiped
     himself up...

                             BENJAMIN
               Why didn't you go back home?

                             NGUNDA OTI
               War between English and Dutch
               people had broken up kingdom.

                             BENJAMIN
               What did you do?

                             NGUNDA OTI
               I leave zoo. Go here. Go there.
               Everything okay. But I alone.

                             BENJAMIN
               You were all alone?

                             NGUNDA OTI
               You'll see little man, plenty
               times you be alone. You different
               like us, it's gonna be that way.
               But I tell you a little secret I
               find out. We know we alone. Fat
               people, skinny people, tall
               people, white people... they just
               as alone as us... But they scared
               shitless...

     He smiles a knowing smile...

                             NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
               Not a thing wrong with being
               alone... no sir...

     He looks out...

                             NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
               I think about the river I grew up
               on. It would be good to sit by my
               river again.

     He looks at his watch.   He suddenly gets up...

                                                                 34A.



52   EXT. BOURBON STREET CORNER, NEW ORLEANS - DUSK, 1927         52

     Mr. Oti and Benjamin coming along the street, music
     pouring out... They reach a corner where a tall octoroon
     woman is waiting. She broadly smiles seeing Mr. Oti.

                             THE WOMAN
               There's my little man. You ready,
               sugar.

                       (smiles, pure Ngunda)
                  Always ready. Always ready.
                       (introduces)
                  Filamena, Mr. Benjamin.

                                FILAMENA GILEA
                       (respectful of his
                        age)
                  It's a pleasure to meet you, Sir.

                                NGUNDA OTI
                       (to Benjamin)
                  You can find your own way home,
                  can't you?

     Although he's not sure he can... he nods, yes.

                                NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
                  The St. Charles Avenue line to
                  Napoleon...

     And with that, his arm around Filamena's waist, the two
     of them laughing, walk off... Benjamin's left standing on
     the street corner... he looks around to get his
     bearings... he moves along Bourbon Street... A streetcar
     comes along, bell clanging, it rushes by him... he
     watches it go... Clasping his canes, determined, he
     starts walking... bent over, one cane after the other...
     making his way along the street...

53   EXT. NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - LATE NIGHT, 1927                53

     We see Benjamin coming back to the gate... and we hear:

                                QUEENIE (V.O.)
                  Where in God's name have you
                  been?!!

     And we see Queenie standing on the porch... She's worried
     sick... she sees his hands are bleeding from blisters.

54   INT. KITCHEN, QUEENIE'S SINK, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT               54

     Queenie cleaning his hands...

                                QUEENIE
                  Like to scare the Holy Hell out of
                  me! I was so worried about
                  you...you take my breath away...

                  life.

55   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              55

     And the "caregiver," Dorothy Baker, comes back in.        She
     feels Daisy's pulse, straightens her pillow...

                                DOROTHY BAKER
                  How's her breathing... ?

                                CAROLINE
                  Shallow.

     Dorothy nods.

                                DOROTHY BAKER
                       (after a beat)
                  They're sayin' it's gonna reach us
                  late in the day... I'm goin' to
                  get my baby and take him to my
                  sister's... they said there's
                  nothin' to worry about here in the
                  hospital...Nurses are right here
                  if you need them...I'll see you in
                  about an hour if that'll be
                  okay...

                                CAROLINE
                  No, that's fine...please...

     She leaves. It's momentarily quiet, the wind knocking at
     the window... Daisy, ruminating...

                                DAISY
                  Was there just company?

                                CAROLINE
                  Dorothy had to go home...

     But Daisy's mind is elsewhere...gesturing for her to keep
     reading...

                                DAISY
                  Caroline...

     Caroline looks back at the book.       Daisy closes her

56   EXT. THE LAWN, THE NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1930                   56

     The boarders on the lawn with their loved ones... And we          *
     see an OLD MAN, walking with the aid of a cane coming out         *
     of the house onto the lawn... And as he moves through the         *
     people we see it's Benjamin... He has a single cane,              *
     standing more upright now, a distinctive shock of white
     hair, eyebrows... A distinguished looking man in his              *
     seventies, or, in normal years, a growing twelve-year-old
     boy...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               It was Thanksgiving 1930, I met
               the person who changed my life
               forever.

     A chauffeured car has stopped... A Man is standing in the
     road, looking at the house through the gates... And we
     realize it's THOMAS BUTTON... looking for a glimpse of
     his son... Benjamin instinctively turns, but it's too
     late, his father's back in the car, being driven away...

57   INT. DINING ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - THANKSGIVING, 1930           57

     The families, along with Ngunda and Filamena, are
     gathered in the dining room, their heads bowed in prayer.
     We see Daisy across from Benjamin... The prayer's
     finished, it's noisy...

                             NGUNDA OTI
               We pray to Bembe... the creator of
               all living things... she retired
               after all that work...

                             DAISY
                    (needing to top that)
               Did you know turkeys aren't really
               birds...?

                             BENJAMIN
               Why do you say that?

                             DAISY
               They're in the pheasant family.
               They can hardly fly. It's sad
               don't you think? A bird, that
               can't fly.

                             NGUNDA OTI
               I like birds that can't fly.
               They're easy to eat.

                             QUEENIE

               I have something to tell you

     They're quiet.

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  While we're giving thanks for
                  God's blessings... I've had a
                  miracle happen.
                       (she touches her
                        stomach)
                  The Lord saw fit to answer my
                  prayers.

     The people applaud the good news.

                                BENJAMIN
                  What does she mean "answered her
                  prayers?"

                                DAISY
                  She's going to have a baby, silly.
                  That's what my mother said when I
                  was going to have a little
                  brother. He didn't live long
                  though. He didn't breathe
                  right...

     And we can see Benjamin's heart beginning to break... he
     looks over, Tizzy, proudly smiling... And as Queenie
     accepts congratulations... Benjamin's old wrinkled face,
     watching her... looks like he's going to cry...

58   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, LATER, 1930                    58

     We see an ABSTRACT BLACK AND WHITE DRAWING.       And we hear
     a woman's voice...

     AN OLD FINGER comes in pointing to a drawing. We see                  *
     Benjamin and Daisy, sitting close together on a sofa, and             *

59   INT. A ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT, 1930                 59

     We see Benjamin asleep in bed with one of the Old Men,
     MR. DAWS. The door opens. And Daisy, in her nightgown,
     has come inside... she slightly touches Benjamin...

                             DAISY
                    (whispers)
               Are you sleeping?

     He shakes "no."

                             DAISY (CONT'D)
                    (whispers)
               Come on...

     She moves quickly out of the room and Benjamin gets up,
     and with the aid of his cane, follows her...

60   INT. BACK STAIRWELL, NOLAN HOUSE - LATE NIGHT, 1930            60

     The old house still. Daisy, moving quietly down the
     stairs. Benjamin, his cane softly thumping the steps,
     following her.

                             BENJAMIN
                    (whispers)
               Where are we going?

     She doesn't say anything. She leads him into the DINING
     ROOM... where we see the wash has been draped, sheets and
     pillowcases, like ghosts over the dining room table, and
     a smaller side table, and a buffet...to dry...

                               DAISY
               Under here...

     And she ducks under a sheet, beneath the dining table...
     Benjamin follows her into the "fort..."

                             DAISY (CONT'D)
               Nobody knows about this but us.

     They sit... The little girl, and the old man with the
     maturity of a ten year old boy, enjoying their secret
     lair... She takes a candle out of the folds of her
     nightgown... She tries to light it, but doesn't really
     know how to use matches...

                                DAISY (CONT'D)
                  Will you light it?

                                DAISY
                  Don't be chicken...

     Despite his caution, he lights the candle... the
     candlelight making it feel more secret...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                  I'll tell you a secret then you
                  tell me one...
                       (whispers)
                  I saw mommy kissing another man.
                  Her face was red from it.

     Benjamin doesn't know what to say.

                                DAISY (CONT'D)
                  Your turn to tell.

                                BENJAMIN
                  I'm younger than I look.

                                DAISY
                       (whispers)
                  You don't seem like an old
                  person... like my grandma... Are
                  you sick?

                                BENJAMIN
                       (whispers)
                  I heard Tizzy and my mother
                  whisper. They said I was going to
                  die soon.
                       (smiles)
                  But I fooled them so far.

     Daisy looks at him in the flickering candlelight.

                                DAISY
                  You are different than anybody I
                  have ever met. Can I?

     She innocently reaches to touch the skin on his cheek to
     see what it feels like... When suddenly a sheet is pulled
     back and Daisy's grandmother is standing there.

                             GRANDMA FULLER
               What are you doing under there?
               Who's idea was this candle?

     She angrily blows it out... and... to Daisy... taking her
     by the arm...

                             GRANDMA FULLER (CONT'D)
               It's after midnight, you come
               right out here and get back up to
               bed...!
                    (and for Benjamin,
                     but saying it to
                     Daisy)
               You are not to be playing
               together! Play with people your
               own age...!
                    (moving her along)
               Now, you come back to bed, young
               lady...! You're too young to be
               wandering around in the night by
               yourself...
                    (and a last word to
                     Benjamin)
               You should be ashamed of yourself!

     And they're gone... Benjamin left sitting along under the
     sheets. There's a slight sound and he sees Queenie, in
     her nightgown, standing in the doorway...

                             QUEENIE
               You are a different child... a man
               child. People aren't going to
               understand how different you are.

                             BENJAMIN
                    (forlorn)
               What's wrong with me, Mother?

                             QUEENIE
               God hasn't said yet. Now, back to
               bed and behave yourself.

     He crosses up the back stairs with the aid of his cane,
     and Mr. Oti, like a spectre, is sitting on one end of the
     back steps smoking a cigarette, drinking form his flask.
     He looks at Benjamin as he goes by.

     bedroom --

61   INT. BEDROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - LATE NIGHT, 1930                 61

     Benjamin climbing back into bed with the Old Man.
     Turning his back to the old man. And Mr. Daws, unable to
     sleep...

                             MR. DAWS
               Did I ever tell you I've been
               struck by lightning seven times.
               Once, when I was fixing a leak on
               the roof.

     And we see just that, the old man on a roof getting
     blasted.

                             MR. DAWS (CONT'D)
               Once, when I was crossing the road
               to get the mail...

     And we see that, the man peacefully crossing a country
     road to get the mail, getting hit by lightning... But
     Benjamin just lays there looking out the window... all he
     can think about... despite everything...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               I never forgot her blue eyes...

62   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT           62

     The words linger. Daisy, her extraordinary blue eyes,
     lying on her death bed... the rattle of the window in the
     wind...

                             CAROLINE
               Are you alright, Mother?

     She nods "yes."

                                CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                  This man. He loved you from the
                  first time he saw you.

     She doesn't say anything.

                                CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                       (without complaint)
                  Nobody has ever loved me that way.

                                DAISY
                       (impelling her)
                  Go on.

                                CAROLINE
                  He crossed out something... and
                  then he's written... "When..."

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  "...When the baby came things were
                  different..."

63   INT. THE KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1931                     63

     We see Benjamin in his pajamas, quietly coming into the
     kitchen for something to eat... And he slows, seeing
     Queenie, taking a moment to herself, sitting at the
     kitchen table, peacefully breast-feeding her infant... as
     Benjamin slips back out unseen, closing the door after
     him...

64   INT. ATTIC, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1931                           64

     We see Benjamin lying on a small bed in the ATTIC...
     cluttered with years of accumulated things...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  I moved into my own room in the
                  attic... I realized, despite a
                  house filled with people that I
                  loved, I was alone...

     There's a noise. And we see Ngunda Oti is at the door, a
     suitcase in hand.

                                NGUNDA OTI
                  I come to say goodbye. I'm going
                  away.

                                 BENJAMIN
                  Going away?   Where?



                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                       46.

64   CONTINUED:                                                        64

                                NGUNDA OTI
                  I don't figure that out yet. I
                  will send you a postcard when I
                  get to there.

                                BENJAMIN
                  What about your friend?   The tall
                  lady?

                                NGUNDA OTI
                  We're not friends anymore. That's
                  what happens with tall people.

     He starts to go...

                                BENJAMIN
                  Goodbye...

     And he's gone.   Benjamin gets up going to the window.
     He looks outside. He can see Mr. Oti come onto the
     porch. There's a full moon. And as he walks off, his
     arrogant little walk, suitcase in hand, going out the
     gate, Benjamin watches him disappear into the night.

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  I spent a lot of time by myself
                  that year...

65   INT. FRONT ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, 1931                  65

     Benjamin sitting at a table, an old man to look at but no
     more than twelve, busy playing with magnets...

                                BENJAMIN (V.O)
                  Until...

     We see a refined, genteel OLD WOMAN, wearing a hat and
     gloves, a suitcase at her feet, flanked by an old DOG,
     just inside the front door...

                                BENJAMIN               (CONT'D)
                  Hello...

                                THE WOMAN
                  I'm moving in today.

     And just then Queenie appears, the baby on her hip...

                                QUEENIE
                  Welcome... we was expecting you...
                       (to Benjamin)
                  Could you show her upstairs?
                                (MORE)

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                                              47.

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  She will be staying in Mrs.
                  Rousseau's old room. I'll be
                  right with you with some fresh
                  towels...
                       (frowning)
                  We don't usually let dogs in the
                  house.

                                THE WOMAN
                  He's as old as the hills. Blind
                  too. Can hardly get around, he
                  won't be a bother much longer.

     Benjamin, like any young boy, immediately pets the old
     dog...

                                QUEENIE
                  I guess as long as he stays out
                  from underfoot.

     Benjamin helps her with her bags showing her up the
     stairs...the old dog dutifully following them...

                                BENJAMIN
                  I'm Benjamin...

     The woman starts to tell him her name... but we don't
     hear it because...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                       (after a beat)
                  As hard as I try, I can't remember
                  her name. Mrs. Lawson, or Mrs.
                  Hartford, or maybe it was Maple?
                  It's funny how sometimes the
                  people we remember the least, make
                  the greatest impression on us.

66   INT. THE OLDER WOMAN'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1931     66

     Benjamin sits petting the dog while the Woman puts her
     things away...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  I remember she wore diamonds...
                  and she always dressed in fine
                  clothing as if she was going out.
                  Although, she never did and nobody
                  would ever come to visit her.

                                                                    48.



67   INT. NOLAN HOUSE, PARLOR - VISITING DAY, 1931                  67

     We see the Woman dressed nicely, sitting in a chair
     reading a book. She takes a look out the window at the
     families on the lawn and bends back to her book.

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               ...She taught me how to play the
               piano...

68   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER NIGHT, 1932                 68

     The Woman sitting with Benjamin teaching him how to play
     piano...playing a classical piece like Chopin...Benjamin
     trying his hand...sounding pretty bad...

                             THE WOMAN
               It isn't how well you play, it's
               how you feel about what you're
               playing. (whispers) Try this.

     And she plays a ragtime piece...New Orleans music...music
     for the other whole part of the soul... Benjamin tries
     his hand and actually plays it fairly well

                             THE WOMAN (CONT'D)
               You cannot help but put your
               entire self into the music.

     And he plays along with her...a piece he won't soon
     forget...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               There were many changes going on,
               some you could see... some you
               couldn't.

69   INT. A BATHROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1932                     69

     We see Benjamin taking a bath. An he notices a single
     gray hair floating on the surface...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               Hair, had started growing, in all
               sorts of places...

     And he sees some hair is under his arms... and as he
     looks downward...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               Along with other things...

     Benjamin, naked, looking at himself in a mirror... like a
     young teenage boy...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                  I felt like I could do anything,
                  that I could sprout wings...

     And as he flexes his muscles, feeling like a man.

70   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT                  70

     It's started to rain, the wind blowing, splattering rain
     against the window. Knocking.

                                DAISY
                  Oh, darlin', the pain...

                                CAROLINE
                  I'll get the nurse...

     She hurries out of the room. Daisy looks out the window.
     The maelstrom of wind and rain. Caroline comes back with
     a Nurse.

                                THE NURSE
                  You're not feeling too good?

     She adjusts the morphine drip.      Daisy lays back.

                                THE NURSE (CONT'D)
                  Nobody seems to know whether to
                  stay or leave. The roads are
                  filled from New Orleans to Baton
                  Rouge already. I think I'm gonna
                  ride it out.
                       (finishing with the
                        drip)
                  There, that should make things
                  easier.

     Daisy starts to feel the effects of the drip...

                                THE NURSE (CONT'D)
                       (to Caroline)
                  Have you had a chance to say your
                  goodbyes?

     Caroline nods.    The Nurse nods.

                                THE NURSE (CONT'D)
                  My father waited four hours for my
                  brother to get here from Boger
                  City. He couldn't go without him.

     She affectionately touches Daisy's cheek.

                                THE NURSE (CONT'D)
                  She seems like a sweet woman.

     Caroline nods.

                                CAROLINE
                  I haven't spent as much time as I
                  would have like with her the last
                  few years.

     Another NURSE looks in...

                                THE WOMAN
                  You busy?

     The Nurse quickly   goes out of the room. Caroline sits
     back down looking   at her mother...Daisy opens her eyes...
     they look at each   other... Caroline knowing Daisy wants
     to hear the sound   of her voice...

                                CAROLINE
                       (taking up the book)

     Daisy shuts her eyes...

71   EXT. THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER - DAY, 1932                       71

     The busy docks... Men waiting, hoping to find work...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               These were hard times... people
               were doing anything they could to
               find work...

     And we see Benjamin, with Mr. Daws, "the lightning man,"
     sitting on a bench with a line of other old men, "killing
     time," watching the boats going up and down the River...

                             MR. DAWS
               Did I ever tell you I was struck
               by lightning seven times? Once,
               when I was in a field tending to
               my cows.

     And we see just that, Mr. Daws, along with a cow of his,
     being hit by lightning.

                             A MAN'S (V.O.)

               Anybody want to make $2 for a
               day's work around here...

     Benjamin turns... And he sees a man in his late 40s with
     his three man crew, standing on the deck of a TUGBOAT,
     and old rusted tug built out of charcoal iron... The man,
     its Captain MIKE... Has a thick Irish accent... For some
     reason none of the able-bodied men needing work
     respond...

                             CAPT. MIKE
               What's wrong, nobody wants to get
               their hands dirty...! Nobody wants
               to do an honest days work for an
               honest day's pay...!

                  Are all you afraid of workin' for
                  a livin'? Somebody got to want a
                  job...

     Benjamin suddenly springs up at the opportunity, waving
     his arms...

                                  BENJAMIN
                  I do...!

                  You got your sea legs old man?

                                BENJAMIN
                       (feeling his legs)
                  I do. I think.

                  your ass on board, we'll sure as
                  hell find out!

     And as Benjamin gets on the boat, heading out to sea...

72   EXT. TUGBOAT, MISSISSIPPI RIVER, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1932       72

     And we see Benjamin "learning the ropes..." Helping to
     tow the freighters, into and out of the River ports...
     Benjamin in this element, like a boy, his hair blowing,
     thrilled to be on the boat, thrilled by the adventure...
     willing to do anything...

                  working da two-a-days... This
                  littl' fat bastard, "tug Irish,"
                  what they calls them. They say
                  the Irish the only one's stupid
                  `nough to work a tug. Them and
                  the Portuguese, as we all know how
                  stupid them Portuguese is. I
                  fin'ly get up the nerves and tell
                  him... "I don't wanta spend da
                  rest of my life on a goddamn
                  tugboat...!" You know what I'm

                  You didn't want to spend the rest
                  of your life on a tugboat.

                  Absolutely, damn right! So you
                  know what my father says? He says
                  "Who the hell you think you are?"
                  "What the hell you think you can
                  do?" I tell him. "Well if you
                  askin' -- I want to be a artist."
                  He laughs. He says, "If God
                  wanted you to be an artist he
                  would made you one." "God wanted
                  you to work a tugboat just like
                  me, and that's what you goin' to
                  do?" "Now, if I ever hear you
                  mention art again, I'll throw you
                  overboard!" Well, I went and I
                  show him... I made myself an
                  artist...

     And he suddenly takes off his shirt, pulls down his
     pants... And we see he's covered, from head to toe, with
     "his artwork," and incredible array of tattoos...

      ready as he's ever going to be... As she looks at him, a
      look bordering on amazement...

77    INT. THE ROOM, WHORE HOUSE, FRENCH QUARTER - NIGHT, 1932      77

                                 THE GIRL
                   What are you, Dick Tracy or
                   something? I've got to rest...

      And that's just what she's doing... trying to catch her
      breath...

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (in heaven)
                   Again?

78    INT. PARLOR, WHORE HOUSE, THE QUARTER - LATER STILL, 1932     78

      And we see Benjamin, at the door, happily smiling...

                                  BENJAMIN
                   Thank you...

                                 THE GIRL
                        (hurting)
                   No, thank you...

      Benjamin, floating on air, hovering, never wants to
      leave...

                                 THE GIRL (CONT'D)
                   Have a nice night...

                                BENJAMIN
                  You'll be here tomorrow?

                                THE GIRL
                  Every night, but Sunday...

     And she's finally able to go...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  It sure made me understand the
                  value of earning a living... the
                  things it can buy you..

     Benjamin turns to leave... we hear footsteps... And we
     see a man, putting on a raincoat, coming downstairs from
     one of those other rooms... We see it's Benjamin's
     father... THOMAS BUTTON... Seeing Benjamin he slows...
     Benjamin, unaware of who he is, turns and goes out...

79   EXT. STREET, FRENCH QUARTER - LATE AT NIGHT, 1932              79

     It's a rainy night. Benjamin, feeling like a million
     bucks, walks along the street, going home... A
     chauffeured car pulls alongside him, the window rolled
     down... And we see Thomas Button in the car...

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  It's awful wet out. Can I offer
                  you a ride somewhere...?

                                BENJAMIN
                  That's very kind of you, Sir.

     He gets into the car.

80   INT. THOMAS' CAR, NEW ORLEANS - LATE AT NIGHT, 1932            80

     They drive in awkward silence.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  My name is Thomas, Thomas Button.

                                  BENJAMIN
                  I'm Benjamin.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                       (saying the name to
                        himself)
                  Benjamin... Yes, Benjamin... It's
                  a pleasure to know you.

     They shake hands.

                  Would you like to stop and have a
                  drink, Benjamin?

81   INT. BAR, FRENCH QUARTER - LATE AT NIGHT, 1932                    81

     A small old bar. Benjamin and his father sitting in the
     back... The waiter comes over, deferring to Benjamin's
     age...

                                THE WAITER
                  What will it be sir?

                                BENJAMIN
                  I'll have whatever he's having.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  A Sazerac for both of us...with
                  whiskey instead of brandy...

     The waiter leaves.

                                THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                  You don't drink do you?

                                BENJAMIN
                  It's a night for firsts...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                  How is that?

                                BENJAMIN
                  I've never been to a whore house
                  either.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  It's an... experience...

                                 BENJAMIN
                  It certainly is.
                       (and honestly)
                  I'm not very experienced about a
                  lot of things.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  That isn't a bad thing.

                                BENJAMIN
                  There's a first time for
                  everything.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  True enough. I don't mean to be
                  rude... but your hands seem awful
                  bent... It must be quite painful?

                                BENJAMIN
                  I don't really know what I have.
                  I have some form of a disease. I
                  have a lot of catching up to do.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  What kind of a disease?

                                BENJAMIN
                  I was born old.

     Thomas is quiet.    And for many things...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                  I'm sorry.

                                BENJAMIN
                       (guileless)
                  No need to be. Nothing wrong with
                  old age.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  I'm sorry about your disease.

                                BENJAMIN
                  My mother says we're all born with
                  something...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                  Your mother?

                                 BENJAMIN
                  I'm adopted.

     Thomas looks at him... They get their drinks... Tap
     glasses, and drink. Benjamin coughs at the taste... But
     forces it down... And as they laugh at his discomfort...

82   INT. THE BAR - FRENCH QUARTER - LATER THAT NIGHT, 1932          82

     Thomas and Benjamin deep in conversation... and both of
     them more than a few sheets to the wind... Benjamin,
     particularly overblown like any first time drunk...

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  ... My wife passed away many years

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  She died in childbirth.

     And there's a moment when it seems like Thomas might tell
     him, but despite the alcohol he thinks better of it...

                                THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                       (toasts, sadly)

                  To mothers and fathers...

     After some moments:

                                BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                  What line of work are you in, Mr.
                  Button?

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  Buttons. "Button's Buttons."
                  There isn't a button we don't
                  make. Our biggest competition is
                  B.F. Goodrich and his infernal
                  zippers...

     The waiter comes over.

                                THE WAITER
                  Would you gentlemen like another?

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  One more Benjamin?

                                BENJAMIN
                  If you'll let me pay for it, Mr.
                  Button...

     He takes out a little of his hard earned pay... proud of
     himself...

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  What kind of work do you do?

                                BENJAMIN
                       (proud of himself)
                  I'm a tugboat man.

                                                                    62.

     The car's stopped outside the gate... Benjamin is
     drunkenly getting out...

               I enjoyed talking to you...

                             BENJAMIN

     Benjamin slows...

               Would you mind, if time to time, I
               stopped by to say hello...?

                             BENJAMIN
                    (a drunken wave)
               Anytime.

                    (happily)
               Goodnight, Benjamin.

                    (drunkenly)
               Absolutely... Mr. Button...

     Benjamin turns inside. Thomas looks after him for a long
     moment... And then he drives away...

84   INT. NOLAN HOUSE - LATE NIGHT, 1932                            84

     Benjamin holding the railing for support starts up the

               Where have you been!?

     And we see Queenie has been sitting in the front room...
     where she can see out the window...

                             BENJAMIN

     He doesn't mention the whore... But generically says...

                                BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                  I think mama... I'm going to...

     And to finish the evening, he throws up.

85   EXT. LAWN, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, 1934                      85

     The family's on the lawn...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  I loved the weekends when she
                  would come and spend the night
                  with her grandmother.

86   INT. GRANDMA FULLER'S ROOM - DAWN, 1934                         86

     Daisy, nine now, asleep in bed with Grandma Fuller... We

     awake...

                       (whispers)
                  Do you want to see something?   We
                  have to keep it secret.

     Daisy, always willing, always brave, gets up...

                  Get dressed. I'll meet you behind
                  the kitchen...

     And he leaves the room as quickly as he came...

                  I think he has mejembe.
                       (shaking him)
                  Captain Mike... could you take us
                  out?

     Captain Mike opens one eye... sees them standing there...

                                CAPT. MIKE
                  You know what day it is?

                                   BENJAMIN
                  Sunday.

                                CAPT. MIKE
                  Do you know what dat mean?

     He doesn't.

                                CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
                  It means I was very drunk last
                  night.

                                BENJAMIN
                  You're drunk every night.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                              BENJAMIN
               A close friend... I wanted to show
               her the River.

                             CAPT. MIKE
               I'm not supposed to be joy-ridin'
               with civilians... I could lose my
               license.

     That notion stops him for about a nanosecond.

90   EXT. THE TUGBOAT, THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER - EARLY, 1934       90

     The tugboat making its way through the fog... Benjamin
     standing with Daisy on the prow... the wind in their
     faces... And suddenly out of the fog a HORN BLARES... As
     loud as anything they have ever heard... and moving out
     of the mist, horn still echoing, a huge ocean liner
     appears... With three other tugboats pushing it to sea...

                             CAPT. MIKE
               She put in for repair... a wounded
               duck... She's flyin' now...

     Captain Mike joins the tugs at the liner's side... the
     tugs sounding horns of their own... a symphony of a
     kind... What interests Benjamin...

                             BENJAMIN
               What does it take to build
               something like that?

     Passengers line the railing... continuing their
     adventure... And what interests Daisy...

                             DAISY
               Imagine all the places they're
               going to see...

     Daisy, thrilled, waves to them -- the passengers along
     the rail, waving back... Benjamin stands by Daisy, their
     hair blowing in the salty air....

                             DAISY (CONT'D)
                    (to Benjamin)
               I wish we could go with them...

     As they watch the liner, like a foggy dream, sailing
     away...

                                                                  66.



91   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT           91

     The rain and wind knocking at the window...

                             DAISY
                    (murmurs)
               I wish we could have...
                    (the morphine)

                             CAROLINE
               Did you say something, Mother?

     And there's a hint of anxiety in Caroline now... anxiety
     coupled with exhaustion... Daisy doesn't say anything.
     Caroline worriedly looks out the window.

                             CAROLINE (CONT'D)
               It seems to be getting worse.

     Daisy doesn't respond.

                             CAROLINE (CONT'D)
               Are you hearing me, mother?

                             DAISY
               Look at that... time just seeped
               out of me...

                               CAROLINE
               What?

                             DAISY
               Somebody will come and mop it up
               and that will be the end...

     Caroline can only listen... She takes a deep breath,
     gathering her strength...And when her mother's settled
     again...

                             CAROLINE
               Do you want me to go on reading?

     She murmurs, "Hmmm?" as if she didn't know Caroline had
     stopped. Caroline looks back down at the book.

                             CAROLINE (CONT'D)
               "Things were changing quickly."

92   INT. OLDER WOMAN'S ROOM   - NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY,       92

     TO SEE we're in his friend's room...

     haircut... the dog at their feet... the VICTROLA, as
     usual, is working overtime...

                             THE WOMAN
               I don't know how it's possible,
               you seem to have more hair...

                               BENJAMIN
                    (a   little arrogant)
               What if   I was to tell you I wasn't
               getting   older -- I was getting
               younger   than everybody else...

     And she then says, taking the wind out of his sails...

                             THE WOMAN
               Well, I'd feel very sorry for
               you... to have to see everybody
               you love, die before you.

     He's quiet, he hadn't thought of that...

                             THE WOMAN (CONT'D)
               That would be an awful
               responsibility...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               I had never thought about life or
               death that way before...

     He's still... And seeing he's upset, she says the most
     beautiful of things...

                             THE WOMAN
               Benjamin... We're meant to lose
               the people we love. How else
               would we know how important they
               are to us.

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               And one fall day... a familiar
               visitor came knocking on our
               door...

93   INT. NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, 1936                        93

     We see Benjamin knocking on the Woman's door...

                             BENJAMIN
               Would you like to go for a walk?

     There's no response. He opens it, going inside... The
     Woman is sitting in a chair by the window, the dog at her
     feet, the familiar Victrola playing dance music... He
     comes around the chair. And he sees she's still...
     perfectly still... her soul moved on...

                                                                  68.



94   EXT. CEMETERY PLOT, NEW ORLEANS CEMETERY - DAY, 1936         94

     We see an old New Orleans paupers' cemetery... Benjamin
     and the mourners, and because he can't remember her name,
     around an unmarked grave...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               She had taught me how to play the
               piano.

     As Benjamin watches the woman go to her final rest.

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               And she taught me what it meant to
               miss somebody.

95   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, ATTIC - NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1937        95

     We see Benjamin taking some things out of a dresser
     drawer, packing a suitcase...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               I had gone to a whore house, I'd
               had my first drink, I had said
               goodbye to one friend and buried
               another... In 1937, when I was
               coming to end of the 17th year of
               my life, I packed by bag.

     We see him putting some final things into the suitcase,
     closing it...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               ...and said goodbye...

96   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1937            96

     We see Benjamin moving through the parlor, one by one,
     saying his good-byes to the old people...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               I knew, life being what it was, I
               would probably never see them
               again...

     The familiar faces... And as we watch him affectionately
     touch or talk to each of them... we can just see out a
     screen window DAISY, almost thirteen now, leaning against
     the side of the house... Out of sight... as if she didn't
     say goodbye, he wouldn't leave...

                                                                    69.



97   EXT. THE FRONT PORCH - NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1937                 97

     We see TIZZY on the porch holding Benjamin's suitcase for
     him... The woman's old dog lying beside him...

                             TIZZY
                    (shaking his hand)
               Good luck, son.

     And we see Queenie has come out onto the porch with her
     little girl... and he holds Queenie... tears running down
     her face...

                             BENJAMIN
               Goodbye, Mother...

     He bends to pet the old dog goodbye... He takes up his
     suitcase and starts off the porch... going down the
     walkway... he hesitates, and opens the gate... moving out
     onto the street... When suddenly Daisy is calling him...

                             DAISY
               Benjamin... Benjamin...

     She comes running.   He stops to let her catch up to
     him...

                             DAISY (CONT'D)
               Where are you going?

                               BENJAMIN
               To sea.    I'll send you a postcard.

                             DAISY
               From everywhere. Write me a
               postcard from everywhere...

     And with so much she wants to say, she can't say
     anything. So she runs away... He watches her go,
     watchers her thin legs running back down the street...
     and he turns and moves off along the street...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               And I went off to sea...

     We see him in the distance, the "old man", a 17 year old,
     suitcase in hand, going to find out who he is and what he
     is to become...

                  There's a box of them... in a
                  velvet bag...

     Caroline, not sure what she wants, opens a red velvet
     bag... she finds a wooden cigar box...

     with postcards... Daisy, going through them...

                                DAISY (CONT'D)

                  Newfoundland... Baffin Bay...
                  Liverpool... Glasgow...Narvik...

     She takes one out, reading it... Taking up some others...
     looking... reading where they came from... reading off
     like an adventure...

     Daisy, the postcards, fond memories spread out on the bed
     around her...

                Who got along fine at sea... but
                for some reason, once they were on
                dry land... couldn't stand the
                sight of each other...

101   EXT. DOCK SOMEWHERE - DAY, 1937                             101

      The brothers getting off the tug... and no sooner have
      they hit dry land they immediately get into a fist
      fight...

                   There was John Grimm, who fit his
                   name... from Belvedere, South
                   Dakota...

102   EXT. TUGBOAT, AT SEA -- DUSK, 1937                              102

      We see a dour looking man... who always expects the
      worst...

                                 JOHN GRIMM
                   You know one in every eight boats
                   never returns, all hands lost at
                   sea.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   ...and Pleasant Curtis who never
                   said a word to anyone... except to
                   himself...

      The asocial Pleasant... talking to himself as he works...

103   EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY, 1938                                 103

      Benjamin standing on the bow of the old tug as it sloughs
      through a fog on the high seas... ready to see the world.

                   I wrote him constantly... told him
                   everything I was doing...

105   EXT. HARBOR SOMEWHERE - NIGHTFALL, 1938                         105

      The tug on its way in for the night... Benjamin, sitting
      on a cleat, reading her letter...

                                 DAISY'S (V.O.)
                   ...I told him they had invited me
                   to New York to audition for the
                   School of American Ballet...

      Tilting from the grey sky, onto an old landmark building.

107   INT. LANDMARK BUILDING, DANCE LOFT, NEW YORK - DAY, 1938        107

      A large open DANCE LOFT. And we see Daisy, dancing for a
      selection committee seated on metal chairs...

      Daisy moving with technical proficiency -- but it's
      bloodless, without any real distinction... She gets nods -
      - but no kudos...

                                 DAISY'S (V.O.)
                   One of the "corps"... another
                   dancing gypsy...

      We see Daisy training... just another lithe body.

108   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT                 108

      Daisy in bed... Picking up another postcard, she stops,
      reading, slowing at a painful memory...

                                 DAISY
                   Oh. Then he wrote me... "I've met
                   somebody... and I've fallen in
                   love..."

109   INT. LANDMARK BUILDING, DANCE LOFT, NEW YORK, NIGHT, 1941 109

      And we see Daisy, sitting on the dance floor reading the
      very same POSTCARD, brokenhearted...

                                 A MAN
                   Places everybody... Once again...

      The troupe moves into their places...Daisy still just
      part of the crowd... The music starts... Now as Daisy
      dances... it is filled with pathos and lost love...and
      everyone takes notice.

110   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT                 110

      Daisy reading the very postcard some sixty odd years
      later... as if reading it for the first time...

                                 DAISY
                   "...I've met somebody...and I've
                   fallen in love..." My, that was
                   over...
                        (and realizing)
                   ...sixty years ago.

      She's quiet, looking out the window...

                                 CAROLINE
                   Did you love him, mother?

                                 DAISY
                   What can a girl know about love?

      Daisy stares at the window, the constant beating rain,
      the water running down the window...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                Murmansk is on the Barrent Sea,
                the only ice-free ocean port in
                the Soviet Union...

111   EXT. MURMANSK HARBOR, RUSSIA - DAY, 1941                    111

      We see "Chelsea" working with other tugs as snow falls in
      the crowded Russian Harbor.

      They tow a large freighter into port.

                              CAPT. MIKE
                Benjamin...

      Benjamin, who is coiling rope on the bow, stands and
      looks at the Captain.

                              CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
                     (squinting down at
                      him, wanting to
                      know)
                Tell me how's it happen you showed
                up you were no bigger than a
                bollard. Now either I drink a
                helluva lot more than I think I
                do, or you sprouted... What's your
                secret?

      And Benjamin, tired of explanations, and what comes first
      to mind...

                              BENJAMIN
                Well Captain, you do drink a
                lot...

      And that makes perfect sense to Mike...

                              CAPT. MIKE
                     (taking a drink,
                      saluting)
                Goddamn right I do!

      And Benjamin stands on the bow... ready to see the
      world...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                We stayed at a small hotel with
                the grand name, "The Winter
                Palace."

                                                                   74A.

      Snow covers the street outside of a turn-of-the Century
      hotel... a front window looks into its lobby... "The
      Winter Palace Hotel."

113   INT. "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - NIGHT, 1941                   113

      There's a packed BAR off the lobby... We see Benjamin
      sitting with Captain Mike, their crew, and a mixture of
      other seamen, Russians and other ethnics, all speaking
      different languages, sitting and standing around tables
      cluttered with bottles and glasses... Captain Mike,
      drunk, his shirt off, is telling a Russian sailor,
      another interpreting for him -- about a tattoo he has
      over his heart... an upside down hummingbird...

                              CAPT. MIKE
                I saws this tattoo puts on a man's
                back in Singapore by Sakumoro, the
                greatest tattoo artist ever lived.
                I puts it on myself from mem'ry.

      And now we know why it's upside down...

                              CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
                This idn't just anoter bird! Its
                heart rate's twelve hunerd beats a
                minute...! Its wings beats eighty
                times a second...! If you was to
                stop their wings from beatin, they
                would be dyin' in less than ten
                seconds...This is no ordinary
                bird, this is a frikkin' miracle!
                They slowed down the wings
                              (MORE)

                   what it showed, they wing tips are
                   doin' dis...

      And he draws on a napkin a FIGURE EIGHT...

                                 CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
                   Does you know what the figure-
                   eight is the mathematical symbol
                   of...?!

      Pointing at the symbol...

                                 CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
                   Infinity!

      And for some drunken reason, no matter what language they
      might speak, they all laugh...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   Everybody, no matter what
                   differences they had, the
                   languages, the color of their
                   skin, had one thing in common...
                   they were drunk every single
                   night...

      Then there's a shout -- and as if to underscore things,
      the Brody twins are kicking the shit out of each other
      again...

114   INT. LOBBY, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - NIGHT, 1941               114

      We see Benjamin waiting for the small caged elevator to
      take him to his room. He gets in, the elevator operator
      about to shut the grill door...

                                 A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
                   Would you wait, please...

      And we see a WOMAN in her late 40s... getting on the
      elevator... Benjamin looks over at her...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   Her name was Elizabeth Abbott. She
                   was not beautiful. She was plain
                   as paper... But she was as pretty
                   as any picture to me...

      "Plain as paper," ELIZABETH ABBOTT... Directly behind her
      walks a tall, tired man, in his 50s... By the look of his
      ruddy face, and her silent mien... they're both drunk...
      Benjamin finds himself looking at her...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   What are you looking at?

      She has a distinctly English accent. Benjamin doesn't say
      a word.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   If you must know, we have a long
                   standing agreement never to go to
                   bed sober. Isn't that right
                   darling?

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   Her husband was Walter Abbott...He
                   was Chief Minister of the British
                   Trade Mission in Murmansk... and
                   he was a spy...

      They ride up. Elizabeth has her shoes off...She sees him
      noting her stocking feet... The elevator finally rattles
      to a stop, and George and Elizabeth get off... Starting
      down the hall...she abruptly turns to say to Benjamin...
      so that it's completely understood...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   I broke the heel off of one of my
                   shoes...I don't usually walk
                   around in my bare feet...

      And as he watches her saunter along the hallway... the
      way drunks do... endeavoring to keep her dignity...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   They were long days there...

115   EXT. MURMANSK HARBOR, RUSSIA - DAY, 1941                    115

      Benjamin on the tug, but it's less fun now, not much
      adventure, just hard work... Fighting the snow and the
      wind, they tow a large freighter into port...

      night...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                And longer nights...

      He lays on his bed looking out at the dark sky... the
      snow falling...

                   One particular night... when I was
                   having trouble sleeping...

117   INT. "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - LATE NIGHT, 1941                117

      Benjamin trudges down the stairs, stepping tentatively
      into the empty lobby... He slows, seeing ELIZABETH ABBOTT
      in her bathrobe, sitting, alone and lonely... and it's
      not the first time for her...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I'm sorry... I can't sleep...

      She's quiet... She finally looks up... but doesn't say
      anything... There's an awkward moment...exacerbated by
      the stillness of the hotel in the middle of the night...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   I was going to make some
                   tea...would you like some?

      She shakes her head no... He crosses through the empty
      bar, into an old KITCHEN... He looks for tea... Puts
      water in a kettle... As he watches the kettle boil...
      Elizabeth, her arms folded across her chest as if she
      were chilled, stands by the door... Benjamin, without
      asking, takes a cup for her...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Milk...? Honey...?

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   Some honey, thank you.

      He finds a large honey jar... and seeing some dead flies
      in with the sweet syrup he asks...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Do you like flies with your tea?

      She smiles...for the first time... A thin smile... He
      starts to stir the tea... Elizabeth stopping him...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   You must let it steep for a
                   minute...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Steep?

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   Sit. There's a proper way to make
                   tea.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Where I'm from, they just want it
                   to be hot.

      She doesn't smile. He gives her a cup of tea... She
      cradles the cup... They're quiet, drinking their
      tea...two strangers... After some moments...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   You're a seaman? I don't mean to
                   be rude...but aren't you rather
                   old to be working on a boat?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   There's no age limit... as long as
                   you can do the work...

      She nods... They're quiet again. She sits at an old wood
      counter.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   You have trouble sleeping?

      It's an invitation to sit with her... He pulls a stool
      over sitting across from her...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I didn't know I did... I usually
                   sleep like a baby. Something kept
                   me up.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   I never sleep... Well, rarely
                   anyway...

      He doesn't say anything.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   My father, when he was in his
                   eighties, was so sure he was going
                   to die in his sleep... He would
                   only take naps during the
                   afternoon... so that death
                   couldn't catch him...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Did he?

                Did he what?

                              BENJAMIN
                Die in his sleep?

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                He died sitting in his favorite
                chair listening to his favorite
                program on the radio.

                              BENJAMIN
                     (smiles)
                He must have known something.

      She smiles at the idea... Another one... that goes as
      quickly as it's come... And it's quiet again...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                My husband's the British Trade
                Minister. We've been here fourteen
                months... We were supposed to be
                going to Peking... but it just
                never did work out. It never does
                seem to work out. Have you been to
                the Far East?

                              BENJAMIN
                I haven't really been anywhere. I
                mean outside different harbors.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                Where are you from?

                              BENJAMIN
                New Orleans, Louisiana.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                     (pure Elizabeth)
                I didn't know there was another
                one.

      Which escapes him.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                I've never been to America.
                Everywhere else. But not America.
                Am I missing anything?

                              BENJAMIN
                     (simply, guileless)
                The Mississippi River.

                And she told me all the places she
                had been, and what she had seen...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                I can tell you what bars look like
                in places all over the world...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                And we talked until just before
                the dawn...

118   INT. KITCHEN, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - DAYBREAK, 1941       118

      The first hint of daylight...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                Thank you for the tea...

      She leaves as quietly as she entered... Benjamin remains
      standing for a moment...then shuts the light off behind
      him.

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                ...And we went back to our
                rooms... to our separate lives...

      And as he goes back up the quiet stairs...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                And every night... we would meet
                in the middle Of the night...

119   INT. LOBBY, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - DEAD OF NIGHT, 1941 119

      Benjamin padding downstairs... slowing... happy to see
      Elizabeth, in her bathrobe, sitting in the empty lobby,
      waiting for him...

120   INT. KITCHEN, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - BEFORE DAWN, 1941 120

      Elizabeth and Benjamin quietly talking...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                A hotel in the middle of the night
                can be a magical place...

      And we see the empty front desk and tiny silver bell...
      The vacant lobby, with its musty old rugs... The open
      elevator, waiting... The dining room, with its crisp
      white tablecloths.

                   A radiator hissing. A sink
                   dripping. A floor creaking. A
                   curtain blowing.

      We see and hear it all... All the little sounds, a
      symphony, that make up life in a hotel in the middle of
      the night... Benjamin and Elizabeth sitting quietly
      drinking their tea.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   There is something peaceful, even
                   comforting, knowing that people
                   you love are asleep in their beds,
                   where nothing can harm them...

      Queenie and Tizzy asleep together in her bed... Their
      child on the floor... The old people in their beds in the
      old house. Ngunda Oti asleep in a room somewhere. The
      unnamed woman's grave. A different kind of sleep. And of
      course Daisy, in a New York apartment loft with other
      dancers... sleeping peacefully.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Why do you say that?

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   Married women don't usually sit
                   with strange men in a hotel in the
                   middle of the night. I certainly
                   don't.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (honestly)
                   I don't know what married women do
                   or don't do.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   Let's get one thing straight. I
                   love him very much. I happen to
                   think he is one of the smartest
                   and most considerate men I ever
                   met. It is not his fault I decided
                   to spend my life in his shadow.

      And with that she gets up and leaves... Benjamin, left
      with that thought...

123   INT. DINING ROOM, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - NIGHT, 1941         123

      Benjamin and Elizabeth in the empty dining room at a
      table with a white tablecloth... with some wine and
      cheese... She's laughing now, measurably loosened up...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   He started to take his pants
                   off... I'm afraid he misread me
                   completely...

      He laughs. She looks through her wine glass at him...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   Do you notice how people look
                   better through a wine glass...

      He holds his up.... looking at her....She moves her glass
      just looking at him...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   You're a good looking man with or
                   without a wine glass...

      She picks at the tablecloth with her finger next to
      his... She puts her finger over his making a cross...

                   We are all just crossing in the
                   night. Sometimes we intersect.

      She leaves her finger there for a moment... lingering...
      She abruptly moves it away...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   I should go to bed... he'll be up
                   soon.

      She hesitates... And she kisses him, and then hurries out
      of the dining room... As Benjamin sits in the empty
      dining room... the kiss left on his lips...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   It was the first time a woman had
                   ever kissed me. It's something you
                   never forget.

                   Are you upset, Mother?

      She doesn't say anything. Caroline, seeing her feet have
      come out of the covers, caring, fixes her blanket.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                   Would you like some socks?

      Daisy's quiet.

                   Do you want me to stop reading?

      Daisy's answer for her is...

                                 DAISY
                   It must have been very cold. I'm
                   glad he had somebody to keep him
                   warm.

      Which Caroline takes as her cue to read on...

                   are...

      She laughs, taking his arm, walking to the dining room as
      if going to dinner... They sit at a table... which she
      has set for them... Caviar and Vodka...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   Don't bother with the cheese or
                   the wine here, they're quite
                   common... but the caviar and the
                   vodka are plentiful and sublime...

      She feeds him a spoonful of the caviar...Unaccustomed to
      it, he swallows it too quickly...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   Take your time... If you eat it
                   all at once there will be nothing
                   left to enjoy... savor it...

      She gives him another spoonful... and takes one
      herself... He takes his time... They both do... savoring
      it...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                        (pouring)
                   Now, a swallow of vodka...

      Which they do... She laughs... Looking at him...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   You haven't been with many women
                   have you?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   No. Not many. At least none on a
                   Sunday.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                        (smiles)
                   I feel like I'm with a virgin.

      She's not far off... And it's a lovely thought... and it
      makes her think of her youth.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                When I was nineteen, I tried to
                become the first woman to swim the
                English Channel...

126   EXT. THE ENGLISH CHANNEL ­ DAY, 1911                        126

      And we see just that....Young Elizabeth, in goggles, her
      body covered with grease, swimming with two escort boats
      across the English Channel.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.)
                The current was so strong...that
                for every stroke I took... I was
                pushed two strokes back...

      And we see just that, Elizabeth fighting the current...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.)
                              (CONT'D)
                I swam for 32 hours... I was only
                two miles from the French shore...

      Elizabeth in sight of the lights of Calais...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.)
                              (CONT'D)
                When it started to rain...

      And it starts to rain on her... Harder and harder... the
      shore is suddenly gone from sight...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.)
                              (CONT'D)
                When I couldn't go any further,
                and I just stopped...

      And we see her being taken onto a boat, a blanket wrapped
      around her...

127   EXT. CALAIS, BEACH - NIGHT, 1911                            127

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.)
                They asked me whether I would try
                again...?

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                Why wouldn't I?

      She smiles, a young girl, full of life...

                                                                   86.



128   INT. DINING ROOM - "WINTER PALACE" - LATE NIGHT, 1941        128

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                I never did. As a matter of fact,
                I have never done much of anything
                with my life after that...

      And it's quiet. She touches his rough hand.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                Your hands are very rough... you
                have grease under your nails...

      She runs her fingernail along his face...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                I can feel the wind on your
                face...

      They look at each other. And this time, Benjamin kisses
      her. It lingers... She stops herself...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                I'm afraid it's the witching
                hour...

      She quickly gets up... And she's gone. As Benjamin sits
      in the empty dining room.

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                It took me a long time to go to
                sleep.

129   INT. "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - ANOTHER LATE NIGHT, 1941      129

      We see Elizabeth nicely dressed, a bottle of champagne in
      her hand, sitting anxiously waiting. The elevator doors
      open. Benjamin in a suit and tie, as handsome as we've
      seen him steps out. She stands, takes his arm.

                              BENJAMIN
                Do I look okay? I borrowed it from
                one of the men. It's his church
                suit.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                You take my breath away.

      She walks with him, champagne bottle in hand, through the
      empty lobby...




                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   The thing about clothing is, it
                   should make you feel comfortable,
                   then you will be comfortable...
                   Come, let's take a walk...

130   EXT. MURMANSK, RUSSIA - DEAD OF NIGHT, 1941                    130

      Their arms in each other's, their breath showing in the
      night, they walk through the sleeping Russian town, their
      shadows in the moonlight. They stop to share a drink from
      the champagne bottle. They laugh.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I feel so much younger when I'm
                   with you...

      And it seems he's about to go on... But Elizabeth,
      flattered, takes it metaphorically...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   That's such a nice thing to say.
                   You make me feel years younger,
                   too. I wish I was. I would
                   change so many things. I would
                   undo all of my mistakes.

                                    BENJAMIN
                   What mistakes?

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   I kept waiting, thinking I would
                   do something to change my
                   circumstance... Do something...
                   But I never did... It's an awful
                   waste, you can never get it
                   back... wasted time...

      They're quiet.    She looks at him.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                        (abruptly)
                   If we're going to have an affair,
                   you're never to look at me during
                   the day, we must always part by
                   sunrise, and we can never say "I
                   love you..."

      He's quiet...




                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                   88.

130   CONTINUED:                                                  130

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   And when it is over I will send
                   you a card that will simply say
                   goodbye... Those are the rules...

      They stand in the cold. His answer is...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Are you as cold as I am?

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                        (laughs)
                   My god, colder.

      They stop to finish what's left of the champagne,
      Elizabeth hurling the bottle. The bottle falling silently
      into some fresh snow.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   You can't even break a bottle
                   here.

      They look at each other and they kiss. And without
      anything else needing to be said, they start back...

131   INT. LOBBY, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - LATE NIGHT, 1941      131

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   Get a key.

      Benjamin goes behind the registration desk, taking an
      empty room key off a hook... They cross to the
      elevator...

132   INT. ELEVATOR, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - LATE NIGHT, 1941 132

      They stand in the elevator as it ascends. Anticipating
      what's to come...

133   INT. HALLWAY, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - LATE NIGHT, 1941    133

      They move along a dark hallway. He quietly unlocks an
      empty room door... And as he follows her into the room...
      the door closing.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   She was the first woman who ever
                   loved me.

                                                                  89.



134   INT. "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - ANOTHER DAY, 1941            134

      Benjamin, in his peacoat, and stocking cap, snow on him,
      hurries into the hotel from work... He runs to the
      elevator, the doors just closing.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Hold it...

      It opens. He goes inside.      And Elizabeth's husband is
      standing in the elevator.

135   INT. ELEVATOR, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - LATE DAY, 1941     135

      They silently ride up, not a word exchanged. The
      elevator stops. Elizabeth's husband gets out. As he
      quietly walks down the hall...

                                 BENJAMIN'S (V.O.)
                   We saw each other every night...
                   we always used the same room...

136   INT. HALL "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - NIGHT TO DAWN, 1941     136

      We see the key going into the door... Benjamin and
      Elizabeth going inside closing the door behind them...
      leaving us with the quiet hallway.

                                 BENJAMIN'S (V.O.)
                   But each time seemed new and
                   different...

      And we see them as dawn creeps along the hallway,
      Benjamin and Elizabeth, leaving the room, not wanting to
      part, passionately kissing, and as they start to go their
      separate ways...

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (whispering)
                   Elizabeth...

      She turns.

                                  BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                        (whispers)
                   You should swim the English
                   channel again.

      And as she laughs to herself and hurries off...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   Until one night...

                                                                   90.



137   INT. "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - ANOTHER NIGHT, 1941           137

      We see Benjamin coming down the stairs, into the lobby to
      meet Elizabeth. And he slows...Elizabeth isn't there. He
      looks into the bar...the kitchen....the dining room... He
      goes back to the lobby, sitting on a lone sofa, waiting
      for her... A mouse runs across the marble floor, stops,
      looks at him and runs off... And he sits and waits.

138   INT. LOBBY, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - EARLY MORNING, 1941 138

      Snow shrouds the windows. We see Benjamin has fallen
      asleep on the sofa... There's the distinctive BELLOW of
      Captain Mike's VOICE. Benjamin wakes... He follows the
      bellowing to find Captain Mike with the tugboat CREW in
      the bar...

                              CAPT. MIKE
                Roosevelt says we all got to do
                our part! After them Japs
                attacked Pearl Harbor everyone's
                got to! The Chelsea's been
                commissioned to serve in the
                United States Navy, to repair,
                tow, salvage and rescue... Anybody
                don't want to go to war, now's the
                time to say so... Once you set
                foot on that boat again, you're in
                the Navy friend!

                              BENJAMIN
                     (right away)
                I'll go captain!

                              CAPT. MIKE
                Easy old timer.
                     (to the men)
                I'll hold it against no man. But
                speak up now or forever hold your
                water.

      And the Cook, Prentis Mayes...

                              THE COOK
                I was planning on talking to you
                Cap'n Mike... My wife's doing
                poorly. I'd like to see her one
                more time...

                              CAPT. MIKE
                     (understanding)
                You're free to get home any way
                you can Mr. Mayes.

      And the cook walks off.

                                 JOHN GRIMM
                        (always dour)
                   Who do you intend to have cook
                   then? One of the leading causes
                   of death at sea is food poisoning,
                   right after inadequate safety
                   equipment.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I grew up cooking, sir. I'll take
                   the job, if I'm not too old to
                   serve.

                                 CAPT. MIKE
                   You a real Johnny on the Spot,
                   Benjamin. I'll take any able

      And with no one dissenting...

                                 CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
                   Then that's it! We's goin' to
                   war, gentlemen!

      And filled with fervor, they give a cheer.

139   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, "WINTER PALACE" LATER, 1941               139

      Benjamin unlocking the door to his room. An ENVELOPE has
      been left under the door, he opens it.

                                 BENJAMIN'S (V.O.)
                   She had left a note. She wrote,
                   "it was nice to have met you."
                   That was it.

      And as he stands holding the letter in his room at the
      small Russian hotel:

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   And so, I went to war.

140   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN, SOMEWHERE - NIGHT, 1941           140

      The men on the tug on a dark gray sea....

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   It wasn't the war we expected. We
                   would tow crippled ships... scraps
                   of metal...

                   across the high seas... If there
                   was a war, we didn't see it...

      And what seemed exciting, the idea of war... is
      tedious... The "Chelsea" towing a strange hulking shape
      on the dark, empty sea...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   There was a man assigned with
                   us... The Chief Gunner loved the
                   Navy, and most of all, he loved
                   America.

                                 THE MAN'S (V.O.)
                   There is no other country in the
                   world...! When YOU spell America,
                   A.M.E.R.I.C.A. You're spelling
                   freedom...!

      We see the young Gunnery Mate, no more than nineteen...
      sitting at his post on a high caliber machine gun...
      ready to kick some enemy ass...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   His name was Dennis Smith and he
                   was a full blooded Cherokee... His
                   family had been in America for
                   over five hundred years.

                                 DENNIS SMITH
                   You have these pacifists. They
                   say they won't fight on
                   conscience. Where would we be if
                   everybody decided to act according
                   to their conscience?

                                 CAPT. MIKE
                        (out his Window)
                   Keeps it down, would you chief!

      He goes back inside... And as they settle into their
      tasks..

                                 DENNIS SMITH
                        (on his gun, to
                         himself, the last
                         word)
                   Where else can you shoot white
                   people and get away with it...

      Benjamin's the only one around to hear him...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   I worked in the kitchen...

                                                                   93.



141   INT. THE TUGBOAT KITCHEN - DAY, 1941                         141

      Benjamin busy preparing a meal in the galley kitchen. The
      Perpetually silent Pleasant Curtis, on kitchen duty,
      helping him with the preparation... while they work...

                              BENJAMIN
                     (trying to make
                      conversation)
                You're from the Kentucky mountains
                aren't you? It must be pretty
                there..

      Pleasant Curtis doesn't say a word. Benjamin shrugging,
      puts the pie in an oven.

142   INT. THE GALLEY - TUGBOAT - NIGHT                            142

      The men; including Dennis Smith, Pleasant Curtis, John
      Grimm, the "fighting" Brody twins, Benjamin serving them,
      silently eating dinner, rolling with endless rolling
      Ocean. Pleasant, not interested, just gets up and leaves.

                              JOHN GRIMM
                There's something not normal about
                him.

      As they silently eat, mostly bored...

                              DENNIS SMITH
                     (looking outside)
                Whoever said "War is hell,"
                doesn't know shit from shinola.

143   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN -- ANOTHER NIGHT, 1942          143

      We see "Chelsea," a steel tow line splayed out from its
      winch, towing a large crippled freighter across the
      ocean...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                We were towing a British
                freighter, that had gone dead in
                the water, 800 miles to Halifax
                for repair...

      We see Benjamin and the crew watching the ship on the tow
      line run out some thousand feet behind them...

144   INT. CREW QUARTER, TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942     144

      We see Benjamin awake in his bunk, Dennis Smith asleep in
      the bunk above him.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

144   CONTINUED:                                                     144

      Pleasant Curtis seemingly asleep in his bunk below him...
      Benjamin looking out at the black sea... and out of the
      silence Pleasant Curtis for the first time speaks...

                                  PLEASANT CURTIS
                   I've been watching you. You seem
                   trustworthy. If something happens
                   to me... could you see this gets
                   to my wife...?

      He hands Benjamin a folded up handkerchief...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   He had given me all of his pay...
                   he hadn't spent a dime of it...

                                 PLEASANT CURTIS
                   If anything happens I want my
                   family to know I was thinking
                   about them, and if I could have,
                   I'd have come back home.

      And that said he turns back over... And as Benjamin looks
      at the dark foreboding sea... suddenly:

                                 CAPT. MIKE (OVER)
                        (calls)
                   All hands on deck!!!

      They bolt from their bunks... Going outside...

145   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942                     145

      Captain Mike stands by the wheelhouse... silently looking
      at the ocean... They see bodies of men, dead men,
      floating by them... One and two at first... then three
      and four... and then more and more until they are moving
      through a carpet of bodies...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   The war found us.

      As they move through the water... their propeller
      literally chopping up bodies, to where they have to
      veritably shut their engines down...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D)
                   A transport carrying 900 men had
                   been hit by a torpedo. We were
                   first to arrive at the scene...

      And as the tug arrives at the scene we see a TRANSPORT
      VESSEL, with a gaping hole in its midships sinking
      quickly... Fuel oil burning on the water...
                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                       95.

145   CONTINUED:                                                      145

      It's then we see the true horror of the men in the
      water... in the burning black oil... The transport boat
      silently slips into the water, disappearing under the
      sea...

146   EXT. TUGBOAT - ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942                     146

      As the tug moves through the thick black smoke...
      Benjamin and the other crewmen watching along the
      rails...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   There wasn't a sound...

      Except for the   lapping of water, and the tugboat's
      engines, there   isn't... just the silence of death...
      Something else   appears, doming onto the surface like a
      spectre... the   U-BOAT that had reeked this havoc...
      looking to see   the results... Captain Mike sees the
      sub...

                                 CAPT. MIKE
                        (mad as hell)
                   We can't run from the fucker and
                   we can't hide...! There's only one
                   thing we can do...!
                        (and he shouts)
                   Battle Stations...!!!

      They run to their battle stations...

147   INT. PILOT HOUSE, TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942         147

      Captain Mike at the wheel in the pilot house, turning the
      tug, furiously bearing down on the surfaced submarine...

148   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942                      148

      A German submariner, on the conning tower, seeing the
      Tugboat, turns the .50 caliber machine gun on the
      tugboat... Benjamin is grazed by a bullet, his forehead
      cut open, bleeding... Despite the strafing the tug is
      relentless... The submarine, seeing it is about to be
      rammed tries to dive... but it's too late... the tugboat
      ramming the submarine... severing the U-Boat in half. The
      concussion of the collision has triggered a torpedo in
      the sinking submarine's torpedo shaft, the torpedo
      exploding, bursting the submarine, and in the process,
      blasting away under the stern of the tugboat... the men
      on the stern blown to pieces... Benjamin's literally
      thrown against the wheel house... He manages to get to
      his feet, the tug listing, beginning to sink... There's a
      man's voice...

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                      96.

      And he sees, Captain Mike riddled with bullets, his body
      covered with blood... Benjamin bends to him... Captain
      Mike trembling as he lays dying...

                                 CAPT. MIKE
                   Look at what they did! They shot
                   holes in me! They shots the hell
                   out my paintin'!

      His body, his tattoos, like a ripped canvas, is
      riddled...

                                 CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
                   You've seen a lot of things. Tell
                   me it's going to be alright.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You're going to heaven Captain
                   Mike. You're going to heaven.

      Benjamin sits beside him, his friend Captain Mike, dying.
      And a light comes in Captain Mike's eyes... an
      understanding.

                                 CAPT. MIKE
                   You can be mad as a mad dawg at
                   the way things wents... You can
                   swear, curse the fates, regret
                   every'ting you ever dids... but
                   when it comes to the end... You
                   have to lets go...

      He looks in Benjamin's old eyes....

                                 CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
                   Give me a hand, old man...

      And as he holds Benjamin's hand ready to meet his
      maker...

149   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - LATE AFTERNOON, 1942            149

      There are two destroyers and a hospital ship in the
      battle zone flow... Planes circling... The water still
      speckled with debris, and bodies...

150   EXT. A LIBERTY SHIP, THE NORTH ATLANTIC - DUSK, 1942           150

      We see Benjamin at the railing of a Liberty Ship.. He
      watches the "Chelsea" sink, disappearing under the sea...

                   736 men died that day... I said my
                   goodbyes to the Cherokee, Dennis
                   Smith, John Grimm who was right,
                   he was going to die there... I
                   sent Pleasant Curtis' wife his
                   money... I said goodbye to the
                   twin, Vic Brody...

      He instinctively turns, and sees Rick Brody looking out a
      porthole, lost without his twin brother...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   And to Mike Clark... Captain of
                   the tugboat "Chelsea."

      A storage cabinet is opened, a sailor taking out a
      wreath, from a supply of just such wreaths...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You mind...

      The Sailor shrugs, giving him the wreath...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   I said goodbye to all the other
                   men... who had dreams of their
                   own... All the men who wanted to
                   be plumbers or singers or
                   insurance salesmen or doctors...
                   or lawyers or Indian chiefs.

      And suddenly, angrily, he throws the wreath into the
      water...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   Out here, death didn't seem
                   normal.

      Benjamin standing at the rail of the ship... no longer a
      boy... And a SAILOR standing beside him....

                                 THE SAILOR
                   This don't get fixed...

      Benjamin's quiet. When suddenly a HUMMINGBIRD comes
      flying across the water... It circles the wreath, the way
      Hummingbirds do... and then flies off...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   ...I'd never seen a hummingbird

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D)
                In the spring of 1945.... when I
                was 26 years old... I went home...

151   EXT. THE NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - TWILIGHT, 1945            151

      We see Benjamin, suitcase in hand, going up the walk to
      the old house. We're struck by the difference... the old
      man who had left to see the world has returned a
      strikingly handsome man in his fifties. The old blind
      dog, smelling ham, ambles off the porch to meet him.
      Nothing seems to have changed. An old woman we don't
      know is rocking on the porch. A black girl, just 14... is
      hanging out wash...

                              BENJAMIN
                Is your mother home?

                              THE GIRL
                She's gettin' supper ready....

      He goes up the porch, inside....

152   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - TWILIGHT, 1945            152

      Some old folks are in the front room... Nobody we know...
      He moves by them into the kitchen... the stovetop smoking
      and gurgling... He goes into the dining room... Queenie
      is busy setting the table... He watches her for a
      moment...

                              BENJAMIN
                     (quietly)
                Queenie...

      She turns, seeing him... she drops a plate...

                              QUEENIE
                Lord have mercy....you're home...

      She runs to embrace him... We see she's aged... the eight
      years he's been gone... and the 25 years or so since
      we've known her... now in her fifties...

                              THE GIRL'S (V.0.)
                     (asks)
                Who is that mama?

      The Girl comes inside... curious...


                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                       99.

                                 QUEENIE
                   Your brother, Benjamin...

                                 THE GIRL
                   I didn't know he was my brother.

                                 QUEENIE
                        (laughs)
                   There's a shit load of things you
                   don't know...

      But her interest is in Benjamin....

                                 QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                        (studying him)
                   You look like you've been born
                   again... you're younger than the
                   springtime... I think that
                   preacher laid the hands on you
                   brought you a second life... I
                   knew the moment I saw you -- you
                   were special... Every night I got
                   on my knees asking the Good Lord
                   to bring you back safely. Remember
                   what I told you...?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You never know what's comin' for
                   you.

      And they both share a good laugh at her homily... glad to
      be together once again.

                                 QUEENIE
                   Did you learn anything worth
                   repeating?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I saw a lot of things.

      She touches the scar, from the bullet, on his forehead.

                                 QUEENIE
                   You seen some pain.

      He nods.

                                   QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                   Some joy too?

      He nods, that too. And she holds him again.

                                 BENJAMIN
                Where's Tizzy?

                              QUEENIE
                Mr. Weathers died in his sleep one
                night last April. He's sleeping
                comfortably now in the cemetery on
                St. James street, God rest his
                soul...

                              BENJAMIN
                I'm so sorry...

      She turns from him so as not to cry....

                              QUEENIE
                There's only one or two of them
                left now... They all just about
                new... waitin' their turn like
                everybody else... I am so glad to
                have I you back. Now we got to
                find you some proper work and get
                you married right...

      And as she goes about readying the table for dinner,
      humming to herself...

153   EXT. PORCH, NOLAN HOUSE - EVENING, 1945                       153

      Benjamin sitting with a row of oldsters. And feeling out
      of place, out of time, he gets up and goes inside.

154   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, LATER, 1945                 154

      We see Benjamin playing the piano in the parlor, the
      particular tune the Woman had taught him... an old man
      sitting nearby, seemingly listening... Queenie, looking
      in...

                              QUEENIE
                You're wasting your time... he's
                stone deaf... You'll be staying in
                what was Mrs. DeSeroux's room now,
                you're too much of a man to stay
                in the attic anymore.

      She goes about her business... And as Benjamin goes back
      to playing the piano for the deaf man... playing for
      himself...

155   INT. THE PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1945                    155

      We see Mr. Daws, much older now, asleep in an easy chair.

      Benjamin standing at the familiar window, listening to
      the silence of the house...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   It's a funny thing about coming
                   home. Smells the same. Looks the
                   same. Feels the same.

      Mr. Daws awakens.    Seeing Benjamin.   As if he never left.

                                 MR. DAWS
                   Did I ever tell you I've been
                   struck by lightning seven times.
                   Once I was sitting in my truck
                   listening to the radio.

      And we see just that Mr. Daws sitting in his truck
      getting belted by lightning.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   You realize what's changed, is
                   you...

      While Benjamin stands locking out the window:

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   And one evening, not long after I
                   had been back...

156   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE - EARLY ONE EVENING, 1945                 156

      We see Benjamin, coming down the stairs. He happens to
      glance out a casement window... He slows... He can just
      see part of a TAXI coming to stop at the gate. He moves
      to the next landing...where he can see a figure is
      getting out of the cab... The figure of a young woman,
      wearing a beret, a dark coat and lace up boots... She
      strides through the gate... It takes us a moment to
      recognize her... the leggy thirteen year old girl is
      gone... replaced by a confident woman in her early
      twenties... with her red hair and her blue eyes she could
      be no one else but DAISY. Benjamin follows her progress,
      moving through the parlor, watching her out the screened
      windows... She moves gracefully past the porch with its
      swings... The unnamed woman's old dog, smelling her,
      comes to greet her... Daisy going around to the back of
      the house... Benjamin moving to the back door, and just
      as Daisy starts to knock... Benjamin opening it...
      Momentarily startled, she doesn't recognize him.... and
      asks...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Daisy... it's me, Benjamin.

      She hardly can believe her eyes...

                                 DAISY
                   Benjamin...Oh my God it's you...
                   Of course it's you...

      They embrace, and there's a moment when the touch is not
      just of old friends, but something different... and they
      both, in that moment recognize that things will never be
      the same... Daisy, over-hugging him... the way young
      people do...

                                  DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Benjamin, how are you? It's been
                   such a long time... There's so
                   much I want to know... When did
                   you come back?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Just a few weeks ago...

                   I spoke to Queenie...she told me
                   you were in the war...somewhere at
                   sea... I was so worried about
                   you...

                                   BENJAMIN
                        (simply)
                   I'm okay.

                   When I had left she was a girl...
                   and a woman had taken her place...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I can't get over you -- You are so
                   lovely...

                                 DAISY
                   You stopped writing.

                                 BENJAMIN

      Benjamin sitting beside her... the two shoulder to
      shoulder... Daisy looking through the book... and
      reading....

                                 DAISY
                   ...This is the picture of Old Man
                   Kangaroo at five in the
                   afternoon..."

      She looks at him.

                              DAISY (CONT'D)
                You don't look like an old man
                anymore...You always said you were
                different... I think you must
                be...

      He doesn't say anything. The two of them sitting with
      their backs to us like the old friends they are...They
      touch... acutely aware of their proximity and before it
      can go any further...

                              BENJAMIN
                Are you hungry? Would you like to
                get something to eat?

                              DAISY
                I would love that...

      And the moment's gone...

160   EXT. A NEW ORLEANS STREET - NIGHT                           160

      ...And we see a taxi door being opened in slow motion...
      and Daisy, dressed for the night, glides out... a man
      helping her... and we see Benjamin a step behind getting
      out of the car... dressed to the nines... hair slicked,
      elegant... but nonetheless, a step behind... And we hear
      Daisy's voice, from somewhere else...

                              DAISY'S (V.0.)
                ...I danced for a man named
                Ballenchine...He's a famous
                choreographer. He said I had a
                perfect line. They asked
                Ballenchine to describe what he
                did. He said, "I'm a carpenter."
                Isn't that amazing? In one of his
                rehearsals a dancer fell. He put
                it into the production. Can you
                imagine that in a classical
                ballet? A dancer intentionally
                falling? He isn't the only one,
                Agnes DeMille, Lincoln Kirstein,
                Richard Pleasant, Lucia
                Chase...There's a whole new word
                for dance now, it's called
                abstract..."

      The door to the restaurant held open for Daisy... another
      man showing her inside... Benjamin forgotten for the
      slightest of moments at the door... going after her.

                                                                   106.



161   INT. NEW ORLEANS RESTAURANT - NIGHT, 1945                    161

      A crowded New Orleans restaurant. Daisy as a maitre d in
      slow motion is showing her to a table... Men's, and even
      women's, eyes following her...

                              DAISY'S (V.0.)
                ...They have torn up all the
                conventions... the straight up and
                down style, all the things that
                bound dancers...It's not about the
                formality of the dance...the
                classical structure...it's about
                what the dancer's feeling...there
                are no rules; the movement can be
                tense or relaxed, abrupt or
                flowing, carefree or somber, it
                may suggest love or hate,
                attraction or repulsion. The
                unexpected shifts of weight or
                energy -- not just to shock but to
                reinvent tradition...putting the
                familiar form to new and
                unexpected uses. It's so basic
                Just you alone with your body...

      They reach a table... A chair in slow motion swept out
      for her to sit... another man in slow motion putting a
      napkin in her lap...

                              DAISY (V.O)
                They understand America's vigor
                and physicality -- they understand
                the freshness of the American
                people at their most modern, at
                their best.

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                And she told me about this world
                that she was so attracted to...
                names that didn't mean a thing to
                me...I didn't really hear very
                much of what she was saying.

      We watch them at the table... Benjamin listening,
      appreciating her... her face aglow with the intensity and
      the passion of youth... Caviar is brought over...
      vodka... She screws up her mouth not wanting to eat... We
      can sense he's telling her, what he's learned from
      Elizabeth Abbott, how to savor it... He feeds her a
      spoonful... They drink the vodka washing it down... she
      laughs, delighted... And we now hear what she is
      saying...

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                 DAISY
                        (realizing)
                   Oh my god, I've been just talking
                   about myself...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I'm enjoying listening...

      She takes out a cigarette... He instinctively looks for
      matches, a man gets there first, lighting her cigarette
      for her... he watches the smoke curl around her...
      appreciating her...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   I didn't know you smoked...

                                 DAISY
                   I'm old enough. I`m old enough
                   for a lot of things....

                                    BENJAMIN
                   Yes you are...

162   EXT. A NEW ORLEANS PARK - NIGHT                                 162

      We see Benjamin and Daisy, their silhouettes walking
      through the park... She puts her arm around his
      shoulder... being close to him...

                                 DAISY
                   I have to go back tomorrow... I
                   wish I could stay...

      They reach a GAZEBO... Not a soul around... They stand
      for a moment in the silence...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   In New York we stay up all
                   night... I eat breakfast in a
                   diner on Houston with red booths
                   and watch the sun come up over the
                   buildings... there's always
                   something to do...

      Which is in stark contrast to Benjamin's life... Daisy,
      takes off her shoes...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Dancers... don't need costumes or
                   scenery.

      And showing him what she's been telling him about, she
      does a dance for him...

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I could imagine dancing completely
                   naked...

      Daisy, dancing for him... While she dances...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Have you read "D.H. Lawrence," his
                   books were banned... The words are
                   like making love....

      He stands, hands in his pockets appreciating her... she
      moves closer to him... She comes next to him and she
      kisses him... and when he doesn't respond... she tries a
      different tact...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   In our group... you have to trust
                   people... not be afraid... Sex...
                   is a big part of it... A lot of
                   the dancers... are lesbians... A
                   woman wanted me to sleep with
                   her....

      He's quiet.

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Does that upset you?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Which part?

                                 DAISY
                   That someone wanted to sleep with
                   me.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   People should want to sleep with
                   you... You're very desirable...

                                 DAISY
                   Let's go back to the house... or
                   get a room somewhere... we can put
                   down your coat...

      She takes his hand, as if to lead him to the dark of the
      park... There's nothing he'd like more... but...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   It's not that I don't want to... I
                   just can't... not tonight....Its
                   just not...

                              DAISY
                I'm old enough.

      And despite how available she is, how desirable she is...

                              BENJAMIN
                Go back to New York, Daisy... Be
                with the people you are so fond
                of... You can only be young
                once...

                              DAISY
                Do you think you are too old for
                me... I've been with older men...

      And when he still doesn't respond...   Daisy, rejected,
      takes up her shoes... And she starts   off... Benjamin
      coming beside her... but they're not   really walking
      together anymore... and the time for   them, this time, has
      gone away...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                You only get so many chances to be
                with someone... I let her go...
                and I missed it...

163   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT            163

      Daisy, caught in the distant time...

                              DAISY
                You look so handsome in that
                suit... your hair...

      A Nurse looks in...

                              THE NURSE
                They're sayin' the hurricane's
                going to miss us... blow right on

                              CAROLINE
                Oh, that's great.

      The Nurse goes off down the hall, her voice telling
      people the good news...

                   I'll just stay under the blankets
                   with my mother. She said nothing
                   would happen to me.

      She looks at the book.

      Benjamin lying on his bed, his glasses on, reading...
      "D.H. Lawrence"... We see he's squinting... We see his
      POINT OF VIEW, the print, is blurred... He takes off the
      glasses, looks at the print... and it's clear as a
      bell...

      He can see outside an ambulance has arrived... to take

      underscore what he's just said, he sees THOMAS BUTTON in
      his fifties himself now, leaning on crutches, his feet
      bandaged, standing in the doorway...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   My foot was infected... I'm afraid
                   they had to remove it...
                        (beat, without irony)
                   Welcome home, my friend.

165   INT. DELMONICO'S STEAK HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1945         165

      The bar and restaurant crowded with men, many with
      various kinds of handicaps from the war, drinking away
      their demons... And we see Benjamin and Thomas sitting at
      a table... thick steaks, baked potatoes, drinks at their
      elbows...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You're still drinking Sazerac with
                   whiskey instead of brandy.

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   I'm a man of habit.

                        (smiles)
                   Are you still visiting the house
                   on Bourbon street?

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                        (smiles)
                   Not for a long time.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   I told him about my life... about
                   my time at war... and he told me
                   how he had devoted his business to
                   making buttons for the war
                   effort...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   The war has been kind to the
                   button industry... we had gone
                   from making forty thousand buttons
                   a day to making two hundred and
                   fifty thousand... We employed ten
                   times the number of workers... We
                   were operating around the clock...

      And he quiets... the sound of the busy restaurant... And
      after some moments Thomas tells him...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   I don't know how much longer I
                   have to live...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I'm sorry to hear that, Mr.
                   Button.

      And it seems like he is about to tell Benjamin the entire
      truth... but he can't bring himself and instead...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   I don't have any people. I keep to
                   myself. I -- I'm frightened. I
                   hope you won't mind... but
                   whenever it's possible... I would
                   enjoy your company...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I'll do what I can, Mr. Button.

      They quietly eat.

                Tell me Benjamin, do you know
                anything about buttons?

                              BENJAMIN
                Just what holds my shirt on.

      An old brick building with a painting on its side of a
      woman sewing on a button... "Button's Buttons." A driver
      waits outside of a "town car".

167   INT. BUTTON FACTORY, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1945                 167

      We see Thomas unlocking a door.

                              THOMAS BUTTON
                     (has been telling
                      him)
                ... comes from the French,
                "bouton," meaning a bud, or any
                round object...

      They come into a corridor. Thomas unlocking another door.

                              THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                They were originally decorative,
                jewelry sewn on clothing...

      They walk through the quiet factory...

                              THOMAS BUTTON
                The practice of buttoning
                originated in the 13th century...
                when baggy clothing was replaced
                with more form-fitting clothes...

      Thomas, on his crutches...past the lines of work
      benches... Mannequins in uniforms of the armed
      services... with their various gold and silver buttons...

                              THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                Button's Buttons has been in our
                family for one hundred and twenty-
                four years. My grandfather was a
                tailor. He had a small shop in
                Richmond. After the Civil War he
                came to New Orleans.

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   My father saw the wisdom of making
                   our own buttons. The tailor shop
                   grew to this... And today...
                        (a smile)
                   I can't sew a stitch.

      Benjamin is interested, but the obvious question is...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   It's all very interesting.   But
                   what do you want from me?

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   I said, our family has been in the
                   business for a hundred and twenty-
                   four years.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Our family?

      And it's as if he has opened a flood gate...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   You are my family. Benjamin, you
                   are my son.

      And tears run down his anguished face... Benjamin's
      still...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   I am so sorry not to have told you
                   before...

      Benjamin hasn't moved. The words ring in his ears.

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   You were born the night the great
                   war ended... Your mother died
                   giving birth to you... I
                   thought... I thought you were a
                   monster... I left you on the back
                   steps of a house... I promised
                   your mother I'd make sure you were
                   safe... I should never have
                   abandoned you...

      Benjamin's dead quiet... He looks at this man, his
      father...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   My mother?

                                                                     115.



169   INT. THE BUTTON HOUSE, THE GARDEN DISTRICT - NIGHT, 1945       169

      We see Benjamin and Thomas in a hallway leading to the
      kitchen of the large house... The hallway filled with:
      photographs of the Button Family. Thomas pointing out
      relatives... Family photographs...

                               THOMAS BUTTON
                ...A great uncle, from Germany.
                      (and a group picture)
                All of the men in the family at
                the Lake House...
                      (notices the date on
                       it)
                1915, three years before you were
                born.

      A photograph of an old man sitting in a wooden deck chair
      on the dock of a lake.

                              THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                Your grandfather at the summer
                house on Lake Pontchartrain. When
                I was a boy I would love to wake
                up before anybody else and run
                down to the lake to watch the day
                begin. It was as if I was the only
                one alive.

      And they've come to a young Woman's photograph... who
      could only be Benjamin's mother. He stops...

                              THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                I fell in love with her the first
                time I saw her.
                     (beat)
                Your mother's name was Caroline
                Murphy. She was 20. She worked in
                your grandfather's kitchen...She
                was from Dublin... Her father,
                your maternal grandfather, was a
                chimney sweep... He died in the
                flu epidemic of 1900... Caroline
                came with her mother, two sisters,
                and four brothers in 1903 to live
                in New Orleans.

      They stop at the kitchen door.

                              THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                I would find reasons to go to the
                kitchen... just to look at her...


                                                       (CONTINUED)

      He does just that... Looking through the round window
      into the empty kitchen... as if she was there those years
      ago... as if she was still there...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   The happiest day of my life was
                   April 25th, 1918 the day I married
                   your mother.

      They move along the hallway... Benjamin looking at the
      photographs... his bloodlines... After some moments:

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Why didn't you tell me?

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   I made a mistake.

      Benjamin looks at him.

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   Come and take your rightful
                   place... with your family... with
                   me...

      When Benjamin doesn't say anything...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   We can catch up for all the lost
                   time...

      And when he still doesn't answer...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   I'm planning on leaving everything
                   I have to you...

      His "bribe" strikes a nerve.

                                  BENJAMIN
                   I better go.

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   Where are you going?

                                  BENJAMIN
                   Home.

      Benjamin turns his back and walks out.

                                                                   117.



170   INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM - NIGHT, 1946                            170

      Benjamin standing by the door, Queenie sitting up in her
      bed...

                              QUEENIE
                     (unforgiving,
                      angrily)
                He's what?! All those years he's
                creeping around here, and never
                tells us who he is?!! I thought he
                was just queer or somethin' comin'
                around here... always askin' for
                you... He left us $18 that night
                you was found... Eighteen ratty
                ass dollars and a dirty diaper...!
                Now he wants to be your father? He
                wants you to sit at his side...!
                He wants your forgiveness! I won't
                ever forgive him for any of it...
                God's the only one that can
                forgive him!
                     (finished)
                Now I got to get up early with
                Mrs. Hamilton... or she gonna
                drown...
                     (but not finished)
                ...He thinks he can just show up,
                and everything gonna be fine and
                dandy, everybody gonna be
                friends... He got another thing
                coming...

      And with that she turns over, to go back to sleep,
      Benjamin quietly leaves the room.

171   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE - BACK STAIRS, HALLWAY - NIGHT          171

      He climbs the back stairs to his room, as if he's
      carrying a terrible burden... as he comes onto the
      hallway, Mr. Daws is sitting on a bench in the hall...
      Seeing Benjamin...

                              MR. DAWS
                Did I ever tell you I was struck
                by lightning seven different
                times. Once, I was walking my dog
                along a country road.

      And we see just that, when suddenly he's struck by
      lightning. The dog, unharmed, licking his face.

                   I'm blind in the one eye...I can't

                   shakes out of nowhere... I lose my
                   line of thought... but you know
                   what... God, for some reason,
                   keeps on sending me a wake-up...
                   It's His way of reminding me I'm
                   lucky to be alive...

      And   gets up and pads off into his room. Benjamin, left in
      the   hallway...He goes over to look out the window, like
      the   boy we remember looking out at the street lights...
      the   street...

172   EXT. THOMAS BUTTON'S HOUSE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT                172

      We see Benjamin being let in by a Butler into the
      fashionable home.

173   INT. THOMAS BUTTON'S HOUSE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT                173

      Benjamin in the dark hallway, quietly walking among the
      photographs of "his" family. He goes up the staircase. He
      goes to his father's room. He quietly opens the door. The
      room's dark, his father asleep. He goes to his father's
      bed. His father's frail figure.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (whispers)
                   Thomas...

      Thomas awakens...seeing Benjamin...

174   EXT. THOMAS BUTTON'S HOUSE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT                174

      We see Benjamin wheeling his father in a wheelchair out
      of the house...And...

175   EXT. LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN, LOUISIANA - SUNRISE                    175

      The endless lake. And we see Mr. Button's chauffeured car
      driving along the lake.

176   EXT. THE BUTTON SUMMER HOME, LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN - SUNRISE 176

      The car's stopped at a chain across the driveway of an
      old summer home. Benjamin helps to put Thomas into his
      wheelchair. He wheels him up the long drive to the house.


                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                     119.

176   CONTINUED:                                                     176

      All closed up. Shuttered. There are steps that lead down
      to the lake. He starts to wheel his father down the
      steps. The steps are too steep for the wheelchair.
      Benjamin reaches, picking his father up out of the chair.
      He carries him down the steps, but that too is arduous...

      And he puts his father on his back...His father holding
      onto his son, as Benjamin carries him on his back down
      the steps to the dock. There's an old wooden deck chair.
      He helps his father sit in the chair. And as his father
      sits for the last time, watching the lake...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   Thank you, Benjamin.

      Benjamin sitting at a distance behind him...Both of them
      watching the day begin...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   You can be mad as a mad dog at the
                   way things went...You can swear,
                   curse the fates, regret everything
                   you ever did... but when it comes
                   to the end... You have to let
                   go...

      And as his father shuts his eyes, sitting in the sun.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D)
                   I buried him in the Button family
                   plot.

177   EXT. AN OLD CEMETERY, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1946                  177

      We see Benjamin standing at his father's gravesite in the
      family plot, with ornate headstones...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   I had a tailor sew onto his best
                   coat -- a button for every year of
                   his life....fifty-five of them...
                   all different, pearl and silver,
                   brass and wood... in case he lost
                   one along the way...

      And as he stands at the gravesite... He hears something.
      Queenie has come to be with him...to comfort him...

                                 QUEENIE
                        (why she's here)
                   Don't you suffer alone for it.

      She takes his arm, always there for him.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                      120.

177   CONTINUED:                                                      177

                                 QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                        (looking around)
                   It's a beautiful cemetery... And
                   buried here right next to your
                   mother.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (looks at her)
                   His wife.

      And as they stand at the gravesite...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   I went to pay a visit to the
                   button factory.

178   INT. BUTTON FACTORY, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1946                    178

      We see Benjamin with an elderly woman, MS. SANDERSON,
      standing at the railing of a mezzanine above the factory
      work floor... looking down upon the workers, exclusively
      women, and exclusively white women, making buttons...The
      women, seeing him, look up, and there's a sudden hush...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   My name is Benjamin, Benjamin...
                        (for the first time)
                   Button...

      They stare up at him...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   As you know, my father...

      It still sounds strange to him.

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   ...My father, Thomas Button...
                   recently passed...

      After a moment:

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   He asked that I take over the day
                   to day operation of Button's
                   Buttons.

      They silently stare up at him....

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Well, I don't know the first thing
                   about buttons...and I don't know a
                   thing about business...
                                 (MORE)

178   CONTINUED:                                                  178
                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                        (after a beat)
                   Button's Buttons has been in my
                   father's family for over 100
                   years. It could not have survived
                   without people like you. My father
                   asked me to tell you how much he
                   appreciated the hard work you put
                   in for him and his company for so
                   many years.

      Dead still... And after a moment;

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   I have decided that all of you --
                   his loyal employees, will have a
                   share, depending on your length of
                   employment, in the ownership of
                   this factory, his legacy.

                                 ONE OF THE WOMEN
                   We're the owners now?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   That's about it.

      They're literally dumbfounded.

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Mrs. Sanderson will explain how
                   everything works and will answer
                   any of your questions...

      And with that he turns, walking away...Having "given away
      the store"... the workers in disbelief looking up at
      him...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   And I went to New York.

179   EXT. NEW YORK CITY -- NIGHT, 1947                           179

      We see a cab pull up and Benjamin, in a nice suit,
      flowers in hand, daisies, gets out, hurrying into The
      Majestic Theater, the marquee telling us "CAROUSEL," is
      performing.

180   INT. THE MAJESTIC THEATER, NYC - NIGHT, 1947                180

      Benjamin, coming in late, being shown to his seat. And we
      see the production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical
      "Carousel," with Mielziner's seminal stage design, as
      choreographed by Agnes De Mille... And we see the dancer
      is Daisy...dancing with the man of her dreams, the "bad
      boy" carnival barker... while Benjamin watches her.

                                                                   122.



181   INT. BACKSTAGE, THE MAJESTIC THEATER - NYC - NIGHT, 1947     181

      We see Benjamin, flowers in hand, making his way through
      a crowded backstage corridor filled with friends and well-
      wishers giving cast members congratulations. He comes to
      the door... to the attention of a STAGEHAND...

                              BENJAMIN
                I'm a friend of Daisy's...

      The man matter-of-factly opens the door... A dressing
      room crowded with dancers changing out of their
      Costumes... He calls out...

                              THE MAN
                Daisy has company...

      We can hear Daisy's name being said...Benjamin waiting...
      He sees Daisy, in a robe, coming through the room....

                              DAISY
                Somebody's looking for me?...

      ...And she sees it's Benjamin. And rather than excited to
      see him... She's startled he's there... and not
      altogether pleased about him showing up...

                              DAISY (CONT'D)
                Benjamin... What are you doing
                here?

      And he realizes, as most of us have in one love affair or
      another, whatever his expectations may have been, his
      fantasy, is not the reality...

                              BENJAMIN
                I thought I'd come visit... spend
                some time with you if I could...

                              DAISY
                I wish you would have called...
                You caught me by surprise.

      He gives her the flowers, the daisies.

                              BENJAMIN
                I couldn't take my eyes off of
                you... you were mesmerizing...

                              DAISY
                That's so nice of you to say...
                These are lovely... Thank you...


                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                      123.

181   CONTINUED:                                                      181

      There's an awkward moment... and...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I better get changed... a group of
                   us are going to a party... would
                   you like to come...?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Somebody told me about a
                   restaurant I thought you might
                   enjoy... I made a reservation...
                   Just in case --

                                 DAISY
                        (awkwardly)
                   ...all the dancers go out together
                   after the show... You're welcome
                   to come with us... There'll be all
                   sorts of interesting people... Let
                   me get changed.

      And she runs back inside the dressing room... Benjamin
      left to stand in the hallway....

182   INT. A NEW YORK LOFT - NIGHT, 1947                              182

      A loft elevator opens depositing Benjamin and Daisy along
      with a bunch of people into a large loft... crowded with
      her friends, dancers and show people, musicians,
      predominantly young people, straight and gay, beatniks
      before there were beatniks, bohemians... Music playing...
      People pressed together, having to shout to talk...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   And I met her friends...

                                 DAISY
                   I'll get you a drink...

      As she turns to a kitchen to get him a drink, she is
      startled as a young man, DAVID, suddenly grabs her,
      kissing her, a kiss that's not intended to be platonic...
      Daisy obviously involved with him... but embarrassed by
      the intimacy in front of Benjamin and not wanting to hurt
      his feelings... she pulls awkwardly away from him...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   This is my friend David... David
                   dances with our company too...
                   This is the man I've told you
                   about, Benjamin...

      They shake hands... Daisy, wanting to escape.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                   I'll get you that drink. - -

      ...she goes into the kitchen...

                                 DAVID
                   You were her grandmother's friend
                   or something like that...?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Something like that.

      And Daisy comes back out with a drink for him... and one
      of her own... But before she can give him his drink, a
      woman takes it from her... and starts to dance with
      her... but not with her... the way dancers do... and many
      of the dancers are dancing just because they feel like
      it... David, comes to dance with Daisy... Benjamin
      standing watching Daisy dancing with him... as only
      dancers can... in complete control of their bodies and
      yet totally uninhibited... Benjamin sees David kiss
      her... and his jealousy getting the best of him, he turns
      and leaves...

183   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              183

      Daisy in her turban... listening to Caroline read..

                                  DAISY
                        (whispers)
                   I knew I'd hurt you... Maybe I
                   intended to...

184   EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT, 1947                              184

      Benjamin on his way out of the apartment coming along the
      street. Daisy running after him...

                                 DAISY
                   I did what you told me to... enjoy
                   my life... I'm only going to be
                   young once... I had no idea you
                   were coming. What did you think I
                   was going to do...? You can't
                   expect me to just drop everything,
                   Benjamin... this is my life...

      And we see DAVID and a group of her dancer friends have
      come outside down the way into the street... looking for
      cabs...

                        (to Daisy)
                   There's a party downtown we're
                   going to...

                                 DAISY
                        (conflicted, to
                         Benjamin)
                   Why don't you come with us,
                   Benjamin... There'll be a lot of
                   musicians, interesting people
                   there.... You'll have a good
                   time...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I came here to tell you I made a
                   mistake before...A day doesn't go
                   by that I don't regret it...It's
                   not the way I felt...I should have
                   never let you go...I came because
                   I hoped I could be with you...

                                 DAVID
                   Daisy, you going to come...?

      Cabs have pulled up... She's torn... between her life and
      some other life... Benjamin, recognizing her conflict...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Do you love him?

185   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              185

      Daisy in bed...

                                 CAROLINE
                   Did you Mother?

      Daisy snaps back to the reality of the room... Starts to
      put the pieces together...

186   EXT. THE MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT, 1947                         186

                                 DAISY
                   I think so. I think I do.

      We see the dancers scrambling getting into the taxis...

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (understanding)
                   Okay. Okay... I'll see you in New
                   Orleans...

      He turns to go... she's motionless, caught between the
      two worlds... And we expect her to yell after him, to
      stop him... But instead, she does what we all do in these
      moments, what feels good at the time... She runs to be
      with her friends... She gets into a taxi... The cab
      drives by him as they leave... Daisy turned to look out
      the back window... looking back at him... He waves...
      letting her go... And another chance for them is
      missed... The street's quiet. And hands in his pockets, a
      middle-aged man going on 26... he walks off into the
      night...

                   He came to tell me his father had
                   died.

                                 CAROLINE
                   You couldn't have known.

                                 DAISY
                   I was 23...I just didn't care...

      She's quiet with her thoughts... and, remembering, she
      hums to herself some distant memory of music...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   ...There are some photographs I
                   think... the zipper part of the
                   large bag...

      Caroline goes to the suitcases... she comes back with a
      manila envelope... Daisy dumps them out...and we see
      they're photographs of Daisy dancing at the height of her
      abilities...

                                 CAROLINE
                   I've never seen these... You never
                   talked about your dancing very
                   much...

      Daisy looks at the photographs...

                                 DAISY
                   I was as good as I was ever going
                   to be. For five years... I danced
                   everywhere... London, Prague,
                   Vienna, and I was the only
                   American invited to dance with the
                   Bolshoi... It was glorious...

                                                                   127.

      And we see Daisy, five years older, her arm inside a tall
      young blond Russian dancer's, ANITOLY, crossing a snowy
      street in Moscow...

                              DAISY (V.O.)

                I'd find myself saying...
                     (a beat, saying)
                Goodnight, Daisy.

      And as they both lie in their beds... thinking of the
      other...

      Benjamin in work clothes on a ladder, painting some old
      window shutters... Queenie opens the window... to tell
      him...

                                 QUEENIE
                   Mrs. La Tourneau just passed away.

      Benjamin nods. Queenie shuts the window.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   Until one day...

      A Messenger on a bicycle rides up...

                                 A WESTERN UNION MESSENGER
                   I have a telegram for Mr. Benjamin
                   Button...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   That would be me....

      He comes down the ladder. The Messenger gives him the
      telegram and getting his tip, rides off, Benjamin opens
      the telegram.

                   It will just be a minute... please

196   INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM, PARIS, FRANCE - DAY, 1954               196

      We see Benjamin coming into the hospital room in
      France...Daisy, fully immobilized, lying in a hospital
      bed...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                And her leg was crushed...

      She's still, her eyes closed. Sensing him, she stirs. And
      then she sees him.

                              BENJAMIN
                Hello, Daisy...

                                DAISY
                Who told you?

                              BENJAMIN
                Your friend wired me.

                               DAISY
                That was very kind of you... to
                come all the way here, to see that
                I was alright.

                              BENJAMIN
                You would have done the same for
                me...

      And her first reaction, to how young he is...

                              DAISY
                My God, look at you. You're
                perfect....

      Which she isn't... She's quiet, and she suddenly says:

                   I wish you hadn't. I wish you
                   hadn't come here.

      He's dead still.

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I don't want you to see me like
                   this...

      She turns over... as if she didn't see him he wouldn't be
      there... Before he can say anything... A Nurse comes in
      saying something in French... She pulls the curtains
      around the bed... Benjamin waits...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   Her leg had been broken in five
                   places.... and with therapy, and
                   time, she might be able to
                   stand...maybe even walk...

      The Nurse leaves... Benjamin comes into the circle of
      curtains... It's reminiscent of when they sat under the
      table... the sheets over them... in their private
      world... But this time she lays in the hospital bed her
      back to him...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I'll get a room... and once you
                   can leave you'll come home with me
                   to New Orleans. Where you can be
                   with people who love you.

      She suddenly turns...

                                 DAISY
                   What home? Who's we? I'm not going
                   back to New Orleans. New Orleans
                   is your home... I don't have a
                   home... I haven't been home for
                   five years... I'm not going
                   anywhere with you...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Alright, I'll stay here in
                   Paris... I'll help you with
                   anything you need...

                                 DAISY
                   Benjamin...! I know I'm feeling
                   sorry for myself... But it wasn't
                   supposed to be like this...

                 Do you understand, I don't want to
                 be with you... I tried to tell you
                 that in New York... You just don't
                 listen...

                               BENJAMIN
                 You'll change your mind.

                               DAISY
                 We're not little children playing
                 under the table... Remember, when
                 you came to New York. You didn't
                 belong there. I didn't want to be
                 with you then, I don't want to be
                 with you now! I want you to leave!
                 I'm not going anywhere with you! I
                 want you to stay out of my life!

       And she turns away from him again...It's dead still...
       and we look at her staring at the curtains... And after
       some moments she turns back to look at Benjamin... And
       there are just the curtains billowing in the breeze...
       Benjamin is gone...

                 I'll get the nurse...

       She goes into the hall... Daisy left to deal with the
       remnants of her mortality... The Nurse coming into the
       room... Caroline behind her... times her pulse.

                               THE NURSE
                 Let's get you comfortable.

       She raises the morphine level...straightens her
       covers...she stops before she leaves...motions to
       Caroline...Caroline going over to her.

                               THE NURSE (CONT'D)
                 Pulse rate's slowing...She's
                 getting less oxygen...You'll
                 notice her struggle to
                 breathe...Will you be alright?

       Caroline nods...The Nurse gives her a compassionate look
       and leaves...Caroline stands, her arms protectively
       across her chest, watching her mother...Daisy hums the
       particular ragtime song that Benjamin would play on the
       piano...She opens her eyes, as if not completely sure
       where she is...telling Caroline...

                 People sitting and drinking and
                 talking... I lay on my bed
                 thinking about the rest of my
                 life... about people... about
                 home... until I fall asleep.

       She looks at Caroline as if to say, "What happened to

                    "sailing." Does that make sense?

                    I learned to sail on an old boat
                    of my father's from the Lake
                    House...

       And we see Benjamin, the wind in his hair, sailing an old
       sailboat... And the change in his appearance is
       startling... His hair is without a trace of gray... His
       face with barely a wrinkle, chiseled...He is a healthy
       man in his 40s now...

                                  BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                 ...Or maybe three...

       Benjamin seeing her to the stairs...And as she starts
       down the stairs to leave...we see a cluster of old
       people, ready for the day, looking up at them...the woman
       making her way awkwardly down the stairs and out the
       door...Benjamin gives a little self conscious wave to the
       old timers and starts back into his room...He slows at a
       second story hallway window...looking outside at the
       walkway...the familiar street beyond...If we didn't know
       any better he seems to be waiting for someone to come
       home

       We see Benjamin riding the old motorcycle along the
       street on his way home... leaves the motorcycle out in
       front...

202    EXT. THE NOLAN HOUSE - END OF THE DAY, 1962                 202

       He comes to the gate, opening it, coming into the yard,
       shutting the gate behind him, going up the walkway. An
       Old Man is on the porch, quietly rocking. And Queenie,
       for some reason is standing just outside the front door
       on the porch... an apron in her hands... She nods to
       Benjamin... talking to the Old Man in the rocking
       chair... but she seems to be watching Benjamin, as he
       walks around the house -- to the back door. He takes off
       his dirty work boots, leaves them on the porch.

      He hops the back steps, and starts to open the kitchen
      door, when it opens... And DAISY, now 36, but still with
      her unmistakable blue eyes, is standing before him...

                                    BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   She came back.

      They look at each other in silence...and they simply
      smile, so glad to see each other after all the missing
      years... They embrace...for some time... and kiss... As
      people who haven't seen each other, and have thought
      about each other... for a very long time... And it just
      is...no big symphonies, no endless skies...just, two
      people at a kitchen door in the middle of their lives...
      and the simplicity, just that, is what makes it real and
      breaks your heart.

203   INT. THE KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - THAT NIGHT, 1962                  203

      A radio plays... they sit at the kitchen table, eating
      dinner... the conversation muted... They don't know
      really where to begin, where did they leave oft...so they
      don't begin until they can....

                                 DAISY
                   Don't you want to know where I've
                   been?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   No. I don't care where you've been
                   -- I'm just happy you're back.

      And we see Queenie has come into the kitchen... in her
      nightgown now...

                                  QUEENIE
                         (pure Queenie)
                   How come you didn't write or
                   nothin'? Just disappearing like
                   that?

                                 DAISY
                   It was what I needed to do for
                   myself.

                                 QUEENIE
                   I never took you to be selfish. I
                   hope I'm not wrong. I'm not
                   usually wrong about people.

      And Queenie leaves the kitchen...

                                 DAISY
                   She's still taking care of you.
                                                          (CONTINUED)

203   CONTINUED:                                                   203

      Benjamin slightly smiles. They look at each other.

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   You're not talking. You haven't
                   said more than two words to me.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I don't want to ruin it...

      And they sit quietly in the kitchen, looking at each
      other, silently eating...

204   INT. BACK STAIRWAY - NOLAN HOUSE - THAT NIGHT, 1962          204

      Benjamin carries her bags upstairs. They reach the third
      floor.

205   INT. HALLWAY, NOLAN HOUSE - 3RD FLOOR - THAT NIGHT, 1962     205

      All the years seem to surround them. They walk along the
      corridor to Daisy's room. What was her grandmother's
      room. She opens the door.

206   INT. THE BEDROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - THAT NIGHT, 1962             206

      He sets her bags down. Queenie despite her reservations
      has left some clean towels on the bed for her... There's
      an inept quiet. The two of them with nothing left to
      say... And they listen to the quiet... The house with its
      symphony of night noises...

                                    BENJAMIN
                   Goodnight.

      He is just at the door... when she says...

                                    DAISY
                   Sleep with me.

                                    BENJAMIN
                   Are you sure?

                                    DAISY
                   Yes.

      He turns to her. They look at each other. And they kiss,
      A kiss that has waited for thirty years. A kiss that has
      waited a lifetime. And yes, there is passion... and
      need... but most particularly, the awkwardness of people
      discovering each other for the first time... While he
      gently, tenderly, kisses her, undresses her..

                   Are you sure you don't want to
                   know?...

      While they kiss and caress each other.

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I lived in Lyon...

      Benjamin and Daisy undressing one another, touching,
      kissing...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   ...I learned to walk again

      Daisy and Benjamin, naked, passionately kissing...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   ...I worked in a flower shop...

      They lay on the bed, kissing, caressing...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   ...I went to American movies a
                   lot.

      They kiss more and more passionately...And Benjamin about
      to make love to her hesitates...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   You won't hurt me...

      He kisses her scarred crooked leg. Kisses her body.     And
      as they make love in the old bedroom...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   I asked her to come with me...

      What follows feels like a HOME MOVIE...without any sound.

207   EXT. THE FLORIDA GULF COAST - ANOTHER DAY, 1963                207

      And we see the small sailboat out on the gulf coast...

                                 BENJAMIN SUTTON'S (V.0,)
                   We sailed into the Gulf... along
                   the Florida coast...

208   EXT. THE FLORIDA COAST, A COVE - DAY, 1963                     208

      Daisy and Benjamin on the sailboat at a cove on the
      Florida coast. They watch a ROCKET, soaring into space
      from Cape Caniveral.

      As they watch it roar overhead, Benjamin marvels at its
      power...leaving its trail across the sky...Daisy, not so
      much interested, taking his arm, taking him back down
      below...

209   EXT. THE CARIBBEAN, ANOTHER COVE - DAY, 1963                   209

      Daisy washing her hair off the side of the boat.

      The boat anchored. Benjamin and Daisy sitting on the
      deck having a picnic with just a single lamp for light.

211   EXT. THE CARIBBEAN, ANOTHER COVE - NIGHT, 1963                 211

      The boat in still another cove. Daisy and Benjamin in
      the water. Just their eyes above the dark water looking
      only at each other.

212   EXT. THE BOAT - CARIBBEAN -    NIGHT, 1963                     212

      The boat out on the water, Daisy sitting on the deck, the
      wind in her hair... Benjamin at the wheel...threatening
      clouds on the horizon...

                                 DAISY'S (V.0.)
                   I'm so glad we didn't find one
                   another when I was 26... I'm glad
                   we missed...

                                 BENJAMIN'S (V.0.)
                   Why do you say that?

                                 DAISY'S (V.0.)
                   It wasn't right...

215   INT. A CARIBBEAN HOTEL, BAR - DAY, 1963                        215

      A small Caribbean hotel. We see Benjamin and Daisy
      sitting at a table drinking, talking in a nearly empty
      bar... wind and rain lashing the hotel... waiting out a
      tropical storm...

                                 DAISY
                   We wouldn't have this... We
                   wouldn't be here... It happened
                   when it was supposed to happen...

      They look at each other...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Relationships have a time and a
                   place.

                                 DAISY
                   Don't say that.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   What I mean is... You don't
                   usually get more than one chance.
                   If you miss it, it's too late...
                   and it's gone... We're lucky... we
                   had more than one chance.

                                 DAISY
                        (laughs)
                   That's easy for you to say...
                   You'll have plenty of chances.

      She tenderly touches his hand... They look at each
      other... And dedicating herself...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I'm going to enjoy every moment I
                   have with you...

      The waiter's come over.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Have you ever had a Sazerac with
                   whiskey not brandy?

                                 DAISY'S
                        (smiles)
                   I'm with you, aren't I?   I'll try
                   anything.

      And the wind changes direction, the rain coming in
      through the open windows of the bar, getting them wet...
      people run for cover...

                                 DAISY
                   Bet I can stay out here longer
                   than you can.

216   INT. HOTEL ROOM, THE CARIBBEAN HOTEL - NIGHT, 1963           216

      A white hotel room... The storm shutters closed... The
      wind and the rain banging at the shutters... Daisy and
      Benjamin lying together on a bed out of the storm... She
      touches his face as if for the first time...

                              DAISY
                You barely have a line, a crease,
                or a wrinkle... Everyday I have
                more wrinkles you have less...

      He touches her face.

                              BENJAMIN
                I love your wrinkles.

                              DAISY
                What does it feel like growing
                younger?

                              BENJAMIN
                I don't know... I'm always looking
                out of my own eyes...

      They're quiet, just the sound of the rain and the
      chattering shutters... She lays closer to him...
      warmly... She smiles...

                              DAISY
                Will you still love me when I
                can't stand straight... when my
                skin grows old and spotted...

      Benjamin laughs.

                              DAISY (CONT'D)
                Will you still love me when my
                step gets slow... when I sleep too
                much... when you have to push me
                in a chair...

      And his answer is...

                              BENJAMIN
                Will you still love me when I have
                pimples. When I think it's funny
                to make fart noises...

216   CONTINUED:                                                  216

      She laughs...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Will you still love me when I
                   think all girls have cooties...
                   Will you still love me when I wet
                   my bed at night... Will you still
                   love me when I'm afraid of things
                   that aren't real...

      They hold each other... And Benjamin says... from what
      he's seen...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Nothing lasts...

                                 DAISY
                   Maybe some things last...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I've never seen anything not come
                   to an end...

                                 DAISY
                   Maybe it's something you can't
                   see...

      And a shutter slams open... the rain and the wind coming
      into the room... Benjamin gets up to close it... He comes
      back into bed... And Daisy, suddenly afraid...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I'm cold, Benjamin...

      And as he holds her in the white room with the wind and
      the rain trying to get in, banging on the shutters...

217   INT. HOTEL ROOM, CARIBBEAN HOTEL - LATER THAT NIGHT, 1963 217

      The storm's died down... Benjamin and Daisy falling
      asleep...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   And you said...

                                 DAISY
                   Goodnight, Benjamin.

                                   BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   And I said...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Goodnight, Daisy...

                                                                  145.



218   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, THE PRESENT          218

                              DAISY
                     (that she's stopped)
                Caroline?

                              CAROLINE
                     (after a beat,
                      slightly confused)
                I don't understand. When did you
                meet Dad?

                              DAISY
                Dear Robert... some time after
                that...

                              CAROLINE
                Did you ever tell him about this
                Benjamin?

                              DAISY
                He knew enough. He loved me as I
                was. I loved him for who he was.
                What more was needed?

      She trails off... she's quiet... and wanting to know
      what's next, reading on...

                              CAROLINE
                "That night, in the Caribbean I
                had a visitor..."

219   INT. HOTEL ROOM, CARIBBEAN HOTEL - MIDDLE OF NIGHT, 1963    219

      Benjamin and Daisy sleeping... the shutters quietly
      talking on a breeze... when one of the shutters SLAMS
      open as if somebody's come in... Benjamin wakes up... And
      he literally sees QUEENIE is sitting on the side of the
      bed beside him...

                              QUEENIE
                I wanted to tell you I love you
                and your mama's gone...

      And she bends, sweetly kissing him...

      And Benjamin rolls over... His eyes come open... Daisy
      sensing he's awake, awakening, murmurs...




                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                 DAISY
                   Is anything wrong?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Queenie came to tell me she loved
                   me... and that my mother was gone.

                                 DAISY
                   ...go back to sleep...

      As she caresses him... falling back to sleep... the
      shutters talking...

220   EXT. THE NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - ANOTHER DAY, 1963       220

      We see Daisy and Benjamin, with their few belongings,
      returning home... They go up the walkway... Benjamin
      trots up the steps, opens the screen door and goes
      inside...

221   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - ANOTHER DAY, 1963       221

      Benjamin comes inside... Daisy's just behind him... The
      front room is empty... The house still...

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (calls)
                   Hello... Queenie... we're back...

      He looks into the parlor... The piano... He goes down a
      hallway into the kitchen...

                                  BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Queenie...?   Mama?

      Nobody... He goes down the hall looking in Queenie's
      small room under the stairs... Nobody's there... He moves
      back into the front room... calling...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Hello... Anybody here?

      When finally an old Woman, who's been sleeping, comes out
      of her bedroom...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   It's Benjamin, Mrs. Carter...
                   Where is everybody?

                                 THE OLD WOMAN
                   Benjamin... your mother died.

                                                                   147.



222   INT. A BLACK BAPTIST CHURCH, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1963         222

      The church crowded... And we see Benjamin and Daisy
      coming in the back as the service is ending... They are
      the only white people there. Benjamin walks to the open
      casket... standing by his mother's side as the choir
      sings a Hallelujah chorus...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                We buried her beside her beloved
                Mr. Weathers...

223   EXT. AN OLD NEW ORLEANS CEMETERY - DAY, 1963                 223

      A predominantly African-American cemetery... overgrown
      and old... The mourners, almost all of them old white
      people, standing at Queenie's gravesite alongside her
      beloved Mr. Weathers. We see Queenie's daughter among
      the mourners... in her early 30s herself now... And
      Benjamin, standing over his mother's grave... saying his
      goodbyes...

                              BENJAMIN
                We are meant to lose the people we
                love. It's how we know how
                important they are to us.

                              BENJAMIN'S (V.O.)
                And so we could have memories of
                our own I sold my Father's house
                on Blaine Street...

224   EXT. THE BUTTON HOUSE, GARDEN DISTRICT - DAY, 1963           224

      The old house, in a now decaying New Orleans
      neighborhood... but despite the faltering area, the house
      retains a dignity of its own...

225   INT. THE BUTTON HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, 1963                    225

      We see a young pregnant Woman, a renter, being shown by
      Benjamin along with a Real Estate Agent, around the old
      house.

                              THE WOMAN
                ...It's such a lovely place... You
                must have a lot of fond memories.
                It must be hard for you to give it
                up.

      Benjamin doesn't say anything. There's a knock on the
      door. Benjamin opens it, to let an OLDER MAN in... quite
      a bit older...

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                148.

225   CONTINUED:                                                225

                                 THE MAN
                   Is Mrs. Williamson here yet... I'm
                   sorry to be late...

      And he sees his wife... pleased to see her... hugging
      her... tenderly kissing her... and their age difference
      readily obvious... Benjamin acutely aware of it...

                                 THE WOMAN
                   It's a wonderful old place,
                   darling... I think we will be so
                   happy here...

      They go into the hallway lined with the family
      photographs... She's taken by them...

                                 THE WOMAN (CONT'D)
                   Oh, what a long family history you
                   have...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   They come with the house...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   And we bought a house of our
                   own...

226   EXT. A SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1963        226

      Benjamin and Daisy sitting on the front steps of a
      suburban New Orleans townhouse, a small screened front
      porch with a tree in front...

227   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT            227

                                 DAISY
                        (murmurs)
                   I loved that house... it smelled
                   like firewood... The chimney
                   leaked smoke... We didn't care...
                   Oh don't stop dear... don't
                   stop...

      She closes her eyes...

                                  CAROLINE'S VOICE (OVER)
                   "It was one of the happiest times
                   of my life..."

                                  BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   We had no furniture to speak of...
                   we would have picnics in the
                   living room...

                                                                    149.



228   INT. THE SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1963          228

      Benjamin and Daisy having a picnic on the virtually empty
      living room floor.

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0,)
                We slept on a mattress...

229   INT. BEDROOM, SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE, NEW ORLEANS DAY, 1963       229

      We see Benjamin and Daisy sleeping on a mattress on the
      floor in the bedroom...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                We vowed never to go to bed or
                wake up at the same time. We
                lived on that mattress...

      And we see just that, a short film of two people who
      can't get enough of each other living on a mattress...
      Daisy and Benjamin at various times, while they are
      either sleeping, or talking, or eating, or reading, or
      making love, ON THE MATTRESS ON THE FLOOR...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Our neighbor, Mrs. Van Dam was a
                physical therapist...

230   INT. PORCH, SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1953       230

      We see Daisy in the screened-in front porch, exercising
      her leg under the supervision of an older woman... MRS.
      VAN DAM...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                We lived four blocks from a public
                pool...

231   INT. A PUBLIC SWIMMING POOL, YWCA - DAY, 1963                 231

      We see Daisy in a bathing suit, resting from swimming,
      holding on to the side of the pool, watching a young,
      well conditioned girl, 18, with nothing but her life
      ahead of her, completely in tune with her body, swimming
      laps... And as it comes to all of us, painfully aware of
      the years passing, her own physical mortality, she starts
      to cry... And we see that Benjamin, come to meet her, is
      standing above her.

                              BENJAMIN
                You're crying...



                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                 DAISY
                   It's just the chlorine...

      Looking at the young girl... looking at her...
      understanding...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You chose something to do...
                   something so special... so
                   unique... there was such a short
                   period of time that you could do
                   it... Even if nothing had happened
                   ... Sooner or later you would be
                   in the same place you are now...

      She's quiet... she knows what he's saying is true...

                                 DAISY
                   I don't like getting old.

232   EXT. LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN, LOUISIANA - DAYBREAK, 1964             232

      Benjamin, Daisy holding onto him, riding the old
      motorcycle along the lake...

233   EXT. THE DOCK AT THE LAKE - DAYBREAK, 1964                      233

      Daisy sits in the familiar deck chair his father had sat
      in looking out at the lake... Benjamin brings her a cup
      of coffee... He sits on the deck on his heels beside
      her...

                                 DAISY
                   I promise you, I'll never lose
                   myself to self-pity again...

      And as they watch the day begin...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   And I think, right there and then,
                   she realized none of us is perfect
                   forever.

234   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, THE PRESENT          234

      The window has started to rattle again... the wind
      knocking.

                                 CAROLINE
                   I thought the wind had shifted
                   away...

      Daisy doesn't say anything, lying still, staring off...
      her breathing shallow, laboring...

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                   Mother?

                                 DAISY
                        (agitated)
                   I don't remember if I turned the
                   lights off. Did I leave the
                   heater on?

      The Nurse, on her way by, seeing her distress... coming
      in...

                                 THE NURSE
                   Let's get you comfortable...

      She gently covers her... Daisy quietly lies back...

                                 THE NURSE (CONT'D)
                   She's getting ready to leave...

      She looks at Caroline and turns and leaves the room.
      Caroline quietly looks at her mother. Their eyes meet.

                                 DAISY
                   You have the most beautiful eyes.

      Caroline reaches to hold her thin hand. Daisy says
      something to herself. Caroline looks at her...she looks
      down at the book...

                                 CAROLINE
                   He said, "She found peace."

                                 DAISY
                        (says to herself)
                   Peace.

      A small dance studio... a scratchy phonograph record
      playing music... young girls learning how to dance...

      The first time we've seen her dressed like this in many a
      year... happily teaching young girls how to dance...

236   INT. DANCE STUDIO, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1967                    236

      We see Daisy alone... cleaning up... music playing on the
      record player... and for a brief moment she stops, and
      dances... the smallest, most tentative of steps... she
      sees in the studio's mirrors Benjamin's been silently
      watching her...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You're still beautiful to watch...

      She looks at herself in the dance mirror... just what
      happens...

                                 DAISY
                   Dancing is all about the line...
                   the line of your body...after
                   awhile... you lose the line... and
                   you can never get it back...

      They look at each other in the mirror...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I figured out if you were born in
                   1918... 49 years ago... I'm 43...
                   we're almost the same age... In
                   three years we'll meet in the
                   middle...

      And what she doesn't say, what they both know, is she's
      going one way and he's going the other...Benjamin
      affectionately...

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (smiles)
                   We finally caught up to each
                   other...

      She smiles, starts to turn...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Stay just like that... I want to
                   remember what we look like right
                   now.

      They stay like that for a moment longer... She turns to
      get her things... She shuts off the lights... She takes
      his arm...

                   I thought I was far too old... I'm
                   pregnant...

      He stops... They look at each other, she smiles, nodding
      "yes," it's true. And deeply moved he takes her in his
      arms... grateful...touching her face... holding her...

                   The child...

      We're not sure what more she is about to say, her
      breathing rasps... she's having some difficulty
      breathing...


                                 CAROLINE

      As they ride Benjamin looks over watching a father
      sitting with his child... Daisy notices his look...

      Daisy with a hot Fudge sundae and a tuna sandwich...
      Benjamin just some coffee... They're quiet... And Daisy
      says...

                              DAISY
                I know you're afraid.

                              BENJAMIN
                I'm not hiding it.

                               DAISY
                Okay.   What's your worst fear?

                              BENJAMIN
                What if it has...what if its like
                me?...

                              DAISY
                Then we'll love it all the more...

                              BENJAMIN
                I want to be father... not a
                little brother... I don't want to
                be picked up from elementary
                school by my kid... I don't want
                anyone babysitting me...

                              DAISY
                I'm going to make this work...
                This is what I want, and I want it
                with you...

                              BENJAMIN
                You know, there's nothing I
                wouldn't do for you...

                              DAISY
                Would you tell a blind man he
                can't have children? You will be
                a father for as long as you can.
                I know the consequences. I
                accepted that. Your love, loving
                you, is worth everything to me.

      He smiles... She gets up and goes to the restroom. He
      sits with his thoughts... and he notices a television's
      on... a news report... something catches his eye...
      someone swimming? He gets up moving to the television...
      where he hears...

                                 A MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                        (on television)
                   The oldest woman to ever swim the
                   English Channel arrived in Calais
                   today... having made the swim in
                   thirty-four hours, twenty-two
                   minutes and fourteen seconds...
                   the sixty-eight year old
                   Englishwoman, Elizabeth Abbott...

      And we see dear ELIZABETH ABBOTT, coming out of the
      water, completing the English Channel swim.

                        (on television)
                   Anything's possible.

      And as she smiles, after a lifetime of waiting,
      triumphant... And Benjamin smiles for her, and for
      himself, too... where anything is possible... Daisy's
      come beside him...

                                 DAISY
                   Ready?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Yes.

      He leaves some money. He takes her arm... and as they go
      outside, moving along the street...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)

      We see, lying on Daisy's chest, is a newborn baby...
      Benjamin, standing beside her... And a young Woman Doctor
      that's there... packing up her things...

                   You're sure there's nothing wrong

                   She's a normal, healthy baby in

       NIGHT, 1969

       The room's dark. We see Benjamin in bed, the baby
       sleeping between him and Daisy... And as Benjamin watches
       them sleep... he looks at his reflection in a wall
       mirror... his 51st year on this earth... 34 years old...
       a young man... He looks at his baby... he looks at
       Daisy... in her mid 40s... her hair's begun to gray...
       her face begun to show the natural touches of age... His
       stare awakens her... She looks at him sensing he's deeply
       troubled... He shuts his eyes... she watches him sleep,
       Daisy as troubled as he is... but for very different
       reasons...

246    EXT. A PARK - NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1969                        246

       Benjamin is sitting with Caroline while she plays in a
       park's sand box... Caroline helping herself to a mouthful
       of sand... Benjamin, trying to get the sand out of her
       mouth...

                                  BENJAMIN
                    Don't eat sand...

       Daisy comes over to sit with them...

                                  BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                    She's going to have a really
                    attractive diaper.

       As they sit watching Caroline playing in the sand...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   I think you should find a real
                   father for her...

                                 DAISY
                   What are you talking about?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   She needs someone to grow old
                   with...

                                 DAISY
                   She'll learn to accept whatever
                   happens... She loves you...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   She needs a father not a playmate.

                                 DAISY
                   Is it that my age is starting to
                   show...? Is that what you are
                   telling me? Have you lost your
                   desire for me...?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You don't need another child to
                   raise...

                                 DAISY
                   You're going to leave me, aren't
                   you?

      He doesn't say anything.

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   You can't leave me.

      He's silent.

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   You can't do this to me...!

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   It was your first birthday. We
                   had a party... the house was
                   filled with people...

                                                                   159.



247    INT. SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE - NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1969           247

       The birthday party. A cake with a big number "1" candle.
       One-year-olds not having a clue.

                               BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                 The fathers and mothers were
                 there...

       He looks at the age appropriate mothers and fathers with
       their children...

                               A MAN
                 Before you look around they'll be
                 in High School dating.

       Benjamin manages a smile.

247A   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY - PRESENT         247A

                               DAISY
                 I remember your first birthday
                 like it was yesterday.

248    INT. SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE - LATER IN THE DAY, 1969            248

       The house is empty, the guests gone... Daisy busy
       cleaning up from the party. She stops to look outside,
       at the backyard. Benjamin is sitting on a lounge
       chair... the baby, in her party dress, sitting on his
       chest... As Daisy stands at the window watching him with
       their baby...

249    INT. THEIR BEDROOM - SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT,    249
       1969

       Benjamin, dressed, watching Caroline in her crib, asleep.
       Daisy in bed, asleep.

                               BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                 I sold the summer house on Lake
                 Pontchartrain... I sold my share
                 of Button's Buttons... I sold the
                 sailboat... I put it all into an
                 account for your mother... And
                 before you would ever remember
                 me...

       And he bends to kiss his sleeping daughter, whispering to
       her...

                               BENJAMIN
                 I want you to know I love you...

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                      160.

      He stops to put a bank book on the dresser, along with a
      house key... the sound of the key is just enough for
      Daisy to stir. He starts to leave... He turns to go...
      and he sees Daisy is looking at him... A look not so much
      of anger, or hurt, not of resignation, but a look of
      acceptance... that this is what her life is now... He
      crosses out of the dark room silently closing the door
      behind him...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   I left, so that you and your
                   mother could have a life.

250   EXT. SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1969              250

      He takes the old motorcycle out of the garage.

                                  BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                         (after a beat)
                   I left with just the clothes on my
                   back.

      He starts the motorcycle, and with just the shirt on his
      back he rides away...

251   INT. SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - LATE AT NIGHT,           251
      1969

      Daisy still lying in bed, the sound of the motorcycle
      driving away. She gets up. She takes the baby out of
      her crib and into bed with her, holding her baby in the
      bare light...

252   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              252

      Daisy, in her regal turban, silently looking out the
      window... the wind knocking loudly again...

                                  CAROLINE
                   I almost wish I didn't know any of
                   this.
                         (she's quiet, after a
                          beat)
                   I feel odd, reading...it...

      She looks at the book...

                   Where did he go?

                                   DAISY
                   I don't know.    I never heard from
                   him.

      Caroline, distant, picks through the book...She comes
      upon...

                                 CAROLINE
                   There are postcards...

      Looking through them...

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                   They're all addressed to me...
                   They're from all sorts of
                   places...

      And she realizes...

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                   They're for my birthday.

                   1970...I would have been two...
                   "Happy Birthday." "I wish I could
                   have kissed you goodnight."
                        (reading, another
                         one)
                   "Happy Birthday, you're five." "I

                        (reading on)
                   "Happy Birthday six-year-old." "I
                   wish I could be there to teach you

                   Nothing I ever did will replace
                   that..."

      Daisy murmurs... Which brings Caroline back to the
      book...

       And Benjamin's voice comes in... WHILE WE SEE HIM IN
       VARIOUS PLACES ALL OVER THE WORLD, A MONTAGE, A FILM
       WITHIN A FILM, OF THE ROAD HE'S TAKEN...

                               BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                 "...What I think is, it's never
                 too late...or, in my case, too
                 early, to be whoever you want to
                 be...There's no time limit, start
                 anytime you want...change or stay
                 the same...there aren't any
                 rules...We can make the best or
                 worst of it...I hope you make the
                 best...I hope you see things that
                 startle you. Feel things you
                 never felt before. I hope you
                 meet people who have a different
                 point of view. I hope you
                 challenge yourself. I hope you
                 stumble, and pick yourself up. I
                 hope you live the life you wanted
                 to...and if you haven't, I hope
                 you start all over again."

       A record's playing piano music. Classes are done.
       Parents taking their children. We see Daisy, in her long
       skirt... helping pick up with her hands and her nimble
       toes, errant clothing, the jackets, the sweaters...

      It takes us a moment to recognize her... in the some
      twelve years since we've last seen her, 56 now, her
      hair's cut short... and it's gone mostly gray... and,
      although her age is on her face, she still has a dancer's
      posture, her head held high... carrying herself with
      grace... and one thing that will never change, are her
      unforgettable blue eyes... We hear the door opening...
      Daisy, busy gathering, saying her goodnights... glances
      toward the door across the studio... And she sees a young
      Man has come in, a young man in his twenties... standing
      silently, a stranger, standing by the door... Daisy, as
      she closes up the studio, makes her way toward him,
      saying goodnight to people... she bends to pick up a
      ballet slipper...

                                 DAISY
                   Somebody left their slipper...

      Daisy looks over, the young Man hasn't moved... the
      studio has all but emptied... she walks toward him...
      he's wearing worn trousers, a coat that's seen better
      days...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Are you here to pick someone up?

      He shakes "no." Coming closer....

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I'm sorry, we're closed now.

      She moves to open the door to show him out... when she
      gets a good look at him. She stops, realizing who it
      is...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Benjamin?

      ...and she's taken aback by his youth, we all are...
      sixteen years younger... in his 20s now... it's at once
      staggering and heartbreaking... what age can do... And
      she realizes, at that very moment, he was right all
      along...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   You're so young.

      They look at each other... When she's able to find the
      words...

                I wanted to see you both.

      She stares at him... just the piano music. And despite
      the gulf of time... there's a terrible aching they have
      for each other... and before they can say anything... the
      door swings open and Caroline, 12, comes hurrying in...

                              CAROLINE
                You ready, Mom?

      Benjamin stares at her appearance... And Daisy, can't
      help herself, and seeing Caroline, Daisy, overcome by it
      all, starts to cry.

                              CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                Is something wrong, Mother?

                              DAISY
                No... He was telling me a very sad
                story about a mutual friend we
                hadn't seen in a long time... This
                is my friend, Benjamin... you knew
                him when you were... just a
                baby...

                              CAROLINE
                Hi...

                              BENJAMIN
                Hello...

      He reaches, taking her hand... needing to touch her...

                              A MAN'S    (V.O.)
                Hello...

      And a Man 50s, wearing a suit and a tie, comes in...

                              THE MAN
                I'm sorry... I thought you were
                done...

                              DAISY
                This is a friend of my family's...
                Benjamin Button... this is my
                husband... Robert...

      They shake hands... There's an awkward quiet...

                              ROBERT
                It was nice to have met you...
                We'll be in the car, darling...

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                   167.

                              DAISY
                I'm just closing up...

      And Robert and Caroline go outside to wait for her...

                              BENJAMIN
                She's so lovely... she looks like
                you... Does she dance?

                                 DAISY
                Not very well.

                              BENJAMIN
                I suppose that would be from my
                side of things.

                              `DAISY
                She's a dear sweet girl... she
                seems a little lost... But who
                isn't a little lost at 12?
                There's a lot of her that reminds
                me of you.

      And she shuts off a set of the lights.

                              DAISY (CONT'D)
                My husband. He's a doctor... was
                a widower... He's an incredibly
                bright, adventurous man...

      Benjamin smiles.

                              DAISY (CONT'D)
                He's been a terrific father... and
                a great partner and friend...

      And she shuts off the record player and another set of
      lights... and for a moment they stand in the dark
      studio... and they look at their reflections in the
      mirror... seeing who they are now...

                              DAISY (CONT'D)
                You're so much younger.

                              BENJAMIN
                Just what you can see.

      She looks at him, and after all these years... she now
      understands completely... she looks outside at her
      daughter standing by the car with her "father,"
      waiting...

                               DAISY
                 You ware right. She needed a
                 father. I couldn't have raised
                 both of you. I'm not that strong.

      He's quiet.   They both are.   She looks at him.

                               DAISY (CONT'D)
                 I never thought how it must have
                 broken your heart, too.

      His silence is enough.

                               DAISY (CONT'D)
                 Where are you staying? What are
                 you going to do?

                               BENJAMIN
                 I'm at the Pontchartrain Hotel on
                 the avenue. I have no idea what
                 I'm going to do.

      And it seems like they want to hold each other. But they
      can't. It's still. And aware of the car's headlights
      waiting at the curb... she turns, holding the door open
      for him...

                                 DAISY
                 I have to go.

      He nods.   He walks by her, going out.

264   EXT. A STREET, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1980                         264

      She stops to lock the door. She turns, getting into the
      car... and leaves... Benjamin stands on the corner, hands
      in his pockets, the car driving by him... and Daisy can't
      help but look at him... and then the car's gone... and as
      he crosses the street and walks off into the night...

265   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT               265

                               CAROLINE
                 That young man was my father?

      And a Nurse comes in.

                               THE NURSE
                 The hurricane changed directions
                 again. They are predicting it
                 will make landfall sometime soon.

                                 CAROLINE
                   Is there anything we need to do?

                                 THE NURSE
                   Arrangements are being made to
                   move people if we have to. I'll
                   let you know as soon as we know
                   anything.

      She leaves hurriedly.

                                 DAISY
                   Please tell me what he says?

      Caroline looks at the book.       And Benjamin's voice comes
      in...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   "That night..."

266   INT. BENJAMIN'S HOTEL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1980            266

      Benjamin, sitting on the end of the bed, not sure why he
      came there at all... There's a sound at the door...as if
      somebody was there...

                                    BENJAMIN
                   Hello?

      Its quiet...a hesitancy...He starts to get up and there's
      a knock on the door...He opens it...and Daisy's there.
      He's startled to see her...

                                    DAISY
                   May I come in?

                                    BENJAMIN
                   Please...

      She comes inside...an awkward quiet...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   I don't know what I'm doing
                   here...What I expected...?

      It echoes how she's feeling being there...They stand not
      knowing what to say...And Daisy says, sadly...

                                    DAISY
                   Nothing lasts.

      He puts a finger to her lips. He shakes "no."       And what
      he's come to know, that some things do last...

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I never once stopped loving you...

      He affectionately pushes a hair off of her forehead...

                                 DAISY
                   I'm an old woman now, Benjamin.

      And he helps her off with her coat... She's still.

                                   DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Benjamin...

      He kisses her... and she's quiet... and he undresses
      her... undressing himself... and they stand momentarily
      naked... the young man and the older woman.

                                   DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Are you sure?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Some things you don't ever
                   forget... the feel... the taste...

      And he kisses her again...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   ... the smell...

      He puts his mouth by her cheek... breathing her in...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   ... the touch...

      Caressing her...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Of someone you love...

267   INT. BENJAMIN'S HOTEL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1980           267

      We see Benjamin standing at the window watching as Daisy
      gets into a taxi... the taxi starting to drive off... and
      Daisy turning... to look back... waving to him. Benjamin
      waving to her... what they both somehow know, is a last
      goodbye...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   I watched her go...

      ...the taxi going down the street and out of sight... for
      the last time... Despite losing sight of her he still
      hasn't moved... standing by the window...

268   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT             268

      Daisy, breath raspy, sitting silently in her bed looking
      out the window... We realize Caroline's stopped
      reading...

                                    DAISY
                   Please read...

                                 CAROLINE
                   That's the last thing he wrote...

      Daisy's quiet... they both are... alone with their
      thoughts...

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                   What happened to him after that
                   last time with you, Mother?

      The wind has picked up considerably, rattling the window
      even harder..

                                 DAISY
                   A year or so after your father
                   passed... There was a call...

269   INT. DAISY'S HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - LATE DAY, 1990               269

      And we see Daisy in her bathrobe, in her sixties...
      drinking a cup of coffee... the telephone rings...

270   INT. A TAXI, NEW ORLEANS - LATE DAY, 1990                       270

      We see Daisy riding in the back or a taxi.

                                 DAISY
                   It's the last house...

      She looks outside, and we see up ahead of her, the Nolan
      House standing like a monument to time...

271   EXT. NOLAN HOUSE - LATE - DAY, 1990                             271

      Daisy gets out. The taxi drives off. Daisy stops for a
      moment before she opens the gate. The house has fallen
      into disrepair. A solitary old man sits on the porch
      rocking and rocking. She goes up the walk and out of
      habit goes around the back porch... to the kitchen...
      going inside...

272   INT. NOLAN HOUSE - LATE DAY, 1990                               272

      She comes into the kitchen. She moves down the hallway
      into the living room... The interior has also fallen on
      hard times. Some old people are still in residence --
      predominantly African Americans now... Queenie's
      daughter, now in her fifties herself, stands in the
      living room... Along with a plain Man in a plain suit...

                                  DAISY
                   I'm Daisy...

      The Man turns...

                                 THE MAN
                   Thank you for coming... I'm David
                   Hernandez with the Orleans Parish
                   department of Child Welfare
                   Services.

      Queenie's daughter turns on a lamp... it doesn't work...
      she crosses the room to turn on another...

                                 THE MAN (CONT'D)
                   He was found living in a condemned
                   building off of east Lamont... the
                   police found this with him... this
                   address... and your name...

      And he gives her the journal...

                   He was in very poor health... he
                   was taken to the hospital... He
                   doesn't seem to know who or where
                   he is... He's very confused... The
                   doctors who looked at him think he
                   may be autistic.

                                 QUEENIE'S DAUGHTER
                   I told Mr. Hernandez about
                   Benjamin bein' one of us. I told
                   him if he needs a place to stay...
                   it's alright... he can stay
                   here... he is blood after all...

      And just then we hear a PIANO playing... as if it were
      being played by a child... with no skill... banging as
      much as anything... And Daisy follows the sound of the
      piano into the parlor...

273   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1990                            273

      And she sees his back... just a boy of 12 now... hunched
      over... trying to play the piano... trying to play the
      tune the woman had taught to him...

                                 DAISY
                   Benjamin.

      He turns at the sound of her voice. There is no
      indication he recognizes her at all.

                                 BENJAMIN AT TWELVE
                   Do you know this song?

      And he tries to play what he thinks is the song, but is
      nothing more than a child playing random notes.

                   You play really beautifully.

      She comes and touches his back... He shrinks from her
      touch.

                                 THE MAN
                   He doesn't seem to like to be
                   touched.

      And while he tries to play...

                                 THE MAN (CONT'D)
                   The doctors said if they didn't
                   know any better, he goes in and
                   out of states of recognition, as
                   if he had the beginnings of
                   dementia...

      Daisy's looking at the boy, who was once the man she
      loved... who she still loves... She looks into his
      eyes...

                                 DAISY
                   Do you remember me?   I'm Daisy.

      He looks at her.    No sense of recognition.

                                 BENJAMIN AT TWELVE
                   Daisy is a very pretty name. I'm
                   Benjamin.

                                 DAISY
                   It's good to meet you Benjamin.
                   Do you mind if I sit with you? I
                   would love to hear you play.

      He doesn't say anything. She sits down beside him on the
      piano bench. He stops to look at her.

                                 BENJAMIN AT TWELVE
                   There's something about you...
                   There's something about your eyes
                   I remember from a long time ago...

      He looks at her eyes. She looks at him... And as she
      sits with him on the piano bench... as he tries to
      play... Daisy and Benjamin, "together again..."

274   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              274

                                 DAISY
                   Queenie's daughter saw to it that
                   he was taken care of...

275   INT. THE KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING, 1994                   275

      And we see Benjamin, just eight now... coming into the
      kitchen... Queenie's daughter cleaning up after
      breakfast.

                                 BENJAMIN AT EIGHT
                   I want some breakfast.



                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                       175.

                                 QUEENIE'S DAUGHTER
                   You just ate breakfast.

                                    BENJAMIN AT EIGHT
                   No I didn't...

                                 AN OLD WOMAN
                   You just finished eating, Mr.
                   Button.

                                 BENJAMIN AT EIGHT
                   You think I don't know what you
                   are doing?

      And like an eight year old, or an old man old with onset
      Alzheimer's -- which makes him nearly a helpless child,
      he starts to rage... throwing things...

                                 BENJAMIN AT EIGHT (CONT'D)
                   You are all fucking liars!

                                  DAISY'S (V.0.)
                   And every day I would stop by...
                   and make sure he was
                   comfortable...

      And just then Daisy comes into the kitchen.       She sees him
      raging.

                                 QUEENIE'S DAUGHTER
                   He doesn't believe he's already
                   had his breakfast.

                                 DAISY
                   Let's see if we can find something
                   else for you to do.

                                  BENJAMIN AT EIGHT
                         (upset, meaning
                          lapses)
                   I can't help it. I can't help
                   this.

                                 DAISY
                   I know you can't.

      And as she puts her arm around him, taking him out of the
      room, understanding...

                                 DAISY'S (V.0.)
                   Many times he would simply forget
                   who and where he was at all...

                                                                   176.



276   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - DAY                      276

      We see Daisy sitting on a bed with Benjamin in his room
      on the second floor of the old house... And he's oddly
      lucid...more articulate than his age would indicate...

                              BENJAMIN AT EIGHT
                I get the feeling there's a lot of
                things I can't remember...

                              DAISY
                What do you mean?

                              BENJAMIN AT EIGHT
                It's like there's this whole life
                I had and I can't remember what it
                was...

      He's frustrated by it...

                              DAISY
                It's alright... It's alright to
                forget things...

      And as she sits on his bed with him... in the upstairs
      room...

                              DAISY'S (V.0.)
                It wasn't easy...

277   EXT. NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1996                                 277

      And we see Benjamin, no more than six now, standing on
      the ROOF... Daisy standing on the ground down below
      him...

                              DAISY
                     (nervous)
                I wish you'd come down...

                              BENJAMIN AT SIX
                     (a little boy)
                I can see everything.

      And he points out...

                              BENJAMIN AT SIX (CONT'D)
                I can see the big river... all the
                boats... I can see the graveyard
                where mama's buried and all those
                other people... I can see the
                city... where you have your
                dancing place...

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                      177.

277   CONTINUED:                                                      277

      And tears fill Daisy's eyes...

                                 DAISY
                   You're right, you can see
                   everything sweetheart...

      And he can... he can see all the way across to the
      Mississippi River... the old graveyard... the city... his
      whole life...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I think you better come down...

                                 BENJAMIN AT SIX
                   What if I could fly?

      And it looks like he might just try...

                                 DAISY
                        (stopping him)
                   I knew a man who could fly. Come
                   down and I'll tell you all about
                   him.

      He's quiet, thinking about that. And acquiescing, he
      turns up the roof out of sight... some short
      moments...and he comes running out the front door... his
      hands in his pockets like the brave little man he is...
      Daisy bends down... and as he runs into her arms... Daisy
      holding him...

278   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              278

      Daisy propped in her bed looking out the window...

                                 DAISY
                   And I went to take care of him...

279   EXT. NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1997                                    279

      And we see Daisy, in her seventies now, carrying a
      suitcase, coming up the walkway, and onto the porch...
      old people sitting in the porch chairs...

                                  DAISY'S (V.0.)
                   He was five, I think, when I moved
                   in... the same age I was when I
                   had met him...

      And we see Benjamin, 5 now, sitting on the porch swing,
      staring off... and he drools like a helpless old man.
      Daisy stops, taking out a handkerchief, wiping the drool
      off his chin...

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                   How would you like to help me
                   unpack?

280   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1997                   280

      Daisy, unpacking her suitcase with Benjamin's help,
      taking out an alarm clock, a quilt, some photographs...
      The "Just So Book.." Her personal things... moving in...
      Benjamin, playing with the alarm clock, making the alarm
      go off... again, and again...

281   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1997                 281

      Benjamin in a small child's bed. Daisy, sitting on his
      bed reading from Kipling's "Just So" stories to him...

                                 DAISY
                   This is the picture of old Man
                   Kangaroo at five in the afternoon,
                   when he got his beautiful hind
                   legs just as Big God Ngong had
                   promised.

                                 DAISY'S (V.0.)

282   EXT. NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, THE FALL, 2000                  282

      And we see Benjamin, just three or so now, holding
      Daisy's hand, walking with her in some autumn leaves...

                                 DAISY'S (V.0.)
                   I watched as he forgot how to
                   talk...

283   INT. NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, 2001                            283

      Benjamin almost two... sitting On Daisy's lap in the

      clock of "Mr. Cake's"... handing it down to another
      workman...and putting up a new clock... a digital
      clock... The time moving... the way it's meant to be...

      Shadows dapple the room. Daisy sitting in    an old chair

      on her... holding Benjamin on her lap... a   tiny thing
      now... nearly newborn... he can almost fit   in her two old
      hands...

                He looked at me...

                   I'm going to see what they want us
                   to do...

      And as she gets up, the "book" drops on the floor.      And a
      card's fallen out. Caroline picks it up.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                   It's a train schedule.

      She turns it over.    There's writing.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                   "I'm on a train in India filled
                   with people."

290   INT. A TRAIN SOMEWHERE IN INDIA - LATE AT NIGHT                 290

      An overcrowded train car... people sitting and standing

      available space, nook and cranny, asleep.

                   sleeping...

      Now we see Benjamin sitting on the floor among all of the
      people, the only one awake, writing on the back of the
      train schedule.

      eight... the symbol for infinity... it fights its way

    Heavy leaden skies over the arachnoid stands and floodlights
    of Elland Road stadium: home to Leeds United football club.

    And rain. Sheets of angry, Yorkshire rain.

    TITLE: "THE DAMNED UNITED"


2   INT. BOARDROOM - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                    2

    Flashlights pop as DON REVIE, (late 40's), the most
    successful manager in English football, walks out in front of
    a pack of newspaper and TV REPORTERS. He is flanked by the
    Chairman of Leeds United, (MANNY CUSSINS, 60's), and several
    other white-haired blazer-wearing members of the Board.

                        REVIE
           I'm just going to make a brief
           statement.

    CAPTION: "JULY 4th, 1974"

    REVIE stands under a large trophy cabinet, filled with the
    silverware he has won. REPORTERS wait: intimidated. Cowed.

                        REVIE (cont'd)
           Yesterday afternoon at 3.00, I
           accepted the FA's offer to become the
           next manager of the England national
           football team.

    A gasp among the JOURNALISTS. A burst of flashlights. The
    BOARD MEMBERS look down at the floor in silence. Bereaved
    fathers losing their favourite son.

                        REVIE (cont'd)
           Obviously that involves me leaving
           Leeds United after 13 happy and
           successful years, which makes me very
           sad. I'd like to think I have built
           the club into a family and there must
           be sadness when anybody leaves a
           family. However, when one man goes,
           another steps into his place. I know
           who I think that person should be, the
           man to replace me, and I shall make my
           feelings clear to the directors. Thank
           you. No further comments.

    REVIE turns and walks out, a volley of REPORTERS shouting
    questions...

    We're in a car. Tarmac passes beneath us. Roadmarkings.

    OVER THIS: the sound of a flat Teeside voice, singing along
    with Frank Sinatra on the radio...

    Two young BOYS, (12, 9) stare out of car windows. Raindrops
    on the panes of glass. Their father, BRIAN CLOUGH, (39),
    slick, modern, cocky, handsome. About as big a contrast to
    DON REVIE as it's possible to find, is up front. Driving..

                        CLOUGH
                  (singing)
           "And let me play among the stars.."

                        SIMON
           When are we there?

                        CLOUGH
           Any moment now. On the right.
                  (singing)
           "Let me see what spring is like..."

    The car turns a bend, and suddenly the floodlights and stands
    of a football stadium come into view. The BOYS' eyes widen.

                        BOY 1
           There it is! Dad! There it is!
    The BOYS smile in excitement.

                        CLOUGH
                  (singing)
           "..on Jupiter and Mars.."

    `LEEDS UNITED FOOTBALL CLUB' written on the side of the
    stadium. CLOUGH smiles, then puts his foot down. The car
    accelerates past the turning. The BOYS' smiles fade.

                        BOY 1
           Where are you going? Dad? You've
           missed it.

                        CLOUGH
           We've something else to do first.
           Won't take long.

    The MUSIC continues as the car drives on, turning into the
    MUSIC of a television program..


5   INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY - (1974)                          5

    The `CALENDER' front title sequence, a Yorkshire TV current
    affairs program. We're in a TV studio. The presenter is
    AUSTIN MITCHELL, (40)..

                          MITCHELL
             Today we welcome Brian Clough as he
             starts his new job as manager of Leeds
             United, taking over from Don Revie -
             the most successful manager in the
             club's history, under whom Leeds have
             won everything..
                          CLOUGH
             ..not QUITE everything. Not won the
             European Cup...

                          MITCHELL
             ...but pretty much everything else.
             Daunted?

                          CLOUGH
             Daunted? Not at all, Austin. Looking
             forward to it.

                          MITCHELL
             The biggest challenge of your life,
             and you'll be without Peter Taylor,
             for the first time. Your lifelong
             professional colleague.

                          CLOUGH
             Yes, Pete's at Brighton now. He had
             the opportunity to come with me, but
             Brighton was his choice. Leeds was
             mine.

                          MITCHELL
             A surprising choice, some might say.
             Because you've been very vocal in your
             criticism of them over the years.

                           CLOUGH
             I have.

                           MITCHELL
              You've accused players of dirty
              tactics, cheating, dissent, foul play.
              You called Norman Hunter, Norman
              "Bites yer legs" Hunter, you've said
              Peter Lorimer falls when no one
              touches him...

                           CLOUGH
              And I was right.

                           MITCHELL
              I'm curious. Why do you now show such
              alacrity to joining them after such
              vituperative criticism of them for so
              long?

                           CLOUGH
              Goodness, it's going to take me half
              an hour to explain all those words for
              a start.

     Laughter from the camera CREW..

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              Football is a beautiful game, Austin.
              It needs to be played beautifully. I
              think Leeds have sold themselves
              short...


5A   INT. REVIE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME                              5A

     CLOUGH's interview continues on a TV in a sitting-room, where
     it is being watched by Don Revie, sitting in an armchair...
                           CLOUGH (ON TV)
              ..they've been champions but they've
              not been good champions in the sense
              of wearing the crown well. They've not
              been loved. But then that's hardly
              surprising, given the type of
              operation there's been in place there.

     CLOUGH continues...

                           CLOUGH
              Football clubs are like families,

              ..who has long been regarded as a

              even, after all the things you've said
              in public, coming in and taking ouver
              as STEPfather.

              Don't you expect some degree of
              resentment to this?

                           CLOUGH
              I would accept and expect a
              strangeness, initially, it's   perfectly
              normal. But it won't be long   before
              they realise I'm a fair man.   A kind
              man. And maybe under me they   can
              experience what it's like to   be in a
              happy family, after all.

                            MITCHELL
              How can you be sure they weren't happy
              with Don all along?

                           CLOUGH
              They wouldn't have played football
              that way if they were happy.

6    EXT. TRAINING FIELD - DAY - (1974)                             6

     Here they are. The Leeds PLAYERS. Long hair and long faces.
     Surly. Truculent. Dangerous.

     Out on the practice pitch. In the rain. Some doing warm-up
     exercises. Others milling dangerously in groups. Their names
     on their purple track suits.

     HUNTER, LORIMER, GILES, BATES, GRAY, CLARKE, BREMNER, MCQUEEN

            Morning lads! Lovely Yorkshire
            weather!
                   (gestures shivering)
            I tell you makes me want to jump on a
            plane right back to Majorca!

    CLOUGH laughs. The PLAYERS stare in silence. Squinting in the
    drizzle. Condensation coming from their mouths.

    JOHNNY GILES stares. BILLY BREMNER spits and continues
    talking disrespectfully.

                         CLOUGH (cont'd)
            Not much of a welcome, was it? And not
            so much as a smile from Johnny Giles.

                         JIMMY
            You're five days late!! And did you
            really need to say that about Majorca?
                   (beat, changing the
                    subject)
            You know he was Revie's first choice
            for getting your job.

                         CLOUGH
            Who? Johnny Giles?

    CLOUGH looks over at GILES, who turns away, resumes
    training....

                         CLOUGH (cont'd)
            Was he now? And Bremner?

                         JIMMY
            Club Captain. Don's son and heir. His
            first born. You're never going to get
            any love from him.

    BREMNER, a flint-eyed Scot, stares at CLOUGH..

                         CLOUGH
            Great. Here's to happy fucking
            families.


8   INT. CORRIDOR - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                     8

    JIMMY GORDON leads CLOUGH and his BOYS down a corridor, where
    countless photographs of DON REVIE hang on the walls. Holding
    silverware.

    They pass an open door, with a sign outside, `MANAGER. Mr.
    DON. REVIE.' CLOUGH stops. Looks at the sign.

9   INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)             9

    CLOUGH walks into the manager's office. The empty chair. The
    bare desk. His desk. Don's desk.

    CLOUGH takes a seat in the chair.

    Presently, a middle-aged matron, JEAN REID, Don Revie's
    faithful SECRETARY for 13 years, appears in the doorway..

                        CLOUGH
           Any chance of a cup of tea, duck?

                        JEAN
           They're waiting for you. Upstairs.

    CLOUGH swings his feet on the desk.

                          CLOUGH
           Who's that?
                        JEAN
           The Directors.

                          CLOUGH
           For me? Why?

                        JEAN
           For the board meeting.

                        CLOUGH
           Let them wait. Now, how about that cup
           of tea?

    CLOUGH smiles sweetly, but JEAN stares at CLOUGH. She
    pointedly doesn't move. CLOUGH lowers his feet.

                        CLOUGH (cont'd)
           All right, I'll go then. Wouldn't want
           to get off on the wrong foot.

    CLOUGH walks over to the door. Looks at the desk.

                        CLOUGH (cont'd)
           Who's desk is that, love?

                        JEAN
           Yours, Mr. Clough.

                        CLOUGH
           Not mine. I didn't put it there, did
           I?

              Chairs, too. The whole bloody lot.
              Think it would be best if there were
              nothing of his left here.

     CLOUGH reaches the door..

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              Were you his secretary?

                           JEAN
              I was. For thirteen happy years.

                           CLOUGH
              What's your name, pet?

                           JEAN
              Jean, Sir. Jean Reid.
                           CLOUGH
              In which case, no offence duck, but
              there's nothing I want typed on paper
              from you other than your resignation.

     She gasps..

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              And you can change the locks on your
              way out. Don't want the ghost of
              troubled Don popping in now, do we?
              Rattling his chains. Scaring my young
              ones.

     CLOUGH puts his arms protectively round the BOYS, and leads
     them out of the door. JEAN REID stares, visibly shaken.

     BOLTON, BOB ROBERTS, SYDNEY SIMON, PERCY WOODWARD.

     Aldermen and Rotary club members. Masons and businessmen.

     CLOUGH enters the boardroom. Indicates to JIMMY GORDON to
     look after the BOYS outside. Inside: matching curtains and
     carpets.

                           CUSSINS

     The DIRECTORS shoot looks at one another.

              We've had a phone-call.

                           BOLTON
              Not so much a phone-call. Bloody
              tirade.

                           CUSSINS
              From Don. They only went and rung him.
              And ran some of your quotes by him.
              About how unhappy the players were.
              What "bad champions". Looking for a
              response.

              done that piece in the Mirror should
              he? Saying he thought I was a daft
              choice.

               Of course it's just about me and Don.
               Always has been. But instead of

     (60's) looks like Krushchev, cue-ball head, voice like a

              Tonight's on Uncle Sam. We're going

                           CLOUGH
              I want it perfect. Like a fucking
              carpet. We've got proper footballers
              coming. Who know how to keep the ball
              on the deck.

                           GROUNDSMAN

     CLOUGH turns to TAYLOR..

                           CLOUGH
              You know he'll be making a file on us.
              A dossier.

                          TAYLOR
              Who?

                           CLOUGH
              Don Revie. Prepares a file on every
              game. Leaves nothing to chance. Knows
              every opponents formations.
              Strategies. Everything.

                           TAYLOR
              I've heard he's a superstitious twat.
                     (calling out)
              Ey..! Help him, someone HELP him..!

                           CLOUGH
              We grew up just a few streets apart,
              you know. In Middlesborough, close to
              Ayrsome Park. He'll have known my
              street, Valley Road - probably bought
              sweets from Garnetts Factory, where my
              dad worked.

                           TAYLOR
              Heard he wears the same suit to every
              game. His "lucky blue suit".

     CLOUGH polishing the sign, `VISITORS' on the dressing-room
     door.

     CLOUGH on his knees, scrubbing, cleaning baths in the
     visiting team's washrooms.


22   INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1968)        22
     CLOUGH puts on his suit. Ties his tie. He takes a bottle of
     vintage red wine from a cupboard.

     He places the bottles on his desk. Then puts two cut crystal
     glasses on his desk. His and Don's.

     A flicker of jealousy on PETER TAYLOR's face, almost like a
     wife - hurt that his friend is making such an effort for
     someone else.

     A knock on the door. JIMMY GORDON appears in the doorway..

                          JIMMY
             They're here!
                    (a confused look)

23   EXT. CAR PARK - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1968)               23

     CLOUGH rushes out of the doors, straightening his cuffs,
     straightening his hair, buttoning his jacket. First out to
     greet the arriving team.

     He turns the corner to see the LEEDS COACH a hundred yards
     down the street, the PLAYERS getting off the coach and
     walking towards him..

                         CLOUGH
            What are they doing?

                         JIMMY
            They've run out of petrol.

                         TAYLOR
            No, it's that superstition, isn't it?
            Every away cup ties, Revie makes them
            walk the last hundred yards.
     TAYLOR mutters under his breath, "Soppy twat".

     CLOUGH cranes his neck. Watches DON REVIE, 40's. Thick-set.
     Severe, forbidding, intimidating, in a huddle with his
     coaching staff, Les Cocker and Syd Owen. His henchmen. His
     assassins. His "Goodfellas". His right and left hand.

     CLOUGH walks towards him. Hand outstretched..

                         CLOUGH
            Welcome to Derby, Don. Pleasure to
            meet you. I'm Brian Clough.

     But REVIE walks past without shaking hands, without talking,
     without even breaking stride..

     ..and disappears into the stadium, deep in conversation with
     Les Cocker and Syd Owen.

     CLOUGH stares. Hand still outstretched. He looks over at
     PETER TAYLOR, who can't help smiling, `Forget it'.

     TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON walk off, but CLOUGH still stares at
     REVIE in disbelief.


24   EXT. DUG-OUT - TOUCHLINE - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1968) 24

     The LEEDS PLAYERS run out onto the pitch: HUNTER, MADELY,
     BREMNER, GILES, REANEY, JONES, in a line, waving to the
     crowd, turning North, South, East, West...

     TAYLOR rubs his hands in excitement, "Here we go". But CLOUGH
     is miles away. Still cannot let the insult go. He stares over
     at the visiting team dug-out..

     REVIE and his lieutenants. Whispering among themselves.
     Huddled in thought. Huddled in strategy. Huddled in
     malevolence.

     Presently, the game starts. A roar from the crowd.

     "Beeeep", the REF's whistle blows. A Derby PLAYER rolls in
     agony, cries out, a terrible, cynical challenge. Horrified,
     JIMMY GORDON and PETER TAYLOR up on thier feet in protest..

                             TAYLOR
             Referee..!

     CLOUGH looks over to REVIE's bench. Sees REVIE and SYD OWEN
     quietly applauding the Leeds PLAYER. Encouraging more of the
     same. As the Derby PLAYER is stretchered off..

     Presently, RRROOOOAAAARRRRR goes up. Goal Leeds. REVIE and
     his henchmen get to their feet. Applauding. 1-0.

     TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON immediately start shouting out
     encouragement to the Derby PLAYERS, new instructions, as the
     game restarts..

                          TAYLOR (cont'd)
             C'mon, keep your shape! Close him
             down!

                          JIMMY
             Think, Alan! To feet!

                          TAYLOR
             Now sent it out wide!

     CLOUGH doesn't join in. He continues to stare at REVIE in his
     dugout.

     Suddenly:

     "Beeep!", whistle! Penatly Leeds! CLOUGH leaps off the bench
     in outrage. Screaming, on his feel, protesting in disbelief..
                          CLOUGH
             What? He didn't fucking touch him!
             Ref! He DIVED! He fucking dived!

     REVIE shaking hands with his COLLEAGUES. Smiling amongst
     themselves. Congratulating themselves. Celebrating.

     The inevitable roar as Leeds convert, followed by,
     "Beeeeeep", the sound of the final WHISTLE. CLOUGH stares in
     disbelief. Robbed. Deflated.

     The REFEREE blows the whistle for the end of the game.

     CLOUGH watches as REVIE and SYD OWEN brush past, shaking
     PETER TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON's hands, (assuming TAYLOR's the
     manager), on their way to the dressing-rooms, their minds
     already on their next game...

     CLOUGH stares as they go..

              Couldn't wait to get away.

     Through the front door we see: DON REVIE, SYD OWEN and LES

     discussion, already thinking about the next match.

              Bloody cheats and all. Neither of
              those goals should have been allowed.

     But CLOUGH doesn't hear...

                           CLOUGH

              Beat him it's the last thing I do.

             to go and find me that player. A wise
             head.

                          CLOUGH (cont'd)
             And don't worry about the money.
             That's my problem. Just you go and

             All right, gentlemen, gather around,
             please.

     The players truculently gather round. CLOUGH watches them,
     notes their mood, then..

                          CLOUGH (cont'd)
             I might as well tell you now.

              You lot may all be internationals and
              have won all the domestic honours
              there are to win under Don Revie, but
              as far as I'm concerned, the first
              thing you can do for me is to chuck
              all your medals and all your caps and
              all your pots and all your pans into
              the biggest fucking dustbin you can
              find because you've never won any of
              them fairly. You've done it all by
              bloody cheating.

     Silence from the PLAYERS..

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              Mr. William Bremner. You're the
              captain. And a good one. But you're no
              good to the team and you're no good to
              me if you're suspended. I need you fit
              for every game, and I want good,
              clean, attractive football from my
              captain. Setting an example.

     CLOUGH turns to PETER LORIMER.

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              Mr. Lorimer, I hope you were listening
              because you're as good a footballer as
              I've ever seen, but you know how I
              feel about the way Don let you
              harangue referees, fall over when
              you've not been touched, protesting
              and pointing, trying to get other
              players booked. We'll have no more of
              that.
     CLOUGH turns to JOHNNY GILES..

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              And you, Irishman. God gave you skill,
              intelligence, and the best passing
              ability in the game. What God did not
              give you was six studs to wrap around
              another player's knee.

                           GILES
              I don't know what you're talking
              about.

     CLOUGH turns to NORMAN HUNTER...

                           CLOUGH
              But you do, though, "Bites yer Legs".

                          CLOUGH
             Not with me as manager. Do that on my
             watch, you'll be fined and stuck in
             the reserves.
                    (to all the PLAYERS)
             Things are going to be a little
             different around here. Without Don.
             Might feel a little strange at first.
             Might pinch a little. Like a new pair
             of shoes. But if you want your
             grandchildren to remember you for
             being something other than the dirty
             buggers you all were, if you want to
             be loved as REAL champions, WORTHY
             champions, you're going to have to
             work. And improve. And change.
                    (nods to JIMMY GORDON)
             Now let's start off by playing some
             seven-a-sides.
     PLAYERS stare at one another. Bristling. Disbelieving looks.

                          BREMNER
             Don never did that.

                          CLOUGH
             Well, I'm not Don. And from now on I
             never want to hear that man's name
             again. Ever. Next player who mentions
             it, or what he did or didn't bloody do
             in the good ol' days, will spend a
             week cleaning my boots.
                    (clapping hands)
             Seven-a-side. Keep it nice and clean,
             and sensible. No fifty-fifty's.
     CLOUGH sees that one side is a man short..

                          CLOUGH (cont'd)
             Right, I'll play myself. You might
             learn something, Irishman. Two hundred
             and fifty-one goals in two hundred and
             seventy-four starts.

     CLOUGH skillfully traps the ball between his feet, flips it
     up onto this head - down onto his chest, then "WHAM" volleys
     it into a distant goal..

                          CLOUGH (cont'd)
             Like to see Don fucking Revie do that,
             eh?

     CLOUGH removes his track suit trousers, rolls his neck. JIMMY
     GORDON quickly divides the players into two teams, blows the
     whistle..
                                                       (CO NTINU ED)

     The game starts. CLOUGH, leading by example, anxious to prove
     himself, is soon darting about, calling out...

                          CLOUGH (cont'd)
                    (clapping hands)
             Here, son. To feet. Keep it simple.
             Think and give. On the deck. Nice and
             crisp. Yes, to me, Sniffer. To me.

     CLARKE passes the ball. But it's a fifty-fifty. Another
     player bears down on CLOUGH..who refuses to pull out..

     "CRUNCH", a bone-shaking tackle from "BITES YER LEGS".

                          CLOUGH (cont'd)
             Oh, Jeeeeeesussss!!!

     CLOUGH is flattened. Rolls around on the floor. JIMMY GORDON
     runs up to NORMAN HUNTER..
                          JIMMY
             Fucking matter with you? He said no
             fifty-fifty's.

     HUNTER aggressively steps forward. Nose to nose. He is
     immediately flanked by other aggressive Leeds PLAYERS.
     Crowding the referee. Intimidating him.

                          HUNTER
             What are you going to do about it?
             Book me?

     JIMMY GORDON backs off, visibly frightened. CLOUGH lies on
     the floor. In agony. Holding his knee.

28   INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE DRESSING-ROOMS - SAME TIME                  28

     CLOUGH listens to the PLAYERS laughing at him. Disrespecting
     him. His face darkens.

                          BREMNER
                    (mimicking)
             "Two hundred and fifty-one goals in
             two hundred and seventy-four starts."

     The sound of coarse, cruel laughter among the LEEDS PLAYERS.
     JIMMY GORDON appears, CLOUGH's two SONS in tow..

                          JIMMY
             I've got what you were looking for.

     JIMMY holds up a large parcel wrapped in brown paper.
     CLOUGH's expression changes.

              What about the petrol?

                           JIMMY
              In the boot of the car.

                            CLOUGH
              Good lad.


29   INT. CORRIDOR - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                      29

     CLOUGH limps down a corridor. In a thunderous mood. Holding
     the parcel. PEOPLE scatter.


30   INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)              30

     The door flies open. CLOUGH storms into his office. He walks
     over to the desk. DON REVIE's desk.
     He unwraps the parcel, and takes out an axe.

                            CLOUGH
              Stand back.

     CLOUGH's SONS watch as their father violently swings the axe
     down onto the desk. The sickening sound of splintering wood.


31   EXT. ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                                 31

     CLOUGH watches the desk burn in a small bonfire outside.
     MANNY CUSSINS and several DIRECTORS walk out.
     They are surprised to see CLOUGH by the fire holding an
     axe...

                           CUSSINS
              Everything all right?

                           CLOUGH
                     (sunny, waving with the
                      axe)
              Fine thank you, Mr. Cussins.

     CLOUGH smiles politely, then turns, and walks to his car. The
     DIRECTORS watch..

                                                           CUT TO:

     "Rrrriiinnnggg", the phone rings. CLOUGH and his FAMILY are
     having Sunday lunch. BARBARA CLOUGH looks up..

                         BARBARA
            Not now, love - please?

     "Rrrrriinnngggg". The phone rings. CLOUGH tries to ignore it.

                         CLOUGH
            But it might be Pete.

                         BARBARA
                   (rolls eyes)
            Of course it's Pete.

     "Rrrriiinnngggg", CLOUGH tries to eat, then..

                         CLOUGH
            But it might be important.
                   (to NIGEL)
            C'mon, eat your carrots. For your
            Mother.

     CLOUGH gets up. Walks out of the room..


33   INT. TAYLOR HOUSE - HALL - DAY - (1968)                      33

     PETER TAYLOR, similarly in disgrace with his family,
     similarly unable to go a single Sunday lunch without calling
     CLOUGH, whispers down the phone, terrified of his wife..

                         TAYLOR
            You asked me to find a player with a
            good head. Experience.
                   (whispering, furtive)
            I've found one! He's perfect. Dave
            Mackay.

                         CLOUGH
            Dave Mackay?!? He's a hundred and
            fucking fifty.

                         TAYLOR
            I admit he's not young.

                         CLOUGH
            Not young? He's old as fucking time!

                         TAYLOR
            But he's clever, keeps the ball well.
            And passes it better than anyone
            alive.

                           LILIAN (O.S.)
              Pete...! That's enough! Come back!

                           TAYLOR
                     (looks left and right)
              He's the one, Brian.

                           CLOUGH
              You sure?

                           TAYLOR
              Never been more sure of anything in my
              life.

                           CLOUGH
              All right, I'll talk to Longson in the
              morning.
                           TAYLOR
              We haven't got until morning. Hearts
              have already made him an offer. Want
              him as their manager. Apparently
              they've already agreed terms.

                           CLOUGH
              Well, what did you fucking call me for
              then?

                           TAYLOR
              Because when I asked Bill Nick how
              done the deal was - he said ninety-
              nine per cent.
     CLOUGH's face.

                           CLOUGH
              Meaning he hasn't signed.

                           TAYLOR
              Exactly.

              All right, Brian. Enough. Come back

37   EXT. ROADSIDE CAFE - DAY - (1968)                               37

     CLOUGH and TAYLOR emerge from a roadside cafe and walk
     towards their car. They've missed Sunday lunch. So it's
     Crisps. Sweets. Fizzy drinks. Almost childlike. Happier in
     one another's company than with their own families.

                            CLOUGH
               Where would we play him?

                            TAYLOR
               In the middle of the park. Somewhere
               he can see everything, use his loaf,
               and tell the kids what to do.

                            CLOUGH
               We'll play him as a sweeper, then.

                            TAYLOR
                      (eating crisps)
               Aye.

     They climb into the waiting car...

                            CLOUGH
               Won't have to run about too much. And
               what's all this I hear about a tie
               shop?

                            TAYLOR
               He's got a tie shop, hasn't he? In
               London. Which he spends two days a
               week at.

     CLOUGH starts the engine...

                            CLOUGH
               Fucking tie shop?

             No one's going to be wearing fucking
             ties in twenty years time.

     CLOUGH and TAYLOR both giggle. Like kids. The car pulls
     off...

                          CLOUGH (cont'd)
             Hope his footballing brain is better
             than his business brain.


38   EXT. MACKAY'S HOUSE - NORTH LONDON - DAY - (1968)                 38

     CLOUGH's car pulls up outside a house in a quiet terraced
     road in North London. TAYLOR checks it against the address on
     a piece of paper. The two men get out of the car...

                          CLOUGH
             You know it's illegal. To sign someone
             on the sabbath.

                             TAYLOR
             Is it?
                    (immediately cautious)
             Then perhaps we should just shake on
             it today? And sign tomorrow?

                          CLOUGH
             What? And let Hearts in again in the
             morning? Fuck off.
                    (producing contracts)
             I'm not leaving here without a
             signature.
     CLOUGH and TAYLOR walk up the garden path..

                          CLOUGH (cont'd)
             You'd bloody DO that, too - wouldn't
             you? Come all this way, then just
             "shake hands"?
                    (shaking head)
             Dear oh dear. What would you DO
             without me?

                          TAYLOR
             Hey, you would never have FOUND him if
             it weren't for me.

     CLOUGH stops, rings the doorbell. Looks at TAYLOR.

                          CLOUGH
             Good job we're both wearing ties.

     `Snap', the door opens to reveal DAVE MACKAY, a thick set,
     dark-haired bull of a man, with a thick Scots accent. CLOUGH

              My name's Brian Clough, and I once had
              the pleasure of playing for England
              against you in an Under-23 match.

                           MACKAY
              I remember you now. You had a black
              eye, a right bloody shiner.
                     (a beat)

              What are you doing here?

              Land, Dave. Land of Milk and Honey.

                           UNCLE SAM
              I'm not. What were you thinking? Going
              over my head like that? Why didn't you
              call?

                           CLOUGH
              Because you'd have said `no'.

              Bloody right I'd have said `no'. The
              man's bloody crocked.

                           CLOUGH
              Pete reckons he's good for three more
              years.

                           UNCLE SAM
              Is he fuck. He's broken more bones
              than Evel Knievel.

                           CLOUGH
              Trust me, Mr. Chairman. It's money
              well spent.

     LONGSON turns and double-takes....

                           UNCLE SAM
              And who the FUCK are they?
                           CLOUGH
              That'd be Messrs. McGovern and O'Hare.

              My old stomping grounds. Hartlepools
              and Sunderland. Very reasonable, too.

     CLOUGH smiles..

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              Just doing what's best for the club.

              You're a genius, Pete. Bloody genius.

     On the training ground: DAVE MACKAY, barrel-chested and
     older, voice like a bullhorn, is already bossing about the
     young players, urging them to "think"..

                           TAYLOR
              Dunno. It was just obvious. McGovern
              in midfield, Mackay at the back,
              O'Hare up front. The skewer isn't it?
              In the shish kebab.

     CLOUGH watches MACKAY passing the ball, creating space..

                           CLOUGH
              It's beautiful. A thing of fucking
              beauty!!

     SAM LONGSON, BRIAN CLOUGH, PETER TAYLOR and DAVE MACKAY are
     all celebrating with all their families.

     The trophy is centre-stage. CLOUGH sings a Sinatra classic..

                           CLOUGH
              "Love and marriage, love and marriage,
              it's an institute you can't
              disparage.."

     To everyone's amusement: CLOUGH sings to PETER TAYLOR, not
     his own wife..

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              "Try, try, try to separate them, it's
              an illusion. Try, try, try and you
              will only come to this conclusion.."

     In another corner: MACKAY is amiably ribbing LONGSON..
                           MACKAY
              ..."the man's crocked", "older than
              time" "broken more bones than Evel
              Knievel?"

                           LONGSON
              All right, I admit it, I was wrong.

     LONGSON starts eating his trademark felt hat. Much cheering
     as he munches in disgust and swallows with difficulty.

     Suddenly, DAVE MACKAY looks up, sees the television. Calls
     for quiet!!

     ON TV: a live awards presentation. From London. DON REVIE is
     being presented with an award...

                           REVIE
              ..for Leeds to win the First Division
              title, and for me to be named as
              English Manager of the year...feels
              like a dream come true...

     CLOUGH watches. His expression changes. His eyes burn into
     REVIE's.

                           CLOUGH
              You enjoy it, Don. Go home, put your
              feet up and fucking enjoy it. There's
              a good lad. Because we'll be in the
              First Division next season. And we're
              going to have you!

     Loud CHEERS from LONGSON, TAYLOR, MACKAY and CLOUGH. OVER
     THIS: we fade in the sound of roaring...

            You'd expect nothing less having been
            their manager for 13 years. But the
            fact is I'm here today as manager of
            England...

                         CLOUGH
            Right, the team for today is: Harvey
            in goal, Reaney, Cherry, Bremner,
            McQueen, Hunter, Lorimer, Clarke,

            see how things have changed. Without
            Don. What might be different under me.
            Let's show them some of the things

                            CLOUGH (cont'd)
               You know, son, I've nothing but the
               highest regard for you as a player.

      They PLAYERS get the instruction to walk out, towards the
      roar of the crowd...

                            CLOUGH (cont'd)
               In fact, I wrote you a card saying as
               much. Did you not get it? From
               Majorca?

      The roar of the CROWD grows louder...
                            CLOUGH (cont'd)
               Saying how excited I was to be taking
               this job. How much I thought we could
               achieve together. And inviting you and
               your family down to our place in Calla
               Major any time you like?

                            BREMNER
               Never got it.

      They walk out into the ROAR of the crowd....

      DON REVIE sits in the stadium watching as:

      CLOUGH leads his Leeds PLAYERS out. 67,000 FANS screaming and
      shouting.

      A stony-faced BREMNER behind him.

      CLOUGH's face in close-up. Singing the National Anthem.

      He sees REVIE in the crowd.

      CLOUGH's eyes.

      REVIE's eyes.

      All around them, (ARCHIVE FOOTAGE) 67,000 belting out "God
      Save The Queen". But there might as well not be.

     The game is underway. The T.V. match COMMENTATORS can hardly
     believe what they are seeing, (we catch snippets of
     FLICKERING ARCHIVE FOOTAGE on their monitors)...

     The Leeds coach had pulled up and the players are all having
     a piss-break. Among them CLOUGH..

                         CLOUGH
                   (over his shoulder)
            Because losing wasn't enough, was it?
            You only had to be the first
            Englishman to be sent off at Wembley.

     Our CAMERA widens to reveal BILLY BREMNER pissing in line
     with NORMAN HUNTER and JOHNNY GILES..

                         BREMNER
                   (through gritted teeth)
            Not fucking English.

                         CLOUGH
            There I am making a big song and dance
            to the media about our new approach.
            Our new attitude. Our new ethics. And
            you turn the place into fucking
            Verdun. My CAPTAIN.

     Silence. CLOUGH shakes himself dry.

                         CLOUGH (cont'd)
            What am I going to do if they suspend
            you? You're my best player. I tell
            you, I've a mind to fine you two weeks
            wages!

                         BREMNER
            You can't do that! Mr. Revie always
            paid all our fines.

                         CLOUGH
            Well he's not fucking here now, is he?

                         BREMNER
            No, he's not.

     BREMNER, GILES AND HUNTER turn. Walks back towards the bus.

                         BREMNER (cont'd)
            More's the fucking pity.

     Some PLAYERS getting dressed. CLOUGH, TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON
     massaging others. Shin-pads. Water-bottles.

                         CLOUGH
            Right, last time there was a whole
            division between you and Leeds. Not
            now. Not today. Today we're here as
            Second Division champions, and equals
            with Leeds. John McGovern and Billy
            Bremner, EQUALS. Kevin Hector and
            Johnny Giles, EQUALS. Alan Hinton and
            Peter Lorimer, John O'Hare and Paul
            Madely. EQUALS. Now, c'mon, chins up.

     CLOUGH and TAYLOR in a deserted bar. Alone. A television
     plays in the corner. DON REVIE's face on TV...

                         DON REVIE (ON TV)
            ...obviously it's a terrific
            achievement for Derby, being promoted
            to the First Division, but the truth
            is Leeds United have an unfortunate
            habit of reminding them just how far
            they still have to go..

                         TAYLOR
            Arrogant twat..

                         CLOUGH
            But he's right. Five nothing. They
            made us look like fools today. And
            what was John O'Hare doing? Letting
            Madeley bully him like that.

              Push him around. Madeley's half his
              bloody size. O'Hare needs to toughen
              up. He's from Scottish dockyards,
              isn't he? And what about John
              McGovern? He was useless in the
              middle. Who's idea was that?

                            TAYLOR
              Yours.

                           CLOUGH
              He was all over the place. Like the
              Wandering Jew. Giving the ball to
              anyone BUT his own. We need a ball
              player, a natural in midfield. Who'll
              hold onto it. Keep possession. We're
              giving it away too easily.

                           TAYLOR
              Someone like Colin Todd.
                           CLOUGH
                     (sharp intake)
              Oooh, now you're talking. Lovely pair
              of feet.

                           TAYLOR
              I've heard he wants out of Sunderland,
              too. They're all jumping ship up
              there.

     CLOUGH thinks for a moment, then...

                           CLOUGH
              Well, go on then. Sign him.
                           TAYLOR
              What? We can't. Longson's already told
              us. Club's in debt.

                           CLOUGH
              Bollocks to that. I've not brought us
              all the way to the First Division just
              to sit there mid-table, and be cannon
              fodder for sides like Leeds. Sign the
              man.

                           TAYLOR
              Hang on, hang on, careful...

                           CLOUGH
              I'll handle bloody Longson.

                                                                              36


62   EXT. TRAINING GROUND - DERBY - DAY - (1972)                  62

     CLOUGH is working a session with the Derby PLAYERS. A car
     screeches into the car park behind. A red-faced, apoplectic
     SAM LONGSON gets out..

                         UNCLE SAM
            A hundred and seventy grand?!? For
            Colin fucking Todd?!?

                         CLOUGH
            Correction, the ALMIGHTY Colin Todd.
            The best technical footballer in the
            country.

                         UNCLE SAM
            A salary of three hundred quid a week?
            You can't pay a footballer that!!

                         CLOUGH
            That's the way things are going, Uncle
            Sam. Football's all about money now.

                         UNCLE SAM
            I told you never to go over my head
            again.

                         CLOUGH
            Had no choice. Windows opened up. You
            were in the bloody West Indies.

                         UNCLE SAM
            WindowS? You mean there were others?!?

                         CLOUGH
            Messrs. Gemmell and Hennessy.

     Two PLAYERS turn and wave to LONGSON..

                         CLOUGH
            Let me ask you a question, Uncle Sam.
            What did you come into football for?

                         UNCLE SAM
            To support the football club in MY
            HOME TOWN. The club I've supported ALL
            MY LIFE.

                           CLOUGH
              Well, I'm sure we all admire your
              loyalty...

                           UNCLE SAM
              What I DIDN'T come into it for was to
              be lectured by a cocky little twat
              from the North East.

                           CLOUGH
              But the way I see it, there's no point
              being in this game unless you want to
              beat the best, and be the best, and
              that's all the people of Derby want.
              To see their team on top of the tree,
              Derby, Derby Uber Alles, and if it's
              really their interest you have at
              heart, not just impressing your
              friends in the Director's box, I
              suggest you keep your eyes on your
              road haulage business, keep your
              opinions to yourself and start signing
              some fucking cheques, there's a good
              lad. Leave the running of this
              football club to the professionals.

                           UNCLE SAM
              But professionals DON'T run the club,
              Brian, the Chairman does. And if it's
              true, that football is all about
              money, and that's the way it's going,
              that's suits us Chairmen just fucking
              fine..because we're the ones who've
              got it.
     SAM LONGSON lights a cigar, and walks off.

     The Leeds coach pulls into the Derby car park. Doors open.
     DON REVIE and SYD OWEN disembark.

     Followed by the Leeds PLAYERS. Smoking. Side-burns. Long-
     haired assassins one and all.

              See they've driven all the way into
              the car park this time.

     CLOUGH and TAYLOR look at one another, "Nutter".


65   INT. DRESSING-ROOM - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1972)           65

     An atmosphere of expectation and excitement.

     Outside, the sound of the crowd. The sound of tannoy
     announcements. CLOUGH goes to JOHN MCGOVERN..

                           CLOUGH
              You know what your job is today?

              Good lad. And enjoy it. You deserve
              to. You've worked hard this week.

     CLOUGH moves to JOHN O'HARE.

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              Clear about what you're doing today?

                           O'HARE
              Be big. Be strong. Any chance I get,
              flatten Paul fucking Madely.

                           CLOUGH
              Good lad. He bullies you, you bully
              him back. And near post for the
              corners we worked on.

                           O'HARE
              Yes, Boss.

     CLOUGH moves to another PLAYER. (his new signing, COLIN TODD)

                           CLOUGH
              Understand what I want from you today,
              son?

                           TODD
                     (smiles)
              I should, Mr. Clough. It's simple
              enough.

              Go on, let's hear it.

                           TODD
              "To be Colin fucking Todd, the best
              technical footballer in the country."

     Laughter in the dressing-room.

                           CLOUGH
              There, how could you forget that? Now
              come on..
                     (clapping hands)
              Up and at `em!

     CLOUGH holds the door open, shaking each and every one of the
     PLAYERS' hands as they clatter out into the tunnel..


66   EXT. TOUCHLINE - DAY - (1972)                                 66
     CLOUGH sits in his dug-out. While JIMMY GORDON and TAYLOR are
     calling out instructions to the Derby players on the pitch...

     CLOUGH stares at REVIE and his lieutenants in their
     neighbouring dug-out.

     Presently...CLOUGH's view, and our frame is filled by two
     wheel-chairs carrying disabled/learning difficulties FANS
     wearing rosettes...

     The wheel-chair FAN looks at CLOUGH for a beat, then
     violently shakes a rattle...

                           WHEEL-CHAIR FAN
              COME ON LEEDS!!!!!

     CLOUGH's face: shocked. Then, all of a sudden....

     "RRRRROOOOOOOAAAAAARRRRRR", a roar goes up. Goal Leeds. REVIE
     and his henchmen leap to their feet, delighted. Applauding.

     The WHEEL-CHAIR FAN screams with delight. Makes a `wanker'
     gesture in CLOUGH's face.

     CLOUGH's face: darkening like thunder.


67   INT. DRESSING-ROOM - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1972)           67

     CAPTION: "HALF-TIME: DERBY 0, LEEDS 1"

     The DERBY PLAYERS sit in the dressing-room. Shaking.
     Terrified. Trying to hide, find shelter, find protection.

                                                          (CO NTINU ED)

     Already fearing the rocket they will get, the lash of his
     tongue..

     Presently, the door opens, and CLOUGH walks in, carrying a
     bottle of brandy, Remy Martin.

                           CLOUGH
              Congratulations, lads! Beautiful! That
              was as perfect a half of terrible
              football as I've ever seen. The plan
              you've obviously been hatching to get
              me the sack has worked a treat, so you
              deserve a little celebration...

     CLOUGH pours brandy into a tea-cup, gives it to a PLAYER..

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              You do want me to get the sack?

                          MCGOVERN
              No, Boss.

                           CLOUGH
              Then why the fuck did you give it to
              their most dangerous player, Johnny
              fucking Giles?

                           MCGOVERN
              I didn't see him.

     CLOUGH turns to another PLAYER, (JOHN O'HARE), pours him a
     shot of cognac...

                           CLOUGH
              You want me to get the sack, Mr
              O'Hare?

                          O'HARE
              No, Boss.

                           CLOUGH
              That open goal? Looked like a
              deliberate fucking miss to me. A miss
              to get your manager the sack.

     CLOUGH turns to a third PLAYER, (COLIN TODD), hands him a
     cup..

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              You do want me to get the sack, Mr.

             No what?

                             TODD
             No, Boss.

                          CLOUGH
             The amount of bloody money I paid for
             you, I must have been out of my mind.
             You can't even keep on your feet.

                             TODD
             No, Boss.

     CLOUGH turns, and faces the room.

                          CLOUGH
             You've all done a terrific job of
             getting me the sack. So I'm not
             letting you out of here for the second
             half, until you've finished the
             bottle.

     The PLAYERS stare at one another, holding their drinks.

                             CLOUGH (cont'd)
             DRINK!!!

     The PLAYERS nervously down their drinks. CLOUGH exits..


68   INT. TUNNEL OUTSIDE DRESSING-ROOM - DAY - (1972)                  68

     CLOUGH walks out to see PETER TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON waiting
     - who were listening through the door..
                          TAYLOR
             You can't do that!!

     CLOUGH winks...

                          CLOUGH
             Can't I? Just you fucking watch me!!

     CLOUGH storms off. PETER TAYLOR is left alone. Looks pale.
     Momentarily holds his chest...

                          JIMMY
             You all right?

                          TAYLOR
             Yeah....fine.

     TAYLOR indicates JIMMY's cigarettes.

     The Derby PLAYERS run out, belching, watched and encouraged
     by PETER TAYLOR...

     JIMMY GORDON emerges from the dressing-room, holding the
     empty bottle of Scotch...

                         JIMMY
                   (to TAYLOR)
            Where's he gone now?


70   INT. MANGER'S OFFICE - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1972)        70

     CLOUGH pacing in his office. Unable to watch. Like an
     expectant father.

     Presently the building reverberates with a large...
     RRRROOOAAAARRRRRRRRR.

     A goal. But scored by whom? Derby or Leeds?

     CLOUGH looks up at the clock. The clock on the wall shows
     it's 4.20.

     Visibly anxious, CLOUGH starts pacing again. Presently,
     another deafening...

     RRRRROOOOOAAAAARRRRRRR

     The building is almost brought to it's foundations..

     CLOUGH looks up. Desperate to know. Derby or Leeds?
     But it's only 4.35. Game still not over. Not by a long way.

     CLOUGH carries on pacing. Walks from one side of the room to
     the next. Left to right. Right to left.

     Then, another stadium-shaking..

     RRRRRROOOOOOAAAAAARRRRRR

     CLOUGH looks up at the clock. 4.55.

     This is intolerable. The game must be over now.

     CLOUGH cannot bear it a moment longer. He opens the door.

                                                                            43


71   INT. CORRIDORS - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1972)            71

     CLOUGH walks down a corridor. Then runs. Then checks himself.
     Slows down. Dignity. Dignity. But still walks as fast as he
     can.

     CLOUGH turns a corner to the dressing-rooms and the tunnel,
     then sees PETER TAYLOR up ahead entering the tunnel from the
     pitch with several Derby PLAYERS..

     CLOUGH stops. TAYLOR looks up. Sees CLOUGH. Their eyes meet.
     CLOUGH's eyes. TAYLOR's eyes.

     Words are not necessary. TAYLOR's smile says it all. CLOUGH
     runs towards TAYLOR. The two men embrace.

                          CLOUGH
            And..?

                          TAYLOR
            2-1!!!

                          CLOUGH
            Who scored?

                         TAYLOR
            O'Hare. A brace. Oh, Brian, you should
            have seen his first. Turns Bremner
            inside out, nutmegs Madeley for good
            measure. It was beautiful. You'd think
            he'd been born in Rio de Janeiro, not
            Aber-bloody-deen..

     CLOUGH and TAYLOR walk off down the corridor.
                         TAYLOR (cont'd)
            What made you go for the Brandy?

                         CLOUGH
            They were just nervous. Shitting
            themselves. You could tell.

                         TAYLOR
            You're a bloody genius. I tell you
            what, Bri - if we can beat this lot,
            we can go all the way.

                                                                               44

                          CLOUGH
             Derby County winning the championship
             is a victory for decency, for honesty
             and for football. Because they don't
             pull shirts, or nudge people in the
             back in the box.

            I haven't personally heard Mr.
            Clough's comments, but they have been
            reported to me, and our solicitors are
            looking into them. If I could offer
            Mr. Clough some advice ...I think he'd
            be better off keeping his opinions to
            himself...some of these allegations
            against Leeds United and his fellow
            professionals are an absolute
            disgrace...

            happen not to like him. And I don't                            
            like the way he goes about football                            
            either. Football is a game of opinion                          
            and there are perhaps people in your

              You've achieved something here that                          
              most managers struggle for years to

              young. Are you surprised?

            what I want to achieve, I know what

     MICHAEL PARKINSON, the highest rating talk show on TV..

                         CLOUGH (cont'd)                                   
            You ever see eighty five or perhaps                            
            ninety percent of chairmen talking -                           
            I'd love a few chairmen on your                                
            programme occasionally - I believe the                         
            very sight of them brings the game                             
            into disrepute (some clap in the                               
            audience). And every time they open                            
            their mouths it kills it. Because the                          
            very thing they've given me a lot of                           
            stick about over the years - about                             
            talking too much and going on                                  
            television too much, there are the                             
            very people who can put two words                              
            together and its rather embarrassing                           
            to me that a man - or men - can stop                           
            me talking to people like you. I love                          
            football. It's deep, it goes right                             
            down through. It's in every nerve,                             
            vein, you name it. It consumes me. And                         
            when I have to come and talk about I                           
            like the passions of football to come                          
            out. Because there are not enough in                           
            the game.

              example. We have therefore decided to
              impose a fine of five hundred pounds..

     CLOUGH's face: a victorious look.

                            CLOUGH
              Thank you..
                           COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN
              ...and a suspension until September
              30th...

     "Bang", he brings down a gavel. CLOUGH's face: the smile
     fades..

                           CLOUGH
                     (disbelieving laugh)
              What? September 30th? That's more than
              a month? Thats six bloody weeks??

                           COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN
              I'll make it seven if you carry on
              with language like that..

                           CLOUGH
              C'mon, double the fine. Treble it.
              Anything. Don't suspend him for that
              long. He's my Captain. The best player
              I've got.

     The COMMITTEE MEMBERS get to their feet and walk out.

            Hello?

     CLOUGH in his cheap hotel-room. PETER TAYLOR's voice the

86   INT. TAYLOR'S HOUSE - SAME TIME - (1974)                      86

     TAYLOR freezes, hearing the voice, (we intercut as necessary
     for the remainder of the call)..

                           TAYLOR
              God...what time is it?

                           CLOUGH
              Suspended for eleven bloody games!!

                           TAYLOR
              I know. You're buggered. Billy
              Bremner's the heart and soul of that
              team.
                           CLOUGH
              Plus Mike Jones and Eddie Gray are
              injured.

                           TAYLOR
              Like I said. You're buggered.

                           CLOUGH
              What do I do, Pete? I need new
              players. Tell me who to buy.

                           TAYLOR
              No, Brian.

                           CLOUGH
              Help me. C'mon, we'll sort this place
              out together. You and me. Turn it
              around.

                           TAYLOR
              It's too late. I'd have helped you
              once. But not now. Not after what was
              said. We're on our own now. Each man
              for himself. Remember?

     "MR. D. MACKAY - MANAGER".

     CLOUGH stares at the sign as he parks his car in the space
     beside it. A stab in his heart.


88   INT. BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1974)                          88

     CLOUGH walks along a corridor. Sees the PLAYERS training
     outside. HIS players. DERBY players.

     To one side, MCGOVERN and O'HARE. CLOUGH looks out at them.
     He winks, discreetly at them. They look back, and nod.

     Then get back to work.
     The sound of laughter. The camaraderie of a family. What a
     contrast to Leeds.

     CLOUGH walks along a corridor with photos on the wall. Framed
     photos of HIS victories.

     HIS club. HIS family. HIS home.


89   INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1974)       89

     CLOUGH walks into the office to see DAVE MACKAY behind his
     desk. Who gets to his feet. Extends his hand.

                         MACKAY
            Well, look who it is! Come to raid my
            larder? Or just missing the place?

                         CLOUGH
            McGovern and O'Hare. I've spoken to
            them on the phone. They want to come
            and play for me.

              Aye, and you can have `em. A hundred
              and fifty thousand pound for the pair.

                           CLOUGH
              Cheeky sod! They're not worth a penny
              more than seventy.

                           MACKAY
              But you're desperate now, aren't you?
              Having lost to Stoke and Birmingham..
                     (a beat)
              All, right, since it's you..I'll knock
              ten grand off.

                           CLOUGH
              Give you a hundred grand.

                           MACKAY
              One thirty. Final offer.
     CLOUGH is about to explode, then..

                           CLOUGH
              All right. Done.

     The two MEN shake hands. Barely.

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              So? Enjoying yourself?

                           MACKAY
              Two wins from two. What's not to
              enjoy? You?
                           CLOUGH
              Loving it. Different class, Leeds.
              Proper club. BIG club.

                           MACKAY
              Demand results there, though, Brian.

                           CLOUGH
              Hey, it's `Boss' to you.

                           MACKAY
              Not any more.

                           CLOUGH
              I bought you when you were crocked,
              you fat bastard. And gave you the two
              best years of your career. It will
              always be `Boss' to you.

                            CLOUGH (cont'd)
               Ever tempted to burn that bloody desk?
               Chop it up and burn it?

                            MACKAY
               Why would I do that?

                            CLOUGH
               Exorcise the bloody place. Get rid of
               me.

                            MACKAY
               Why? You're not here anymore, are you?
               Be a waste of a perfectly good desk.

               Yes. This is he.

               and your skates on because you're
               coming to meet me at the Victoria

               And Duncan?
                            MACKENZIE (O.S.)
               Yes, Mr. Clough.

              And you, Mr. Mackenzie, you scored
              twenty-eight goals last season. You'll
              score me twenty-nine goals this.

              Yes, Mr. Clough.

                           CLOUGH
              Do you know how many goals I scored
              before I got injured?

              I'm sorry, Mr. Clough. I don't.

                           CLOUGH
              Two hundred and fifty-one.

     MCGOVERN and O'HARE privately exchange looks, "Here goes".

             team. Clean it up and clear it out
             once and for all.
                          MACKENZIE
             Yes, Mr. Clough.

     CLOUGH indicates MACKENZIE's drink..

                          CLOUGH
             Now c'mon, drink up. We're off to meet
             the press.

                          MACKENZIE
             Yes, Mr. Clough.

     MACKENZIE knocks back his champagne..

                          CLOUGH
             And Duncan..?

                          MACKENZIE
             Yes, Mr. Clough?

                          CLOUGH
             It's "Boss" from now on. There's a
             good lad.

                          MACKENZIE
             Yes, Mr. Clough.

     CLOUGH sighs and goes. MCGOVERN and O'HARE roll their eyes.
     MACKENZIE stubs his cigarette, and hurries after them..


96   EXT. ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                                   96

     "Flash", photographs are being taken by PRESS of the three
     new signings, DUNCAN MCKENZIE, JOHN O'HARE and JOHN MCGOVERN,
     all wearing Leeds shirts.

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL: they are being watched from a distance
     by several Leeds SENIOR players..

97   INT. ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                                   97

     CLOUGH walks through a corridor, brushing past JOHNNY GILES,
     BILLY BREMNER and several other SENIOR PLAYERS. An
     intimidating atmosphere..

                          BREMNER
             What the hell did you buy them for?
             Waste of bloody money.

                          CLOUGH
             Duncan Mackenzie scored twenty-eight
             goals last season. John O'Hare and
             John McGovern are both internationals.
                          GILES
             We've got two strikers, Alan Clarke
             and Mick Jones, they're
             internationals, too.

                          CLOUGH
             And one's injured and the other's
             fucking suspended.

                          BREMNER
             Maybe if you spent a little more time
             here on the training ground with us,
             you wouldn't need to buy Derby
             "rejects".
                    (a beat)
             We've a game Saturday. Against Queens
             Park Rangers. Or had you forgotten?

                           CLOUGH
              I haven't forgotten.

                           GILES
              Well, you haven't told us a single
              thing about how QPR will play. Mr
              Revie would have files and dossiers
              prepared. Had the reserves playing the
              Rangers way all week. Had the first
              team looking out for this and that.

                           CLOUGH
              Bollocks to Mr. Revie! You're
              professional footballers. Stop Stan
              Bowles! That's all you need to know
              about QPR. And I don't have to justify
              myself to you. Not how or when I
              conduct training. Not who I buy or
              pick to play.
                           GILES
              No. Not to us. But come Saturday
              afternoon, there'll be 40,000 people
              here who you DO have to justify
              yourself, to.

     GILES, BREMNER et al walk off. CLOUGH left, staring.

     OVER THIS: a large RRRRROOOAAARRRR. GOAL.


98   INT. LEEDS DRESSING-ROOM - DAY - (1974)                       98

     The LEEDS PLAYERS trudge in, after the game. Angry. Heads
     hung low. Begin to strip off.
     CAPTION: "QPR 1, Leeds 0."

     CLOUGH enters. Visibly gutted by the result, but now's not
     the time to show it..

                             CLOUGH
              Sorry, lads.

     CLOUGH walks round the dressing-room, shaking hands
     individually, patting PLAYERS on the back...

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              You were robbed out there today. Broad
              bloody daylight. That was never a
              penalty.

     CLOUGH's tone is sensitive. Tactful. Considerate.

                             CLOUGH (cont'd)
              Stan Bowles?    Diving like that? Man's
              a disgrace..

     But several of the LEEDS PLAYERS refuse his hand. Or freeze
     at his touch. Turn away from him..

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              I've spoken to the referee already.
              Given him a piece of my mind. And come
              Monday morning, mark my word, I shall
              be taking this further...

     The LEEDS PLAYERS stare at one another. Shoot one another
     looks.

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              Anyway, I want you all to know, I'm
              not in the slightest bit critical of
              your performance today. Not a bit of
              it. You were terrific out there...

      NORMAN HUNTER spits in contempt. GILES turns and walks out,
      into the showers.

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              I couldn't ask for more effort.
              Commitment.
                     (tailing off)
              Passion.

      The LEEDS PLAYERS follow. Finally O'HARE and MCGOVERN, too.

      A deathly silence. CLOUGH is left alone in the dressing-room.

      OVER THIS: the sound of a ringing telephone. A gruff VOICE
      answers..

                              REVIE (V.O.)
              Hello?

98A   INT. CLOUGH'S ROOM - DRAGONARA HOTEL - NIGHT                  98A

      It's the middle of the night. CLOUGH speaks into the phone,
      visibly the worse for wear from alcohol...

                           CLOUGH (V.O.)
              You must be loving this. Loving every
              minute.


98B   INT. REVIE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT - (1974)                 98B

      DON REVIE's face, half-asleep. Visibly irritated. He sits up
      in bed. A stout Yorkshire matron wakes beside him.
                              REVIE
              Who is this?

                           CLOUGH
              Watching it all fall apart. It's Brian
              Clough.

                              REVIE
              What?

                           CLOUGH
              They won't play for me. Your boys.
              Your bastard sons. And never will.

                           REVIE
              Are you drunk, man? It's two in the
              morning. What do you want? Why are you
              ringing me here?

                They're loyal to you. Thought you'd
                like to know that. Loyal to Big Daddy
                Don..

                             REVIE
                For God's sake go to sleep. Where's
                you dignity, man? And don't call here
                again.

      "Click", REVIE hangs up. CLOUGH stares at the receiver.

      The Leeds Coach arrives at Derby. Hydraulic brakes
      hissssssss. Doors open. Boots, shoes, walk down steps.

      DON REVIE, SYD OWEN and the Leeds PLAYERS disembark.

      HARVEY, REANEY, CHERRY, BREMNER, HUNTER, LORMIER, CLARKE,
      JORDAN, GILES, GRAY walk towards the Derby dressing-rooms..


101   INT. BOARDROOM - BASEBALL GROUND - SAME TIME - (1973)         101

      SAM LONGSON stands by the window, looking out into the car
      park. He sees the Leeds United PLAYERS. Reads their mood.

      Their faces. Their focus. Their murderous intent.

      A flicker of concern on SAM LONGSON's face. He thinks, then
      calls out to his SECRETARY..

                            LONGSON
               Get me today's team sheet, will you?

      He lets the curtain fall..


102   INT. CORRIDOR - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1973)                102

      SAM LONGSON walks through corridors of Elland Road, carrying
      the team sheet. Walking towards the dressing-rooms. He turns
      a corner and runs into CLOUGH..

                            CLOUGH
               What's up, Uncle Sam? Bit below stairs
               for you here, isn't it? Taken a wrong
               turn somewhere?

                            LONGSON
               Just seen the team sheet. Hinton,
               O'Hare, Todd, Mackay.
                      (looks left and right)
               That's our strongest side.

                            CLOUGH
               Of course it's our strongest side.
               It's Leeds United. Would you prefer I
               sent out the apprentices?

                            LONGSON
               We're at Juventus mid-week. Semi-final
               of the European Cup. Biggest night in
               the club's history!! Couldn't you just

               A weaker side? Am I hearing right? Is
               the CHAIRMAN of this football club
               seriously asking his manager to LOSE?

               The Chairman of this football club is
               asking his manager to be pragmatic.
               Manage his resources. Prioritise.
               We've embarked on a huge program of
               refurbishment and improvements. New
               stands. Better floodlights. We need a
               good run in Europe to pay for it.

                            CLOUGH
               I'm going to pretend I didn't hear a
               word of this.

      CLOUGH turns to walk away. LONGSON calls after him..

                            LONGSON
                      (checking watch)
               We've still got twenty minutes before
               kick-off. I'd reconsider if I were
               you. I wouldn't want my employer to be
               unhappy..

                              CLOUGH
               My employer?

                            LONGSON
               Chairman of Derby County. And Chairman
               LONG before you ever showed up.

                            CLOUGH
               That's right. You were Chairman of
               Derby County before I came here. I
               remember that. When Derby County were
               at the fucking foot of the Second
               Division, when nobody had heard of
               them for twenty years and nobody had
               heard of Sam bloody Longson ever. Full
               stop. And that's where you'd still
               fucking be if it wasn't for me; at the
               foot of the bloody Second Division,
               where nobody remembered you and nobody
               had heard of you. There would BE no
               Derby County without me, no league
               title, no Champions of England; not
               without Brian Clough.

      A door opens and PETER TAYLOR walks out in time to hear...

                            LONGSON
               I'm going to give you some good
               advice, Brian Clough.

              or how clever, or how many fancy new
              friends you make on the telly, the
              reality of footballing life is this:
              the Chairman is the boss, then come
              the directors, then the secretary,
              then the fans, then the players, and

              bloody manager.

      LONGSON turns and storms off. TAYLOR looks at CLOUGH..

                           TAYLOR
              What have you done now?

      CLOUGH doesn't answer, and storms off in the opposite
      direction. TAYLOR is left alone, visibly anxious.

103   EXT. PITCH - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1973)                103

      CLOUGH watches from the touch-line as the game is in
      progress. "CRASH", a Leeds PLAYER scythes into a Derby
      PLAYER. "BEEEP", the referee blows his whistle. CLOUGH and
      leaps off his bench in fury. Shouting abuse..

                           CLOUGH
              You're a bloody disgrace! You should
              be in the book for that, Cherry!

      "BEEEP", the referee blows his whistle. REVIE smiles to
      himself as a Derby PLAYER is carried off on a stretcher.
                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              You're an animal. A fucking animal,
              Hunter!

      SAM LONGSON watches from the director's box. He closes his
      eyes. PETER TAYLOR witnesses this..

      "CRUNCH", another brutal tackle, another whistle. Another
      Derby PLAYER hobbles off the pitch. Blood streaming from a
      cut to his head..

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              I'll see you in fucking court,
              Lorimer!

      CLOUGH's eyes meet REVIE's eyes along the touchline.

                                                                             60A


104   EXT. PITCH - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1973)                 104

      Afterwards: the LEEDS and DERBY players file off the pitch.
      BREMNER brushes roughly past CLOUGH...

                      (under his breath)
               Good luck in Europe..

      CLOUGH turns, `What?" BREMNER, GILES, HUNTER, LORIMER carries
      on walking down the tunnel. Laughing to themselves..

      CLOUGH is joined by TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON.


105   INT. DERBY DRESSING-ROOM - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1973) 105

      Afterwards: the Derby dressing-room looks like the Emergency
      Room at a hospital..

      Casualties. Blood. Stitches. Swellings. At least half-a-dozen
      PLAYERS are injured. Some on stretchers.

      CLOUGH stares in horror at the wreckage from the doorway. SAM
      LONGSON appears beside him. Stares at CLOUGH..
                            LONGSON
               You fucking idiot.

      LONGSON turns and walks away. CLOUGH turns to survey the
      carnage in the dressing-room. Like a battlefield.

      CLOUGH's eyes meet TAYLOR's.

      The most important night in Derby's history as the Derby
      players arrive in Turin to play against mighty Juventus..

107   INT. CLOUGH HOUSE - NIGHT - (1973)                            107

      BARBARA CLOUGH and the children. Huddled together round the
      television. Eating supper. Watching the Juventus game on TV.

                            BARBARA
               There's Dad, look!

      BARBARA and the KIDS watch intently. But JUVENTUS score one
      goal. Then another. The final whistle. JUVENTUS win 3-1.

                            BARBARA (cont'd)
               Pity.

      BARBARA gets to her feet...

      ON TV: CLOUGH is in the tunnel. Speaking to a television
      REPORTER.

                            CLOUGH (ON TV)
               Disappointed? Not a bit. My players
               were heroic out there tonight.
               Effectively we were playing the
               Italian champions with a reserve team.
               That many of our first team are
               injured...


108   INT. TUNNEL - JUVENTUS - NIGHT                               108

      CLOUGH continues. PETER TAYLOR stands beside him, visibly
      pale, stressed...
                            CLOUGH
               ...it's what happens if you have a
               Chairman who authorizes a multi-
               million pound refurbishment of the
               director's box and hospitality suites
               before he pays for a proper squad.
               Suppose it depends on your priorities.
               Players or prawn sandwiches? I know
               which I'd prefer. I know which honest,
               working class Derby supporters would
               prefer, too..

      A commotion breaks out. TV JOURNALISTS ask questions, sensing
      a great story. CLOUGH continues answering as, beside him,
      (unseen by anyone else)...
      ...TAYLOR is white-faced, holding his chest.

      CLOUGH pouring brandy into a glass. DUNCAN MACKENZIE, JOHN
      O'HARE, and JOHN MCGOVERN sit in front of him. Visibly
      uncomfortable.

                            CLOUGH
               What are they saying?
      This falls to MACKENZIE, who knocks back his drink. Trembling
      hands. Dutch courage.

                            MACKENZIE
               That you're never here.
                      (a beat)
               That they're worried about the future.
                      (a beat)
               That you're just going to fill the
               place with more Derby players.

                            MCGOVERN
               And that all thing's considered they
               were all a lot happier under...

                              MCGOVERN
              Yes, Boss.

                           CLOUGH

              Yes, Boss.

                           O'HARE
              And that they miss the bingo.

                              CLOUGH
              The bingo?
                           MCGOVERN
              And the carpet bowls.

                           CLOUGH
              Carpet bloody bowls?

                           MCGOVERN
              It helps them relax before a game.

      MCGOVERN and O'HARE stare at one another..

              That it, Boss? Can we go now?
      CLOUGH stares, lost in thought: the three PLAYERS go. The
      door closes. CLOUGH is left alone.

      Then he gets up, and in a terrifying flash of rage, picks up
      his glass and throws it against the wall..

      JOHNNY GILES, BILLY BREMNER and NORMAN HUNTER (among others),
      with their GIRLFRIENDS and WIVES and KIDS, being shown brand

      CLOUGH sees BREMNER, GILES and HUNTER trying out the sports
      cars. His smile fades. He walks up to the REP from the CAR
      FIRM..

                            CLOUGH
               Nice to meet you, pet. Now, you can

               you deserve a compliment. Right now
               you don't deserve a complimentary
               bicycle between you.

      CLOUGH takes the KEYS and gives them to the REPRESENTATIVE..

               If I had my way, you'd WALK to the

      BREMNER, glowering GILES, glowering HUNTER, glowering
      GIRLFRIENDS and WIVES.

      his eyes. Breathes a private sigh of relief. Home. At last.

      Safe. Surrounded by people who love him.

               A joke? All right. There's this bloke
               walking about in London, when all of a
               sudden, the city gets hit by a Russian
               `A' bomb. Booooooooom.

      CLOUGH sits down, strokes his son's head..

                            CLOUGH (cont'd)
               And all the buildings have fallen
               down. And all the people are dead. And
               now this bloke is the only man left in
               the whole of London.

      CLOUGH continues stroking his son's hair..

                            CLOUGH (cont'd)
               And he suddenly feels very, very
               lonely because there's no one else to
               talk to. Nobody else but him.
      CLOUGH's SON falls asleep. CLOUGH doesn't notice..

                            CLOUGH (cont'd)
               So he decides that he's had enough,
               that he can't bear being this lonely,
               and so he climbs up to the top of the
               one building still standing. The Post
               Office Tower. And then he jumps off.
               And he's falling down, down and down
               and down, the sixteenth floor, the
               fifteenth floor, the fourteenth, and
               that's when he hears the phone
               ringing...
      CLOUGH looks down. And gets two unexpected shocks.

      The first is that his SON is already asleep. The second is,
      there is a tear running down his own cheek.


115   INT. TUNNEL - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                    115

      The LEEDS PLAYERS clatter off the pitch. Covered in mud.
      Walking in silence. No smiles. Heads hung low..

      CAPTION: "LEEDS 0 - MANCHESTER CITY 2. LEEDS ARE NOW FOURTH
      FROM BOTTOM"

      JIMMY GORDON is waiting for CLOUGH..

                            JIMMY
               The Chairman wants to see you. Said it
               was important. Right away.

      CLOUGH's face: already fearing the worst.

                                                                                68


116   INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BOARDROOM - DAY - (1974)                116

      CLOUGH walks along the corridor. Past the photographs on the
      wall. The trophies in the cabinets. The pictures of a smiling
      DON REVIE - mocking him.

      CLOUGH shoots his cuffs. Rolls his neck. A boxer on his way
      to the ring. A gladiator on his way to the circus.

      He knocks on the door, and walks in. MANNY CUSSINS, SAM
      BOLTON and a third man. A stranger.

                          BOLTON
             About bloody time.

                          CUSSINS
             Where you been? I was about to send
             out a search party.

                          CLOUGH
             Look, Mr. Cussins, I know it's not
             been the best of starts, but in my
             defence, there are a couple of things
             I'd like to say...

                          CUSSINS
             This is Martin Hughes. He runs
             Mercedes here in the North.

                           CLOUGH
                     (double-takes)
             What?

                          CUSSINS
             We hear that's what you like to drive.
             A Mercedes?

                          CLOUGH
             It's..what I used to drive at Derby.
             Yes.

                          CUSSINS
             Well, we can't have Leeds United being
             outdone by Derby County, can we? So
             Martin here is going to take you over
             to his showroom and get you sorted
             out.

      They begin to walk to the door. CUSSINS puts his arm round
      CLOUGH...

                Also we figured if you were sitting in
                a spanking new car yourself, you might
                be a little more bloody lenient with
                your senior players, who've kicked
                off, as you can imagine - being denied
                what's rightfully theirs.

                             BOLTON
                Never come between a footballer and
                his motor!

                            CLOUGH
                No.

                             BOLTON
                Especially not Billy bloody Bremner.

      CLOUGH smiles nervously, visibly relieved...
                             CLOUGH
                Is that it, then?

                             CUSSINS
                Why? You look white as a ghost, man.

      CUSSINS tightens his grip again, arm round CLOUGH.
      Unmistakably intimidating..

                             CUSSINS (cont'd)
                What did you think we'd asked you up
                here for?

      CUSSINS's eyes. CLOUGH's eyes. The air crackling with menace
      and intent.

      CLOUGH visits PETER TAYLOR in a large, crowded ward of old,
      infirm, dying people. It's a shock.

                             CLOUGH
                Heart attack, eh?

                             TAYLOR
                Had it three weeks ago, they reckon.

              I told them the only thing they needed
              to know was that I share my
              professional life with Brian Clough.
              That seemed to satisfy them.

      CLOUGH manages a smile. Moved.

                           TAYLOR (cont'd)
              I'm only half-joking, you know. Have
              we still got jobs?

                           CLOUGH
              We have. Longson's tried to put a
              gagging order on me, of course.
                     (mimics)
              "Any further utterances in public or

                           TAYLOR
              Well, I hope you take notice. And act
              accordingly.

                           CLOUGH
              Would you like to hear my contrite

      CLOUGH pulls out a letter..

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              "Due to the complete breakdown in

              Taylor and I find it is impossible to
              continue our good work for Derby
              County. We therefore wish to tender

               No. Nor do I. Don't worry, they'll
               never let us. We just won them the
               championship. But it will strengthen
               our position and force them to get rid
               of Longson.

                            TAYLOR
               What? Oh, no, Brian. They'll never do
               THAT. He's Chairman.

                            CLOUGH
               I can't do it, Pete. I can't work with
               my hands tied, a Chairman telling me
               what I can or cannot do.

                            TAYLOR
               You're picking the wrong enemy. The
               enemy's not Longson. It's Revie. And
               your obsession with Leeds.
                            CLOUGH
               Don't be daft. We won the league,
               Pete. We're top dogs in Derby now. And
               Longson can't stand it. That's the
               problem.

                            TAYLOR
               No, it's not. It's YOU. This monster
               in you. This mad ambition. It comes
               and goes. Sometimes it's good...a
               fire, that stirs everything up, and
               then there's this...this thing that
               takes you over...and destroys
               everything that is good in your life.

      CLOUGH, voices fall silent. They stiffen..

                          CLOUGH
             What are you doing? You weren't
             supposed to accept our resignations.

             `Shouldn't bloody well offer them,

             I only did because of HIM!
                    (points at LONGSON)
             You can't get rid of us. It'd be a
             disaster for the club. For the whole
             of Derby.

                          LONGSON
             You can't keep shooting your mouth off
             the way you have been...or issuing
             these ultimatums..

      The board stare at one another, avoid eye contact..

             With great reluctance your
             resignations have been accepted.

                          CLOUGH
             You can't do this! It's madness!
                          LONGSON
             The decision stands. And don't even
             think of a settlement. You're getting
             nowt.

                          CLOUGH
             We're going to create a footballing
             dynasty here. Derby could be one of
             the greats alongside United,
             Liverpool, Leeds..

      Newspapers are strewn over the table. CLOUGH sits in the
      corner, being given counsel by SOLICITORS. JIMMY GORDON reads
      out a letter from the DERBY PLAYERS...

                          JIMMY

      Deathly silence. The crowds part. CLOUGH sits up, and
      stares..

                            CLOUGH
               What? Dave MACKAY?

                            TAYLOR
               It's in the evening paper.

                            CLOUGH
               I signed that fat fuck - saved his
               professional life. Gave him two more
               years as a player, as my captain. Dave
               Mackay?
                      (a beat)
               He wouldn't fucking DARE!

      CLOUGH sees the paper. "MACKAY TO BE DERBY MANAGER". CLOUGH's
      face. Devastated.

                            TAYLOR
               Why did you do it? I love this place,
               Brian. I'm happy here. So are you.

                            CLOUGH
               It's not over yet, Pete. The lawyers
               are issuing a writ tomorrow. Against
               Longson. The players are calling a
               meeting. There's talk of them coming
               out on strike. There's protest marches
               scheduled for this week-end.

                            TAYLOR
               Why couldn't you just have kept your
               mouth shut? We'll never find anywhere
               like this again.

      TAYLOR stares. Worried. At that moment, BARBARA sticks her
      head outside.

                            BARBARA
                      (holding phone)
               Mike Bamber on the phone?

                            CLOUGH
               Who's Mike Bamber??

124   EXT. DUGOUT - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                     124

      With a loud ROAR the game against Luton gets under way.

      CLOUGH takes his seat alone in the dugout. Unseen by him, in
      the stands behind him...

      DON REVIE arrives, shaking hands, taking a seat.

      Immediately, as soon as they see REVIE, the LEEDS FANS start
      cheering, "There's only one Don Revie.."

      CLOUGH turns, to see REVIE. Waving back. Acknowledging the
      crowd.

      The LEEDS FANS chant, "There's only one Don Revie!"

      In the directors' box, MANNY CUSSINS notes the reaction of
      the crowd.

      In the press boxes, the JOURNALISTS and TV COMMENTATORS also
      note the reaction of the crowd...

      CLOUGH's face: stinging with humiliation. And as if that
      weren't bad enough...

      "RRROOOOAAARRRRR", Luton score a goal.

      In the director's box: MANNY CUSSINS' face..


125   INT. TUNNEL - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                     125

      Afterwards: CLOUGH and the PLAYERS walk down the tunnel to
      see MANNY CUSSINS and SAM BOLTON waiting. Grim-faced.

                            CUSSINS
               Players Lounge, Brian. Ten minutes.

      CLOUGH opens his mouth, is about to reply, but CUSSINS has
      turned and walked away.


126   INT. PLAYERS' LOUNGE - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)            126

      CLOUGH walks in as several players walk in, too. CLOUGH takes
      a seat. CUSSINS calls for quiet...

                            CUSSINS
               This is the worst start to a season
               Leeds has had in twenty years. Four
               points from five games? Second from
               fucking bottom? What's going on? As
               far as I can I see, there's no
               relationship, no understanding between
               players and management. Not a healthy
               one, anyway.

      PLAYERS heads low. Avoiding CLOUGH's eyes.

                            BREMNER
               Perhaps if Mr. Clough were to step
               outside, we would all feel a little
               more like speaking our minds.

      CLOUGH can't help smiling..

                            CLOUGH
                      (under his breath)
               You bastard.

      Of course, CUSSINS will reprimand him. Refuse his request.
      CUSSINS looks at WOODWARD and BOLTON. Then..

                            CUSSINS
               All right. If you wouldn't mind,
               Brian? Just for a minute or two?

      CLOUGH cannot believe his ears. What?? He gets to his feet.

                              CLOUGH
               As you wish.

      CLOUGH walks out of the room. DUNCAN MACKENZIE watches.
      Visibly shocked.


127   INT. CORRIDOR - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974                    127

      CLOUGH closes the door behind him. He stands in the corridor
      outside. From inside, we hear..

                            BREMNER (O.S.)
               No one likes him. The atmosphere in
               the dressing-room is non-existent.
               We're not allowed to mention Mr.
               Revie's name...

                            GILES (O.S.)
               He's banned us from doing all the
               things we used to do...like playing
               bingo and carpet bowls...

                            BREMNER (O.S.)
               Tactically, he's never prepared, never
               tells us how he wants us to play...

                            HUNTER (O.S.)
               You know he's just itching to bring in
               a whole lot of new players..

      CLOUGH looks out of the window to see DON REVIE signing
      autographs, shaking hands with adoring LEEDS FANS outside..

                            VOICE
               What's going on?

      CLOUGH turns to see JIMMY GORDON..

                            CLOUGH
               The last two words of every story ever
               written is what's going on. "The
               fucking end."

               What I want to know is why, after all
               the thing he's said about us, did you
               appoint him in the first place?

                            CLOUGH
               I'm about to go home and work out how
               much I want in severance pay. Don't
               worry, I'll make sure your job is
               safe.

                            JIMMY
               I'm not staying here without you. No
               bloody way.

                            CLOUGH
               Then I suggest you go home and do the
               same.

                            BREMNER (O.S.)
               What me and the lads are trying to
               say, Mr. Cussins, is that compared to
               Mr. Revie - he's just not good
               enough...

      CLOUGH: a dagger in his heart..

                           CLOUGH
               Come on.

      CLOUGH turns, leading JIMMY GORDON away, then he stops.
      Having seen something through a window..

      Outside: DON REVIE walks down into the car park and towards
      his car - cheered and clapped every step of the way by LEEDS
      FANS..

      The Messiah of West Yorkshire...

      He and PETER TAYLOR get out on a road overlooking the sea..

      CLOUGH looks around at his surroundings. The OLD PEOPLE. The

              Brighton and Hove Albion? Have you
              seen where they are? Bottom of the
              third division.

                           TAYLOR
              And we can get them out of there. Like
              that. We did it with Hartlepools. We
              did it with Derby.

                           CLOUGH
              We cared about Hartlepools and Derby.
              We're from the North, Pete. What do we
              care about Brighton? Bloody
              Southerners. Look where we are. We're
              almost in France.

                           TAYLOR
              Hey, they've got money, this lot. And
              ambition. And get a lungful of that
              air. It'd be good for my health.

                           CLOUGH
              You can't manage a team that's not
              your own people. Not what you know.
              Anyway the Protest Movement in Derby
              is still in full flow. We could still
              get our jobs back.

                           TAYLOR
              No, we won't. It's over, Brian.
              They'll never take us back. Not now.

                           CLOUGH
              What about proper clubs? Like
              Manchester United? Or Spurs? Or
              England, now Alf's gone. Wouldn't you
              fancy that?

                           TAYLOR
              No one's rung, have they? You've
              scared them all off.

                           CLOUGH
              It's only been a couple of weeks.

               Plus a salary that exceeds by twenty
               percent what Derby were paying you.

               Very generous, Mike. Terrific.

                            CLOUGH
               But those are first division wages.

                            BAMBER
               First division's where I want this
               club to be.
                            CLOUGH
               Are you sure you can afford it?

                            BAMBER
               Are you sure you're worth it?

                             CLOUGH
               Cheeky sod.

      BAMBER offers his hand. CLOUGH stares at it..

                            CLOUGH (cont'd)
               We're going to need a holiday first.
                            BAMBER

                            CLOUGH
               Two weeks. Somewhere hot. On you.

      BAMBER doesn't even flinch. Smiles..

                            BAMBER
               I'll even throw in the bloody trunks.

      CLOUGH and BAMBER shake. TAYLOR beams with delight. OVER

       Until he finds CLOUGH. ARCHER takes out his handkerchief,          
       mops his brow..

                 You're a hard man to find, Mr. Clough.

                              ARCHER
                 My name's Keith Archer. Secretary of                     
                 Leeds United football club.

                 Then what are you doing here, Keith?                     
                 Because from what I'm reading in my                      
                 paper, and from what I hear on the                       
                 jungle drums, you've got a bit of a                      
                 problem at home with your manager                        
                 flirting with the England job.

                 He's not flirting...

       CLOUGH turns, squints in the light...

             But we've given Brighton our word. And
             they've paid us the money.

                          CLOUGH
             We can pay BACK the money. Bollocks to

             chance.

             all.

             He had faith in us, offered us a job
             when no one would.

                          CLOUGH
             He offered us a job. And now someone
             else has offered us a better one..and
             not just anyone. The best team in the
             country. C'mon, Pete, you know what
             that means.. It'd be the Charity
             Shield at Wembley in a months time.
             The European Cup after..

                          TAYLOR
             Yes, but even if we won them it would                        
             always be Revie's achievements. HIS

             But at least we'd be together, you and
             me. We could build them up. Make them
             our own. Like we did with Hartlepools.
             Like we did with Derby.

             And then what? Bottle again as soon as
             it comes to the big time. That's
             always been the trouble with you,
             Pete. No ambition.

                          TAYLOR
             And that's the trouble with you. Too
             much ambition. Too much greed. Too
             much everything.

                          CLOUGH
             You knock it, but it's done you proud
             over the years. My "ambition". Without
             me - you'd still be stuck in Burton

             earth.
                          TAYLOR

             in Derby. A job and a home that I
             love.

             Yes, Brian - you're the shop window,
             I'll grant you that. The razzle and
             the bloody dazzle. But I'm the goods
             at the back. And without me, without                          
             someone to save you from yourself,
             you're not just half..

                            CLOUGH
               Good lad.

               Not just me that feels that way,
               either.

                            CLOUGH
               The sad thing is, it won't work. You
               can't change a manager like a pair of
               socks. It'll happen once, to me - and
               never again.

      CLOUGH shakes CLARKE's hand.

      `Rrrrinng', the phone rings. CLOUGH turns and picks up the
      phone. He listens, then..

      CLOUGH sits in make-up. The door opens and AUSTIN MITCHELL,
      the same presenter as earlier, sticks his head round the
      corner..
                             MITCHELL
                Thanks for agreeing to this.

                No problem.

      CLOUGH is led into the studio, and onto the `Calender' set,
      chatting to the SOUND MAN.

      CLOUGH's microphone is fixed, he is shown to his seat beside
      the PRESENTER's. Then CLOUGH notices a third (empty) seat
      beside his..

                             CLOUGH
                What's this? We expecting guests?

      Then CLOUGH looks up to see a distinctive BLUE BLAZER, with
      gold buttons approaching the set...

      Blue blazer. DON's blazer.

      CLOUGH's face falls as DON REVIE and AUSTIN MITCHELL turn the
      corner, in conspiratorial conversation, and out to the
      seats..

      It's a set-up! CLOUGH looks over at AUSTIN MITCHELL and the
      crew, who shiftily avoids CLOUGH's eyes..

                            CLOUGH (cont'd)
               You bastards!

      REVIE is put in the seat beside CLOUGH. Avoiding CLOUGH's
      eyes. REVIE rolls his neck, crosses his legs. Vast,
      intimidating REVIE. Ready for battle.

      Suddenly, the theme music plays, the FLOOR MANAGER counts
      down..

                            FLOOR MANAGER
               Five, four, three..
      The PRESENTER looks up..

                            MITCHELL
               Good evening. Tonight the football
               world was stunned by the news that
               Brian Clough has been sacked as
               manager of Leeds United. We'll be
               talking not just to Brian Clough, but
               also to the man he replaced, who's
               success he couldn't emulate, Don
               Revie.

      MITCHELL turns to CLOUGH..

                            MITCHELL (cont'd)
               To Brian Clough first of all. What's
               your reaction to being sacked in this
               fashion?

                            CLOUGH
               Obviously, Austin, my initial reaction
               is one of shock at finding myself here
               with Revie...

                            REVIE
               See? Not so easy to make accusations
               when it's to someone's face...

                            CLOUGH
               ...but in answer to your question, six
               weeks is hardly a long time to be
               given a chance in any job. I would
               hope Revie would get a lot longer time
               in his.

                          MITCHELL
             Do you consider it was possible to
             step into your shoes, Don Revie? To
             replace you?

                          REVIE
             Being very, very honest, I think it
             was a difficult job for anyone to do.
             But I do feel Brian Clough, I won't
             call him Clough because I won't take
             him down like that..

                           CLOUGH
             Thank you.

              himself than he need have.

                           CLOUGH
              How did I do that, Don?

                           REVIE
              Shooting his mouth off about how dirty
              my players were.

                           CLOUGH
              Well, you WERE dirty, Don!

                           REVIE
              That's not true. The last four
              seasons, we've topped the charts for
              entertaining football.

                           CLOUGH
              And before that, you also topped ALL
              the disciplinary charts. You should
              have been docked points and sent DOWN
              to the second Division.

                           MITCHELL
              And in fact, you went on record and
              said so, Brian Clough. Again and
              again. That Leeds should, in fact, be
              relegated.

                           CLOUGH
              And I was right.

                           MITCHELL
              Do you think that might have hurt your
              chances of success when you then came
              to manage them?

                           REVIE
              Of course it did! The things he said?
              Why, man? Why did you take the job in
              the first place?

                           CLOUGH
              Because I thought it was the best job
              in the country.

                           REVIE
              Of course it was the best job in the
              country.

             than you.

             There's no way you COULD win it
             better.

             But that's the only hope I've got.

             I only lost four matches..

                          REVIE

             Listening to you, I am struck that
             this is not just a business matter for
             you both. It's more than that. It's
             personal. Am I right?

                          CLOUGH
             Well, we're very different people, Don
             and I. We have different styles. In
             football and in life. I'm a warm man.
             An idealist. I do believe in faeries,
             and that is my outlook. Don is
             different. There's a hardness to him.
             A hardness. Maybe he's not even aware
             of it. But he's a cold person.

                          REVIE
             You don't KNOW me!

              And that lack of warmth. That coldness
              was there. Permeated the club when I
              arrived.

                           REVIE
              I totally refute that. The atmosphere
              at Leeds was like a family. A happy
              family. You ask any of my players. I
              signed most of them personally. Knew
              their backgrounds. Their parents.
              Their streets. I was a father to them.
              In that club every morning. Massaging
              those boys. Did you do that for them?

                           CLOUGH
              They would never have let me.

                           REVIE
              Did you try? You didn't even try. I
              soaped those boys down with my own
              hands. You just went to Leeds with no
              thought for the club, no thought for
              the players. Just on some kind of mad
              personal vendetta with me.

                           CLOUGH
              Well are you surprised? What else was
              I going to do?? After what you did...

              refused to shake my hand.

              beneath you. Looked down on me. And

              Well, you certainly know it NOW.

      All heads turn. That came out unintentionally loud.

                           REVIE
              Oh, we ALL know it now.
                     (a beat)
              We know you as the man who's constant
              outbursts, his defaming of fellow
              professionals, have brought this game,
              this beautiful game into disrepute.
              Who had one of the best jobs in the
              country, at Derby, and managed to get
              the sack. Who had one of the best
              partners in the game, in Peter Taylor,
              and threw him away. Who was given the
              greatest gift in British football
              Leeds United, a team that in ten years
              hasn't finished outside the top four,
              and took them to the bottom of the
              first division. Yes, it's fair to say
              we all know who you are now.

      AUSTIN MITCHELL's eyes widen.

                           MITCHELL
              OK, gentlemen, we're going to have to
              leave it there..

                           CLOUGH
              Well, let's see where we are in a
              year's time, Donald Revie.
                           REVIE
              Dear oh dear..

                           CLOUGH
              Let's see where we both are in five!

                           AUSTIN MITCHELL
              That's it for tonight's show. I'd like
              to thank Brian Clough and Don Revie
              for joining me...

                           REVIE
              Thank you, Austin.

      The show wraps up. Theme music starts playing. REVIE removes
      his microphone, turns and walks out.

      CLOUGH is left staring, hollow-eyed. Wishing the ground would
      swallow him up..

                                                                       94A

       Inside the car: CLOUGH drives, staring at the road ahead.
       Talk on the radio of CLOUGH's dismissal..

                              CLOUGH
                 Boys? Do you think your old man is a
                 fool?
                                SIMON/NIGEL
                 No.

                              CLOUGH
                 You're wrong. He bloody is.

       A silence. CLOUGH continues to drive.

                              CLOUGH (cont'd)
                 Who is the least mature person in this
                 car? Who most needs to bloody grow up?
                 Who's been making a right arse of
                 himself the past few months?

       The BOYS can't help laughing..
                              CLOUGH (cont'd)
                 Who fancies a trip to the seaside? To
                 see Uncle Pete?

                                NIGEL/SIMON

                 Me, and all.

       CLOUGH's foot hits the floor.

                                                                               96

149   EXT. TAYLOR'S HOUSE - BRIGHTON - DAY - (1974)                149

      PETER TAYLOR is working in the garden. He looks up to see
      CLOUGH standing in the gate to his house..

      TAYLOR looks at CLOUGH. Their eyes meet. A poignant moment.

                          TAYLOR
             They've kicked you out, already?

                           CLOUGH
             They have.

                          TAYLOR
             So how long was that?

                          CLOUGH
             Forty-four days.

                           TAYLOR
             Impressive.

      TAYLOR strains not to show his satisfaction..

                          TAYLOR (cont'd)
             So what are you doing here?

                          CLOUGH
             Don't make this difficult for me,
             Pete...you know why I'm here...and I
             won't bloody grovel.

      TAYLOR shrugs, "Please yourself". Turns and starts walking
      inside.

                          CLOUGH (cont'd)
             All right. I'm grovelling. I'm on my
             knees.

      TAYLOR turns. Sees CLOUGH on his knees. Begging for
      forgiveness.

                          TAYLOR
             "I apologize unreservedly for being a
             twat".

               I apologize for being a twat.

                            TAYLOR
               "Unreservedly."

                            CLOUGH
                      (through gritted teeth)
               Unreservedly...

                            TAYLOR
               "Because I can't do it without you."

                            CLOUGH
               Because I can't do it without you.

                            TAYLOR
               "I'm nothing without you."

                            CLOUGH
               I'm nothing without you.

                            TAYLOR
               "Please, please baby, take me back."

                             CLOUGH
               Fuck off..!

      CLOUGH tails off, realizing he has no option..

                            CLOUGH (cont'd)
               "Please, please baby, take me back."

      CLOUGH's sons watch from the car as PETER TAYLOR opens his
      arms, and the two MEN fall into an embrace.
      But in the clench, TAYLOR's smile fades, his expression
      suddenly becoming serious.

      TAYLOR holds CLOUGH tight, and whispers...

                            TAYLOR
               You'll only fuck me up again, won't
               you?

                            CLOUGH
               I love you, y'know.

                            TAYLOR
               I know. But it won't stop you.

      A beat. CLOUGH thinks, then..

             So? Would you sooner go through it all
             without me?

      TAYLOR's face: freeing and condemning himself at once..

                           TAYLOR
             Never.

                                                         Final Draft

                

               INT. FIELD HOSPITAL TENT - DAY

               A black screen.

               The sound of a knife cutting through boot leather.

               Fade in on the waists of two men (THE SURGEONS) hovering 
               around a crude operating table.

               In the extreme background, TWO STRETCHER BEARERS are just 
               leaving.

                                     SURGEON 1 (O.S.)
                         Is this the last one?

               One of the bearers stops and looks back. His face is numb. 
               And he nods hollowly.

               We cannot see the patient stretched out on the table. But we 
               do see that the first surgeon has succeeded in getting the 
               man's boot off.

                                     SURGEON 2 (O.S.)
                         God, what a mess... at least there's 
                         no gangrene.

                                     SURGEON 1 (O.S.)
                         There will be if it doesn't come 
                         off.

                                     SURGEON 2 (O.S.)
                         Well I can't saw if I can't keep my 
                         eyes open.  Let's coffee up... he 
                         can wait a few more minutes.

               As the TWO SURGEONS duck through a tent flap in the background 
               we see a mangled foot, torn by shrapnel, it oozes blood from 
               a cut clear to the bone.

               LIEUTENANT JOHN J. DUNBAR'S eyes are now open. He's a young 
               man, his features sharp and handsome. With effort, he lifts 
               his head and searches the room.

               His eyes come to rest on the form of a legless man lying in 
               bloodsoaked sheets. He's whimpering like a child.

               Dunbar comes to a sitting position on the operating table. 
               As his eyes move around the room they come to rest on a crate 
               filled with the boots of men who have lost their legs.

               A cane travels through space and deftly hooks one of the 
               boots.

               Lieutenant Dunbar brings the boot onto the operating table. 
               He tries to pull it on his mangled foot, but the pain makes 
               him cry out. Deliberately he breaks the cane and sticks a 
               piece of it between his teeth.

               Tears of pain are rolling down his face. A sweat has broken 
               out on his forehead and with great determination he pulls 
               the boot on.

               EXT. FIELD HOSPITAL TENT - DAY

               The two weary surgeons sip on steaming mugs of coffee, their 
               white coats spattered with blood. Their brief respite is 
               interrupted by the sound of a muffled scream.

               Together they turn and rush back into the tent.

               INT. FIELD HOSPITAL TENT - DAY

               The operating table is empty save the broken cane and a small 
               pool of blood. Dunbar is gone.

               LEGEND: ST. DAVID'S FIELD, TENNESSEE - 1862

               EXT. CIVIL WAR HILL - DAY

               In a natural valley below is a peaceful field.  And on either 
               side of the field, seperated by a hundred yards of green, 
               are low rock walls.

               Several dairy cows are lying dead in the field.

               A group of MOUNTED UNION OFFICERS, ride onto the crest of 
               the hill and look down at the field. The distinguished man 
               with a long grey beard is GENERAL TIDE.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE WALL - DAY

               Ragged CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS crouch sullenly behind one of 
               the walls.

               EXT. UNION WALL - DAY

               And just behind the other wall are UNION MEN, better equipped 
               perhaps, but just as weary as their enemies.

               We hold on one man, an enlisted soldier, SERGEANT PEPPER. He 
               chances to glance behind and squints at a strange sight.

               A solitary officer is standing a few feet behind him. The 
               sun is at his back, giving him a ghostly feel. Eerily he 
               takes a step or two forward. He's limping badly.

               The sergeant recognizes him. It's Dunbar.

                                     PEPPER
                         Lieutenant... izat you?

               Dunbar says nothing. He just stands and stares. It unnerves 
               the sergeant.

                                     PEPPER
                         What're you doing here lieutenant?

                                     DUNBAR
                         This is where I belong... this is my 
                         outfit.

               The sergeant stares at Dunbar's foot.

                                     PEPPER
                         You went to hospital?

                                     DUNBAR
                         It was no good... what's going on 
                         here?

               A ping of riflefire flies overhead and the sergeant dives 
               for the wall. He calls over his shoulder.

                                     PEPPER
                         Better come to cover lieutenant... 
                         those boys are shooters.

               Dunbar settles next to the sergeant.

                                     PEPPER
                         What's goin' on here... seems to be 
                         the question alright... you could 
                         ask the major but he don't know. 
                         He's busy tryin' to figger out how 
                         come the officer's mess run outta 
                         peach ice cream...

               The sergeant nods at the distant hill and Dunbar looks too.

                                     PEPPER
                         General's come up to see the show 
                         but all he knows is there ain't no 
                         show...

               Now he nods toward the trees behind them and the lieutenant 
               follows. Several union men are clustered around a huge hunk 
               of material attached to a gondola.

                         We started a balloon up but they 
                         shot her down fore she was ten feet 
                         off the ground... so nobody's made a 
                         run either way. It's been a stand-
                         off all damn day... and now... the 
                         major, he's lookin' at the general 
                         and he's thinkin' I better do 
                         somethin', and you know what that 
                         means...

               More riflefire comes in and some of the union men answer 
               with a few rounds of their own. The sergeant watches the 
               confederate line across the field through a crack in the 
               wall.

               Lieutenant Dunbar is not watching the enemy. He's looking at 
               some horses picketed in the trees behind the union lines. 
               There's a nice bay. There's a big roan.

                                     PEPPER
                         They're 'sposed to be beat up just 
                         like us but everybody knows that 
                         Tucker's men are tough as cobs. I 
                         sure don't wanna die out there with 
                         them cows.

               Dunbar is still watching the horses. He's holding on a small, 
               well-muscled buckskin standing a little apart from the others. 
               CISCO.

               Now he moves away from the wall, heading for the horses.

               The sergeant squeezes off a shot. Squinting across the field, 
               he sees a rifle with a hat on the tip of its bayonet waving 
               at him disrespectfully. The sergeant rolls on his side to 
               reload. He keeps on talking to the lieutenant, but the 
               lieutenant is gone.

                                     PEPPER
                         Some of the boys are sayin' that if 
                         we ain't gonna fight we could just 
                         settle the whole business with a 
                         little high stakes poker. Wouldn't 
                         that be a sight... a bunch of fellas 
                         sittin' in the middle of this field 
                         drawin' cards...

               The sergeant's chatter is interrupted by a sound... the sound 
               of hoofbeats rushing in behind him. Men on either side are 
               scattering, but there's no time for the sergeant. He turns 
               to the sound and cringes against the wall as the buckskinned 
               belly of a horse soars over his head.

               Dunbar and his horse hit the ground with a thud and dig for 
               the confederate line.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINE - DAY

               Some of the confederate riflemen can see the wild rider headed 
               for their lines. A sharpshooter (RAY) calls over his shoulder.

                                     RAY
                         Tucker!

               A man in a slouch hat crowned by a jaunty feather looks up 
               from an impromptu meeting. TUCKER.

               EXT. CIVIL WAR HILL - DAY

               Like the others, General Tide is absorbed with the spectacle 
               of a single horseman riding into the teeth of the enemy. He 
               holds out his hand and an AIDE slips a pocket telescope into 
               his palm. The general sights through his telescope.

                                     AIDE
                         What is it sir?

               Tide lowers the telescope, glances at the aide and peers 
               back down at the field.

                                     TIDE
                         Looks like a suicide.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

               Dunbar can see the confederate riflemen now. They're rising 
               up behind the wall to aim and fire.

               Fifty yards from the enemy line he's still unhit. He wheels 
               the buckskin into a sharp left turn and they streak parallel 
               to the confederate flank. The buckskin is charging hard, his 
               heels throwing out clumps of dirt.

               The firing is tremendous. The lieutenant's hat is torn away. 
               A slug lifts off one of the officer's epaulettes, but still 
               no bullet finds him.

               EXT. UNION WALL - DAY

               The entire union line is standing, strangely quiet in their 
               disbelief.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

               The lieutenant passes the last of the riflemen and pulls the 
               buckskin up at the far end of the field. The little horse is 
               pitching and rearing, ready for another run.

               The lieutenant bows his head in exhaustion, but a sound coming 
               across the field brings his head up quickly. A great cheer 
               is rolling along the union line.

               EXT. HILL - DAY

               General Tide is furiously spurring his horse as he tears 
               down the hill. His aides are trying desperately to keep up.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE WALL - DAY

               There's action along the confederate line. The men Dunbar 
               passed are desperately trying to reload. Those at the end 
               are jeering, taunting the lieutenant to take another pass.

               Tucker is moving along the line. The battle ground has 
               suddenly taken on a festival atmosphere and Tucker doesn't 
               like it.

                                     CONFEDERATE
                         Come on you son of a bitch -- you 
                         won't make it a second time...

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

                                     DUNBAR
                         Alright by me.

               Dunbar gazes down along his leg. Blood is pumping from his 
               wound.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Forgive me Father.

               Again he digs his heels into the buckskin's flanks and they 
               fly down the line. The confederates are trying to reload. A 
               few are able to get off a hasty shot, but they're all too 
               late.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

               Dunbar swerves in a little closer to the wall as he approaches 
               the other half of the confederate ranks. They're standing 
               ready, like a firing squad.

               Tucker has just reached the side of Ray the sharpshooter.

               The lieutenant shuts; his eyes, lets the reins flop on the 
               buckskin's neck and spreads his arms as they thunder toward 
               the line of riflemen.

               Ray's finger squeezes the trigger, his keen eye sights down 
               the barrel of his gun. THUD... a rifle ball buries itself in 
               Ray's forehead.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

               The union trooper who fired the fatal shot gets up from a 
               kneeling position and scrambles after some of his comrades.

               EXT. UNION WALL - DAY

               With his aides coming behind, General Tide leaps his horse 
               over the wall at a dead run.

               The entire Union line pours after him, screaming a thunderous 
               battlecry in unison. Pepper is one of the last to scurry 
               over the wall.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

               The union troops have the rebels in full flight, chasing 
               them into the woods beyond the field.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

               Suddenly the field is quiet. There is rifle fire in the 
               distance but otherwise everything is still. The field is 
               almost empty. The three dead dairy cows are still there. And 
               at one end of the field is a solitary buckskin horse. His 
               rider lies on the ground, a foot hooked in one stirrup.

               The sound of men's voices is coming near. Suddenly, General 
               Tide is peering down at him. Dunbar stares back, glassy eyed.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Don't take off my foot.

               General Tide stares down into Dunbar's blank face. He kneels 
               next to the lieutenant and bends to whisper in his ear.

                                     GENERAL TIDE
                         You rest easy son... you'll keep 
                         you're foot. As God is my judge, 
                         you'll keep it.

               The general looks up at one of his aides.

                                     GENERAL TIDE
                         Bring up my ambulance...

                                     AIDE
                         Sir?

                                     GENERAL TIDE
                         Bring up my ambulance. And bring my 
                         surgeon with it. We've got an officer 
                         who's worth something lying here.

               The aide dashes off to do what he's told, as General Tide 
               gently removes Dunbar's foot from the stirrup and lays it 
               carefully on the ground. The image fades out.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               The image of a boot fades in, pull back to see that a lone 
               rider is coming toward us. He has had a long and dusty trip. 
               It's Lieutenant Dunbar. He's still riding the little buckskin.

               LEGEND - FORT HAYS. KANSAS - 1863

               Dunbar pulls up short. He stares thoughtfully at something 
               in the distance.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         The strangeness of this life cannot 
                         be measured. In trying to produce my 
                         own death, I was elevated to the 
                         status of a living hero.

               Dunbar starts forward and the camera swings around to cover 
               his back. In the distance we can see an isolated and dreary 
               military post.

               The sky is very blue. The sun is bright. A rough-hewn, 
               unfenced fort is straight ahead.

               There are several miscellaneous stone structures, a well-
               stocked stable, barracks, officer's quarters and in the center 
               of it all, a headquarters building.

               Lieutenant Dunbar, riding straight and tall on his powerfully 
               built buckskin, Cisco, passes into view. He's headed for the 
               center of the fort.

               INT. FORT HAYS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

               Silhouetted against the outside, Lieutenant Dunbar pauses in 
               the wide doorway of headquarters. We can hear the distant 
               sounds of work and life coming from the outside but in here 
               it's strangely quiet.

               A SERGEANT sits at a desk in the foyer. Across the way, at 
               another desk, is an enlisted CLERK. Both men glance from 
               their paperwork at the man in the doorway. But it's only a 
               glance and they go right on shuffling paper.

               Footfalls sound in a hallway and a blue-eyed officer with 
               slick, black hair swings into the foyer. He too has a 
               slackness that echoes the dreariness of this post.

               The blue-eyed officer, LIEUTENANT ELGIN, and Dunbar meet at 
               the doorway. Dunbar glances down at a scrap of paper in his 
               hand.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Where can I find Major... Fambrough?

                                     ELGIN
                         Turn right... all the way to the end 
                         of the hall.

               Being roughly the same age and rank these two might idle 
               awhile, but Dunbar is eager. He's already moving.

                                     FAMBROUGH (O.S.)
                         Lt. John J. Dunbar.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Sir?

               Dunbar stops and turns, peering down the hallway. No one is 
               there.

               INT. FAMBROUGH'S OFFICE - DAY

               Sitting behind the desk, holding a set of orders is MAJOR 
               FAMBROUGH.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         Lt. John J. Dunbar.

               Lt. Dunbar is standing in front of the desk.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Yes sir?

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         Indian fighter, huh?

                                     DUNBAR
                         Excuse me?

                                     FAMBROUGH
                              (indicating paper)
                         Your orders say you are to be posted 
                         on the frontier. The frontier is 
                         Indian country. I quickly deduced 
                         that you are an Indian fighter.

               He arches an eyebrow, challenging the lieutenant. He has sad 
               swollen eyes. He is an army lifer passed over too many times 
               for promotion and right now does not look like a well man.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         I did not ascend to this position by 
                         being stupid.

                                     DUNBAR
                         No sir.

               Fambrough returns to the order. Dunbar watches him in silence.

               The major's tunic is covered with food stains. Sweat has 
               broken out all over his head. His grooming is awful. His 
               hands are trembling slightly. Something is very wrong with 
               him.

               Now the major sees something on the official paper. He looks 
               quickly at the lieutenant, then back at the paper, moving 
               his lips but making no sound.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         It says here you've been decorated.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Yes sir.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         And they sent you out here to be 
                         posted?

                                     DUNBAR
                         Actually sir, I'm here at my own 
                         request... I want to see the frontier.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         You want to see the frontier?

                                     DUNBAR
                         Yes sir... before it's gone.

               The major fixes Dunbar with a sly look.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         Such a smart lad coming straight to 
                         me.

               Still sly, Fambrough digs into a side drawer. There is the 
               distinct clink of glass on glass as he rummages. Now Fambrough 
               has what he wants, a blank official form. He begins to fill 
               it out, writing in a disturbingly childish way.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         Sir Knight, I am sending you on a 
                         knight's errand. You will report to 
                         Captain Cargill at the furthermost 
                         outpost of the realm... Fort 
                         Sedgewick.

               He looks over his work with a schoolboy's excitement and 
               affixes his signature with a wild flourish.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         My personal seal will assure you 
                         safe passage through many miles of 
                         wild hostile country.

               He folds the order and hands it to Dunbar.

                                     DUNBAR
                         I'm wondering sir, how will I be 
                         getting there?

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         You think I don't know?

                                     DUNBAR
                         No sir, it's just that I don't know.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         Hold your tongue.

               The major turns in his chair to stare through a single, dusty 
               window. He can see a teamster outside, tying down canvas on 
               a heavily-loaded wagon.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         I'm in a generous mood and will grant 
                         your boon. You see that peasant... 
                         he calls himself Timmons... he leaves 
                         this very afternoon for your Fort 
                         Sedgewick. Ride with him if you 
                         like... he knows the way. That is 
                         all.

               Dunbar stands and salutes. Fambrough returns it snappily.

               The lieutenant starts for the door.

                                     FAMBROUGH (O.S.)
                         Sir Knight...

               Dunbar turns around. Fambrough is standing in front of his 
               desk. There's a large, dark splotch on the major's trouser 
               front.

               He jams both of his hands into the front of his pants and 
               giggles.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         I just pissed in my pants... and 
                         nobody can do anything about it.

               EXT. FORT HAYS - DAY

               Lieutenant Dunbar skips down the steps, picks up Cisco's 
               reins and starts leading the buckskin along the front of the 
               building. He looks briefly at his orders, stops and turns 
               back towards Fambrough's office.

               And there is Fambrough with a full glass of booze in hand, 
               toasting the young lieutenant from the window. A wide grin 
               on his face.

               EXT. FORT HAYS - DAY

               A wagon is pulling slowly away from the lonely headquarters.

               EXT. FORT HAYS - DAY

               The insane face of Major Fambrough peeks around the corner 
               of a building. On his head is a ridiculous, plumed hat.

               Now he looks both ways, as if preparing to cross a busy 
               street. Seeing that the coast is clear, he minces into the 
               parade ground in front of headquarters. The plume is waving 
               in the breeze and the major carries something in each hand... 
               an officer's sword and a revolver.

               Except for these items, the unfortunate major is naked.

               As he trots onto the parade ground, Fambrough is startled to 
               find that Elgin is following him. He begins to run faster.

               Fambrough halts near the center of the parade ground and 
               turns back on the lieutenant and waves his pistol menacingly.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         Noooo, noooo...

                                     ELGIN
                         It's alright Major.

               Now Elgin sees a GRIZZLED SERGEANT approaching Fambrough 
               from the opposite direction.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Leave him alone lieutenant... he's 
                         cracked.

               Fambrough turns on the voice behind him and waves his pistol 
               at the sergeant.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         Nooo, nooo...

               But Fambrough finds himself staring at the barrel of the 
               sergeant's raised pistol.

                                     ELGIN
                         Don't sergeant.

               In a panic Fambrough wheels back on Lieutenant Elgin.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         Are you deaf fool. I said I'll have 
                         my crown this instant... this instant!

               Slowly and kindly, Elgin is walking toward him. He holds out 
               his hand.

                                     ELGIN
                         Let's have the pistol.

                                     SERGEANT
                              (to Elgin)
                         Don't do it.

               But the lieutenant keeps his hand held out. Fambrough eyes 
               him silently. Then he screws up his face like a crybaby.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         The king is dead... long live the 
                         king.

               In one swift motion, Fambrough brings the revolver up, 
               swallows the barrel and pulls the trigger.

               EXT. WAGON - DAY

               At the sound of a single shot behind him, Dunbar twists around 
               on the wagon seat. Seeing nothing, he turns back to face the 
               front and takes stock of the driver, TIMMONS. He doesn't 
               like what he sees... or smells.

               Timmons, is not what would be called a credit to his race. 
               If all teamsters were greaseballs he would be their absolute 
               ruler. His stink must be incredible. He leans over the side 
               of the wagon and hocks out a disgusting stream of spittle.

               Afternoon shadows are slanting across the rolling ocean of 
               prairie. The wagon passes camera, headed towards an endless 
               expanse of prairie.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT

               The sky is filled with stars. One suddenly catches fire and 
               shoots across the heavens.

               EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT

               Dunbar sits at the fire watching the star burn out.

               Timmons is bending over the fire. He farts, then turns to 
               Dunbar with a smile "good one, huh?".

               He spits for good measure and for Dunbar, the moment is 
               broken, but not forgotten.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         Were it not for my companion I believe 
                         I would be having the time of my 
                         life. He is quite possibly the foulest 
                         person I have ever met.

               Looking over his shoulder at the journal, we see that this 
               latest entry is one of many and Dunbar is embellishing it 
               with a drawing of a star.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Dunbar is off the seat riding atop the mountain of supplies. 
               He is writing in his journal.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         We have been gone four days now and 
                         still we have seen no signs of life. 
                         Only earth and sky.

               Dunbar stops his writing.

                                     DUNBAR
                         How far do you make the fort?

                                     TIMMONS
                         Far.

                                     DUNBAR
                         How far?

                                     TIMMONS
                         Forty or fifty miles, maybe... what's 
                         the big hurry on Sedgewick?

                                     DUNBAR
                         It's going to be my post... my home.

                                     TIMMONS
                         You ain't hard to please, I'll say 
                         that.

               Timmons slows the wagon and stops.  He has seen something.

                                     TIMMONS
                         Look yonder.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               A cluster of bones bleached white, are lying in the tall 
               grass. Human bones. Dunbar is squatting next to them. Timmons' 
               head dips into view over his shoulder and the teamster's 
               mouth splits into a toothless grin.

                                     TIMMONS
                         Somebody back east is sayin'... "why 
                         don't he write?" Stupid bastard.

               The teamster spits and starts for the wagon. Dunbar comes to 
               his feet and examines the burnt out remains of a wagon. Then, 
               he finds an arrow in the grassy wheel. Looking off he can 
               only guess at the drama here. The sun is sinking fast below 
               the great expanse of prairie.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK BLUFF - DAWN

               A hatless soldier in a tattered overcoat, CAPTAIN CARGILL, 
               is on the bluff staring morosely through his telescope. One 
               hand rubs a sore spot on his jaw. He sticks the telescope in 
               his overcoat pocket. He wedges a hand into his mouth and 
               wiggles a loose tooth. He gives it a tug but it is not ready 
               to come out.

               The breeze is coming up and Captain Cargill pulls his overcoat 
               closed. As he slips his last button through the hole, it 
               breaks off, bounces off of his foot and rolls a few feet 
               down the bluff.

               Captain Cargill watches the button forlornly, making no move 
               to go after it. He raises his head once more and looks to 
               the east. Nothing is out there.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK CUT BANK - DAWN

               Cargill is walking along the base of the cut bank. He stops, 
               staring up at a series of holes dug into the bluff. Their 
               entrance covered with "found" draperies of all description. 
               He works up the courage to call out.

                                     CARGILL
                         Corporal Guest... Corporal Guest... 
                         Corporal Guest. Corporal Guest, you 
                         don't have to talk to me... just 
                         please come out.

               At last there's some real movement behind one of the holes 
               and CORPORAL GUEST crawls through one of the curtains. He 
               neither salutes nor speaks. He blinks down at Cargill, looking 
               more like a hobo than a soldier.

                                     CARGILL
                         It's the end... assemble the men in 
                         front of my quarters.

               EXT. CARGILL'S QUARTERS - DAY

               The "MEN" have lined up in front of Cargill's sad, sod hut; 
               pitiful men. Sick, moth-eaten, crushed in spirit. There are 
               nine of them. Just behind Cargill is a half-collapsed supply 
               house and a broken down corral holding two bony horses.

               Cargill has a brave face and a broken heart.

                                     CARGILL
                         You hate me... but I feel none of 
                         the same for you... you men stayed. 
                         You stayed after they took all our 
                         horses. You stayed after all the 
                         others deserted. You stayed on the 
                         promise that the army would resupply 
                         us. I've looked for that wagon from 
                         Fort Hays just as you have... day 
                         after miserable day. All I can say 
                         is that I'm proud of you. Get your 
                         things men, we're leaving this place. 
                         The army... can go to hell.

               The zombie troops have already broken ranks, lurching back 
               to their holes and gear like a gang of drunks.

               Cargill walks out of frame to reveal the broken down sign 
               that hangs askew above his quarters: "Fort Sedgewick."

               EXT. SEDGEWICK BLUFF - DUSK

               A solitary WOLF trots along the top of a bluff overlooking 
               the river. He has two white socks running up his front legs. 
               An old jagged scar cuts across his muzzle. He's watching the 
               ruins of Fort Sedgewick.

               The little band of troops, all on foot, with their two lame 
               horses trailing behind are fading in the distance.

               EXT. WAGON CAMP - DAWN

               The wagon is parked in a shallow depression, its team 
               unhitched. Under the wagon the forms of two men lay curled 
               up in blankets.

               Dunbar is sleeping peacefully, his nose pressed against a 
               jacket. Now his nostrils begin to twitch. His face turns 
               sour and he wakes to find that he's been sleeping against 
               the stink of Timmons. Flies buzz about the teamster's sleeping 
               body.

               Dunbar quickly pulls away from the bad smell. He rolls out 
               from under the wagon and clambers to his feet.

               Lieutenant Dunbar looks out over the prairie. It's going to 
               be a spectacular day.

               In the far distance, a column of buzzards is circling. Dunbar 
               has paused to watch them. He ducks back under the wagon.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Timmons... Timmons.

               No response from the deep-sleeping driver. Dunbar starts to 
               move closer to shake him awake but the odor under there makes 
               him think twice. He snatches up the arrow and probes under 
               the wagon.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Timmons.

               The teamster comes awake with a squeal, he joins Dunbar 
               staring up at the circling birds.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Something's out there...

                                     TIMMONS
                         Somethin' dead.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Might have a look.

                                     TIMMONS
                         Might stay clear of whatever did the 
                         killin'.

               Timmons' mood is different now. He begins to hitch the team 
               with a new sense of urgency.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               From a high point on the prairie we can see the wagon moving 
               west. And no more than half a mile away we can see Cargill's 
               column, moving east. Neither is aware of the other's presence.

               Several buzzards are settling on a half-butchered horse. 
               It's one of the animals that was with Cargill's command. We 
               can hear men singing. The shaky little column from Fort 
               Sedgewick is marching east for Fort Hays.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Dunbar is walking through a little valley of tall, rich grass. 
               The wagon is nowhere in sight.

               He looks back at Cisco who is also wandering by himself 
               searching for prime shoots.

               Timmons' wagon comes into view now.

                                     DUNBAR
                         How come we haven't seen any buffalo?

                                     TIMMONS
                         Can't figger the stinkin' buffalo. 
                         Sometimes you don't see 'em for days, 
                         sometimes they're thick as curls on 
                         a whore.

                                     DUNBAR
                         What about Indians?

                                     TIMMONS
                         Goddamn Indians you'd jus' as soon 
                         not see, lessen the bastards're dead. 
                         Nothing but thieves and beggars.

               Timmons, as usual, laughs at his own imagined wit.

               The wagon disappears over a ridge and again, Dunbar is alone.

               In gentle awe, he runs his palm over the top of the grass 
               swirling about his waist.

               A meadow lark's mournful call startles him. Dunbar brings 
               his head up at the sound and so does Cisco.

               Now there's a sudden lifting of the breeze. It sweeps through 
               the valley, making the grass roll with a life of its own.

               The lark's sad call and the sudden violent movement of the 
               wind sends a shudder through Lieutenant Dunbar. He scans the 
               horizon in all directions, aware all at once of his aloneness.

               He flips the reins over Cisco's neck and sticks a foot in 
               the stirrup.

               Dunbar heads for the ridge.

               EXT. BLUFF - DAY

               As Dunbar comes over the hill, he sees the wagon has ground 
               to a stop.

               The wagon has paused at the edge of a bluff. Dunbar and 
               Timmons are peering into the little valley below

                                     TIMMONS
                         Not what you'd call a going concern.

               The wagon lurches over the edge of the bluff and down. We 
               see the pathetic remains of Fort Sedgewick.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY

               A full view of the deserted fort. Timmons sits on the wagon 
               by himself.

                                     TIMMONS
                         Ain't nothin' here lieutenant.

               Dunbar appears from Cargill's former quarters.

                                     TIMMONS (O.S.)
                         Everybody's run off... or got kilt.

               The lieutenant looks briefly at Timmons, and marches over to 
               the caved-in supply house. Again he ducks inside.

               Dunbar emerges from the supply house and stares up at the 
               wagon driver.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Alright...lets unload the wagon.

                                     TIMMONS
                         What, and leave it all here?

                                     DUNBAR
                         I'm staying too... we don't know 
                         what's happened.

               Dunbar moves around to the back of the wagon.

                                     TIMMONS
                         There ain't nothin' here lieutenant.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Not at the moment, no.

                                     TIMMONS
                         So things bein' the way they are we 
                         might as well turn around and get 
                         started back.

                                     DUNBAR
                         This is my post...

                                     TIMMONS
                         This is my... are you crazy boy?

               The lieutenant's eyes have gone absolutely black. The heel 
               of his hand is dropping lightly on the butt of a long revolver 
               at his hip.

                                     DUNBAR
                         This is my post! And these are the 
                         post's provisions. Now get your ass 
                         off that wagon and help me unload.

               Timmons leaps down.

               INT. SUPPLY HOUSE - DAY

               The half-caved in supply house bulges with supplies.

               INT. CARGILL'S QUARTERS - DAY

               Cargill's late quarters are also filled with new goods. 
               There's barely enough room to reach the little bunk.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DUSK

               Timmons is atop his wagon seat, reins in hand.

                                     TIMMONS
                         Well... I'll let 'em know where you 
                         are.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Good.

                                     TIMMONS
                         Good luck lieutenant.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Thank you.

               Timmons clucks to his team and the wagon pulls out. The light 
               on the prairie is fading fast.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK RIVER BANK - DUSK

               The wolf with two socks is patrolling along the edge of the 
               river.

               INT. QUARTERS - NIGHT

               A lamp turns up, casting a glow over Dunbar's incredibly 
               cramped quarters.

               He adjusts the lamp and sits back on the bunk, his journal 
               on his lap. He begins an entry.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         Have arrived to find Fort Sedgewick 
                         deserted. Am now waiting for the 
                         garrison's return or word from 
                         headquarters. Post is in exceedingly 
                         poor condition. Have decided to assign 
                         myself clean-up duty beginning 
                         tomorrow. Supplies abundant. The 
                         country is everything I dreamed it 
                         would be. There can be no place like 
                         this on earth.

               Dunbar signs the entry, yawns contentedly and reaches to 
               turn down the lamp.

               A wolf howls somewhere outside. It's low at first but it 
               keeps on building. At its height, the howl sounds as though 
               it is coming from, something gigantic.

               Dunbar is still listening after it's gone. He hears wood 
               snap in the direction of the river then all is quiet again. 
               Without hesitating, he slips the big revolver out of its 
               holster and cradling it like a teddy bear, slips it under 
               his blanket.

               The light is left blazing.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAWN

               First light over the sad fort.

               INT. QUARTERS - DAWN

               Dunbar is sleeping quietly. He opens his eyes and rears his 
               head to get his bearings. Then he flops back down and shuts 
               his eyes, hoping for more sleep.

               He hears two heavy footfalls in rapid succession.

               Dunbar holds his breath staring at the doorway. Quietly, he 
               pulls his gun aiming it directly at the doorway.

               Silence. Suddenly, a shadow starts across the threshold, 
               followed quickly by Cisco's big buckskin head. The horse 
               watches Dunbar a moment, then looks curiously around the 
               room.

               EXT. CORRAL - DAY

               Dressed in pants, old boots, and a threadbare shirt, Dunbar 
               bangs home a nail on the sagging corral gate. He tests the 
               gate's swing and satisfied with this, he latches it leaving 
               Cisco inside.

               The lieutenant picks up a water bucket and we follow as he 
               walks the few, quick yards it takes to reach the bank 
               overlooking the river.

               When he sees what lies along the slope below, he stops. At 
               this spot just below the fort, a garbage dump falls away to 
               the stream. Old containers, sacks, rags, trash, bottles, and 
               a thousand other miscellaneous scraps.

               Dunbar hops over the steep lip of the bank and starts down 
               the gentle incline, eyeing the trash as he goes. Now he 
               reaches the stream and kneels, preparing to dip the bucket.

               He sniffs a bad odor, looks across the stagnant stream and 
               sees something sticking out of the water.

               It's a cloven hoof. And further out, another. And part of an 
               antler. There are decomposed antelope corpses everywhere.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               An antelope skeleton is being pulled from the muck.

               Dunbar is stripped to the waist as he drags the body through 
               deep water. Covering his face against the stink is a bandana. 
               His pants are soaked and he's sweating hard.

               At the stream's edge he heaves the antelope onto a pile 
               holding several others. Under the bodies is a huge bed of 
               trash which he has already collected.

               The body he tosses up slips and he has to right it. Now he 
               wades back into the river and searches the water with his 
               hands for more.

               EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY

               Dunbar fastens the last of the traces to a pile of garbage 
               spread out on a sheet of canvas. He picks up a set of long 
               reins, clucks to Cisco and they start up the steep bank with 
               the load.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               A distinct change has taken place with the water. It's 
               running.

               EXT. TRASH PILE - DAY

               Oil is pouring out of a jug and onto the great heap. Dunbar 
               empties the last of the oil and throws the empty jug onto 
               the pile. He takes the match he's been holding between his 
               teeth and flicks it to life with a fingernail. He flips it 
               onto the heap.

               The fire catches immediately and Dunbar has to back away a 
               few steps as the flames send a column of thick, black smoke 
               into the air.

               To Dunbar's horror, the smoke billows bigger and bigger... 
               climbing into the sky as a signal for anyone to see.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Damn... damn.

               He stoops for his rifle and we follow as he scrambles up the 
               slope. The lieutenant clambers over the lip and stops to 
               scan the horizon.

               But we continue, following the black smoke as it towers higher 
               and higher until it is just a wisp.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Four fantastic faces fill the screen, three together, one a 
               little apart. They are tired, frustrated faces, and also 
               very fierce. They are painted. Several wear their hair in 
               spiked roaches, one has brightly-colored eagle feathers 
               jutting out of his scalp at all angles. The FOUR WARRIORS 
               are naked from the waist up.

               They are Pawnee, the scariest of all the Plains Tribes. The 
               man a little apart looks THE TOUGHEST. The four men are 
               squatting on their haunches and four scrawny ponies stand 
               behind them. All the men are staring in the same direction 
               from a low rise on the prairie.

               It's smoke, a column much smaller than Dunbar's. The smoke 
               is drifting up from the furthest of a line of rolling gullies.

               We can see the whole Indian party now: the four men and their 
               ponies, two injured men on travois and two extra ponies.

               (PLEASE NOTE: ALL INDIAN DIALOGUE WILL BE IN NATIVE DIALECT 
               AS INDICATED BY TRIBE. SUBTITLES WILL BE USED.)

                                     THE TOUGHEST
                         Only a white man would make a fire 
                         for everyone to see.

                                     1ST PAWNEE
                         Maybe there's more than one.

               The Toughest turns back to face the others. Without another 
               word, he jumps on his horse. Another silence as the three 
               warriors consider what to do.

                                     2ND PAWNEE
                         We have no rifles. White men are 
                         sure to have rifles.

                                     3RD PAWNEE
                         We should forget this and go home.

               The Toughest has listened all the while, growing more and 
               more disgusted. He pulls the blanket from his shoulders and 
               flings it angrily at his companions.

                                     TOUGHEST
                         Then go. I for one, will not debate 
                         the merit of a single line of smoke 
                         in my own country.

               He starts his pony walking down the rise toward the smoke.

                                     1ST PAWNEE
                              (shaking his head)
                         He will not quit until we are all 
                         dead.

               The Third Pawnee starts after the Toughest. The other two 
               follow.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               We're dropping down through the smoke, right down to the 
               supper fire of Timmons the teamster. He's cooking slab bacon 
               in a pan. Risking the heat, he dips a finger into the pan 
               and sucks off the grease.

               There's a sudden swish of sound behind him and a split-second 
               later, an arrow goes deep into the wagon driver's ass knocking 
               him clear across the fire.

               Timmons screams like a half-butchered hog and starts into an 
               odd crippled run. He clears the gully where he's been camped 
               and struggles up the incline.

               Another swish and another scream, as another arrow catches 
               him high on the shoulder.

               Terrified with pain and fear, Timmons looks back as he 
               scrambles up the slope.

               Here comes the Toughest at a lazy gallop. He's riding only 
               with his legs. His hands are busy with bow and arrows. Casual 
               but blink quick, the Toughest snatches another arrow from 
               the quiver at his waist, strings it and fires. This arrow 
               catches Timmons in the gut. He falls squirming against the 
               slope.

               The Toughest is still coming, his face like granite as he 
               fires arrow after arrow.

               The three warriors who came with the Toughest have reached 
               the wagon. Two of them are slicing away harness on the team 
               of nice army horses. The third is rifling through Timmons' 
               gear. This man unwittingly picks up Timmons' blanket. When 
               he gets a whiff of its stink, the warrior flings it far out 
               on the grass. Then he drops to one knee, scoops up some dirt 
               and rubs it between his soiled hands.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               A lone arrow remains in Timmons' dead body, jutting out of 
               his privates.

               Now the Pawnee warriors pass by, heading for home in no 
               particular hurry. The Toughest passes by with Timmons' scalp 
               hanging from his bow. None of the men give Timmons a parting 
               glance.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK BLUFF - DAY

               We're close on Dunbar, his face is grimy with sweat and dirt. 
               He's working hard at something.

               We pull back and see that Dunbar is half-way up the bluff, 
               he's been filling up the pockmarks, the holes where Cargill's 
               men once lived.

               Exhausted, he stabs the shovel into the fresh earth and pauses 
               to look over his work, all of the holes have been filled.

               His eyes sweep over the prairie across the river. He sees 
               something moving, it's the wolf. Dunbar instinctively goes 
               for his rifle.

               Before he can bring it up to aim, he has second thoughts. He 
               lowers the gun and watches the wolf a moment longer, then 
               walks up the hill and disappears into the sky.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK BLUFF - DAY

               Fingers are playing with a button. It appears to be the same 
               one that came off Captain Cargill's coat. Dunbar stands atop 
               the hill, sighting across the prairie.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         No sign of Captain Cargill's command. 
                         I don't know what to do. Communication 
                         can only take place if I leave and I 
                         don't want to abandon my post.

               He sticks a hand in his overcoat, pulls out a piece of dried 
               meat and bites off a hunk.

               Dunbar starts down the hill toward the fort. He watches the 
               horizon as he goes.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         Made a short patrol yesterday p.m... 
                         discovered nothing. Will go further 
                         tomorrow.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DUSK

               His long day has drawn to a close. Dunbar sits on the stoop 
               of his quarters. His journal open in his lap. The sign over 
               the doorway has been straightened. Dunbar is staring at 
               something.

               One hundred yards away, sitting in the grass is the outline 
               of a wolf.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         There is a wolf who seems intent on 
                         the goings on here. He does not seem 
                         inclined to be a nuisance however 
                         and aside from Cisco has been my 
                         only company. He has appeared each 
                         afternoon for the past two days. He 
                         has milky white socks on both feet. 
                         If he comes calling tomorrow I will 
                         name him Two Socks.

               EXT. SUPPLY HOUSE - DAY

               With a grunt Dunbar lugs an army saddle out of the supply 
               house and starts for the door. He slows to a stop and stares 
               down at the saddle as if in a trance. In a moment he is 
               tossing the saddle back where he found it.

               EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY

               Dunbar is leading Cisco to the top of a low hill. He glances 
               over his shoulder and sees that he is being followed.

               The wolf with two socks stops when Dunbar looks back at him.

               Dunbar watches him curiously for a moment and continues 
               leading Cisco up the hill. But now he's glancing regularly 
               over his shoulder and discovers that as he moves, so does 
               the wolf.

               Reaching the top of the hill, Dunbar pauses. He pulls out 
               the pocket telescope and sweeps the prairie. There is nothing.

               Now Dunbar swings onto Cisco's bare back and with a last 
               glance back at the wolf starts down the rise and on to the 
               open prairie at an easy canter. We follow for a little 
               distance. Dunbar glances once more over his shoulder.

               The wolf is sitting on top of the hill watching. He has 
               decided to come no further.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY

               Considerable time has passed. Dunbar, bundled warmly against 
               the chill of an oncoming storm, and Cisco are coming back 
               into camp from a hunting foray. A brace of grouse is slung 
               over Cisco's withers.

               INT. QUARTERS - DAY

               It's storming outside. Rain is pouring down, its patter broken 
               from time to time by spectacular flashes of lightning and 
               the boom of thunder.

               But inside it's cozy. The quarters are still crowded but 
               considerable order has been brought to bear on the place.

               He is just finishing up the grouse and a pile of bones sits 
               on the table. Open at his side is his journal.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         Almost a month and no one has come. 
                         The longer this condition persists, 
                         the less inclined I am to believe 
                         that anyone will. Rain has forced me 
                         indoors for most of two days. I have 
                         begun an awning. The work has ruined 
                         my hands, but I am excited about the 
                         improvement it will bring to this 
                         place.

               A great bolt of lightning strikes outside, filling the room 
               with violent white light. Dunbar walks to the door and tosses 
               out a handful of bones. Two Socks scurries to collect the 
               bones and retreats under the shelter of a nearby tree.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         It is the loneliest of times... but 
                         I cannot say that I am unhappy.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Just as Dunbar did on his trip out with Timmons, someone is 
               running a palm over the tips of the tall prairie grass. This 
               hand, however, is red.

               A lone Indian is standing in the grass, his pony at his side. 
               He is a real Indian; tough, wild and free. He is a person of 
               special maturity. He radiates wisdom and is a man of 
               responsibility in his community. He is a Sioux medicine man. 
               He is KICKING BIRD.

               EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY

               Dunbar is squatting naked at the edge of the stream, pounding 
               the dirt out of his trousers on a little rock ledge. He rises, 
               wringing out the pants, and wades across the river.

               On the opposite bank he spreads the pants on a low bush. 
               Then he looks along the river. For some distance every bush 
               and shrub is draped with the lieutenant's laundry, all of it 
               drying in the sun.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY

               The spectacular face of Kicking Bird is staring at something.

               He's looking thoughtfully at the "new" Fort Sedgewick; the 
               tidy grounds, the great awning, the repaired corral. The 
               beautiful, buckskin standing inside.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               Comfortable with his nakedness, Dunbar is meandering along 
               the stream in no particular hurry. He's very white. His skin 
               practically sparkles in the sun.

               Dunbar is making his way up the bluff. The steepest part is 
               at the lip and here he drops to all fours.

               Dunbar's face comes into view. He freezes.

               Someone is creeping under the shade of the awning... an 
               aboriginal man.

               Dunbar's head pops down behind the bluff.

               The lieutenant is down on his naked haunches. His heart is 
               pounding in his ears. Sweat has broken out on his face. His 
               mouth is dry as ash.

               He's playing back images in fragments. A deerskin shirt, 
               strands of hair sewn along each sleeve. Fringed leggins. A 
               dark, faded breechclout. Moccasins with beading. A single, 
               large feather drooping behind a head of shiny, black hair. 
               Braids wrapped in fur. A lethal stone club hanging from a 
               red hand. No eyebrows on a magnificent, primitive face.

               Dunbar stays in a crouch, trying to think on jellied legs. 
               His breathing has quickened. His mouth is open.

               A horses' whinny startles him.

               Ever so slowly, the lieutenant peers over the bluff.

               The aboriginal man is in the corral. He's walking slowly 
               toward Cisco. One hand is held out reassuringly, the other 
               is grasping a rope. He's making gentle, cooing sounds and is 
               only a step or two from being able to loop his line over the 
               horse's neck.

                                     DUNBAR
                         You there!

               Kicking Bird jumps straight into the air. As he lands he 
               whirls to meet the voice that startled him.

               Dunbar is coming. His hands are clenched and his arms are 
               swinging stiffly at his sides.

               Kicking Bird has turned to stone at the sight of this horror. 
               With a sharp intake of breath, he staggers back a few steps. 
               Then he turns and runs, tearing through the corral fence as 
               if it were made of twigs. He leaps onto his horse and quirts 
               the pony into full gallop.

               Dunbar is watching from the yard. His jaw is clenched, his 
               hands are still fisted.

               The great grassland is empty. Kicking Bird is gone.

               INT. SUPPLY HOUSE - DAY

               The first of three carbine boxes is lugged off the stack.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               The three boxes are stacked on the open prairie. Suddenly a 
               shovelful of dirt flies out of an unseen spot next to the 
               crates. Another flying shovelful. And another.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         Have made first contact with a wild 
                         Indian. One came to the fort and 
                         tried to steal my horse. Do not know 
                         how many more are in the vicinity 
                         but I am taking steps for another 
                         visitation. Am burying excess 
                         ordnance, lest it fall into enemy 
                         hands.

               The last square of sod is placed carefully on the surface of 
               the earth. Dunbar drives a bleached rib bone into the ground 
               at an angle just in front of his cache.

               Dunbar steps back from his work. The replaced sod is 
               invisible. The guns will not be found.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               The lieutenant sits atop Cisco scouting along the bluff. 
               Fort Sedgewick lies in the background.

               INT. QUARTERS - DAY

               Dunbar's journal lies open on his bunk. We hear a digging 
               sound in the background. The lieutenant is facing the wall 
               of his quarters. Using a bayonet as a cutting tool, he has 
               carved a window out of the sod. He's nearly finished and is 
               just tidying up.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         Have made all the preparations I can 
                         think of. I cannot mount an adequate 
                         defense but will try to make a big 
                         impression when they come. Waiting.

               Finished, he retreats to his bunk and sits staring across at 
               his new window. He glances at the journal by his side and 
               has a thought. He picks it up and starts to write.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         The man I encountered was a 
                         magnificent looking fellow.

               EXT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - DAY

               An old Indian man sits in the shade outside his lodge. His 
               skin is leathery, his hair grey and wispy but his eyes are 
               bright as diamonds. He is TEN BEARS, well past sixty, but 
               still strong enough to be the head man. He is, for the most 
               part, oblivious to the GRANDCHILD squirming in his lap.

               He's smoking a long-stemmed pipe, but the main object of his 
               interest is an old woman squatting next to him... PRETTY 
               SHIELD. She's pounding away at something in a bowl.

               Ten Bears looks up to notice Kicking Bird. The medicine man 
               is passing not far away and Ten Bears' eyes follow him 
               carefully, not glancing away until Kicking Bird has ducked 
               into his lodge.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Kicking Bird has been keeping to 
                         himself these last few days. I do 
                         not like to see our medicine man 
                         walking so alone.

               The old woman looks up from her pounding but does not respond.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         What does his wife say?

                                     PRETTY SHIELD
                         He is keeping to himself.

               Ten Bears gives his wife a challenging look and she bristles.

                                     PRETTY SHIELD
                         That's what she says.

               Ten Bears accepts this. Then he looks down at the bowl.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Make sure that meat is soft... my 
                         teeth hurt.

               Ten Bears looks once more at the entrance of Kicking Bird's 
               lodge.

               INT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY

               Kicking Bird sits next to the fire playing with his son but 
               he is preoccupied with something.

               There is a rustle of movement at the tent flap, and Ten Bears 
               peers in.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         May I come in?

               The little boy races over to the old chief, Kicking Bird 
               makes a move to pull him back, but Ten Bears indicates the 
               boy should stay.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         No, no let him sit with me.

               There is silence as the two men settle themselves by the 
               fire, the little boy content in Ten Bears' lap.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Our country seems good this summer, 
                         but I have not been out to see it.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Yes... it is good. The grass is rich. 
                         The game is plenty and not running 
                         away.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         I am glad to hear it. But the buffalo 
                         are late. I always worry about the 
                         bellies of our children.

               A brief silence.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         I was thinking of a dance.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Yes, a dance is always a good idea. 
                         It would be good to have a strong 
                         sign.

               Kicking Bird seems suddenly uncomfortable. The little boy 
               leaves.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Yes.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         There's a funny thing about signs. 
                         They are always flying in our faces. 
                         We know when they are bad or good 
                         but sometimes they are strange and 
                         there is no way to understand them. 
                         Sometimes they make people crazy but 
                         a smart man will take such a sign 
                         into himself and let it run around 
                         for two or three days. If he is still 
                         confused he will tell somebody. He 
                         might come to you or to me and tell 
                         it. A smart man always does that.

               Ten Bears picks up the pipe and puffs away, seemingly without 
               care.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         I have seen such a sign.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Oh?

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         I saw a man, a white man.

               Ten Bears' eyes get big for a moment. Then he thinks.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Just one?

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Just one. He was naked.

               Ten Bears thinks some more.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Are you sure it was a man?

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         I saw his sex.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Did you speak to him?

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         No.

               Ten Bears rubs at his old eyes with both hands.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         We will council on this.

               EXT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - NIGHT

               A teenaged boy, SMILES A LOT and his two buddies OTTER and 
               WORM lie prone outside Ten Bears' home. They are peeking 
               under the tipi's rolled-up sides. Their eyes are wide, for 
               inside there's plenty to see and hear. The village's most 
               influential warriors have squeezed into the lodge for this 
               big and important meeting

               INT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - NIGHT

               The eldest and most respected men of the band, including Ten 
               Bears, his pal STONE CALF, an influential warrior named WIND 
               IN HIS HAIR, and Kicking Bird are seated around the fire.

               Crowded around them, in a high state of excitement, are the 
               village's leading warriors. The meeting is in progress.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         He might be a god or he might be a 
                         special chief -- that's why we are 
                         thinking of having a talk with him.

               There is a little murmuring around the fire, and it goes 
               silent. Wind In His Hair rises to speak.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         I do not care for this talk about a 
                         white man. Whatever kind of white 
                         man he is, he is not Sioux and that 
                         makes him less. We've camped here 
                         for ten days now and each day our 
                         scouts find nothing. One old bull 
                         with wolves tearing him apart, nothing 
                         more. We need meat -- not talk.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         You are right, we need meat today 
                         and tomorrow. But we must also have 
                         meat in ten years.

               Kicking Bird pauses here. Everyone is listening attentively.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         But the whites are coming. Our friends 
                         the Shoshone and the Kiowa, even our 
                         enemies, agree on this -- the whites 
                         are coming. More than can be counted.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         Kicking Bird is always looking ahead 
                         and that is good. But when I hear 
                         that more whites are coming -- more 
                         than can be counted I want to laugh. 
                         We took a hundred horses from these 
                         people, there was no honor in it. 
                         They don't ride well, they don't 
                         shoot well, they're dirty. They have 
                         no women, no children. They could 
                         not even make it through one winter 
                         in our country. And these people are 
                         said to flourish? I think they will 
                         all be dead in ten years.

               There is a surge of enthusiasm in the lodge and Wind In His 
               Hair is riding the crest of it.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         I think this white man is probably 
                         lost.

               This parting shot prompts a good-natured round of laughter.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Wind In His Hair has spoken straight, 
                         his words are strong and I have heard 
                         them. It's true the whites are a 
                         poor race and it's hard to understand 
                         them. But when I see one white man 
                         alone, without fear in our country, 
                         I do not think he is lost. I think 
                         he may have medicine. I see someone 
                         who might speak for all the white 
                         people who are coming. I think this 
                         is a person with which treaties might 
                         be struck.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         This white man cannot cover our 
                         lodges, or string our bows, or feed 
                         our children. I will take some good 
                         men... there are many here tonight. 
                         We will ride to the soldier fort, we 
                         will shoot some arrows into this 
                         white man. If he truly has medicine 
                         he will not be hurt. If he has no 
                         medicine he will be dead.

               This is the best idea so far and there is much talk around 
               the fire. They quiet down as Ten Bears prepares to speak.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         It is easy to become confused by 
                         these questions. It is hard to know 
                         what to do. No man can tell another 
                         how he will be. But I know this... 
                         killing a white man is a delicate 
                         matter. If you kill one, more are 
                         sure to come. We should talk about 
                         this some more.

               He drops his head, closes his eyes and starts to fall asleep. 
               The meeting is over.

               EXT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - NIGHT

               Inside the meeting is breaking up. But Smiles A Lot is no 
               longer watching. He's lost in thought, as if he has got 
               something on his mind.

               Now he comes out of it. With a last look into the lodge, he 
               sneaks off into the night.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT

               Three boys Otter, Worm and their leader Smiles A Lot, are 
               riding to the fort.

               Smiles A Lot stops, just realizing that the other two have 
               fallen behind. He rides back to investigate.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         What's the matter now?

                                     WORM
                         Otter doesn't want to go.

               Smiles a Lot trots his pony over to Otter.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         If we take the horse of a white god 
                         they will make up songs about us.

                                     OTTER
                         Maybe.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         They will ask us to go on raids.

                                     OTTER
                         Who gets the white god horse?

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         I do... but we share... you and Worm 
                         can ride him too. Who can say this 
                         is not a great plan?

               Otter and Worm have blank expressions.

               INT. QUARTERS - NIGHT

               Dunbar is snoring. The lantern is turned down low. A horse 
               whinnies loudly and Dunbar arises.

               In the next instant there is a pounding of hooves and the 
               yelping of Indian boys.

               Reeling with sleep, Dunbar is up and moving. He grabs a rifle 
               and lurches for the door.

               As he runs through the door he forgets to duck under the 
               wooden cross beam. His skull cracks resoundingly against 
               the. overhang and Dunbar slumps onto his back... out cold.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT

               The three boys are shrieking as they race across the prairie 
               with their prize. Otter has Cisco by a lead line. Smiles A 
               Lot gallops alongside.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         Let me take him Otter.

                                     OTTER
                         I have him.

               To Smiles A Lot's amazement, Otter is suddenly gone. He's 
               zooming backward in midair.

               Otter comes to ground a few yards back, throwing up a puff 
               of dust. Cisco has screeched to a halt. Now he rears up, 
               twisting until the rope is free of Otter. Then he sticks his 
               tail in the air and makes tracks in the direction of the 
               fort. Worm chases after Cisco as Smiles A Lot sees to Otter

               EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT

               Smiles A Lot pulls his pony up next to Otter and peers down 
               at the fallen boy.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         What happened?

                                     OTTER
                         I don't know. My arm doesn't work.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         You shouldn't have fallen down... 
                         now we'll get in trouble.

                                     OTTER
                         It was your idea.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         My idea was only to take the horse.

               This squabble is interrupted by Worm's return. He gallops up 
               and jumps off his pony.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         Otter hurt himself.

               Worm shakes his head in frustration. Otter grabs a handful 
               of dirt and flings it at Smiles A Lot and Worm.

                                     OTTER
                              (to Worm)
                         You're not hurt... I'm hurt.

                                     WORM
                         I will be when my father finds out, 
                         his bow will be across my back.

               INT. QUARTERS - DAWN

               It's growing light and Dunbar is just coming to. He rolls to 
               one side and touches the egg that has risen on his forehead. 
               He hears movement in the yard and looks out.

               Cisco is pawing the ground. The Indian line still around his 
               neck.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               Dunbar is sitting naked in the shallow river below the fort. 
               He has worked up a good lather on his face and is shaving. 
               The big Navy revolver and his gunbelt are slung over his 
               shoulder. Dunbar glances at the far bluff.

               Two Socks is sitting quietly, watching the shaving ritual 
               below.

               The lieutenant is finishing shaving his moustache. He stares 
               onto the surface of the water trying to get it just right. 
               Once again he glances up at Two Socks.

               Two Socks' attention has been diverted. He's on guard, staring 
               intently across the river.

               Dunbar looks quickly at the bluff nearest the fort. Everything 
               is still. He looks back at Two Socks.

               The wolf is gone.

               The lieutenant hears something now. Hoofbeats. Hoofbeats 
               coming in a rush.

               He bursts from the water and scrambles up the incline.

               EXT. CORRAL - DAY

               They're streaming past him. FIVE MOUNTED WARRIORS bunched 
               around Cisco: raw, powerful men on painted, feathered ponies. 
               Wind In His Hair is one of them.

               Their faces are streaked with colorful designs, their weapons 
               slung around the shoulders, their nearly naked bodies all 
               sinew and bone. They are the full and breathtaking glory of 
               war.

               Dunbar is struck dumb. He stands still as the pageant passes 
               in front of him.

               The sight of Dunbar troubles Wind In His Hair, so much that 
               he pulls up a hundred yards away. He sits a moment on his 
               whirling pony, trying to decide if he should confront this 
               white god.

               He makes a warrior's choice. Wind In His Hair shouts to his 
               fellows to go on and charges down the slope... straight for 
               Dunbar.

               Dunbar's eyes are fixed on the closing horseman. He can't 
               move.

               Wind In His Hair is coming flat out, his lance extended. At 
               the last moment he pulls up so hard that the black pony skids 
               to a sit. The horse is up quickly and hard to manage. He 
               pitches back and forth only a few feet in front of Lieutenant 
               Dunbar.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         I am Wind In His Hair. Do you not 
                         see that I am not afraid of you?... 
                         Do you see?

               Dunbar stares expressionlessly into the Sioux's eyes. He 
               doesn't blink.

               Wind In His Hair suddenly turns his pony and whips after his 
               comrades. A big smile breaks out across his face.

               Dunbar stares after the disappearing horse and rider. He 
               feels the weight of the gun and lets it drop to the ground.

               For two or three steps he staggers toward the quarters, but 
               his legs give way and he falls face first in a dead faint.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Wind In His Hair is riding hard and happy. He really fixed 
               that white god. But as he clears the brow of a rise, a 
               riderless horse blows past him, running in the opposite 
               direction.

               Cisco's running back, to the fort at full speed, the lines 
               of two ropes flying behind him.

               The big warrior's smile is gone. He wheels his pony and 
               charges over the rise, nearly colliding with another warrior 
               who has been in hot pursuit of Cisco. The warrior pulls up 
               and looks helplessly at Wind In His Hair. But Wind In His 
               Hair's attention is focused on the rest of his party. The 
               three remaining warriors who rode with him are all on foot. 
               One is bending over a man lying unconscious on the ground. 
               The third is limping badly, trying to catch his horse.

               Wind In His Hair glances back in the direction of the fort, 
               but the buckskin is already gone.

               He starts down the incline to help his friends.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Wind In His Hair and his friends, two of them riding double, 
               are going slowly home when they see a COURIER coming in their 
               direction. They rein in waiting for the young man cantering 
               toward them.

               He speaks directly to Wind In His Hair.

                                     COURIER
                         The party that went against the Pawnee 
                         is coming in...

               Wind In His Hair says nothing.

                                     COURIER
                         There are many hearts on the ground.

               EXT. INDIAN CAMP - DUSK

               Several travois are parked in a clearing. It's a scene of 
               terrible woe. On the travois are dead bodies. Women members 
               of several families are grieving as they collect the dead 
               men.

               Some are shrieking, some are crying softly, and some are 
               beating themselves.

               One group is just beginning to hoist a body off its litter 
               when a strange looking woman appears in the clearing. She's 
               been running. Her light, cherry-colored hair is tangled.

               Her face is creased with pain and disbelief as she rushes 
               forward, crying out in Sioux. She pushes through the other 
               women and tackles the body, taking it to the ground.

               She climbs atop the dead man, cradles his head against her 
               face and says a single word softly.

               It is his name and she whispers it again.

               Of course there is no answer. With each saying of the name 
               she is more desperate, her voice growing louder and louder.

               She arches her back eerily and wails the name to the heavens 
               before flinging herself back at the lifeless face.

               At last the other mourners feel compelled to drag her away. 
               The little woman does not go easily.

               Her name is STANDS WITH A FIST.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - NIGHT

               The lieutenant rides, a silhouette against a harvest moon.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         I realize now that I have been wrong. 
                         All this time I have been waiting. 
                         Waiting for what? For someone to 
                         find me? For Indians to take my horse? 
                         To see a buffalo?

               INT. QUARTERS - NIGHT

               Lieutenant Dunbar has gotten a beautiful shine out of his 
               best boots. He's putting the finishing touches on one of the 
               toes.

               Dunbar places the boot next to its mate and turns to inspect 
               a dress tunic laid out on the bunk. His open journal is lying 
               next to it. He picks at little pieces of lint and brushes at 
               the smudges.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         Since I arrived at this post I have 
                         been walking on eggs. It has become 
                         a bad habit and I am sick of it. 
                         Tomorrow morning I will ride out to 
                         the Indians. I do not know the outcome 
                         or the wisdom of this thinking. But 
                         I have become a target and a target 
                         makes a poor impression. I am through 
                         waiting.

               EXT. CORRAL - DAY

               The buckskin's ears are pricked and his eyes are set. 
               Something has his complete attention.

               The "something" is Lieutenant John Dunbar. He looks like a 
               recruiting poster: full dress uniform, red sash, saber 
               clanking at his side, hair tied in a neat pony tail, knee-
               length riding boots. And all of it is gleaming... from the 
               brass buttons to the gold epaulettes to the army issue belt 
               buckle.

               The red sash flutters and Cisco shies to one side. Dunbar 
               slaps at the sash, calms his horse and jumps on.

               We stop with them at the supply house. Old Glory is standing 
               against one of the crumbling walls. The flag has been affixed 
               to a long willow branch. Dunbar sweeps it up and sticks the 
               staff into one of his boots.

               They start off at a jog, the flag popping in the stiff morning 
               breeze. Just as they are getting small in the distance, Two 
               Socks comes into view.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Lieutenant Dunbar has ridden deep into the prairie. Watching 
               the sky, he takes a drink out of his canteen. The lieutenant 
               hears something, he turns Cisco in that direction. He listens 
               harder. A weird sort of singing. Warily he goes ahead.

               EXT. KNOLL - DAY

               Stands With A Fist is sitting under a solitary cottonwood. 
               Her hands are folded on her lap. A blood-stained knife is 
               held between them. She has ritually slashed her arms. The 
               cuts are not deep -- but all are running with blood. Blood 
               pours from a deep cut in her thigh.

               She lets her song fade to nothing and bows her head. She 
               dabs at a large pool of blood spreading in the ground next 
               to her thigh. Suddenly she's alert. Stands With A Fist has 
               heard something too... a strange popping sound. She turns.

               The gleaming buckskin horse is standing thirty or forty feet 
               behind her on the top of the knoll. A white soldier is sitting 
               on the horse. A white soldier with a sword, a bright uniform 
               and a red sash. And most amazing of all, no face.

               A shift in the breeze has wrapped the popping red, white, 
               and blue flag around his head. One of the soldier's hands is 
               trying to claw it away from his face.

               Dunbar pulls the flag away.

               It's an Indian woman alright. But now that she is staring at 
               him open-mouthed and afraid, he can see that there is 
               something odd about her.

               Too late for further study. She's risen and has taken a slow 
               step backward from the knoll. She's covered with blood.

               Reflexively, he offers a helping hand and calls after her.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Wait...

               She's still backing down the hill, her steps a little faster 
               now. He's following her at a walk.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Wait... you're hurt.

               She's reached the base of the knoll and has begun to run. 
               Dunbar is trotting after her.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Let me help you.

               She's too weak to run and falls face first in the grass. She 
               starts to crawl.

               Dunbar slips off Cisco and reaches down tentatively for her 
               shoulder. She screams at his touch and he pulls away. But he 
               follows on foot as she crawls.

                                     DUNBAR
                         You're hurt... you need help.

               He takes her again, this time holding her firmly. She 
               struggles mightily, twisting onto her back. She lashes out 
               at his face but he grabs her hands, holding them tight. 
               They're nose to nose.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Don't...

               He can't believe he heard it and she can't believe she said 
               it.

               She spits out a Stream of Sioux curses, throws her head back 
               and wails like a wolf. Then she passes out.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               She's lying in the same spot, still unconscious. The cuts on 
               her arms have been bandaged up with strips of Old Glory.

               Modestly, Dunbar lifts her dress to get at the bad thigh 
               wound. As he ties it off, the lieutenant notices how white 
               her skin is. He runs a finger over it. She is very still and 
               he presses an ear to her heart. She's still breathing.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Dunbar is on Cisco. His big impression is gone. The uniform, 
               and his hands and face are smeared with Stands With A Fist's 
               blood. The girl is slung in front of him.

               His arms are holding her. Her face is pressed against his 
               chest. They've come a good distance and are approaching a 
               smokey cloud.

               EXT. PONY HERD - DAY

               Smiles A Lot, Worm and Otter (who now sports a crude splint 
               on his arm) are occupying an open space in the midst of a 
               huge pony herd.

               They should be on guard against enemies but the three boys 
               are sitting on the ground, absorbed in a gambling game.

               EXT. PONY HERD - DAY

               Dunbar is skirting the edge of the herd. Leaving the horses 
               behind him, the lieutenant makes his way up a gentle slope.

               A powerful vision is upon him.

               Ten Bears' village is rising slowly, like a curtain going 
               up. The smoke from many fires, the willow poles fanning 
               against the sky, the conical houses covered with well-used 
               hides, the horses along the river, the children, the women, 
               the men. An ancient tableau, fully alive before his eyes.

               EXT. VILLAGE OUTSKIRTS - DAY

               Dunbar has stopped on the slope leading down to the village, 
               taking it all in. No one has seen him. He can hear human 
               voices drifting up from the camp.

               Stands With A Fist coughs lightly against his tunic and the 
               lieutenant moves Cisco ahead at a walk.

               EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

               A woman and her children have come out of the breaks along 
               the river and are marching back to the village when one of 
               the kids sees him. With an ear-splitting shriek, the woman 
               grabs up her children and runs screaming for the safety of 
               the village.

               There's pandemonium amongst the lodges. Everyone seems to be 
               running everywhere at once.

               Dunbar pulls Cisco to a halt a hundred yards from the first 
               of the conical houses and slides off, taking the girl up in 
               his arms.

               The people of Ten Bear's village, realizing now that there 
               is only one white man and that he is carrying someone, are 
               massing with great curiosity on the outskirts of the town.

               Warriors, some of them mounted, have taken the front ranks. 
               The women and children and elderly are standing just behind.

               Initial panic has given way to a steady buzzing as everyone 
               jockeys for a better look.

               Still holding Stands With A Fist in his arms, Dunbar suddenly 
               stops on a familiar face... Wind In His Hair.

               He lifts the girl resting in his arms and holds her out... 
               as in offering.

                                     DUNBAR
                         She's hurt.

               The Sioux buzz is stronger now. The mounted warriors are 
               getting excited.

               Suddenly, Wind In His Hair breaks ranks and starts for Dunbar 
               at a determined walk. A nasty war club is held tightly in 
               hand.

               Dunbar stands his ground.

               Wind In His Hair halts only a few steps in front of Dunbar. 
               He barks at the intruder as he takes another step or two.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         You are not welcome here.

               Another step and he is close enough to touch the white man.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         Go away from us...

               Dunbar doesn't flinch. And Wind In His Hair's harangue is 
               definitely part bluster. He's very curious about the woman 
               in Dunbar's arms and now he peers down at her face.

               The lieutenant looks down too and in a flash she is torn out 
               of his grasp.

               Holding her in one strong arm, Wind In His Hair backs a pace 
               or two and shouts once more at the lieutenant.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         Go away from us... go now.

               He raises his club and shakes it at Dunbar.

               Though he doesn't understand the words, Dunbar gets the 
               message. As he goes for his horse, Wind In His Hair marches 
               back to his people with Stands With A Fist.

               There is great commotion as the crowd surges in around Wind 
               In His Hair.

               With a look of profound disappointment, Dunbar walks away on 
               Cisco.

               EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

               Otter, Worm and Smiles A Lot are riding in, drawn by the 
               ruckus in the village. They see the white soldier oh his 
               horse leaving the camp. They see the tumult in the village 
               and realize they are in trouble, again.

               Some of the young, mounted warriors are shouting taunts at 
               the departing soldier, calling for him to come back and fight. 
               They seem set to take out after him when Kicking Bird suddenly 
               appears in front of their ponies.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         The soldier did not come to fight -- 
                         he is going away and we will let 
                         him.

               No one is going to argue with one of the band's leading men. 
               The young warriors shout a few more taunts and turn away.

               The medicine man glances after the boys who just came in. 
               Each boy, confronted now by an angry father or uncle, is 
               being jerked off his pony. There's going to be discipline.

               Kicking Bird looks back at the lieutenant.

               Dunbar's head is down and his shoulders are slumped. It is a 
               sight that makes the wheels in Kicking Bird's head turn.

               INT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - NIGHT

               Another council is in progress. As before, the leading men 
               are seated around Ten Bears' fire while the other warriors 
               stand packed in the shadows. Wind In His Hair is seated close 
               to the elders.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         I am in agreement with Kicking Bird. 
                         We will go down and talk to the white 
                         man and find out what kind of white 
                         man he is.

               Wind In His Hair jumps into the conversation.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         If this council decides to talk with 
                         the man at the soldier fort then it 
                         will be so. But in my mind it is not 
                         right that a Sioux chief, a chief as 
                         great as Ten Bears, goes to ask the 
                         business of a puny, trespassing white 
                         man... a white soldier who has only 
                         a smart horse and a few white man 
                         clothes.

               There are many yeses in response to this. As is his custom, 
               Ten Bears lets the outburst subside, seeming unruffled all 
               the while. Casually, he pops a piece of meat into his mouth 
               and begins to chew.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         I will not go... you will go... you 
                         and Kicking Bird. That is all I have 
                         to say.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY

               Dunbar is sitting cross-legged in the grass. His mouth is 
               occupied with chewing. In one hand is a knife, in the other 
               is a chunk of slab bacon. He saws off a slice and extends 
               it, waiting patiently.

               The wolf is sitting only a few feet away. He wants the offered 
               meat but cannot bring himself to eat from a human hand. 
               Finally, Dunbar flips the bacon into the grass and Two Socks 
               pounces on it. He takes his prize toward the river and out 
               of view.

               Dunbar starts for his quarters. He stops. The hair on the 
               back of his neck is standing straight up.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY

               Six Sioux warriors, THE ESCORT, are sitting atop their ponies 
               high on the ridge.

               Dunbar buttons his tunic and casts a quick, backward glance 
               at the quarters. A rifle is standing near the door.

               Dunbar decides not to go after it. He straightens his bearings 
               and he watches the approaching riders. It's only two -- Wind 
               In His Hair and Kicking Bird. The lieutenant bows at the 
               waist.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Welcome...
                              (gesturing at them)
                         Come... please... sit down.

               The two men slide off their ponies. Dunbar throws an 
               unreturned wave to the escort warriors.

               There is a moment or two of silence.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Would you like some coffee? Coffee?

               There is no response.

                                     DUNBAR
                         I'll get some cups.

               Dunbar disappears inside his quarters.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY

               Wind In His Hair and Kicking Bird are sitting comfortably 
               under the awning, each holding steaming army-issue cups. 
               They are staring straight ahead with a curious expression.

               Dunbar is turning a handle on a machine. It is a coffee 
               grinder.

               The last of the beans goes down and Dunbar pauses for dramatic 
               effect. Then he pulls out the drawer containing the fresh 
               grounds and passes it to the medicine man. Kicking Bird and 
               Wind In His Hair both sniff the contents.

               Dunbar gestures at their still full mugs -- neither one of 
               them has taken a drink.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Is the coffee not good? Too strong 
                         maybe? Here...

               Dunbar reaches for a sack by the fire. Holding it in front 
               of him, Dunbar suggests that Wind In His Hair put some of 
               its contents into his mug.

               Wind In His Hair finally does, but his blank expression 
               indicates that he doesn't know what difference this could 
               make.

               Dunbar takes a lick at his fingers, suggesting that Wind In 
               His Hair should do the same. A smile creeps over his face as 
               the universal appeal of sugar is taking hold. Wind In His 
               Hair has licked every bit off each finger.

                                     DUNBAR
                              (to Kicking Bird)
                         Do you want some?

               Wind In His Hair doesn't wait for Kicking Bird's answer. He 
               reaches over and dumps a good amount in Kicking Bird's cup, 
               adding some more to his own for good measure.

                                     DUNBAR
                         So what are you guys doing? Looking 
                         for buffalo?

               There is no response. Wind In His Hair's attention is now on 
               Cisco.

                                     DUNBAR
                         He's a good one... good horse. My 
                         horse.

               Wind In His Hair's interest borders on rude. Prompted by a 
               light tap on his leg from Kicking Bird, Wind In His Hair 
               turns his attention back to Dunbar.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Good horse.

               No argument from Wind In His Hair.

                                     DUNBAR
                         My horse. You see any buffalo?

               Kicking Bird and Wind In His Hair are baffled.

               The lieutenant is trying to jam a wadded blanket under the 
               back of his tunic.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Wait just a bit.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                              (to Kicking Bird)
                         His mind is gone.

               Kicking Bird doesn't respond. He's still intent on the 
               lieutenant. In wedging the blanket under his tunic, Dunbar 
               has become a hunchback. He bends over in a weird attitude, 
               and with a finger peeking over each side of his head, he 
               begins a bizarre display of dancing, punctuated with snorts 
               and bellows.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Buffalo.

                                     DUNBAR
                              (incorrectly in Sioux)
                         Buffalo?

                                     KICKING BIRD
                              (slowly)
                         Buffalo.

                                     DUNBAR
                              (getting it right)
                         Buffalo.

               Kicking Bird nods his assent and Dunbar flashes a pleased 
               smile.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Buffalo.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY

               Dunbar is watching Kicking Bird and Wind In His Hair walk 
               their horses up the ridge to meet the waiting escort. Each 
               horse has a gift of coffee and sugar slung over its withers. 
               Occasionally, Wind In His Hair dips a hand into one of the 
               bags and carefully licks each finger.

               Dunbar waves up at them but there is no response.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         The sugar didn't figure to last at 
                         that rate any way. I don't believe 
                         I'd go too far in saying that a 
                         foundation for good relations is 
                         being laid.

               DISSOLVE INTO:

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         They have come again, as always the 
                         same two with an escort of six.

               Dunbar is standing in the same spot, it is a new day

               Leaving their ever present escort behind, Kicking Bird and 
               Wind In His Hair ride into the fort.

               Kicking Bird's pony is carrying something large and bulky on 
               his withers. A buffalo robe. Dunbar walks up to greet them. 
               Kicking Bird returns the welcome and signs to him as he 
               speaks.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Have you seen any buffalo?

               Dunbar can only shake his head no.

               Kicking Bird accepts this and dismounts.

               Dunbar throws his customary wave but the escort remains 
               noncommittal.

               EXT. HILL - DUSK

               Dunbar is lying on his buffalo robe, his hand runs against 
               the grain of the thick fur. He begins writing in his journal.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         I believe I am dealing with Kiowa 
                         Indians as I have heard that word on 
                         several occasions.

               He rolls on his back, and lays aside the journal, practicing 
               the hand signals.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         I am learning the Kiowa words for 
                         head, hand, horse, fire, coffee, 
                         buffalo, hello and goodbye.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY

               It's raining. High on a hill, the Indian escort waits 
               stoically, horses heads bowed in the drizzle. On the haunches 
               of one of the ponies is a single deer.

               Down below, Wind In His Hair and Kicking Bird are still 
               mounted and converse with Dunbar using sign talk.

                                     DUNBAR
                         No, I haven't seen any buffalo. Are 
                         you hungry? I have food... are you 
                         hungry?

               Dunbar suggests they take some of his supplies but Kicking 
               Bird will not stand for this. He waves Dunbar off. The three 
               men say their goodbyes, and Dunbar as usual throws a wave to 
               the six men on the hill.

               Unexpectedly, one of them returns it and the other five react 
               with surprise.

                                     ESCORT 1
                         He waved.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         Nothing I have been told about these 
                         people is correct. They are not 
                         beggars and thieves. They are not 
                         the bogeymen they have been made out 
                         to be.

               Kicking Bird and Wind In His Hair disappear over the hill, 
               followed by their escort.

               Lightning bursts far out on the prairie.

               INT. QUARTERS - NIGHT

               Dunbar huddles beneath the warmth of his buffalo robe. He is 
               finishing up the second of two drawings. It is a portrait of 
               Wind In His Hair, he carefully titles it "The Fierce One." 
               He has already completed a likeness of Kicking Bird and 
               underneath it the words "The Quiet One."

               EXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY

               Several children are playing close-by as Stands With A Fist 
               works over a staked-out hide, scraping away the excess flesh. 
               Though her arms are lined with scabs her work is methodical 
               and unforced. She seems recovered.

                                     KICKING BIRD (O.S.)
                         Stands With A Fist.

               She looks up to see the medicine man looming over her.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         We will talk awhile.

               INT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY

               Except for Kicking Bird and Stands With A Fist, the tipi is 
               empty. They are just seating themselves at the firepit in 
               the center of the lodge. A brief silence, during which Kicking 
               Bird studies the girl with the bowed head.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Your wounds are healing well?

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Yes.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         You are happy here, with my family?

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         I am glad to be here. I am missing 
                         my husband.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Perhaps you will marry again when 
                         the time is right.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Perhaps.

               Kicking Bird is leading up to something and Stands With A 
               Fist fears it. She keeps her head bowed.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         We have word from many places that 
                         the whites are...

               Kicking Bird stops himself, he knows this must be hard. She 
               brings her green eyes to bear on the medicine man, waiting 
               to hear more.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         They are coming into everyone's 
                         country. They will soon be in ours I 
                         think. This white man who lives at 
                         the old soldier fort, the one who 
                         calls himself loo ten tant... I have 
                         visited him and I believe his heart 
                         is a good one. He knows things about 
                         the whites which we do not.

               He pauses letting this sink in.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         I am afraid of the man at the fort.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         He is only one man.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         I am afraid that he will tell some 
                         whites that I am here. I am afraid 
                         that they will try to take me away.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Every warrior in camp would fight 
                         them if they tried.

               She is not much reassured by this. In the way of a defeatist 
               she lowers her eyes once more.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         I cannot make the white man talk. 
                         Loo ten tant does not know Sioux.

               Kicking Bird waits. Still she does not raise her head.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         You have a certain medicine which no 
                         other Sioux -- man or woman -- has.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         It has been a long time since I made 
                         the talk.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         I do not ask this for myself... I 
                         ask this for all our people.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         It's dead in me.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         I want you to try and remember the 
                         the word.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         I don't know how.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         You don't want to know.

               This outburst shocks Stands With A Fist, she runs out of the 
               lodge.

               EXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY

               Stands With A Fist rushes past BLACK SHAWL, her face covered 
               with tears. Now Kicking Bird comes out. Black Shawl looks at 
               Kicking Bird, his face is not happy.

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         Will she make the white words?

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Perhaps I am asking too much.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               Stands With A Fist is tearing through the thick willows 
               growing alongside the river. She's crying her heart out.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               The big cry is over, but Stands With A Fist is still sniffling 
               as she emerges on a little patch of beach-next to the river. 
               She sits herself down under a cottonwood and looks hollowly 
               at the surface of the water in front of her.

               Somewhere in the distance is the sound of many drums, with a 
               sigh she drops her head.

               Then, as if shocked by some unseen force, her eyes spring 
               open. Wide and unblinking, her eyes stare deeply into space.

               Someone is calling. The voice is so faint at first that the 
               word can't be heard. But the calling grows and suddenly the 
               word is upon her.

                                     VOICE
                         Christine...

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

               A little girl of seven, CHRISTINE, is lying in the grass of 
               a sod roof. Next to her is ten year-old WILLIE. They are 
               planning their wedding and staring up at the sky.

               Like many youngsters she's not eager to heed the persistent 
               call of her mother.

                                     MOTHER (O.S.)
                         Christine... where are you?

               Reluctantly, the little girl gets up and looks over the edge 
               of the roof to see her mother holding yet another child. She 
               seems anxious.

                                     CHRISTINE
                         I'm right here mother...

                                     MOTHER
                         Get inside both of you.

                                     CHRISTINE
                         Why?

                                     MOTHER
                         Just do what I... oh God! Stay where 
                         you are. Keep down do you hear me?

               FOUR PAWNEE are riding up in the background. TWO MEN are 
               moving out to meet them.

                                     CHRISTINE
                         Who is it Willie?

               Willie is peeking over the edge of the roof. An old muzzle-
               loading rifle is by his side. He whispers to her.

                                     WILLIE
                         They look like Pawnee... my father 
                         and your father are talking to them.

               Down in the yard, out beyond a rough table set with the 
               leavings of a Sunday dinner, two white men on foot are talking 
               to the four mounted Pawnee warriors.

               It's an argument. As a baby cries somewhere inside the house 
               the two white men sign the Indians to go away. The Pawnee 
               make no move to go however, and with their patience at an 
               end, the two white men turn back to the house.

               One of the warriors brings his hatchet down and nails a white 
               man between the shoulder blades. The injured man grunts and 
               hops sideways. The other runs for the house but is cut down 
               by arrows.

               Women begin to scream.

               Willie is scooting down the roof, his face white with fear.

                                     WILLIE
                         Run Christine...

                                     CHRISTINE
                         Why?

                                     WILLIE
                         Just run!

               He gives her a hard shove which sends her rolling down the 
               roof.

                                     WILLIE
                         Run!

               Christine runs past the point where the roof meets the natural 
               hillside and down into the draw. She's running toward us. In 
               the background we can see Willie on the edge of the roof, 
               aiming his squirrel gun into the yard. He fires once, then 
               grasping the gun like a club, he leaps off the roof and 
               disappears.

               Christine never looks back. She runs up the draw as fast as 
               her skinny young legs can carry her.

               EXT. HOLE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

               The moon is up. Christine is feebly clawing at the ground, 
               trying to pry herself out of a tiny hole. She gives up. Then, 
               from the burrow's dark entrance comes the thin, cracking 
               voice of a little girl.

                                     CHRISTINE
                         Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray 
                         the lord my soul to keep. If I die 
                         before I wake, I pray the lord my 
                         soul to take.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               Stands With A Fist is still in shock. The drumming in the 
               village is very loud now. She rises unsteadily to her feet 
               and starts back to camp.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - NIGHT

               The moon is full. As we look down on the fort we can hear a 
               new sound coming off the prairie. A light rumbling.

               INT. QUARTERS - NIGHT

               Lieutenant Dunbar is asleep in the moonlight. The rumbling 
               is getting louder. It wakes him. He gropes about, lights the 
               lantern and listens to the strange, powerful sound.

               Something's in the air. He holds the lantern toward the 
               ceiling. Particles of dirt and dust are being shaken from 
               the roof. It's the earth that's trembling.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - NIGHT

               Dressed in only pants and boots, Dunbar walks along the bluff 
               above the river, his lantern held out in front of him. The 
               sound is tremendous now. Dunbar stops as a great wall of 
               dust rises before him.

               At the same time, he realizes something is alive behind the 
               wall of dust, he recognizes the sound... the sound of 
               thousands of hoofbeats.

               He sees one veer out. And now another. And another, darting 
               briefly from the great cloud of dust. The most powerful force 
               on the prairie now seems like the most powerful force on 
               earth as it thunders by.

               The buffalo.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT

               Dunbar and Cisco are running flat out in the moonlight.

               EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - NIGHT

               The village is coming up. A great fire is blazing at the far 
               end. Horse and rider speed past the first lodge.

               It's an important mission for the lieutenant. As he gallops 
               through the village, he says one word over and over, trying 
               to remember the correct pronunciation. It's the Sioux word 
               for buffalo.

               EXT. FIRE - NIGHT

               Everyone has gathered around the great blaze. In the center 
               of the circle close to the fire, the buffalo men are dancing. 
               Others are dancing too. The music is very loud.

               The little buckskin is out of his head with speed. He doesn't 
               answer the bit when Dunbar first tries to pull him up.

               People scatter in all directions, as Dunbar and Cisco charge 
               into their midst.

               Dunbar pulls back with all his might, and the buckskin sits 
               down. He's wet from his long ride, and Dunbar can't stay on 
               his back. As Cisco rears, he slides off and tumbles onto his 
               back.

               Angry warriors pile on top of him. Dunbar shouts out the 
               word for buffalo, yelling it over and over as the warriors 
               pummel him.

               So many men have rushed into the fray that none can deal the 
               lieutenant a decisive blow. They roll about in the dust. 
               Just as Dunbar's cries have begun to lose their strength, he 
               feels a sudden lessening of the weight upon him.

               As the men pile off, Dunbar is left flat on his back. His 
               lip is split and blood is streaming from his nose.

               He's looking into a familiar face. The man's head is covered 
               with the full skin and feathers of an eagle. Kicking Bird.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Buffalo...

               Kicking Bird doesn't understand or can't hear. He brings his 
               face close to Dunbar's.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Buffalo...
                              (making horns with 
                              his fingers)
                         Buffalo.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Buffalo?

                                     DUNBAR
                         Yes. Buffalo.

               Kicking Bird raises up and yells it out to his people.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         The buffalo have come.

               For a fleeting moment there is shocked silence. Then the 
               Sioux explode with excitement.

               Still dazed, Dunbar is pulled to his feet. The people are 
               surging in around him with yelps of joy.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               A wide stretch of prairie, falling away to nothing.

               The buffalo have left a trail in the form of a tremendous 
               swath of torn-up ground, several hundred yards from side to 
               side.

               Indians on horseback move into the picture.

               Most of Ten Bears' camp is moving out in a long, noisy column. 
               Spirits are high. First come the lead scouts, followed by 
               Ten Bears and his advisors, Kicking Bird and wind In His 
               Hair among them. A large body of warriors come next. Behind 
               these men are the women, children and elderly. Dunbar is 
               riding at the head of the last group.

               The attitudes of the people have changed significantly. People 
               who catch his eye are openly smiling at the lieutenant.

               An old woman comes alongside and offers him a piece of dried 
               meat, patting his hand as he takes it.

               Here comes Smiles A Lot, Worm and Otter, all on ponies, 
               galloping up beside him. They want to play.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         Loo ten tant...

               He motions for Dunbar to break ranks and while the lieutenant 
               is puzzling this out, a chorus of cries comes from the 
               column's front.

               Three far-ranging scouts are coming in at a run.

               EXT. COLUMN - DAY

               The scouts pull up in front of Ten Bears to make their report. 
               There's no way to know what's going on but something important 
               is happening.

               Wind In His Hair suddenly breaks ranks and rides back to the 
               main body of warriors. A dozen warriors strip off their shirts 
               and leggings. They're ready in moments. Then, with Wind In 
               His Hair leading them, the party breaks away from the column 
               and rides east at a gallop.

               The column resumes its southward march.

               EXT. COLUMN - DAY

               The day has grown hot as the column continues its march 
               through changing terrain.

               Dunbar is suffering some. The heat and dust are monstrous. 
               At the moment however, he's most concerned with Stands With 
               A Fist. She's riding closeby and he watches her with interest.

               It's easier to see now that she was once white.

               Suddenly she looks in his direction. The lieutenant quickly 
               tips his hat, but she turns her shy eyes away before he has 
               finished the motion.

               Kicking Bird is riding down the line. The medicine man 
               gestures Dunbar forward and the lieutenant guides Cisco out 
               of line.

               Through her tangled hair, Stands With A Fist watches the 
               soldier and the medicine man ride up the line.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Dunbar and Kicking Bird are riding together at the flank of 
               Ten Bears' entourage.

               Far in the distance, the lieutenant sees something strange 
               on the prairie... pink bumps are dotting the landscape up 
               ahead. And black specks are moving about on the bumps.

               EXT. KILLING GROUND - DAY

               Beneath droves of scavenging black birds lies the body of a 
               buffalo. His hide has been peeled off and his tongue has 
               been cut out. The rest of his body has been left to rot in 
               the sun.

               The column, so noisy and happy before, winds its way through 
               the killing ground in silence. There must be twenty-five 
               buffalo like the one we saw close up, all of them stripped 
               and rotting.

               Dunbar looks queasy. The lieutenant glances at the medicine 
               man riding next to him. Kicking Bird looks sick too. Dunbar 
               looks away. The entire column is stretched along the killing 
               ground, looking.

               A naked cow, covered with birds, lies on her side. Her new 
               born calf, doomed to death, cries for his dead mother. And 
               next to the calf, Dunbar sees something else. He sees wagon 
               tracks and the booted footprints of white men.

               EXT. KILLING GROUND - DAY

               The column is clear of the killing ground and heading deeper 
               into the prairie. They have left everything untouched.

               EXT. TEMPORARY CAMP - DAY

               While Kicking Bird's lodge rises behind her, Stands With A 
               Fist digs out a firepit. She looks up from her work.

               Watching bashfully from several yards away is Lieutenant 
               Dunbar. Now that she has seen him he starts forward, perhaps 
               to try some more talk.

                                     KICKING BIRD (O.S.)
                         Loo ten tant...

               Dunbar turns to find Kicking Bird sitting on a pony just 
               behind him. Two dozen mounted BUFFALO SCOUTS are gathered 
               around him. Kicking Bird points at Cisco, indicating that 
               Dunbar should join them.

               Tipping his hat to Stands With A Fist, Dunbar hustles away 
               to his horse.

               Stands With A Fist faces the pit she's digging, not bothering 
               to look up as hoofbeats drum their way out of the temporary 
               camp. She seems to have lost herself in her own hands... the 
               hands that are digging out the soft prairie earth.

               There is crying but when Stands With A Fist looks up there 
               is just one of Kicking Bird's children standing there smiling 
               at her. She goes back to her digging.

               INT. HOLE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

               The first light streaks through the burrow entrance.

               Christine is exerting herself mightily in an effort to move. 
               But she can't and again she begins to cry.

               More sounds from down below in the canyon. Hoofbeats. And a 
               whinny or two. No way to tell whether this is friend or foe. 
               But she can't stay in the burrow.

                                     CHRISTINE
                         Help...

               She listens. The hoofbeats are gone.

                                     CHRISTINE
                              (louder)
                         Help me...
                              (screaming)
                         Please... I need to get out.

               Someone is coming up the slope.

               A moment later, hands are clawing at the walls of the burrow 
               and she is looking into three, surprised Sioux faces. The 
               face in the center is recognizable. A YOUNGER KICKING BIRD.

               EXT. BUFFALO DRAW - DUSK

               Two dozen riderless Indian ponies are tethered at the base 
               of the draw.

               EXT. BUFFALO DRAW - DUSK

               With Kicking Bird and the other buffalo scouts, Lieutenant 
               Dunbar is sneaking up one side of the draw. They all reach 
               the summit together and peer over.

               They are there by the thousands, grazing quietly in the 
               twilight. The buffalo.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT

               The buffalo scouts, Dunbar included, are galloping back to 
               the temporary camp. It looms ahead of them, the hide-covered 
               lodges glowing like candles in the last light of day. A big 
               fire is blazing in the center of camp.

               Dunbar hangs back as the other riders go into the noisy camp. 
               A special event of some kind is taking place. As he looks 
               this scene over, Dunbar sees something remarkable.

               Back in the shadows, behind the fire, is a wagon.

               Dunbar and Cisco pace back and forth on the fringes of the 
               camp. The lieutenant searches for any sign of the white people 
               who came in the wagon, but finding none, he focuses on the 
               dancers moving in a circle around the big fire.

               One of the men waving his lance is Wind In His Hair. Dunbar's 
               eyes track up the lance and there he finds the white people. 
               Hanging from Wind In His Hair's lance tip is a fresh scalp, 
               blonde and wavy. Several of the other men have scalps too. 
               None of the hair is Indian.

               Dunbar can see into the wagonbed now. A couple of dozen fresh 
               buffalo hides are stacked in the wagonbed. It's all come 
               clear. The white men who killed the buffalo for hides and 
               tongues have themselves been killed.

               Dunbar slowly retreats into the shadows.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT

               Cisco has been hobbled nearby, and with the temporary camp 
               glowing on the plains a half-mile away, Dunbar spreads his 
               blanket on the open plain.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAWN

               A huddled body lies covered by the army issue blanket. A 
               moccasined foot comes into view and prods the blanketed shape. 
               Lieutenant Dunbar's waking face pops out of the blanket.

               Standing over him is Wind In His Hair, stripped of all but 
               his breechclout. The barrel of his rifle is hanging downward, 
               swaying in front of the lieutenant's face.

               It is occurring to the lieutenant that his time may have run 
               out.

               The warrior swings his rifle into a shooting position, sights 
               after some imaginary game and imitates the rifle's recoil.

               He stares down at Dunbar with a smile, lifts his rifle 
               overhead and barks out a cry of victory.

               EXT. TEMPORARY CAMP - DAY

               The band's best hunters, two dozen of them, are making ready 
               to chase the buffalo. It's the big time, no event is more 
               important. The villagers -- mostly women, children, and 
               elderly -- have gathered around each of the hunters.

               The largest audience has gathered around Lieutenant Dunbar 
               and Wind In His Hair. Wind In His Hair's pony is ready. Great 
               bolts of yellow lightning adorn his shoulders and rump. Right 
               now the warrior is drawing the same design along Cisco's 
               rump.

               Dunbar reads this correctly as a great honor and stands by 
               silently. Wind In His Hair is finished. He looks at Dunbar 
               and nods at the paint as if asking for a response.

                                     DUNBAR
                         I wish I knew what to say.

               A Sioux voice, using english words, sails out of the circle 
               of watchers.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Say... thank you.

               Startled the men turn to the sound. The other Sioux are 
               stunned too.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                              (indicating the paint)
                         His speed... his power... you have.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Thank you.

               He takes the warrior's hand in his own and shakes it crisply.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               It's the first time we've seen the buffalo up close. They're 
               fantastic creatures, powerful, brutish, untameable animals 
               from another age. A great bull turns away from the others 
               and lifts his purple, horned head to sniff the breeze. He 
               can detect no sign of trouble and eventually returns to his 
               browsing.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               The hunters are advancing across the prairie, spreading out 
               in a formation that will encircle part of the herd.

               The lightning bolts on Wind In His Hair's pony are in motion. 
               Cisco's bolts are moving too.

               There's a lump in Dunbar's throat. He knows nothing of what 
               is expected of him but he's doing it anyway. He glances to -- 
               his right at Wind In His Hair and to his left at Kicking 
               Bird. They're both concentrated on what lies ahead.

               From the corner of his eye, he sees Kicking Bird look back. 
               The lieutenant looks too.

               It's a minor flap. Three or four youngsters, eager to 
               distinguish themselves have trailed too close to the hunters 
               and are being turned back. Dunbar recognizes one of them as 
               the boy who took charge of Cisco at the village... Smiles A 
               Lot.

               Like Kicking Bird, Dunbar swings his face back to the front. 
               They're close enough now to hear the low bellowing of the 
               herd.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               A strike far up on the horned formation. Their ponies leap 
               forward. The mad dash is on.

               Dunbar's hat flies off at first spurt and now the lieutenant 
               and his horse are hurling over the prairie. The little 
               buckskin seems to know what is expected of him and has put 
               every ounce of his muscle to speed. They're burning up the 
               ground.

               When Dunbar looks back over his shoulder, he's shocked to 
               find that the best buffalo ponies the Sioux's have are far 
               behind. He and Cisco are on their own.

               The herd is in full flight and the sound of their stampede 
               is overwhelming. The buffalo are very fast but Cisco is 
               gaining with every stride. They've formed a great running 
               wall in front of him and now Dunbar can see their rumps and 
               tails and flying hooves.

               Dunbar takes a solid grip on his rifle and shuts his eyes as 
               if in prayer. The sound of thousands of hooves is deafening.

               Dunbar and Cisco have caught the buffalo. A few more strides 
               and they'll be in.

               Dunbar and Cisco are running with the buffalo. A shaggy head 
               moves in and swipes at Cisco, but the little horse is too 
               quick and too smart. He dodges away, nearly dumping the 
               lieutenant in the process.

               Dunbar rights himself and fires. It's a wild shot, only 
               grazing the buffalo's shoulder. The report of the gun 
               instantly scatters the herd and Dunbar pulls up, dust swirling 
               all around him.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Sioux hunters stream past him, every man for himself zeroing 
               in on targets.

               Dunbar starts to dismount but something he sees stops him.

               A hundred yards away a small hunter is after a handful of 
               buffalo who have splintered off from the rest. It's Smiles A 
               Lot, trying to make a kill of his own. As Dunbar watches, 
               the boy's inexperienced horse shies away and bucks, pitching 
               the kid to the ground.

               A big bull breaks away from the splinter group, lowers his 
               head and charges.

               Dunbar kicks Cisco into a run, spits a spare bullet from his 
               mouth and rams it into the chamber.

               Smiles A Lot is picking himself off the ground. The bull is 
               in full charge.

               Dunbar is riding with his knees. Both hands are holding the 
               rifle. He'll never make it to the boy in time. He's got to 
               make the shot. He squeezes the trigger.

               The bullet plows home, exploding the bull's heart. The big 
               buffalo's legs collapse but the momentum of his charge puts 
               him into a skid. He comes to rest only a few yards away from 
               Smiles A Lot.

               The boy stands as the lieutenant rides up. Smiles A Lot is 
               dazed but he's okay.

               Dunbar hops off next to the dead buffalo. He's a huge one, a 
               real grandfather and the lieutenant loses himself for a few 
               moments in contemplation of this tremendous kill. Now he 
               looks back to check the boy.

               Smiles A Lot has caught his pony and is racing away from the 
               scene of his humiliation.

               The sounds of approaching riders turns Dunbar's attention in 
               a different direction.

               The entire village is streaming onto the plains for the 
               butchering.

               The riders bearing down on him are being lead by Wind In His 
               Hair.

               Wind In His Hair jumps off his pony and, smiling broadly, 
               slaps Dunbar's back with a good-natured blow of 
               congratulations.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               The buffalo has been split open and Wind In His Hair, kneeling 
               at the bull's side, is feeling around in the cavity. He finds 
               what he's looking for and gives it a jerk.

               It's the liver, still warm and steaming. He offers it to 
               Dunbar but the lieutenant, not having the faintest idea, 
               only looks at it blankly.

               A sizable crowd has gathered to watch this ritual.

               Wind In His Hair sticks the fresh liver in his mouth and 
               happily bites off a chunk, letting the juices run from the 
               edges of his mouth. Now he figures the lieutenant knows what 
               to do, and hands the liver back to him.

               Dunbar doesn't want to do this, but with the pressure of so 
               many eyes and so much good will, he has little choice. 
               Tentatively, he bites off a small piece and chews it 
               thoughtfully. It's good.

               Encouraged by this good taste, Dunbar takes a man-sized bite. 
               Shrill Sioux voices rise all around him as they cheer the 
               lieutenant. Dunbar holds the liver triumphantly over his 
               head.

               EXT. KILLING GROUND - DAY

               Little butchering parties cluster around each fallen buffalo.

               EXT. TEMPORARY CAMP - NIGHT

               Flame begins to lick at each of the bodies and we match 
               dissolve -- the clusters of people have become groups 
               surrounding fires at the temporary camp.

               EXT. FEASTING FIRE - NIGHT

               All over camp people are crowding around fires, feasting on 
               fresh meat. Children are playing everywhere, the dogs are 
               having a field day with scraps and the voices of the people 
               are happy.

               At a little distance, we see Lieutenant Dunbar and Wind In 
               His Hair excusing themselves from one of the fires. They 
               start toward us. Wind In His Hair is sucking on a rib bone 
               and seems to show no sign of slowing down his celebrating. 
               Dunbar, following a couple paces behind, is a different story. 
               He's had it. He spreads his hands to indicate an over-sized 
               belly.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Look I'm full... I can't tell the 
                         story again.

               Wind In His Hair doesn't seem to hear. He points at the 
               epaulettes on Dunbar's tunic.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Go ahead.

               Wind In His Hair reaches out and fingers the gold lieutenant's 
               bars. He fingers a couple of the brass buttons as well. The 
               tunic is something he obviously puts much store in.

                                     DUNBAR
                              (signing)
                         You want to try... put it on.

               He unbuttons the tunic.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Here.

               He sloughs off the tunic and hands it over. Wind In His Hair 
               slips out of the magnificent bone-pipe breastplate he's 
               wearing and gives it to Dunbar as he wriggles into the tunic. 
               The fit is too tight, the material too scratchy but those 
               things are of little consequence to Wind In His Hair. He 
               loves the tunic.

               With urging signs he asks the lieutenant to put on the 
               breastplate. Dunbar slips it over his head and Wind In His 
               Hair helps him with the ties.

               Now it's the lieutenant's turn to be amazed. The breastplate 
               as craftsmanship at its finest. He runs his fingers over the 
               ridges of bone now covering him from neck to waist. He looks 
               up at Wind In His Hair.

               The warrior nods approvingly, as though a good deal has heen 
               struck.

                                     DUNBAR
                         This is too much... I can't take 
                         this...

               But for Wind In His Hair it is already a trade.

               Wind In His Hair spots the next fireside and veers toward 
               it. Dunbar holds him back.

                                     DUNBAR
                         I can't... No more...

               Wind In His Hair grins. He holds up a single finger.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         One more... eat...

                                     DUNBAR
                         I can't, I'm full... very full...

               Still holding up the finger, he guides Dunbar into the 
               firelight of the next party.

               Immediately, men jump up to greet the celebrities. Women 
               begin to saw off more meat.

               EXT. FEASTING FIRE - NIGHT

               As Dunbar gnaws on a rib, he glances at the friendly faces 
               around the fire. His eyes suddenly stop their roving.

               A BIG WARRIOR is wearing the military hat he lost on the 
               hunt. It's a little too big. The brim touches the top of the 
               big warrior's ears.

               Now the Big Warrior notices that Dunbar is staring at him. 
               Their eyes meet.

                                     DUNBAR
                         That's my hat.

               At the sound of these words the cheerful talk around the 
               fire begins to fade.

               Dunbar touches the top of his head and points to his hat.

                                     DUNBAR
                         My hat.

                                     BIG WARRIOR
                         I found it on the prairie. It's mine.

               A silence falls between the two men. wind In His Hair speaks.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         That hat belongs to my friend here.

                                     BIG WARRIOR
                         He left it on the prairie. He didn't 
                         want it.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         You can see that he wants it now.

               The Big Warrior shakes his head. He won't budge.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         We all know that is a soldier hat. 
                         We all know who wears it. If you 
                         want to keep it that's alright. But 
                         give something for it.

               The other men around the fire murmur their assent. The Big 
               Warrior thinks for a moment then abruptly gets to his feet.

               He looks at his waist and unfastens a knife in a beautiful 
               worked scabbard. He tosses it across to Dunbar.

               The lieutenant examines the trade item a moment. Now he looks 
               back at the big warrior. A smile breaks slowly across his 
               face and Dunbar nods. At last he smiles back. It's a trade.

               And at that, the cheerful voices around the fire are at it 
               again.

               Dunbar takes his new knife out and as he watches the light 
               flicker off the blade a voice comes into his ear.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                              (pointing to his head)
                         Good trade.

               Dunbar looks into his smiling face. He laughs.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Yes, it's good. But, I have to sleep.

               He excuses himself and walks away from the light of the fire, 
               finds himself alone in the shadows, still marveling at his 
               breastplate.

               EXT. TEMPORARY CAMP - NIGHT

               Wind In His Hair finishes sucking on the rib bone and tosses 
               it to a dog that's been trailing him. Kicking Bird is walking 
               toward him. He notices the new tunic and gives wind In His 
               Hair a dubious look.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Where is loo ten tant?

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         I ate him.

               Kicking Bird reaches out and feels the strange material on 
               either side of Wind In His Hair's chest.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         I traded for it.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Does it scratch the skin?

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         A little. But do you see how good it 
                         looks. Everyone says it looks good. 
                         Everyone.

               EXT. TEMPORARY CAMP - NIGHT

               Dunbar keeps to the shadows as he makes his way through camp. 
               Now he slows his step.

               Light from another fire is spilling into his path. There's 
               music too. And singing. The voices are high and feminine.

               Dunbar peers around a lodge. A group of young women are 
               dancing in a clockwise circle. Their steps are light-hearted. 
               This is dancing purely for the fun of it.

               One of the young women spots him standing behind the lodge 
               and there's a wave of shy giggling as news of "loo ten tant's" 
               presence is passed along. Embarrassed, Dunbar starts along 
               the fringe of the fires, nodding politely to the women as he 
               goes.

               One has more courage than the others. She breaks out, takes 
               his hand and steers him gently into the dance circle. Whatever 
               resistance he might have is buried by the girl's insistent 
               encouragement. She keeps showing him the step and the 
               lieutenant tries to pick it up.

               The movement is simple and the music is mesmerizing. Awkward 
               at first, Dunbar quickly gets the hang of it. In short order, 
               he's keeping up with the others. And he's enjoying himself.

               Soon he has relaxed enough to shut his eyes, carried along 
               by the eternal sound of the drums. He doesn't notice that 
               the circle has begun to shrink. There is a touch of the devil 
               in their eyes.

               He bumps into somebody and the woman behind bumps into him. 
               But the girls just laugh and so does Dunbar. It was a pleasant 
               accident. But quickly there's another accident. And then all 
               their bodies are squeezing against his. The girls are 
               murmuring good things to him. Their hands are touching him 
               everywhere.

               It's okay with Dunbar. Everybody's having a good time. The 
               drumming suddenly stops however, and the women scatter away 
               from the fire, leaving Dunbar suddenly alone. Kicking Bird 
               is standing not far off.

                                     DUNBAR
                         They asked me to dance...

               The medicine man says nothing.

                                     DUNBAR
                         I was just dancing...

               The lieutenant does a step or two, trying to explain. Finally, 
               that strange half-smile appears on Kicking Bird's face.

               EXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - NIGHT

               Stands With A Fist has been watching everything from the 
               tipi flap. Now she ducks back inside.

               INT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - NIGHT

               The fire is still burning in the center of the lodge. Dunbar 
               is sleeping soundly.

               It's not a moment later that we hear the soft sounds of 
               mumbling somewhere in the lodge. Then it's quiet. There's 
               that mumbling again. And now a woman's giggle.

               Dunbar stirs, waking and curious, sits up a little and looks 
               across the fire. There is movement on Kicking Bird's platform. 
               The medicine man's head and that of his wife come into view 
               for a second or two before they sink back down into shadow. 
               The movements and sound that follow become more forceful. 
               They're having sex.

               Embarrassed, the lieutenant averts his eyes, they happen 
               over the forms of Kicking Bird's deeply sleeping children, 
               the low-burning fire, and settle on Stands With A Fist's 
               back.

               Lieutenant Dunbar, the sounds of lovemaking floating over 
               him, peers again in that direction only to meet the smiling 
               eyes of Kicking Bird and his wife.

               Embarrassed again, he stares open-eyed at the ceiling. He 
               looks like a man who knows something is happening but doesn't 
               know what it is.

               Stands With A Fist's eyes are open too. She doesn't move.

               EXT. VILLAGE - DAWN

               The faintest seam of light is starting to glow on the eastern 
               horizon.

               EXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAWN

               The camera pans off the tipi to the eastern horizon.

               It's the pony herd. And Dunbar is walking in that direction. 
               His feet leave a trail in the wet grass.

               First one, then two, then whole groups of ponies lift their 
               heads and prick their ears at Dunbar's approach.

               Dunbar walks to the edge of this great sea of horses, he 
               stops and gives a long whistle.

               A figure, previously unseen, sits up on the back of a pony. 
               It's Smiles A Lot. He and Dunbar glance blankly at each other. 
               But in a moment, both are distracted by movement in the herd.

               Horses are being gently eased out of the way by Cisco who is 
               answering Dunbar's call. A moment later and they are reunited 
               at the edge of the herd.

               Grasping a hunk of Cisco's mane, Dunbar starts to lead him 
               back to the village. The temporary camp is starting to come 
               to life. And with Cisco at his side, Dunbar pauses to take 
               in the scene.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DUSK

               An escort of six warriors is galloping up the bluff to join 
               the rest of the column as they make their way back to camp. 
               Dunbar looks on, a travois of meat next to him and gives a 
               last wave.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         To stay any longer would've been 
                         useless. We had all the meat we could 
                         possibly carry. We had hunted for 
                         three days, losing half a dozen ponies 
                         and only three men injured. Many 
                         times I have felt alone but until 
                         this afternoon, I have never felt 
                         completely lonely.

               INT. QUARTERS - DAY

               The person we see from the waist up bears little resemblance 
               to the Lieutenant Dunbar we've known.

               His long hair hides his face on his slightly bent head. His 
               skin is not so white anymore, and the great bone-pipe 
               breastplate covers his torso.

               Dunbar starts to write and stops, he repeats this action. It 
               is clear that as Lieutenant Dunbar, he can find nothing to 
               say. He lays the pen down momentarily.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         Made a long patrol today. There is 
                         nothing to report. The truth is I am 
                         bored.

               There is the scurry of movement and the scratch of tiny paws. 
               His eyes roam to the place in the corner where sacks of flour 
               and hard biscuits and other provisions are stored. Watching 
               the sacks more closely, he sees that they are infested with 
               mice.

               Restlessly, he walks to the doorway, gazing out onto the old 
               fort. The awning is beginning to tear at the corner. And 
               then he spots something.

               EXT. QUARTERS - DAY

               A large prairie chicken is lying in front of the quarters. 
               Dunbar squats next to it. It's neck carries punctures, and 
               when he dabs a finger on the wounds, he finds that the blood 
               is still wet. The lieutenant rises slowly, his sharp eyes 
               sweeping the fort.

               He's waiting patiently in his usual spot on the bluff 
               overlooking the river. Two Socks.

               Dunbar smiles and shakes his head. Watching his old friend, 
               he picks up the bird and begins to pluck with an ease that 
               suggests he's had some experience.

               EXT. QUARTERS - NIGHT

               Dunbar is gnawing happily at the last of the bird, still on 
               its skewer. After a couple of bites, he slips the carcass 
               off the stick and chucks it out to Two Socks. He licks his 
               fingers and gazes out into the night.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         Though only two days it seems like a 
                         week. I am missing the company of my 
                         new friends. I can see all of their 
                         faces, but somehow it is not enough. 
                         Tomorrow, I will make an unannounced 
                         visit. After all, they are my 
                         neighbors, what can it hurt?

               EXT. BLUFF - NIGHT

               Two Socks has taken his dinner and retreated to the shadows. 
               He munches contentedly until a strange sound jolts him to 
               attention.

               At the fort is an odd sight. Dunbar is dancing around the 
               fire, occasionally singing out an energetic whoop.

               Two Socks is caught up in the scene and lets out a howl of 
               his own. It could be the stone age.

               EXT. BLUFF - NIGHT

               The silhouettes of three Indians are watching the strange 
               performance below. One of them is Wind In His Hair. Down 
               below Dunbar continues to dance.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               There is nothing for miles.

               Cisco and Dunbar are walking toward us. His boots are pretty 
               worn and his striped trousers have faded to almost nothing. 
               The breastplate shines in the sun. His rifle lies in the 
               crook of his arm, Indian style.

               Dunbar twists around on Cisco and looks back across the 
               prairie. He calls out.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Go home.

               Dunbar watches a moment to see if he's done any good, then 
               turns forward with a sour look.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Damn him.

               Dunbar makes his way through a small, grassy valley borders 
               by rolling slopes. He looks across the prairie. Two Socks is 
               about fifty yards out, trotting parallel to Cisco and Dunbar.

               Exasperated Dunbar pulls Cisco up and slides off. Two Socks 
               sits, waiting and watching.

               EXT. BLUFF - DAY

               Far down in the valley the figure of Lieutenant Dunbar is 
               striding through the grass. He looks angry. When he's within 
               a few feet of Two Socks, Dunbar waves his arms and stamps a 
               foot Two Socks scurries to one side but doesn't go far.

                                     DUNBAR
                         C'mon Two Socks... you can't go... 
                         so go home.

               Dunbar repeats his shooing motion and the wolf hops a few 
               feet.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Alright then, don't go home. But 
                         stay... stay right here.

               Dunbar turns away and as he does a long, low and mournful 
               howl swells behind him. He looks back. Two Socks muzzle is 
               high in the air and one eye is trained on Dunbar hoping for 
               a good reaction.

               Like an angry father who's had too much, Dunbar charges Two 
               Sock with a roar.

                                     DUNBAR
                         You go home.

               The wolf races away this time and Dunbar immediately runs 
               for Cisco, hoping to reach his horse and ditch Two Socks. 
               But he's running long before the wolf comes bouncing 
               alongside. Dunbar weaves out at him, startling Two Socks. He 
               sidles away but as he does the lieutenant reaches out and 
               gives the base of his tail a good hard squeeze.

               It might as well be a firecracker. Tow Socks gives a yelp 
               and shoots off with his tail tucked. Dunbar laughs out loud. 
               He watches until the wolf has gone a fair distance without 
               sign of slowing down.

               Then still chuckling to himself, he turns once again and 
               starts for Cisco at a trot. But moments later, something 
               grabs at one of his ankles, the lieutenant's legs tangle and 
               he goes down face first into the grass.

               Dunbar's lying on his belly. Not knowing what hit him, he 
               rolls onto his side for a closer look. There's Two Socks, 
               sitting in the grass a few feet back. Dunbar sits up cross-
               legged and smiles at his old friend.

               Two Socks catches something suddenly, perhaps from a shift 
               in the wind, and starts to slink away. Dunbar peers over the 
               grass up at the bluff. It's Stone Calf, Kicking Bird and 
               Wind In His Hair.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               The Indian entourage is riding slowly toward Lieutenant 
               Dunbar. Stone Calf is at Kicking Bird's side.

                                     STONE CALF
                         You were right about loo ten tant -- 
                         he is a special white man.

               Kicking Bird watches Dunbar as he replies.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Yes, he is special... he should have 
                         a real name.

               EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY

               Lieutenant Dunbar's arrival this day is different from the 
               ones which have gone before.

               Young mounted warriors have ridden out to swarm around him, 
               but they're full of good cheer reserved for a special friend. 
               There's much backslapping and a few of them lean in to shake 
               hands as they have seen him do.

               But some of the men have chosen to remain in front of their 
               lodges. Their expressionless faces anything but friendly. 
               None of this is lost on Wind In His Hair. He has the look of 
               a secret service man watching a president, as the parade 
               moves through the village.

               EXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY

               The escorts dismount and so does the lieutenant. Smiles A 
               Lot suddenly comes forward and grasps Cisco's reins. There's 
               a brief tug of war. But before it gets out of hand, Kicking 
               Bird is reassuring Dunbar with calm words and a smile, with 
               the lieutenant watching, the boy takes Cisco's muzzle between 
               his hands and blows breath into each nostril. He too gives 
               Dunbar a reassuring smile.

               In the next moment, the lieutenant finds himself being gently 
               pushed into Kicking Bird's lodge.

               As Kicking Bird is about to duck in behind him, a hand on 
               his arm stops him. It is Wind In His Hair and his tone is 
               strong with friendly advice.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         Not everyone thinks it is a good 
                         idea that he is here.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         I know.

               Wind In His Hair turns to the people that have gathered about.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         Kicking Bird has business with the 
                         white man. Let him do it.

               INT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY

               Kicking Bird's pipe is a beautiful piece of work. It's being 
               smoked.

               Kicking Bird puffs away a few times and hands the pipe to 
               Dunbar. The lieutenant, aware that the pipe is something 
               special, handles it with care.

               He looks to Kicking Bird for guidance as he puts his mouth 
               to the tip. The medicine man reassures him with a wave of 
               the hand and Dunbar begins to puff.

               Dunbar coughs lightly at the harsh tobacco but he smokes 
               well, watching the bowl pulse with life at each puff.

               He stops now and lowers the pipe. He stares down. The pipe 
               seems almost alive as it lays in his hands.

               Dunbar hands the pipe back, and as Kicking Bird takes it he 
               hears the light tinkling of bells.

               Dunbar hears it too. As he looks toward the sound, a shadow 
               falls across the arbor's entrance.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         We were waiting for you.

               Stands With A Fist ducks through the arbor's entrance and 
               seats herself between Dunbar and Kicking Bird.

               Stands With A Fist is wearing a band of bells around one 
               ankle. She has a pair of simple but pretty moccasins on her 
               feet. Her dress is old but well-cared for. Animal teeth are 
               sewn along her bodice. On her wrist is a solid brass bracelet. 
               Her hair is tied back loosely with a bret, accenting the 
               feminine in her face.

               Her whiteness seems to show more than ever. But it is not 
               dominant. The Sioux is dominant.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                              (to Dunbar)
                         Welcome. It is good that you are 
                         here.

               Kicking Bird looks to Stands With A Fist. She takes her time 
               and the words are accented but they are close enough.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Hullo. You here... good.

               The words are sweet music to the lieutenant. He replies with 
               a feeling of great relief.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Thank you... I feel good.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                              (to Kicking Bird)
                         He thanks you. It is good.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Ask him why he is at the soldier 
                         fort.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                              (to Dunbar)
                         Uhh... you... come...

               Dunbar jumps in. There are things he wants to know, has waited 
               a long time to know.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Wait... what is your name?

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Our... names?

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         What does he say?

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         He wants to know how we are called.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Ahhh... He's right. I'm sorry.

               The medicine man nods agreeably. He smiles at Dunbar, quite 
               right, introductions should come first.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         He... he... Kick...

                                     DUNBAR
                         Kick?

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         More.

               She kicks at the ground with the toe of her moccasin. Dunbar 
               doesn't get it. She kicks a little harder.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Kicking?

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Kicking... yes... Kicking... Bird.

                                     DUNBAR
                              (to Kicking Bird)
                         Kicking Bird...
                              (to Stands With A 
                              Fist)
                         What does he... is he a chief?

               Stands With A Fist has the word but it takes a few seconds 
               to make it come out of her mouth.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Hul... hal... ho-lee... holy... holy 
                         man.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Oh...
                              (glancing at Kicking 
                              Bird)

               A brief silence. Kicking Bird seems ready to speak but Dunbar 
               is too quick.

                                     DUNBAR
                              (to Stands With A 
                              Fist)
                         Your name... you.

               She thinks. It's hard. She smiles thinly.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         I don't know.

               An idea comes to her. She stands up quickly.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Up? Get up?

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         No.

               She repeats the movement again.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Stand.

               Her smile is a little wider this time.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Yes... Stands.

               Dunbar starts to speak but she cuts him off.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         More...
                              (thinking)
                         Wiff...
                              (quickly)
                         With.

               She draw something in the dirt. It's an "A".

                                     DUNBAR
                         Stands With A...

               Now she makes a fist and holds it close to Dunbar's face.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Fist?

               She nods.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Stands With A Fist. I'm John... John 
                         Dunbar.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         John Dunbar.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Yes.

               EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

               Kicking Bird and Dunbar are strolling through camp engaged 
               in a real conversation, Stands With A Fist is just behind 
               them.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         I try to answer all of Kicking Bird's 
                         questions but I know he is frustrated 
                         with me. He always wants to know how 
                         many more white people are coming. I 
                         tell him that it is impossible for 
                         me to say. When he persists I tell 
                         him that the white people will most 
                         likely pass through this country and 
                         nothing more.

               Kicking Bird and Stands With A Fist are walking away from 
               Dunbar, who takes a few steps in the opposite direction before 
               pausing. Toward the end of the following speech he glances 
               back at them and Stands With A Fist glances back at him.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         But I am speaking to him in half-
                         truths. One day there will be too 
                         many, but I cannot bring myself to 
                         tell him that. I am sure that Stands 
                         With A Fist knows.

               INT. DUNBAR'S LODGE - NIGHT

               His surroundings are completely Indian, Dunbar is cleaning 
               the big navy revolver.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         A war party is going against the 
                         Pawnee soon and I have asked to go. 
                         I sensed that I have made a mistake 
                         in doing so but I could not bring 
                         myself to take it back. They are my 
                         friends and from what little I gather 
                         the Pawnee have been very hard on 
                         these people. I hope I have not 
                         overstepped my bounds.

               The lodge flap rustles and in comes Stands With A Fist and 
               Kicking Bird. Dunbar stands to greet them.

                                     DUNBAR
                         I'm glad to see you... please sit.

               Kicking Bird speaks and Stands With A Fist translates.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                              (translating)
                         Kicking Bird wants to know why you 
                         want to make war on the Pawnee. They 
                         have done nothing to you.

                                     DUNBAR
                         They are Sioux enemies.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                              (translating)
                         Only Sioux warriors will go.

                                     DUNBAR
                         I asked that he would think about my 
                         going.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         He has.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Then tell him this. I have been a 
                         warrior for longer than many of the 
                         young men that will go on this war 
                         party. Tell him.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                              (translating)
                         He says that the Sioux way of being 
                         a warrior is not the white way. You 
                         are not ready.

                                     DUNBAR
                         I know, I understand. But I cannot 
                         learn these ways in camp.

               She translates this to Kicking Bird. The medicine man 
               hesitates then speaks once more.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         He asks that you watch over his family 
                         while he is gone.

               Dunbar looks to Kicking Bird then to Stands With A Fist unable 
               to mask his disappointment.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                              (on her own)
                         This thing he asks you... it is a 
                         great honor for you.

               Dunbar thinks a moment longer and speaks directly to Kicking 
               Bird.

                                     DUNBAR
                         I will be happy to watch over your 
                         family.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                              (translating)
                         He thanks Dances With Wolves for 
                         coming.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Who is Dances With Wolves?

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         It is the name which everyone is 
                         calling you now.

               He thinks and remembers the night with Two Socks.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Dances With Wolves... that's right.
                              (to Stands With A 
                              Fist)
                         How do you say it?

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                              (in Sioux)
                         Dances With Wolves.

                                     DUNBAR
                              (in Sioux to Kicking 
                              Bird)
                         Dances With Wolves.

               The medicine man smiles.

               EXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAWN

               Black Shawl is hurrying out of the lodge with her husband's 
               bow and arrows.

               A war party of twenty warriors is mounted and everyone except 
               sleeping children is out to say goodbye.

               Stands With A Fist is helping to load Kicking Bird's horse 
               with last minute preparations. Out of the tipi comes Kicking 
               Bird's eldest child. He is sleepy but almost on the verge of 
               tears as he knows what is happening.

               Kicking Bird picks up the boy. What is said is between father 
               and son. And it is just a look.

               He hands the child to Stands With A Fist, and pauses to speak 
               with his wife. She comes close to tears but there will be no 
               crying. None from Kicking Bird either. He steps back to his 
               horse.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                              (to Stands With A 
                              Fist)
                         Keep on with the white man talk if 
                         it pleases you.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         I like to make the white man talk.

               Dances With Wolves is standing alone in front of his lodge. 
               Wind In His Hair is riding past. He reaches down and shakes 
               Dances With Wolves' hand. The big warrior smiles.

               Dances With Wolves watches the warriors go by, but his eyes 
               begin to wander. He's looking for someone among the faces of 
               the women. Who ever it is, he can't find her.

               INT. ARBOR - DAY

               Dances With Wolves sits alone in the arbor. He's fidgety. 
               Now he hears a light tinkling of bells, the sounds he's been 
               waiting to hear.

               Her feet appear in the doorway.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST (O.S.)
                         Dances With Wolves?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I'm here.

               EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

               Dances with Wolves and Stands With A Fist are walking through 
               the village, talking and pointing things out to each other.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                              (slowly in english)
                         Grass grows on the prairie.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                              (not sure in Sioux)
                         Fire lives on the prairie.

               Stands With A Fist chuckles but politely checks herself.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Wrong.

               She smiles and tries again.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                              (in english)
                         That man is a fighter.

               He really wants to get one right on the first try. His brows 
               come together as he concentrates.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Again.

               He listens hard.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         That man is a fighter.

               Dances With Wolves thinks some more. When he speaks it is 
               with quiet confidence.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                              (in english)
                         Alright... I have it...
                              (in Sioux)
                         That man...

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Yes...

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Is...

               Dances With Wolves' eyes get big. He leans forward for 
               emphasis his whole face lit with the joy of having the right 
               answer.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         A... bone!

               Stands With A Fist doubles up and falls onto her side, 
               laughing all the way.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         A bone... right?

               Stands With A Fist doesn't really hear. She's rocking back 
               and forth on the floor of the arbor, laughing so hard that 
               her eyes are tearing.

               Her laughter subsides to an occasional chuckle but Dances 
               With Wolves is quiet. He gazes at her face.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         What is the word for beautiful?

               Stands With A Fist hesitates in her answer, meeting his gaze. 
               A little boy pokes his head in.

                                     LITTLE BOY
                         What are you doing here?

               The moment is broken. Stands With A Fist brings herself to 
               respond.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         It is hot. We are sitting in the 
                         shade.

               This makes so much sense to the little boy that he trots in 
               and flings himself on Stands With a Fist's lap. Then a squirm 
               or two.

                                     LITTLE BOY
                         I'm hungry.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Alright.

               Stands With A Fist leads the little boy off to a lodge. Dances 
               With Wolves watches her walk away. From out of nowhere, Smiles 
               A Lot appears. He's been milling about the arbor 
               eavesdropping, and looks over to Dunbar with a teasing smile.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         ...a bone.

               INT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - NIGHT

               Black Shawl is settling the youngest children in for bed, 
               Stands With A Fist is playing with the oldest of the children. 
               They're setting up a child's tipi.

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         How is Dances With Wolves?

               Stands With A Fist stares straight ahead as if she were 
               wondering the same thing. Which she was.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         What do you mean?

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         How is he learning?

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         He learns well... he is fast.

               Case closed, she goes back to playing and Black Shawl 
               continues putting the kids to bed.

               She looks again at Stands With A Fist wondering "what did 
               you think I meant?"

               EXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY

               Dunbar is sitting on Cisco. It's plain he's been waiting for 
               someone.

               Stands With A Fist pulls aside the lodge flap, she's lugging 
               a couple water bags.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         You go for water?

               His Sioux is perfect, and she smiles.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Yes.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Let us take you.

               EXT. RIVER TRAIL - DAY

               Cisco makes his way down the river trail, he shies at the 
               flurry of wings as a covey of quail fly up before them. Stands 
               With A Fist tightens her grip around Dances With Wolves waist.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               Stands With A Fist draws water into a set of bladder bags. 
               Dances With Wolves squats next to her, staring at the eddying 
               stream.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         How did you get your name?

               Stands With A Fist smiles to herself as she fills up the 
               last of the bags.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         I was not very old when I came to be 
                         with the people... I was made to 
                         work.

               She lugs the filled bags onto shore and sits next to Dances 
               With Wolves.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         I worked every day... very hard... 
                         there was a woman who didn't like 
                         me. She called me bad names... 
                         sometimes she beat me. One day she 
                         was calling me these bad names, her 
                         face in my face, and I hit her. I 
                         was not very big, but she fell down. 
                         She fell hard and didn't move. I 
                         stood over her with my fist and asked 
                         if any other woman wanted to call me 
                         bad names...
                              (laughing at the 
                              recollection)
                         No one bothered me after that day.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I would not think so.

               A little silence.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Show me where you hit her.

               He taps his jaw. She makes a fist and brushes very gently at 
               the point of his jaw. Dances With Wolves' eyes flutter. They 
               roll up in his head and he keels over backward... out cold.

               She goes with the joke. Bending over him she slaps lightly 
               at each side of his cheeks, until Dances With Wolves revives. 
               He sits up, rubbing his jaw.

               Neither one acknowledges the joke and, a sudden awkwardness 
               falls between them. Stands With A Fist fiddles shyly with 
               the ties on the water bags while Dances With Wolves draws 
               lines in the earth with a stick.

               Finally he works up the courage to ask a delicate question.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Why are you not married?

               The question comes as a jolt to Stands With A Fist. She stops 
               her fiddling. A visible stiffness overtakes her. She quickly 
               stands up.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         I must go.

               Dances With Wolves doesn't know what to do. He only knows 
               that he should not have asked the question. She slings the 
               heavy bags over her shoulders and starts back up the path. 
               Dances With Wolves jumps to his feet.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I'm sorry. Let me help...

               But the words are delivered to her back. She is already 
               hurrying up the path with her heavy load.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         No.

               Five ponies have wondered into the middle of the path. She 
               kicks violently at the nearest innocent bystander. The horses 
               shy out of the way.

               He's left alone at the waters edge, frustrated and confused. 
               He watches her go for a moment. Then he lets the stick drop 
               from his hand. He stares at it for a second then gives it a 
               vicious little kick.

               INT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY

               Stands With A Fist is sitting in the middle of the lodge, 
               she starts when Black Shawl walks in.

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         You are not talking today?

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         No, I'm not.

               Black Shawl gives her a deeper look, then lets it go.

               INT. ARBOR - DUSK

               The sun is setting and the village is settling in for the 
               evening.

               INT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - NIGHT

               Lying on his bed, Dances With Wolves looks sleepy as he stares-
               across at the small fire. Even, in his drowsiness, it is 
               easy to see he's concentrating... in this case on a certain 
               someone.

               INT. ARBOR - DAY

               Again, Dances With Wolves is waiting. This time, not so 
               patiently. He gives up and leaves in search of something.

               EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY

               Dances With Wolves is wandering through the village, half-
               heartedly looking for Stands With A Fist. The day is very 
               hot and the village is quiet. Most of the people have gone 
               to shade.

               He sees Stone Calf sitting in the shade behind a lodge. A 
               newly made shield hangs from a tripod and he is painting a 
               design on it.

               EXT. STONE CALF'S LODGE - DAY

               Dances With Wolves sits in the shade with Stone Calf, watching 
               the older man paint.

                                     STONE CALF
                         Some of your words are wrong... but 
                         you are learning fast. That is good. 
                         What can I tell you today?

               Dances With Wolves is a little taken aback. The elder has 
               read his mind. He decides to speak it.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I want to know about Stands With A 
                         Fist.

               For the first time, Stone Calf leaves his work. He gives his 
               visitor a quick and penetrating look. Then he goes back to 
               his shield.

                                     STONE CALF
                         What is your question?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         There is no man with her.

               Stone Calf considers before he speaks. It is not something 
               he wants to get into.

                                     STONE CALF
                         She is in mourning.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I do not understand "mourning".

                                     STONE CALF
                         She is crying for someone.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Crying for who?

                                     STONE CALF
                         It is not polite to speak of the 
                         dead... But I will tell you... you 
                         are new. She cries for her husband. 
                         He was killed not long ago.

               The blood has gone out of Dances With Wolves' face. He tries 
               to digest this.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         How long will she cry?

                                     STONE CALF
                         It is Kicking Bird's place to say 
                         when she is finished.

               INT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY

               Stands With A Fist kneels before Black Shawl, the older woman 
               is combing out the tangles in her hair. Black Shawl senses a 
               tension in the girl and gently tries to pry it out of her.

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         People are talking about you...

               Stands With A Fist stiffens a bit.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         What are they saying?

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         They are proud of the medicine you 
                         are making with Dances With Wolves.

               Stands With A Fist is quiet.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         I have hurt him and I must go talk 
                         to him.

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         You can't, he is gone.

               Stands With A Fist bolts up, racing to the lodge flap -- she 
               pulls it aside and is stunned by the sight of Dances With 
               Wolves' abandoned lodge -- Cisco is nowhere to be seen.

               She turns away, tears coming to her eyes. Black Shawl is 
               beside her watching -- the girl's emotions have betrayed 
               her.

               Black Shawl takes the crying girl into her arms. A child 
               runs into the lodge but Black Shawl indicates "not now."

               The message is clearly understood, and the child digs in his 
               heels and heads the other way.

               EXT. FORT - DAY

               The breeze is up and the remaining shreds of canvas that 
               were once the awning are flying like tattered flags.

               Leading Cisco, Dances With Wolves walks into view. It will 
               be his last visit to his old home and he is taking his time.

               He watches the blowing canvas. The sound of it snapping is 
               all that can be heard.

               He steps over to the supply house. He starts to peer in, but 
               when he places a hand against the sod, part of the wall gives 
               way.

               INT. QUARTERS - PAY

               Part of the old bed has collapsed but some of it is still 
               strong enough for support and here Dances With Wolves is 
               sitting as he leafs through his beloved journal.

               He reads a little entry here and there, sometimes smiling at 
               the memory.

               A few blank pages remain at the back of the book. Reaching 
               these he closes the journal and holds it on his lap, letting 
               his mind run for a moment.

               Now he notices the old pen and ink. He picks them up and 
               opens the journal for one last entry.

               He writes: "I love Stands With A Fist" and signs himself 
               "Dances With Wolves."

               Something is moving outside and Dunbar stops, drawing his 
               gun out. He drops the book on the bed and carefully moves 
               outside.

               EXT. QUARTERS - DAY

               Lying in the sun a few feet away is Two Socks. He looks up 
               hopefully at Dances With Wolves. The two partners stare at 
               each other for a moment.

               Then Dances With Wolves reaches into a little day pouch at 
               his side and pulls out a strip of jerky. He squats close to 
               the ground and offers the meat to the wolf.

               Two Socks is up now. He takes several tentative steps. His 
               nose sniffs at the meat and he opens his mouth. Teeth and 
               fingers touch as the wolf takes the meat delicately.

               Now, in his customary style, he moves away, heading out onto 
               the prairie with his prize.

               Dances With Wolves watches a moment longer. Then he vaults 
               onto Cisco's back and they canter off in the direction of 
               the village.

               EXT. RIVERSIDE - DAY

               Stands With A Fist is wading through the water, her mind is 
               far away.

               In a moment there is a shift in the wind. The rustling of 
               the trees alerts her to a presence she had not thought to 
               feel before.

               Gradually, she raises her eyes to see the figure of a man 
               moving through the trees... Dances With Wolves.

               Stands With A Fist walks slowly out of the water. He opens 
               his arms and she melts into them, letting her head rest 
               against his chest.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         I am in mourning.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I know... Stone Calf told me.

               She presses her body full against his, feeling all of him.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         No one can know... we must be careful.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Yes.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         We must be careful.

               She climbs higher into his arms for a moment. Then, supporting 
               each other, the lovers move into the cover of the willow 
               breaks along the river.

               EXT. RIVER PATH - DAY

               The path leading to the river is deserted.

               Suddenly, a couple steps out of the cover of the willows 
               alongside the path. Stands With A Fist and Dances With Wolves 
               look up and down the path. They start for the village, holding 
               hands.

               As they near the top of the trail their hands part. A few 
               steps later and someone calls from the bushes startling Dances 
               with Wolves.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         What are you doing?

               Smiles A Lot, Worm and Otter are sitting pathside. Worm is 
               holding a sack.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Nothin'.

               Smiles A Lot looks to Stands With A Fist.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Nothin'.

               Worm opens the sack. A large, wriggling snake lies in the 
               bottom.

                                     WORM
                         We got a snake.

                                     OTTER
                         We're gonna see if it can swim the 
                         river. You wanna come?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Okay.

               The two parties split up and everyone says goodbye to Stands 
               With A Fist. She makes her way up to the village.

               Dances With Wolves watches her go. Turning back to head down 
               to the river, he is greeted by the open hissing mouth of 
               Worm's snake.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Don't do that!

               Worm and Otter laugh and race off down the path.

               Smiles A Lot and Dances With Wolves follow, Dances With Wolves 
               a little ahead. Something on his back, something curious, 
               has captured Smiles A Lot's attention.

               There's a strange coating of fuzz on Dances With Wolves' 
               back.

               Something occurs to Smiles A Lot. He stops and turns, his 
               eyes going up the trail.

               Stands With A Fist is walking toward the village, it's there 
               on her back too... cattail fuzz.

               Smiles A Lot laughs and runs to catch Dances With Wolves. 
               The boy slaps Dunbar with a knowing pat and a big grin.

               INT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - NIGHT

               Dances with Wolves sits at his cozy fire, working on a pipe. 
               He follows a low rumble of thunder as it rolls overhead. 
               Thunder booms again and suddenly Stands With A Fist comes 
               through the lodge flap.

               Dances With Wolves comes to his feet. They stare across at 
               each other. Dances With Wolves walks slowly to her and they 
               embrace lightly. Stands With A Fist starts to slip out of 
               her dress.

               EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - NIGHT

               Indian riders are coming into camp. There are three or four 
               of them. One man is slung over a pony's back. He's dead. All 
               of the others are wounded.

               INT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - NIGHT

               Dances With Wolves and Stands With A Fist are having sex. 
               The sounds of their love-making are suddenly joined by more 
               insistent sounds from outside. Urgent yelling.

               The lovers freeze. Stands With A Fist props herself on an 
               elbow, listening.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Trouble...

               EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - NIGHT

               Dances With Wolves hurries through a light rain to the scene 
               of a commotion going on at Ten Bears' lodge. There's a real 
               sense of panic in the air by the time he reaches the fire 
               outside Ten Bears' lodge.

               It's a wild scene. Ten Bears is trying to huddle with his 
               advisors, the wounded men are trying to tend their injuries 
               and the rest of the warriors in camp are holding little skull 
               sessions amidst much shouting. Women are running to and fro, 
               rounding up their children.

               Dances With Wolves spots Stands With A Fist making her way 
               toward him. Her eyes are big with terror.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Pawnee... a big party... thirty or 
                         forty men.
                              (indicating wounded)
                         The Kiowa hunters found them not far 
                         to the north. The Pawnee are coming 
                         his way. Soon they will find our 
                         camp.

               Stone Calf is just passing by. Dances With Wolves stops him.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Stone Calf... I follow you.

               The older man doesn't mince words.

                                     STONE CALF
                         The Pawnee do not come for horses, 
                         they come for blood... and with many 
                         men gone, we are few.

               Dances With Wolves nods.

                                     STONE CALF
                         Get your weapons and come to my lodge.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                              (to Dances With Wolves)
                         I will go.

               She rushes off and Dances With Wolves falls into step behind 
               Stone Calf. He hasn't gone two steps before a revelation 
               hits him.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Stone Calf... wait...

               The older warrior faces him.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I have guns... many far-shooting 
                         guns.

               EXT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - NIGHT

               Amid the pandemonium of the village, Dances With Wolves and 
               Ten Bears are talking. Stone Calf stands at Ten Bears' side, 
               listening.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         No, the ride is long... the weather 
                         is bad. We can spare no men.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Guns would make one warrior like 
                         two.

               The idea intrigues Ten Bears. As he thinks, he looks to Stone 
               Calf. But the elder warrior says nothing.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Take one man and go quickly.

               Dances With Wolves turns away now, hoping to make a quick 
               choice. But in their excitement all the warriors are busy 
               running to and fro. Only one person is standing resolutely. 
               He is staring straight at Dances With Wolves. It is Smiles A 
               Lot, and from the look on his face it's easy to see that he 
               wants to be chosen.

               Dances With Wolves returns the boy's stare, trying to make 
               up his mind. He turns to Ten Bears.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I will take Smiles A Lot.

               Ten Bears looks briefly at Smiles A Lot. He too can see 
               resolve in the boy's face. Now he looks once again at Dances 
               With Wolves. He nods.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT

               Rain is pouring now. Thunder is still booming. A great fork 
               of lightning illuminates the ruins of the old fort. And 
               nearby, it reveals two riders out in the grass.

               Dances With Wolves and Smiles A Lot have brought a couple 
               extra horses with travois, but is is dark and in the rain 
               they've been reduced to looking for a needle in a haystack.

               Dances With Wolves' face is grim with frustration as it covers 
               the ground at Cisco's feet.

               Smiles A Lot and his pony are walking the soggy ground. Over 
               the tumult of the storm there is the faint but distinct sound 
               of a "snap".

               He's staring curiously at the ground beneath his pony's feet. 
               Smiles a Lot jumps off and, going on all fours, he paws over 
               the ground.

               His hand grasps something and he holds it up to his face. 
               It's a sliver of bone shattered at one end. Quickly he gropes 
               some more and finds the other half. Together they are a 
               buffalo rib.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                              (shouting over the 
                              storm)
                         Dances With Wolves... Dances With 
                         Wolves.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT

               Frenzied hands claw away mud and sod. Something wooden is 
               uncovered; the lid of a rifle crate.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAWN

               The sky is still full of thunder and lightning but in the 
               breaking dawn the storm can be seen to be lifting.

               The village is just ahead down a long slope as the gun finders 
               come into view.

               A great bolt of lightning hits just as Dances With Wolves 
               starts down the slope. He sees something.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Wait.

               Smiles A Lot stops. Dances With Wolves squints into the feeble 
               light. He can see the outline of the village below, but 
               upriver the light is still too murky to make anything out.

               Another bolt of lightning flashes. There they are. A long 
               line of horsemen crossing river a mile or so upstream from 
               the village. The Pawnee.

               EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAWN

               In front of Ten Bears' lodge, Dances With Wolves is passing 
               out the last of the rifles. Warriors are grabbing handfuls 
               of bullets out of an open ammo box.

               Ten Bears is watching this procedure. And while he watches, 
               he thinks.

               The guns have been passed out and, except for a slight murmur 
               among the warriors, it's strangely quiet. The band's best 
               fighters are gone and many men don't know what to do next. 
               They're looking to Ten Bears for leadership.

               But the old man is looking at Dances With Wolves. He holds 
               up a hand for quiet.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Hear us now.
                              (to Dances With Wolves)
                         A white soldier with many far-shooting 
                         guns... how would he fight the Pawnee?

               Everyone is waiting.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I would hide in the village.

               The warriors send up a chorus of derisive cries but Ten Bears 
               angrily quiets them.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Dances With Wolves has not finished.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I would let the enemy think we are 
                         asleep... let him come close. Then 
                         we would shoot together and run to 
                         fight them, drive them into the river 
                         and kill so many that they would 
                         never trouble us again.

               Ten Bears smiles.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         I am of the same mind as Dances With 
                         Wolves... we should kill so many 
                         that they never trouble us again.

               EXT. RIVER - DAWN

               Two of the camp dogs are lapping water at the river's edge, 
               behind them lies the quiet village. Suddenly both heads jerk 
               up.

               INT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAWN

               Dances With Wolves steps into the lodge, followed by Smiles 
               A Lot. They both have rifles and Dances With Wolves' old 
               long-barreled revolver is holstered at his waist.

               Before him is a quiet, tense scene.

               The women are huddled together on a single sleeping platform. 
               Kicking Bird's three children nestled between them. Two of 
               the kids are crying softly.

               Black Shawl grips a hatchet and Stands With A Fist has a 
               rifle. They will both fight. But they are both scared. 
               Everyone in the village has a life at stake. In one glimpse, 
               Dances With Wolves understands what he will be fighting for.

               He looks once more at the women and children and ducks out 
               of the lodge.

               EXT. RIVER - DAWN

               The feet of the enemy are moving past the dogs, whose bodies 
               are still and riddled with arrows. In front of them the river 
               is full of Pawnee crossing over toward the village. There is 
               no sound.

               EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAWN

               It has stopped raining but the ground is still soaked and an 
               early morning fog is swirling through the camp. Clumped in 
               groups of five or six, behind the lodges nearest the river, 
               are Sioux warriors with rifles. They're absolutely quiet as 
               they wait for the enemy.

               Dances With Wolves looks across a clearing that slopes down 
               to the breaks fronting the river. Nothing.

               Wait. A movement. And another. Another. The heads of men 
               lurking in the fog. He glances at the defenders.

               Most of the warriors are huddled behind the line of lodges 
               watching him. Ten Bears raises a hand.

               The Pawnee are visible now, a war party at its fiercest, 
               painted and feathered and armed to the teeth.

               Coming on foot, the first of them have reached the edge of 
               the clearing. They start into a stealthy trot, more and more 
               of them breaking into a run.

               A Pawnee war cry goes up and, as the others join in. Ten 
               Bears lowers his hand.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAWN

               In ragged formation, the Sioux pour from behind the lodges 
               and thirty rifles fire into the vanguard of the Pawnee charge.

               The smoke of many rifles mixes with the ground fog as the 
               Sioux run screaming down on the Pawnee. Dances With Wolves 
               screams too as he runs flat out down the slope.

               A Pawnee warrior suddenly looms out of the smoke and they 
               crash together violently.

               The two fighters tumble over the ground, each grappling for 
               an advantage. The hand to hand fighting all around them is 
               furious and, shrouded in smoke and fog, it has a surreal 
               quality.

               Dances With Wolves works the Navy revolver from its holster 
               and shoots the Pawnee in the face.

               EXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAWN

               A child sticks his head out from under the edge of the lodge. 
               Momentarily he is jerked back into the lodge out of sight.

               INT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAWN

               Now there's a ripping at the lodge entrance. The flap is 
               being torn away. Black Shawl is desperately pulling the child 
               back from the edge of the lodge.

               Suddenly, there he is... a Pawnee warrior. But now it's his 
               turn to be surprised. He sees Stands with A Fist taking aim, 
               and it's too late. She fires the rifle and the Pawnee explodes 
               back out of the lodge.

               EXT. VILLAGE - DAWN

               Through the smoke, Dances With Wolves can just catch a glimpse 
               of Ten Bears. He is moving through the village at a trot, 
               loading his gun.

               He spots a Sioux warrior grappling with a Pawnee, sights and 
               shoots the Pawnee point blank. He trots off, reloading once 
               more.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAWN

               Dances With Wolves is bumped from behind and is knocked to 
               his knees. It's a frantic Pawnee war horse, loose on the 
               battlefield. Dances With Wolves grabs a hunk of mane and 
               swings onto his back.

               He has a real view now. The Pawnee are taking a terrible 
               licking. Already they are being beaten back to the river.

               A turbaned enemy is falling back to the river, firing arrows 
               as he goes. Dances With Wolves goes after him.

               EXT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - DAWN

               Still clutching his hatchet, a wounded Pawnee half staggers 
               toward Ten Bears' lodge. He is bleeding profusely and in a 
               very bad mood. He reaches the closed lodge flap.

               INT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - DAWN

               Pretty Shield stands in front of a group of children, ready 
               to defend them.

               The Pawnee is inside now. He has a wild desperate look and 
               in a moment his hatchet will be flailing its way through 
               these people.

               But he never takes a step. Instead he suddenly sinks to his 
               knees and we see another arrow join the one that is already 
               buried in his back. The warrior keels over and Pretty Shield 
               looks through the open flap to see the grinning face of Stone 
               Calf.

               Without hesitation, Pretty Shield snatches a half-burned log 
               from the fire and finishes the Pawnee.

               The children watch, their faces a mixture of horror and 
               intrigue.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAWN

               Coming off the pony like a rodeo bulldogger, Dances With 
               Wolves crashes through the river taking the Pawnee in a 
               headlock.

               Somehow they both keep their feet and hurtle down the hill 
               at a weird run. A small cottonwood stops their momentum, the 
               Pawnee taking most of the blow.

               Dances With Wolves grabs either side of the man's head and 
               starts banging his skull against the tree trunk. Shortly, he 
               notices that the man's eyes are dead.

               The Pawnee was impaled on impact by the stub of a broken 
               branch low on the trunk.

               Dances With Wolves shrinks back from this gruesome sight and 
               staggers toward the village.

               EXT. VILLAGE - DAWN

               Stone Calf, his bow and arrow at the ready, is looking for 
               more enemies to kill.

               Suddenly from the corner of his eye the old man senses an 
               attack. But he is too late. A Pawnee war club crushes his 
               skull and the old man collapses.

               Now we can see his attacker. It is the fierce Pawnee warrior 
               who killed Timmons the wagon driver. He glowers down at the 
               body of Stone Calf and swings his club toward the old man's 
               head once again.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAWN

               Dances With Wolves squints toward the village just in time 
               to see the Toughest take another shot at the prostrate, white-
               headed form of Stone Calf.

               Dances With Wolves begins to run.

               EXT. VILLAGE - DAWN

               The Toughest has his knife to Stone Calf's forehead and is 
               preparing to scalp his victim when something strikes him in 
               the lower leg.

               He looks down to find a small arrow imbedded in his calf. He 
               looks up to see three boys, Otter, Worm, and Smiles A Lot, 
               huddled at the edge of the battlefield.

               He turns back to finish the job when another arrow hits him. 
               Enraged he breaks off the arrow, leaps onto a horse and 
               charges the kids.

               Their faces go ashen as the Toughest bears down on them.

               Otter's arrow flies weakly into the air. The boys turn and 
               run for their lives.

               The Toughest would catch them with ease but now, he sees 
               half a dozen howling Sioux warriors angling in to cut him 
               off. He knows in a glance that the fight has been lost. He 
               also knows that he can still escape if he changes direction. 
               He veers for the river.

               The Sioux are distraught. The Toughest will get away.

               But wait, Dances with Wolves is at full speed now. He is 
               streaking across the battlefield.

               Suddenly, the Pawnee himself is hurtling through space, driven 
               there by the full force impact of Dances With Wolves' shoulder 
               which has caught him rib high.

               Both men hit the ground grappling and rolling.

               A knife flashes in the Toughest's hand and Dances With Wolves 
               can only react quick enough to keep the knife from a vital 
               spot. As it is, the blade lays open a huge gash on his arm.

               They square off. The Toughest knows the advantage is his. He 
               smiles grimly at Dances With Wolves and grunts sadistically.

               But the sound from his throat is cut short by the simultaneous 
               arrival of five Sioux arrows. Before the Pawnee can fall, 
               six Sioux warriors are on him tearing him to pieces.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

               Dances With Wolves climbs to his feet and discovers that the 
               battlefield is no longer so. The fighting has stopped.

               It's a scene of carnage and joy. The Pawnee attackers lay 
               where they fell.

                                     SIOUX 1
                         I killed this one.

                                     SIOUX 2
                         This one still breathes.

               The Sioux victors are in high spirits as they hop around 
               finishing off the wounded and counting coup on the dead.

               Dances With Wolves looks down at himself. His body is streaked 
               with blood, much of it his own. His arm is bleeding freely 
               but he is too repulsed to move forward and too exhausted to 
               retreat into the breaks.

               Dances With Wolves now looks up to see the lifeless body of 
               Stone Calf. Ten Bears is hugging him. Pretty Shield starts 
               to kneel beside her mourning husband.

                                     SIOUX 3 (O.S.)
                         Dances With Wolves...

               Before he knows it, Sioux fighters are moving all around 
               him, chanting his name. Like ants rolling a pebble up a hill, 
               they push him into the middle of the battlefield. In a daze 
               he allows himself to be carried along.

               When he looks up again he can see women and children emerging 
               from the lodges.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES (V.O.)
                         It was hard to know how to feel. I 
                         had never been in a battle like this 
                         one. This had not been a fight for 
                         territory or riches or to make men 
                         free. This battle had no ego. It had 
                         been fought to preserve the food 
                         stores that would see us through 
                         winter, to protect the lives of women 
                         and children and loved ones only a 
                         few feet away. I felt a pride I had 
                         never felt before.

               Dances With Wolves looks down and recognizes the face of a 
               man he has just killed. Several warriors are crowding around 
               him now. Dances With Wolves points at the body.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I shot this one.

                                     1ST WARRIOR
                         Yes, I saw you shoot him.

                                     2ND WARRIOR
                         You killed that one too.

               As the sun breaks fully through the clouds, the little knot 
               of warriors, Dances With Wolves in their midst, continues 
               its triumphant tour of the battleground. The men are hugging 
               and slapping each other on the back.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES (V.O.)
                         I had never really known who John 
                         Dunbar was. Perhaps because the name 
                         itself had no meaning. But as I heard 
                         my Sioux name being called over and 
                         over, I knew for the first time who 
                         I really was.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               The war party with Kicking Bird and Wind In His Hair at its 
               head has halted in the middle of nowhere. The Sioux riders 
               are coming toward them at a run. They pull up, excited with 
               what they have to tell.

               The returning war party and the two riders who met them start 
               ahead at a gallop.

               INT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - NIGHT

               Black Shawl and Stands With A Fist are clearing things away. 
               The medicine man has hosted a dinner party which is now 
               winding down.

               Wind In His Hair is there, Dances With Wolves and several 
               other prominent warriors. It's purely social and all the men 
               are enjoying themselves.

               Dances With Wolves sneaks a look of affection at Stands With 
               A Fist, and she returns it.

               Then, with more theatricality than is really necessary, he 
               stretches his arms and yawns. Wind In His Hair looks at his 
               friend with surprise.

               Dances With Wolves gets to his feet.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         There is gambling tonight... at Horse 
                         Back's lodge. Horse Back's games are 
                         always good.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I am tired... and Horse Back already 
                         has a good rifle of mine.
                              (to Kicking Bird)
                         thank you...
                              (to all)
                         goodnight.

               He slips out. In a few seconds, the men have pick up another 
               topic to jawbone.

               They pay no attention to Stands With A Fist's momentary exit, 
               But Black Shawl does, it doesn't bother her, but she notices.

               INT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - NIGHT

               The medicine man's wife is already in bed as he slips under 
               the covers with a grunt.

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         How long will Stands With A Fist 
                         mourn?

               Kicking Bird gives his wife an odd look.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         I don't know.

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         I hope it will not be too long.

               Kicking Bird rises on his elbows.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Something has happened? Well what?

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         She has found love again.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         With who?

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         Dances With Wolves.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Are you certain of this?

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         When you see them together you will 
                         know.

               Kicking Bird stares wearily across the floor.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         What are people saying? They're not 
                         angry?

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         No. They like the match. It makes 
                         sense. They are both white.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         I suppose I will be the one to say 
                         something.

               A brief silence.

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         She's your daughter now.

               Kicking Bird glances up frustrated with himself.

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         You can't see everything coming.

               EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY

               Stands With A Fist is walking through the village with Kicking 
               Bird's youngest child. They're both carrying armloads of 
               firewood.

               Here comes Kicking Bird. He's out of breath.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Stands With A Fist.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Yes.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         You are no longer a widow.

               Kicking Bird turns abruptly and stalks off, leaving Stands 
               With A Fist to ponder the meaning of his curt announcement. 
               A smile gradually works onto her face.

               INT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - DAY

               Dances With Wolves sits waiting as a voice comes to him from 
               the outside.

               Wind In His Hair's face pokes through the entrance. He steps 
               inside, followed by Smiles A Lot.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         There's talk that you want to get 
                         married.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         To who?

               Wind In His Hair and Smiles A Lot share a smile.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         To Stands With A Fist.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         That's the one isn't it?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         She's in mourning.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         Not today.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         She has been released. Kicking Bird 
                         did it.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         He did?

               Wind In His Hair isn't really listening. He glances around 
               the lodge curiously.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         What are you doing?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Kicking Bird told me to wait.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         You might be waiting a long time. 
                         Smiles A Lot says he saw Kicking 
                         Bird riding on the prairie...

               Smiles A Lot whispers in the warrior's ear.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         He says he was talking to himself. 
                         When a medicine man is the last to 
                         know he can take it pretty hard.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         What do I do?

               Wind In His Hair looks around at the sparse furnishing.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         You are pretty poor my friend and a 
                         Sioux girl is not for free. I don't 
                         know if you can get married.

               A long silence. Dances With Wolves looks around his lodge. 
               Wind In His Hair is right. He really has nothing.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I have the buckskin...

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         That's too much medicine.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                              (to Smiles A Lot)
                         Do you think the buckskin is too 
                         much medicine?

               Smiles A Lot is on the hot seat. He looks to Wind In His 
               Hair, but no luck -- he's on his own.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         For a girl.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         Maybe we can help you... wait here 
                         for us.

               Wind In His Hair and Smiles A Lot leave.

               EXT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - DAY

               Wind In His Hair and Smiles A Lot are greeted by seven 
               chuckling warriors. They've been listening to the exchange 
               and move off with the two "helpers".

               EXT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - DAY

               Dances With Wolves is inspecting several new ponies which 
               are tied outside his tipi. Now he notices an old couple 
               approaching.

               The old couple leaves a gift along with others that have 
               already been brought. The old folks are shy and so is Dances 
               With Wolves. They glance at one another and smile but do not 
               speak.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES (V.O.)
                         I thought we had been discreet but 
                         apparently we fooled no one.

               EXT. VILLAGE - DUSK

               Dances With Wolves ties the last of the ponies in front of 
               Kicking Bird's lodge and starts back toward his own home.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES (V.O.)
                         Wind In His Hair said if the match 
                         was acccepted the ponies would be 
                         gone in the morning.

               Dances With Wolves looks over his shoulder at the standing 
               ponies then he continues on.

               INT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - NIGHT

               Dances With Wolves tosses and turns in his bed. He slips out 
               of the covers and ducks his head through the lodge flap, 
               checking again on the ponies.

               EXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY

               The ponies are gone.

               INT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - DAY

               Dances With Wolves' hair is shiny. His breastplate gleams, 
               the officer's pants have been dusted and his old boots have 
               something resembling a shine. The groom is ready.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         Turn around...

               Dances With Wolves does a three-sixty.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         Pretty good...

               A brief silence as Wind In His Hair contemplates something 
               he wants to say.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         You know, the man she mourned for 
                         was my best friend.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I didn't know that.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         He was a good man. It's been hard 
                         for me. I am not the thinker Kicking 
                         Bird is. But I think he went away 
                         from her because you were coming. 
                         That is how I see it now.

               The sound of music and people outside distracts both men.

               EXT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - DAY

               Kicking Bird is leading the wedding party. Stands With A 
               Fist by his side. She glows with the special beauty of a 
               bride.

               Many people are standing about quietly, more like simple 
               observers than participants. The whole village is as peaceful 
               as we will ever see it.

               Kicking Bird steps forward, his wife and Stands With A Fist 
               following in his footsteps.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         This is a good day for me.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         And for me.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Stands With A Fist... if you want 
                         this man, take his hand in yours.

               Shyly, she holds out a slender, graceful hand. Dances with 
               Wolves meets it with one of his own.

               The medicine man looks Dances With Wolves in the eyes for 
               several seconds.

               Dances With Wolves also begins to speak... internally. At 
               first the volume of his voice and that of the medicine man 
               are nearly equal, but Kicking Bird's voice quickly begins to 
               fade.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES (V.O.)
                         I had never been married before. I 
                         don't know if all grooms have the 
                         same experience. But as Kicking Bird 
                         began to speak about what was expected 
                         of a Sioux husband, my mind began to 
                         swim in a way that shut out everything 
                         but her. The tiny details of her 
                         costume. The contours of her shape. 
                         The light in her eyes. The smallness 
                         of her feet. I knew that the love 
                         between us would be served.

               The medicine man's voice cuts back in. He's had to say it 
               twice.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Have you heard all that I have said?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Yes.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Good, then take her inside... she is 
                         your wife.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Oh... good... thank you... goodbye...

               The newlyweds disappear into their new home. The flap is 
               dropped and there it stays. The light begins to change, 
               growing darker, the wind comes up, blowing leaves against 
               the door. In the distance there is thunder.

               EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY

               The lodge flap is still closed. But now it is covered in 
               sunshine.

               Smiles A Lot, Worm and Otter are just across the way, bundled 
               now against the chill of oncoming winter. They're watching 
               too. Smiles A Lot is standing next to Worm, -- Otter is on 
               his haunches. Both are gnawing at a breakfast of dried meat 
               as they talk nonchalantly.

                                     WORM
                         Dances With Wolves' door is closed 
                         alot these days.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         They're trying to make a baby.

               The two older boys look down at Otter.

                                     OTTER
                         I know that.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         You would think they could have made 
                         a baby by now.

                                     WORM
                         Maybe they're having a hard time. 
                         Some people have a hard time.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         I don't think they're having a hard 
                         time.

                                     OTTER
                         Me neither.

               A silence as the boys watch smoke curl out of the lodge. 
               Worm laughs to himself.

                                     OTTER
                         Maybe we should pull the smoke flap 
                         closed. Then they would come out.

               The boys look at each other for the first time, their eyes 
               brightening. What a great idea!

               The two boys are stalking toward Dances With Wolves' lodge 
               when they see something that makes them peel off in another 
               direction.

               It's Kicking Bird, coming to call.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Dances With Wolves, are you in there?

               In a moment the lodge flap opens and Dances With Wolves steps 
               outside. He's fully dressed but a little disheveled.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         I am riding today to a far away place. 
                         It is a place I haven't seen for a 
                         long time. A sacred place. I would 
                         like you to come with me.

               Dances With Wolves ponders this.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Kicking Bird and Dances With Wolves are cantering side by 
               side across the open prairie.

               They pull their horses to a walk and Kicking Bird glances 
               Dances With Wolves' direction.

               Dances With Wolves' glances back and smiles.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         It's good to be out.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Yes it must be.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         We are trying for a baby.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         No waiting?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         No waiting.

               The medicine man keeps looking at his protege. There is 
               virtually no semblance of Lieutenant Dunbar left.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         I was just thinking that of all the 
                         trails in this life, there is one 
                         that matters more than all the others. 
                         It is the trail of a true human being. 
                         I think you are on this trail and it 
                         is good to see.

               Dances With Wolves doesn't reply, but he is blushing a little.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Dances With Wolves and Kicking Bird gallop their horses to 
               the crest of a steep hill and rein to a halt.

               Down below, miles distant, is the curving line of a river. 
               But there is a section of river, directly before them, that 
               cannot be seen. It is screened by a mammoth stand of trees, 
               some of them towering a hundred feet or more.

               He glances at Dances With Wolves but his companion doesn't 
               see. He's staring in wonder at the great forest before him.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         It is said that all the animals were 
                         born here... that from here they 
                         spread over the prairies to feed all 
                         the people. Even our enemies say 
                         this is a sacred place.

               They start toward the river at a walk.

               EXT. BROKEN FOREST - DAY

               The two riders come out of the sunlight and onto a shaded 
               path leading into the forest. They've only gone a few yards 
               when Kicking Bird pulls to a stop. The men sit on their horses 
               in complete silence. Dances With Wolves is still fully 
               entranced.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         It's quiet.

               But Kicking Bird does not acknowledge his companion's words. 
               He seems to be concentrating on the quiet. The quiet is wrong 
               and Kicking Bird knows it. He moves forward slowly.

               Following behind Kicking Bird, Dances With Wolves' attention 
               is focused on the tree tops above him. A curious buzzing 
               sound has started up and is growing louder by the moment. 
               Perhaps there are bees swarming in the branches overhead.

               Now he is distracted by Cisco coming to a stop. Kicking Bird 
               too has stopped. Just ahead the forest opens into an 
               incredible cathedral-like expanse. Sunlight streams down 
               onto the floor in beautiful pools.

               But still there is a deathly quiet and Dances With Wolves 
               can see now that this remarkable place has been horribly 
               desecrated.

               Trees have been felled everywhere, most of them left to rot 
               for no explicable reason.

               At the same time he sees this destruction Dances With Wolves 
               realizes that the strange buzzing sound is not coming from 
               overhead but from the forest floor.

               The insects are not bees. They are flies and they are swarming 
               over dozens of carcasses strewn over the ground. Badgers, 
               skunks, squirrels and other small animals, nearly all of 
               them killed merely for target practice.

               The men and their ponies move on. Deer carcasses are 
               everywhere, many of them horribly mutilated. A choice flank 
               portion is cut away here and there, while ninety-five percent 
               of the bodies have been left to rot.

               Heads and legs have been chopped off. Dances With Wolves 
               passes by a spot where several deer heads have been placed 
               nose to nose as if the heads were having a conversation. 
               Someone's perverted idea of humor.

               The men ride through the carnage in a sad daze.

               Now they reach the center of the cathedral and here they 
               find a few crude leantos, hewn from freshly cut wood. The 
               people who stayed here had bigger plans for all the felled 
               wood, but lost ambition and settled for these ugly hovels.

               A great pile of wild turkeys, perhaps twenty birds in all, 
               sit to one side. They haven't even been plucked. Just shot 
               and left to rot.

               Dances With Wolves notices half a dozen liquor bottles in a 
               heap of trash.

               He cannot bring himself to look at Kicking Bird. Any man 
               would be repulsed at these sights, but in Dances With Wolves' 
               case there is a feeling of shame as well.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         We must wait for these people...

               Kicking Bird says nothing for a long time.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         No, they've been gone a week maybe 
                         more... we will water the horses and 
                         go home.

               He turns his pony away.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Kicking Bird and Dances With Wolves are alone on a great sea 
               of prairie.

               There's a little fire going. A sage hen is being roasted, 
               but for some time we hear nothing but the light crackle of 
               the fire. Each man is preoccupied with his own thoughts, 
               thoughts of the broken forest.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         You have asked me many times about 
                         the white people... you always ask 
                         how many more are coming.

               Dances With Wolves looks at his friend and mentor.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         There will be a lot my friend... 
                         more than can be counted.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Help me to know how many.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Like the stars.

               This is what Kicking Bird wanted to know. And it hits him 
               like a rock.

               Kicking Bird bows his head in thought while Dances With Wolves 
               raises his. He never wanted to say this, he wishes it wasn't 
               true.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         It makes me afraid for all the Sioux.

               INT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - DAY

               The old man puffs away at his trusty pipe. Now he lays it 
               down. Kicking Bird and Dances With Wolves are waiting 
               patiently.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         It's hard to know what to do.

               The old man gets up, walks to his bedside, reaches up into 
               the sacred rigging above an takes down a melon-sized rawhide 
               bundle. He brings this back to the fire and unwraps it slowly. 
               Inside is a rusted hunk of metal, the helmet of a Spanish 
               conquistador.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         The men who wore this came in the 
                         time of my grandfather's grandfather. 
                         Eventually, we drove them out. Then 
                         the Mexicans came. In my own time 
                         the whites came... the Texans. They 
                         have been like all the others who 
                         find something they want in our 
                         country. They take it without asking. 
                         I have always been a peaceful man, 
                         happy to be in my own country and 
                         wanting nothing from the white people. 
                         Nothing at all. But I think you are 
                         right. I think they will keep coming. 
                         When I think of that, I look at this 
                         bundle. Our country is all that we 
                         want. We will fight to keep it.

               He picks up his pipe and puffs deeply.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Tomorrow morning we will strike the 
                         village and go to the winter camp.

               EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY

               The whole camp is being struck. There is activity everywhere.

               INT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - DAY

               Stands With A Fist is packing and so is Dances With Wolves. 
               He is putting away the shield that Stone Calf once worked 
               on. She pauses to stroke her husband's leg tenderly.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         You have everything from the soldier 
                         fort?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         No, there is nothing for me there.

               Stands with A Fist laughs as she starts out of the lodge.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         That's good.

               But as he tightens the leather thongs on the shield case, 
               Dances With Wolves' face begins to cloud.

               EXT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - DAY

               Dances With Wolves bolts out of the lodge and snatches up 
               Cisco's reins. He calls urgently to Stands with A Fist.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Stands With A Fist... wait...

               EXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY

               The village is about ready to move, just a few last minute 
               flurries of activity.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         The words in the book are like a 
                         trail for people to follow. It tells 
                         everything about my life here. I 
                         must get it.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         We cannot wait for you.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I will catch up.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Dances With Wolves and Cisco are cantering quickly over the 
               open prairie.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY

               Old Fort Sedgewick is just beyond the next rise. Dances With 
               Wolves eases Cisco into a full run.

               They fly so quickly over the rise that Dances With Wolves 
               has no time to react.

               There must be forty or fifty of them; talking, walking, 
               working and playing. Old Fort Sedgewick is crawling with 
               them. Blue-coated soldiers.

               Just in front of him is a deep-bedded wagon carrying a cargo 
               of SOLDIERS. They've been out cutting wood. But now the men 
               in the wagon are scrambling for their rifles and screaming 
               out the alarm... "Indians!"

               Dances With Wolves puts everything he has into pulling Cisco 
               up.

               The soldiers in the wagon, a collection of pimply-faced teen-
               agers and middle-aged rabble, are aiming their rifles. Cisco 
               rears high in the air as the volley is fired from the wagon.

               Dances With Wolves is pitched off to one side, landing hard 
               on the ground. When he gets his senses back the first thing 
               he sees is Cisco. The buckskin is lying very still.

               Oblivious to the shouts of the soldiers racing toward him, 
               Dances With Wolves runs crab-like to his horse's side.

               Cisco's been shot several times, one bullet taking him in 
               the heart. He's dead.

               Dances With Wolves whirls to face the soldiers.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         You killed him...

               That's the last thing he says. A rifle stock slams into the 
               side of his face and as soldiers swarm over him, everything 
               goes black.

               EXT. COLUMN - DAY

               Ten Bears village is on the trail. Kicking Bird is riding 
               down the line. He notices Stands With A Fist. She is terribly 
               distraught.

               Kicking Bird glances at the sun. The day is more than half-
               over. He kicks his pony back up the line next to Wind In His 
               Hair.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Something has happened... Dances 
                         With Wolves is not coming.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         He must have trouble.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Pick two good men with fast ponies 
                         and send them back to the soldier 
                         fort.

               INT. SUPPLY HOUSE - DAY

               Dances With Wolves lies unconscious on the floor of the ruined 
               supply house. One side of his face is grotesquely swollen 
               from the blow he took. Blood still seeps from a long split 
               of the skin along his cheek.

               He groans. Voice are playing about his ears, the voices of 
               white men. He opens his eyes.

               A bearish, bearded SERGEANT BAUER, is squatting directly in 
               front of him. Behind the sergeant, peering over the crumbled 
               walls like visitors at a zoo, are a crowd of ordinary 
               soldiers.

                                     BAUER
                         Spivey...

               A pitiful looking man, SPIVEY, who is a soldier by name only, 
               answers up.

                                     SPIVEY
                         Yessir sergeant...

                                     SERGEANT BAUER
                         Tell the major he's wakin' up... and 
                         move your worthless ass.

               The sergeant's smallish eyes are fixed on Dances With Wolves. 
               With some effort he manages to get himself into a sitting 
               position against the back wall.

                                     SERGEANT BAUER
                         Got yourself a helluva shiner, didn't 
                         ya?

               Dances With Wolves only blinks at him. His cheek is crushed 
               and so is his spirit.

               Someone calls attention and two officers walk into the 
               roofless supply house. One is a MAJOR, one is a young 
               lieutenant -- Lieutenant Elgin -- the officer Dances With 
               Wolves bumped into at Fort Hays. Neither one recognizes the 
               other.

                                     MAJOR
                         Does he speak english?

                                     SERGEANT BAUER
                         Don't know sir... you speak english? 
                         Talk english?
                              (kicking at one of 
                              Dances With Wolves' 
                              boots)
                         Talk?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I speak english...

               Everyone is shocked at the clarity of the words.

                                     MAJOR
                         Who are you?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Lieutenant John. J. Dunbar. This is 
                         my post.

                                     MAJOR
                         Why are you dressed like this?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I came out from Fort Hays last April. 
                         But there was no one here.

               The major and the lieutenant exchange whispers.

                                     ELGIN
                         You have proof of that?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         My journal is on the bunk in my 
                         quarters. My orders are in the 
                         journal. It will tell you everything.

                                     ELGIN
                         Spivey, you and Edwards were here 
                         first. Did you find anything... a 
                         journal.

               Spivey shifts uncomfortably.

                                     SPIVEY
                         We didn't see nothin' sir.

                                     ELGIN
                         Where's Edwards?

                                     SPIVEY
                         He's outside. But he didn't see 
                         nothin' either.

               Elgin indicates to the major that he will get to the bottom 
               of this and walks out the door -- the major follows.

               Dances With Wolves lets his head slump forward. The men 
               gathered around the supply house murmur among themselves, 
               commenting on the prisoner. They can't take their eyes off 
               him. Neither can Sergeant Bauer. He watches the prisoner 
               from a distance. Then he walks across the floor, squats in 
               front of him and whispers coarsely in his face.

                                     SERGEANT BAUER
                         You turned Injun, din'cha?

               Dances With Wolves lifts his head and stares at the sergeant.

                                     SERGEANT BAUER
                         Din'cha?

               The major and the lieutenant suddenly reappear.

                                     ELGIN
                         What is your name?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Dunbar... D.U.N.B.A.R... John.

                                     ELGIN
                         You say you are an officer?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Did you read my orders?

                                     ELGIN
                         No.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         It was in my journal.

                                     ELGIN
                         There are no orders and there is no 
                         journal.

               There is a silence as Dances With Wolves takes this in.

               Elgin tries again.

                                     ELGIN
                         Why are you out of uniform?

               Dances With Wolves takes a long time to answer.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I have to relieve myself.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY

               Surrounded by guards, Dances With Wolves is being walked 
               toward a clump of bushes.

               He glances out at the prairie. Cisco's body lies where it 
               fell. Black birds are pecking it.

                                     GUARD
                         Here you... eyes front.

               A rifle butt bangs him hard between the shoulder blades and 
               Dances With Wolves attacks. Before anyone else can move he 
               has taken the offending soldier to the ground and is 
               strangling him.

               Another rifle butt crashes against his skull and again 
               everything goes black.

               INT. SUPPLY HOUSE - DAY

               Water drips from Dances With Wolves' head and he comes to 
               again. As he moves he hears a jangling and discovers that 
               his hands and feet are in chains. Everyone has assembled.

                                     ELGIN
                         Why are you out of uniform?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         What is the army doing out here?

               Sergeant Bauer shoves Dances With Wolves with his gun.

                                     BAUER
                         Lieutenant's askin' the questions 
                         here.

               Elgin quickly steps in.

                                     ELGIN
                         We are charged with apprehending 
                         hostiles, recovering stolen property 
                         and retrieving white captives taken 
                         in hostile raidings.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         There are no hostiles.

                                     MAJOR
                         We will ascertain that for ourselves. 
                         Now if you guide us to these camps 
                         and serve as an interpreter, your 
                         conduct will be reevaluated.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         What conduct?

                                     MAJOR
                         Your status as a traitor might improve 
                         should you choose to cooperate with 
                         the United States Army.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                              (quietly)
                         There is nothing for you to do out 
                         here.

               Elgin can see that the major's attitude and inexperience has 
               killed any chance of communication. He makes one last try on 
               his own.

                                     ELGIN
                         Are you willing to cooperate or not?

                                     MAJOR
                         Well, speak up...

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                              (lowly in Sioux)
                         I am Dances With Wolves...

                                     MAJOR
                         What's that?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                              (loudly in Sioux)
                         I am Dances With Wolves... I have 
                         nothing to say to you. You are not 
                         worth talking to.

               The major is surprised. Elgin is not. The major turns on his 
               heel and walks out. Lieutenant Elgin stares at Dances With 
               Wolves.

                                     ELGIN
                         Sergeant... have a detail take him 
                         down to the river... let him clean 
                         up his face.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               Dances With Wolves kneels by the river, splashing water 
               lightly on his battered face. Half a dozen soldiers are 
               lounging around watching him.

               EXT. BUSHES - DAY

               Trooper Spivey is crapping in the bushes. Another soldier, 
               CRAPPER, is crapping not far away. Spivey can see Dances 
               With Wolves in the distance, still splashing water on his 
               face.

               Now he slips something out of his tunic. It's the journal. 
               He opens it and starts to tear out a page, trying hard not 
               to make noise.

                                     CRAPPER (O.S.)
                         You got paper over there Spivey?

                                     SPIVEY
                         What's it to you?

                                     CRAPPER
                         Well gimme some shitbird.

               Spivey thinks.

                                     SPIVEY
                         Can you read?

                                     CRAPPER
                         Naw, I can't read. What the hell do 
                         you care... you can't either.

               Spivey looks down at the stolen journal, thinking.

                                     SPIVEY
                         Alright... hold your horses.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY

               Two Sioux scouts watch from the brow of a slope above the 
               fort. Having spotted Dances With Wolves, they withdraw.

               We see Dances With Wolves at a distance, being marched back 
               to his "cell" by the detail of soldiers. He's moving awkwardly 
               in his chains.

               INT. SUPPLY HOUSE - DAY

               Dances With Wolves is half-dozing against the wall when Spivey 
               walks in with a plate of army gruel. He's followed by Sergeant 
               Bauer. Spivey sets the plate in front of the prisoner. He 
               admires the breastplate and like a crow eyeing something 
               shiny, he thinks to grab for it.

               Suddenly a pair of manacled hands lock on his wrists. Dances 
               With Wolves face is inches away from Spiveys. Terrified, 
               Spivey pulls away, kicking over the plate of food as he 
               scrambles to safety across the room.

                                     SERGEANT BAUER
                         Lap it up Injun.

               Dances With Wolves sticks a toe under the lip of the plate 
               and flips it over. Most of it hits Spivey, a little splashes 
               on Bauer. Spivey moves to kick the prisoner, but Bauer 
               intercedes with his rifle.

                                     SERGEANT BAUER
                         Go on ahead Injun... You'll just get 
                         hungrier is all... but mebbe that 
                         don't matter. Word is they're gonna 
                         ship you back to Hays. And they'll 
                         hang you once you get there.

               Bauer and Spivey leave him and Dances With Wolves kicks out 
               viciously at the spilled plate.

               EXT. TEMPORARY CAMP - DAY

               There's a tremendous upheaval. Ten Bears' band has halted 
               its march. SIX PAINTED WARRIORS all heavily armed are jumping 
               onto their ponies and being handed the lines to spare mounts. 
               Wind In His Hair is their leader.

               The whole village is up to see them off.

               Smiles A Lot, painted and carrying a bow and quiver rides 
               into the midst of the group. Wind In His Hair studies the 
               resolute boy.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         You will hold our horses... nothing 
                         more.

               Smiles A Lot nods.

               With a great whooping from the villagers, the rescue party 
               roars out of camp.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY

               The wagon is pulling out with an escort of SEVEN SOLDIERS.

               Dances With Wolves' spirits are very low as he sits in the 
               bed of the jolting wagon. Spivey is guarding him.  Elgin is 
               leading the detail.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY.

               Dances with Wolves watches a ridge in the distance for any 
               sign of riders.

                                     SPIVEY
                         I don't see nobody.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Elgin and one of the escort soldiers are scouting far out on 
               the prairie. The lieutenant pauses and looks back at the 
               wagon. It is far behind in the distance, but still coming.

               EXT. WAGON - DAY

               Dances With Wolves is dozing as the wagon jolts across the 
               ground. Suddenly a shot rings out. Dances With Wolves opens 
               his eyes.

               The wagon driver is aiming his rifle out at something on the 
               prairie. He fires again.

               Dances With Wolves looks over the wagon bed and sees Two 
               Socks. He's standing still, fifty yards away. Staring in his 
               old inquisitive way at the wagon.

                                     SPIVEY
                         Lookit the stupid bastard... he ain't 
                         even runnin'.

               Two shots ring out in rapid succession.

                                     BAUER
                         Don't shoot, I seen 'em first... 
                         it's my shot.

               Sergeant Bauer fires his own round. Everyone has missed. 
               Bauer is jamming another cartridge into the chamber.

                                     DRIVER
                         It's my shot goddamit.

               Now Spivey decides to get into the act. He rises up with his 
               rifle aiming.

                                     SPIVEY
                         You dumb sons a bitches.

               Before he can fire, there's a rattling of chains. And the 
               next moment, Spivey's feet are being pulled out from under 
               him by Dances With Wolves. His rifle fires harmlessly into 
               space.

               Bauer turns from the wagon seat and slams the back of the 
               prisoner's head with the gunstock. Dances With Wolves falls 
               back, letting go of the shaken Spivey.

               Bauer smiles at Spivey contemptuously.

                                     BAUER
                         He mighta killed you.

               In the next instant, Spivey gives Dances With Wolves a 
               resounding crack in the sternum with the butt of his rifle 
               and he goes down on his back.

               More shots are fired. Dazedly, Dances With Wolves looks out 
               and sees Two Socks still running parallel to the wagon.

               There's another shot and then shouting.

                                     SOLDIER 1
                         I got him...

                                     SOLDIER 2
                         The hell you did...

                                     SOLDIER 1
                         I got him... dead shot boys.

               Spivey is still poking Dances With Wolves.

                                     SPIVEY
                         You want more?... get up... get up.

                                     ELGIN
                         Spivey!

               Elgin has ridden alongside the wagon.

                                     ELGIN
                         I see you bash the prisoner once 
                         more and I'll put those shackles on 
                         you...

               Elgin's men are headed up towards Two Socks when shots ring 
               out.

                                     ELGIN
                         You men! Get back to your places.

               The camera continues over the hill to Two Socks' body, but 
               it is no where in sight. Instead the Indian war party of six 
               is waiting silently in ambush. Frustrated, they will try 
               again.

               EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

               The wagon is making its way steadily down, toward the river. 
               Dances With Wolves watches the line of growth along the river 
               get closer, his eyes and ears and nose full alert.

               If they come this will be the place to do it. Dances With 
               Wolves will make the most of this hope.

               The wagon moves down a narrow pathway, not much more than a 
               game trail. The lieutenant raises his hand and the wagon 
               halts at the river's edge.

               A soldier rides back and forth in the water on the other 
               side of the river. He's checking for any signs of ambush. 
               The soldier starts back to them.

                                     SOLDIER
                         All clear lieutenant...

               Elgin starts into the water, followed by the wagon. The "all 
               clear" sign means nothing to Dances With Wolves. He's all 
               keyed up.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               Elgin and a soldier are leading the way. They're only a few 
               yards from the opposite bank when the lieutenant is taken. 
               Elgin is completely surprised to find an arrow buried in his 
               chest.

               The outrider is about to pull up his gun when an arrow hits 
               him square in the gut. He brings his head up to see the full 
               force of Wind In His Hair, stringing up another arrow and 
               taking aim.

               Just as the outrider is struggling to raise his gun, Wind In 
               His Hair fires off another arrow deep into the man's heart. 
               The impact sends him flying out of the saddle, dead.

               Wind In His Hair comes on, leading five Sioux warriors.

               EXT. WAGON - DAY

               Dances With Wolves has looped the shackles around Spivey's 
               neck in a death grip when he sees Bauer leveling his rifle 
               at the approaching riders.

               Dances With Wolves aims a vicious kick at Bauer, sending the 
               rifle flying, and Bauer over the edge of the wagon. Bauer 
               flounders in the water, fumbling for his pistol. He sends 
               off a round taking one of the on rushing warriors in the 
               shoulder. The Sioux looses his seat and tumbles off the pony 
               into the water, wounded.

               EXT. WAGON - DAY

               Dances With Wolves snaps the loop around Spivey's neck as 
               hard as he can and bone breaks.

               Dances With Wolves is beating Spivey furiously with his 
               chains. He keeps whacking until the blood is spreading on 
               the surface of the water.

               The frantic driver is about to make a run for it when he is 
               impaled with a Sioux lance.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               The two soldiers in the back of the wagon have turned tail 
               and are splashing back across the river.

               As they scramble up the bank, two Sioux warriors meet them 
               and cut them down with hatchets.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               In the midst of the smoke and confusion of the battle, Bauer 
               has made his way to the cover of the weeds along the river 
               bank.

               Crashing through the thicket, he comes to a clearing and 
               there in the shallows, comes face to face with Smiles A Lot. 
               The boy is standing in the shallows holding the extra horses.

               The boy is so frightened at the sudden sight of this white 
               soldier that he doesn't move. Bauer sticks his revolver into 
               Smiles A Lot's face and pulls the trigger. But the hammer 
               only clicks. The gun is empty.

               Bauer pistol-whips the boy, knocking him to the ground and 
               grabs for the closest of the horses. But the ponies are all 
               stirred up now and starting to run down the river.

               Bauer succeeds in grabbing a hunk of mane, but the horse 
               he's gotten hold of is moving too fast for him to get on. 
               But now Bauer hears a bone-chilling whoop. Wind In His Hair 
               is coming.

               His pony plows through the water at full speed. A skullcracker 
               dangles from one hand. The warrior begins to whirl it around.

               Terrified, Bauer turns to run. Before he can take a step, a 
               hatchet buries itself to the hilt. Smiles A Lot is at the 
               other end. But Bauer is not through.

               His hands are around the boy's neck, choking him with his 
               last seconds of life. A larger than life Wind In His Hair 
               draws even and swings his club. Bauer's head explodes, 
               covering Smiles A Lot in blood -- the sergeant's hands cannot 
               be seen.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               Still in chains, Dances With Wolves and Wind In His Hair are 
               dragging Elgin's body onto shore. Dances With Wolves rifles 
               through the dead man's pockets. He finds a set of keys and 
               plops down to unlock his shackles.

               The wounded Indian warrior is being tended to. Smiles A Lot 
               is downstream washing Bauer's blood off.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               A warrior is stripping down Spivey. He holds up the dead 
               man's tunic, but doesn't notice that something plops out.

               It's the journal. It floats off into the current, well out 
               of Dances With Wolves field of vision. It is lost forever.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               The journal continues its downstream journey. Suddenly a 
               small hand reaches down and scoops it out of the water.

               Smiles A Lot holds the book close to his face amazed at the 
               sight of words.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               The party is mounting. Smiles A Lot rides up next to Dances 
               With Wolves.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         Dances With Wolves... look.

               He offers the book. Dances With Wolves takes it, regarding 
               the journal.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DUSK

               The rescue party is cantering across the prairie.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                              (to Wind In His Hair)
                         We go South?

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         We will ride South for two days... 
                         then turn East. No one must follow.

               This doesn't seem to bother Wind In His Hair. But it sets 
               Dances With Wolves to thinking.

               EXT. CANYON TRAIL - DAY

               The sound of a single drum calls attention to eight 
               silhouettes on horseback making their way down the ridge. 
               The entire village begins to rumble with excitement as the 
               news spreads.

               EXT. CANYON TRAIL - DAY

               The rescue party is walking down the trail single file. Dances 
               With Wolves is a few slots back. All the village is racing 
               up the canyon to greet them.

               Stands With A Fist leads them all. She runs to Dances With 
               Wolves. She jumps all over her husband and finally he lifts 
               her up on his pony.

               INT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - DAY

               The couple we have come to know are sitting on their bed.

               Dances With Wolves is combing Stands With A Fist's hair. 
               It's something he is doing with care and affection. She is 
               loving it as much as he. They are together as two people can 
               be and yet it is a hard time.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         You have nothing to say?

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         What can I tell you?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         What ever is on your mind.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         We have decided. You are my husband. 
                         I am your wife. That is all I know.

               Dances With Wolves lays his forehead on her back. He sighs. 
               Then he pulls away, slips a robe around his shoulders and 
               walks out of the lodge.

               Sadly, she watches him go.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               We follow a pair of boots walking in the snow. Pan up to 
               find an ORDERLY bringing coffee to a MAJOR. He is surrounded 
               by other officers and in front of him a large column of men 
               is moving toward the snow covered mountains.

               The Major tosses the remaining coffee in a fire and he 
               prepares to mount.

               We pan up with the smoke and the steam.

               EXT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - DAY

               It's cold in the Sioux camp. A warm column of smoke is 
               spiraling out of Ten Bears' lodge.

               INT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - DAY

               Several men are gathered around Ten Bears' fire, including 
               Kicking Bird, Wind In His Hair and Dances With Wolves.

               All the men are draped with blankets. The wind is howling 
               outside. The men are engaged in small talk as the pipe goes 
               around the circle.

               The pipe comes around to Dances With Wolves, and the man 
               next to him must nudge him to attention. Dances With Wolves 
               takes the pipe and begins to smoke.

               Ten Bears watches him closely.

                                     TEN BEARS
                              (to Dances With Wolves)
                         Dances With Wolves is quiet these 
                         days.

               He does not reply. He smokes a little more and passes the 
               pipe.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Is his heart bad?

               Dances With Wolves glances at the men around the fire.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Killing the soldiers at the river 
                         was a good thing. It made me free 
                         and my heart was big to see my friends 
                         coming to help me. I did not mind 
                         killing those men. I was glad to do 
                         it.

               He searches for the right words.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         But the soldiers hate me now like 
                         they hate no other. I am more than 
                         an enemy to them, I am a traitor. 
                         They will hunt for me. They will not 
                         give up. And when they find me they 
                         find you and that cannot happen.

               Objections break out all around the fire. Wind In His Hair 
               jumps to his feet and even Kicking Bird is protesting.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Quiet!... sit down Wind In His Hair. 
                         You are hurting an old man's ears 
                         with your loud talk.

               EXT. FOREST - DAY

               The column of soldiers can be heard but not seen. They are 
               moving forward, singing the Battle Hymn of The Republic.

               INT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - DUSK

               Stands With A Fist is building up the fire in their cozy 
               home. Dances With Wolves works on a long-stemmed pipe which 
               is in the last stages of completion.

                                     TEN BEARS (O.S.)
                         Dances With Wolves?

               Dances With Wolves gets up, opens the flap and admits the 
               old chief. A few snowflakes cling to his wispy hair.

               He goes straight to the fire and sits.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Ahh... this is a nice fire... at my 
                         age a good fire is better than 
                         anything.

               Stands With A Fist brings two small bowls of food, places 
               them next to the men and busies herself with something else. 
               Though neither one is much interested they begin to eat.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         I wondered how your bad heart was 
                         doing and though I would come by and 
                         see for myself. This place doesn't 
                         look so bad-hearted.

               Dances With Wolves smiles.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         No, we are happy.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         But you are leaving anyway?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I have talked with Stands With a 
                         Fist and we will go together.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Have you told this to Kicking Bird 
                         or to Wind In His Hair.

               It's anguish for Dances with Wolves to think about his 
               friends. He shakes his head "no". Ten Bears thinks again in 
               silence.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         You are the only white man I have 
                         ever known. I have thought about you 
                         alot. More than you know.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         That does not surprise me.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         You have always spoken with your 
                         heart. And like all of us, you are a 
                         free man and can do anything you 
                         like. When I look across this fire, 
                         I do not see a white soldier. I see 
                         only a Sioux named Dances With Wolves. 
                         And there is nothing they hate so 
                         much as a Sioux.

               Ten Bears words always have purpose and as always, he makes 
               his point.

               He pauses for a moment and notices Dances with Wolves' nearly 
               finished pipe.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         You are making a pipe?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Yes?

               Ten Bears holds out a hand and Dances with Wolves hands the 
               pipe to him. Ten Bears inspects it briefly.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         This might be a pretty good pipe... 
                         how does it smoke?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I don't know, I haven't tried it 
                         yet.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Let's smoke it awhile... it is good 
                         to pass the time this way.

               EXT. WINTER CAMP - DAWN

               From a little distance, Wind In His Hair is watching Dances 
               With Wolves' lodge. His face is full of uncertainty and a 
               kind of pain we have never seen before. He is in agony.

               He starts forward but after a few yards he stops to think. 
               He turns back but has only gone a few steps when he stops 
               and turns to face Dances With Wolves' lodge once more. He 
               starts for the tipi again, but he can't go thru with it. The 
               proud warrior turns away and walks quickly out of sight.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               The column is moving at a leisurely walk when the horses 
               start to bunch up. They're stopping.

               Everyone waits while far up ahead, a group of ten or twelve 
               men examine the ground. White officers sits atop their horses, 
               while their scouts scour the ground. They've found a 
               significant trail.

               The scouts are Indian, and by their distinctive dress, we 
               recognize them. They are Pawnee.

               The Pawnee scouts come racing up. Their horses are wet and 
               have come a good distance. The scouts are very excited.

               The men have dismounted. They prepare for battle, removing 
               any equipment that might rattle -- tin cups, plates, etc., 
               tossing the discards into a growing pile.

               INT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAWN

               Black Shawl watches as Kicking Bird slips a magnificent pipe 
               into its buckskin case. Now he looks at her. The medicine 
               man too is in a kind of pain we have not seen before.

               EXT. WINTER CAMP - DAWN

               Carrying the pipe he made, Dances With Wolves walks through 
               the village. Suddenly he stops. Kicking Bird is standing in 
               the middle of the empty avenue.

               Like gunfighters, the two men approach each other at a slow 
               and deliberate walk.

               Gradually they realize that each has selected the same parting 
               gift. It's heartbreaking. Kicking Bird tries to cover with a 
               casual question, but it's all fake.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         You've finished your pipe? How does 
                         it smoke?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I'm told it smokes well.

               Dances With Wolves moves to make the exchange. Kicking Bird 
               does the same. From one hand to the other. Men couldn't be 
               closer.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         It doesn't seem possible that we 
                         could come this far.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         You were the first man I ever wanted 
                         to be like. I will not forget you.

               Neither can speak. There is only goodbye.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               The column of soldiers is not in a rush, but they're trotting 
               now to make better time.

               EXT. WINTER CAMP - DAY

               Stands With A Fist sits on a pony outside the lodge. Two 
               pack horses are loaded with their things.

               Dances With Wolves swings onto his pony's back and we follow 
               as they start out of the village. No one is standing in rose 
               to watch them leave. No one is crying. In fact, people are 
               making the motions of going about their regular work.

               But it's all fake too. The whole village is sad and the most 
               obvious sign is that there is no sound. In the awful quiet, 
               most people avert their eyes as the two pass by.

               EXT. CANYON TRAIL - DAY

               Dances With Wolves and Stands With A Fist have reached the 
               head of the trail leading out of the winter camp. They have 
               just begun to ascend when a voice, calling from afar, brings 
               them to a halt. The sound echoes through the canyons, through 
               the village.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR (O.S.)
                              (calling)
                         Dances With Wolves...

               EXT. CANYON - DAY

               His pony is jacked up and, as always, Wind In His Hair looks 
               the perfect warrior. But now his face is full of stress as 
               he screams out the message he could not deliver in person.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         I am Wind In His Hair...

               EXT. WINTER CAMP - DAY

               Everyone in the camp has stopped to listen.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR (O.S.)
                         Can you not see that I am your friend?

               EXT. CANYON TRAIL - DAY

               Dances With Wolves looks ready to crack.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR (O.S.)
                         Can you not see that you will always 
                         be my friend?

               Dances With Wolves lets the unhappy echo of these words fade 
               away before he starts his pony again. We follow for a few 
               yards. Then the call comes a second time. If anything, more 
               urgent than before.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR (O.S.)
                         Dances With Wolves...

               Dances With Wolves stops. He drops his head painfully as the 
               sound of his own name booms through his head.

               EXT. CANYON TRAIL - DUSK

               Troops are moving through the trees quietly, sabers drawn.

               EXT. CANYON RIM - DUSK

               The rest of the troops have moved to the edge. They too are 
               quiet. Down below, the Pawnee scouts are milling about looking 
               for sign.

               The soldiers from the canyon floor are silently arriving on 
               the scene. The Pawnee look to the lead scout on the canyon 
               rim. They have no answer, and the lead scout has none to 
               give the general at his side. Ten Bears' village is gone.

               EXT. CANYON RIM - DUSK

               Wind In His Hair and several other warriors are just drawing 
               back from unseen vantage points on the canyon rim. Wind In 
               His Hair glances back and hesitates, as though waiting for 
               someone. A great, yellow full moon has just appeared above 
               the opposite rim of the canyon. The yellow is brilliant, a 
               great spotlight of golden color.

               A wolf steps into the light on the opposite rim. He's walking 
               in the backdrop of the moon. The wolf suddenly arches his 
               back, sticks his muzzle in the air and produces a spine-
               tingling howl. The sound bounces all over the canyon.

               Dances With Wolves is at the canyon's rim. He listens a long 
               time, fully entranced by the wolf's howl. He is still 
               listening when it is gone. A whisper floats out of the night 
               behind him.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR (O.S.)
                         Dances With Wolves...

               Dances With Wolves shrinks back from the canyon's rim, turns 
               and trots off into the darkness, following his friends.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

                                         THE END
DAWN OF
THE DEAD
(The working draft 1977)
by George A. Romero


1	We see the face of a young woman. She is asleep. It is very
	quiet at first, as credits appear. The woman's face begins to
	twitch, as though she is having a bad dream. She moans slightly
	and her expression grows more desperate.

	A mix of subtle sounds begin to fade in. As they get louder, we
	can discern what sounds like a busy office area. It is actually
	a frantic television studio with the hum of panic in a national
	emergency.

	The woman's moans get louder and more desperate as the
	background sounds reach full volume and the credits stop. The
	woman sits up, snapping awake.

2	She lurches forwards into the arms of a strong young man. She is
	Francine, twenty three years old and very attractive, although
	she is gritty with dirt. Her hair is hanging, dishevelled and
	sweaty. Her jeans and blouse have been worn for several days.

	She is sitting on the floor, where she has slept the last
	several hours, covered by an old overcoat.

	Tony:	YOU OK?

	Fran stares at the young man. She is shaking. She doesn't speak.

	Tony:	THE SHIT'S REALLY HITTING THE FAN.

	The girl tries to clear her head as the young man moves on to
	where others sleep on the floor. He wakes them up one at a time.
	We begin to hear voices over the busy hum of the studio. They
	have an electronic tinniness, as broadcast over a monitor. Fran
	looks about. She is still shaken from her dream.

3	We see the television studio. Reporters buzz about madly.
	Everybody looks dishevelled and exhausted. Technicians man
	monitors, and we see people on the little screens, arguing
	emotionally.

4	Voice:	WHAT'S MAKING IT HAPPEN? WHAT THE HELL
			DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE, WHAT'S MAKING IT
			HAPPEN.

	Voice:	YES, BUT THAT'S...

	Voice:	THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER STUDY. THEY'RE TRYING...

	Voice:	BUT IF WE KNEW THAT, WE COULD...

	Voice:	WE DON'T KNOW THAT! WE DON'T KNOW THAT!
			WE'VE GOTTA OPERATE ON WHAT WE DO KNOW!

5	The room is pandemonium. People run in with wire copy; others
	organise the stacks of bulletins as they arrive. Others trip
	over cables and generally get in each other's way.

6	Francine stares at the madness, still trying to clear her head.

	Man's voice: I'M STILL DREAMING.

	Fran turns her head. Another young man sits next to her on the
	floor. He is one of the ones Tony awakened.

	Fran:	NO YOU'RE NOT.

	Woman:	MY TURN WITH THE COAT.

	Fran looks up. A young woman is offering her coffee in a paper
	cup. She is next in line for the overcoat and a few hours sleep.
	Fran takes the coffee and struggles to her feet.

	Woman:	THE GUYS ON THE CREW ARE GETTING CRAZY.
			A BUNCH OF 'EM FLEW THE COOP ALREADY.
			I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER WE'LL BE ABLE
			TO STAY ON AIR.

7	Fran staggers over to the control consoles. The technicians are
	at the end of their ropes.

	Technicians: (all at once)
			WATCH CAMERA TWO...WHO THE HELL'S ON CAMERA
			TWO, A BLIND MAN...
			WATCH THE FRAME...WATCH THE FRAME...
			ROLL THE RESCUE STATIONS AGAIN.

	Technicians: WE GOT A REPORT THAT HALF THOSE RESCUE
			STATIONS HAVE BEEN KNOCKED OUT.
			SO GET ME A NEW LIST.
			SURE, I'LL PULL IT OUTA MY ASS.

	Fran focuses on the monitors. She is incredulous... stunned by
	the madness which surrounds her. She realises the hopelessness
	of the situation as she zeroes in on the televised conversation.

8	We begin to listen over the din of the news room.

	TV Man 1:    I DON'T BELIEVE THAT, DOCTOR, AND I DON'T
			BELIEVE...

	TV Man 2:    DO YOU BELIEVE THE DEAD ARE RETURNING TO
			LIFE?

	TV Man 1:    I'M NOT SO...

	TV Man 2:    DO YOU BELIEVE THE DEAD ARE RETURNING TO
			LIFE AND ATTACKING THE LIVING?

	TV Man 1:    I'M NOT SO SURE WHAT TO BELIEVE DOCTOR!

9	Suddenly we cut into the studio, and we see the argument as it
	is being shot.

	TV Man 1:    (con't)
			ALL WE GET IS WHAT YOU PEOPLE TELL US.
			AND IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO BELIEVE...

	TV Man 2:    IT'S FACT... IT'S FACT...

	TV Man 1:    IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO BELIEVE WITHOUT YOU
			COMING IN HERE AND TELLING US WE HAVE TO
			FORGET ALL HUMAN DIGNITY AND...

	TV Man 2:    HUMAN DIG... YOU CAN'T...

	TV Man 1:    ...FORGET ALL HUMAN DIGNITY...

	TV Man 2:    YOU'RE NOT RUNNING A TALK SHOW HERE, MR.
			BERMAN...YOU CAN FORGET PITCHING AN AUDIENCE
			THE MORAL BULL SHIT THEY WANT TO HEAR!

	TV Man 1:    YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ABANDONING EVERY HUMAN
			CODE OF BEHAVIOUR, AND THERE'S A LOT OF US
			WHO AREN'T READY FOR THAT DOCTOR FOSTER...

10	 A great cry of assent goes up from the studio floor. Doctor
	Foster is flustered and frustrated. The stage hands and
	cameramen are all screaming at him, swearing and ridiculing. We
	notice Police guards, armed, at the studio doors. They control
	the traffic in and out of the big room.

11	 Back at the control panel. Fran stares at the screens. Confusion
	still reigns.

	Man:	 FRANNIE, GET ON THE NEW LIST OF RESCUE STATIONS.
			CHARLIE'S RECEIVING ON THE EMERGENCIES...

	Fran pulls herself away from the monitors as the argument rages
	on screen.

12	 She fights through the heavy traffic and reaches Charlie, a
	harassed typist who holds the receiver of an emergency radio
	unit under his chin...

	Charlie:	(into receiver)
			SAY AGAIN...CAN'T HEAR YOU... 

	Fran:	RESCUE STATIONS?

	Fran leafs through sheets of paper on Charlie's desk. He writes
	notes as he listens on the receiver, and he speaks to the woman.

	Charlie:	HALF THOSE ARE INOPERATIVE ANY MORE.
			I'M TRYIN' TO FIND OUT AT LEAST ABOUT THE
			IMMEDIATE AREA. WE'VE HAD OLD INFORMATION
			ON THE AIR FOR THE LAST TWELVE HOURS.

	Fran:	THESE ARE RESCUE STATIONS. WE CAN'T SEND
			PEOPLE TO INOPERATIVE...

	Charlie:	(into receiver)
			SAY AGAIN, NEW HOPE...

	Charlie makes more notes and hands them to Fran. Still listening
	on the receiver, he speaks to the woman again.

	Charlie:	I'M DOIN' WHAT I CAN. THESE ARE DEFINITE
			AS OF NOW. SKIP AND DUSTY ARE ON THE RADIO,
			TOO. GOOD LUCK.

	Fran snatches up the sheets and moves across the room.

13	 She stops at the consoles...

	Fran:	I'M GONNA KNOCK OFF THE OLD RESCUE STATIONS.
			I'LL HAVE THE NEW ONES READY AS SOON AS I CAN.

	Technician:  WE'RE SENDING PEOPLE TO PLACES THAT HAVE
			CLOSED DOWN. I'M GONNA KILL THE OLD LIST.

14	 Fran moves toward another control room. An armed officer stops
	her. A young man rushing through with copy intercedes.

	Man:	 HEY, SHE'S ALRIGHT.

	Officer:	WHERE'S YOUR BADGE?

	Fran reaches instinctively for the lapel of her blouse. Her
	badge is missing.

	Fran:	JESUS!

	Man:	 SHE'S ALRIGHT.

	Fran:	I HAD IT...I WAS ASLEEP OVER THERE...

	She makes a move toward the corner where she was asleep.

	Man:	 SOMEBODY STOLE IT. THERE'S A LOT OF 'EM
			MISSING.
			(to officer)
			SHE'S ALRIGHT. LET HER THROUGH.

	The officer reluctantly steps aside.

15	 The young man and Fan move down a crowded hall and into a small
	camera room. The foot traffic is solid. They talk as they walk.

	Fran:	I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

	Man:	 ONE OF THOSE LITTLE BADGES CAN OPEN A LOT
			OF DOORS...YOU AVOID A LOT OF HASSLES IF
			YOU GOT A BADGE...ANY KIND OF BADGE...

	Fran:	IT'S REALLY GOING CRAZY.

16	 They reach a small camera installation. The camera is aimed at a
	machine which rolls out a list of rescue stations. The list is
	superimposed over the live broadcast as it goes out.

	Cameraman:   YOU GOT NEW ONES?

	Fran:	I GOTTA TYPE 'EM UP. KILL THE OLD ONES.

	Cameraman:   GIVENS WANT 'EM...

	Fran:	KILL 'EM, DICK. TELL GIVENS TO SEE ME!

	The man clicks off his camera. Fran moves toward the studio.

17	 On the monitors, we see the rescue stations blink off over shots
	of the two men who still argue on the air.

	TV Man 1:    WELL I DON'T BELIEVE IN GHOSTS, DOCTOR.

	TV Man 2:    THESE ARE NOT GHOSTS. NOR ARE THESE HUMANS!
			THESE ARE DEAD CORPSES. ANY UN-BURIED HUMAN
			CORPSE WITH ITS BRAIN INTACT WILL IN FACT
			RE-ACTIVATE. AND IT'S PRECISELY BECAUSE OF
			INCITEMENT BY IRRESPONSIBLE PUBLIC FIGURES
			LIKE YOURSELF THAT THIS SITUATION IS BEING
			DEALT WITH IRRESPONSIBLY BY THE PUBLIC AT
			LARGE!

18	 Another outraged cry goes up from the stagehands and observers.
	Doctor Foster tries to out-scream the cries...

	TV Man 2:    YOU HAVE NOT LISTENED...YOU HAVE NOT LISTENED...
			FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS...WHAT DOES IT TAKE...
			WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE PEOPLE SEE?

19	 Fran moves into the large studio area where the broadcasters
	argue. The commotion is maddening. Fran stares for a moment.

20	 TV Man 2:    (now distraught...almost pleading)
			THIS SITUATION IS CONTROLLABLE. PEOPLE
			MUST COME TO GRIPS WITH THIS CONCEPT.
			IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT...WITH FRIENDS...
			WITH FAMILY...BUT A DEAD BODY MUST BE DE-
			ACTIVATED BY EITHER DESTROYING THE BRAIN
			OR SEVERING THE BRAIN FROM THE REST OF THE
			BODY.

	Another outburst in the studio.

	TV Man 2:    THE SITUATION MUST BE CONTROLLED...BEFORE IT'S
			TOO LATE...THEY ARE MULTIPLYING TOO RAPIDLY...

21	 Fran moves through the crowded room of emotional people and
	finally reaches another emergency radio installation. Skip and
	Dusty are trying to listen to their receivers. They jot notes.

	Fran:	OPERATIVE RESCUE STATIONS?

	Dusty:	THEY'RE DROPPIN' LIKE FLIES. HERE'S A FEW.
			YOU KNOW, I THINK FOSTER'S RIGHT. I THINK
			WE'RE LOSIN' THIS WAR.

	Fran:	YEAH, BUT NOT TO THE ENEMY.
			WE'RE BLOWIN' IT OURSELVES.

	She gives the rest of her coffee to the two men.

	Fran:	NOT MUCH LEFT, BUT HAVE A BALL.

	The two men each slug eagerly from the paper cup. Fran rushes
	off toward a large teleprompter typing machine.

22	 The broadcasters still argue emotionally.

	TV Man 1:    PEOPLE AREN'T WILLING TO ACCEPT YOUR SOLUTIONS,
			DOCTOR, AND I, FOR ONE, DON'T BLAME THEM.

	TV Man 2:    EVERY DEAD BODY THAT IS NOT EXTERMINATED
			BECOMES ONE OF THEM! IT GETS UP AND KILLS!
			THE PEOPLE IT KILLS GET UP AND KILL!

23	 Handing the list of active rescue stations to the teleprompter
	typist, Fran rushes back toward the control room.

24	 Around the monitor consoles, the commotion has been made even
	more frantic by an angered Dan Givens, obviously one of the
	station managers.

	Givens:	 NOBODY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT, I WANT...

	Givens spots Fran as she moves into the room.

	Givens:	 GARRET, WHO TOLD YOU TO KILL THE SUPERS?

	Fran:	NOBODY. I KILLED 'EM. THEY'RE OUT OF DATE.

	Givens:	 I WANT THOSE SUPERS ON THE AIR ALL THE TIME.

	Fran:	ARE YOU WILLING TO MURDER PEOPLE BY SENDING THEM
			OUT TO STATIONS THAT HAVE CLOSED DOWN?

	Givens:	 WITHOUT THOSE RESCUE STATIONS ON SCREEN EVERY
			MINUTE PEOPLE WON'T WATCH US. THEY'LL TUNE OUT.

	Fran stares at the red faced man in disbelief.

	Givens:	 I WANT THAT LIST UP ON THE SCREEN EVERY MINUTE THAT
			WE'RE ON THE AIR.

	Fran is about to say something in anger, but before she can, one
	of the technicians, having overheard Givens, gets up from the
	control panel and starts to walk away.

	Givens:	 LUCAS...LUCAS, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING...
			GET ON THAT CONSOLE...LUCAS...WE'RE ON THE AIR!

	Lucas:	ANYBODY NEED A RIDE!

25	 Two other men from various positions in the room snatch up
	personal effects and follow the technician toward the door. The
	door is guarded by a nervous Officer.

26	 Givens:	 OFFICER...OFFICER...YOU STOP THEM...STOP THOSE
			MEN...LUCAS...GET BACK ON THIS CONSOLE...

	A frantic hubbub begins over the lack of console control. People
	rush in and out, the floor director's voice can be heard over a
	talk back system...

	Voices:	 WHAT THE HELL'S GOIN' ON IN THERE.
			SWITCH...SWITCH...THERE'S NO SWITCHER...
			WE'RE LOSING PICTURE...

	Givens:	 OFFICER...STOP THOSE MEN...
	 
27	 The young officer faces the men as they reach his post. He takes
	a grip on his rifles, opens the door and lets the group through.
	Then he runs out himself, deserting the losing cause.

28	 Givens jumps toward the console. He frantically tries to work
	the complex dials and pots...

	Givens:	 GET SOMEBODY IN HERE THAT KNOWS HOW TO RUN
			THIS THING...COME ON...I'LL TRIPLE THE MONEY
			FOR THE MAN THAT CAN RUN THIS THING...TRIPLE
			THE MONEY...WE'RE STAYING ON THE AIR...

	Fran moves slowly off toward the studio.

29	 In the big room, the tension is thicker than ever. A few of the
	newsmen still earnestly try to perform their various functions,
	but most of the crew are reduced to emotional polarisation over
	the broadcast which still rages.

30	 TV Man 2:    THEY KILL FOR ONE REASON.
			THEY KILL FOR FOOD.
			THEY EAT THEIR VICTIMS, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT,
			MR. BERMAN. THAT'S WHAT KEEPS THEM GOING.

31	 Fran stops to listen to the argument. She falls back into the
	shadows of the studio. People rush past her, some leaving the
	studio in disgust.

32	 TV Man 2:    IF WE'D LISTENED...IF WE'D DEALT WITH THE
			PHENOMENON PROPERLY...WITHOUT EMOTION...
			WITHOUT...EMOTION...
			IT WOULDN'T HAVE COME TO THIS!

	Foster wipes his sweat with a dirty hanker chief. He pulls his
	tie away from his tight collar, and pops the shirt button open.
	He is desperate now, shivering with anger and frustration.

	TV Man 2:    THERE IS A MARTIAL LAW STATE IN EFFECT IN
			PHILADELPHIA...AS IN ALL OTHER MAJOR CITIES IN
			THE COUNTRY...
			CITIZENS MUST UNDERSTAND THE...DIRE...DIRE
			CONSEQUENCES OF THIS PHENOMENON...SHOULD WE
			BE UNABLE TO CHECK THE SPREAD...
			BECAUSE OF THE EMOTIONAL ATTITUDES..OF THE
			CITIZENRY...TOWARD...THESE ISSUES OF...
			MORALITY...
			IT IS THE ORDER OF THE O.E.P. BY COMMAND OF THE
			FEDERAL GOVERNMENT...THE PRESIDENT OF THE
			UNITED STATES...
			CITIZENS MAY NO LONGER OCCUPY PRIVATE RESIDENCES,
			NO MATTER HOW SAFELY PROTECTED OR WELL STOCKED...

	A murmur in the studio begins to build to an emotional
	crescendo. Foster tries to talk over the noise...

	TV Man 2:    CITIZENS WILL BE MOVED INTO CENTRAL AREAS OF
			THE CITY...

33	 Technicians abandon their posts. A few others jump in to take
	their places, but pandemonium reigns. A cameraman whips off his
	headset and breaks for the door. His camera spins on its liquid
	head, and on the monitors, we see a whirling blur as Foster
	continues to speak.

	Fran moves quickly for the spinning camera. She aims it back at
	the sweating Foster, and she stares through the viewfinder not
	believing what she is seeing.

34	 TV Man 2:    THE BODIES OF THE DEAD WILL BE DELIVERED OVER
			TO SPECIALLY EQUIPPED SQUADS OF THE NATIONAL
			GUARD FOR ORGANISED DISPOSITION...

35	 Suddenly a man darts out of the bustling crowd and comes up
	quickly behind Fran.

	Steve:	FRANNIE...AT NINE O'CLOCK MEET ME ON THE ROOF.
			WE'RE GETTING OUT.

	Fran:	(letting the camera slip slightly)
			STEPHEN...I DON'T BELIEVE THIS...WHAT...

	Steve:	WE'RE GETTING OUT. IN THE CHOPPER.

	Another technician steps over to take the camera from Fran.
	Stephen talks more quietly in the other man's presence.

	Steve:	NINE P.M. ALRIGHT?

	Fran:	STEVE...WE CAN'T...WE'VE GOT TO...

	Steve:	WE'VE GOT TO NOTHING, FRAN. WE'VE GOT TO
			SURVIVE. SOMEBODY'S GOT TO SURVIVE. NOW YOU
			COULD BE UP THERE AT NINE. DON'T MAKE ME COME
			LOOKIN' FOR YA.

	Stephen is gone in a flash. Fran nervously looks back at the
	cameraman. The argument still rages between Foster and Berman.
	The cameraman, without taking his eye from the viewfinder,
	speaks to Francine quietly and slowly.

	Cameraman:   GO AHEAD. WE'LL BE OFF THE AIR BY MIDNIGHT
			ANYWAY. EMERGENCY NETWORKS ARE TAKING OVER.
			OUR RESPONSIBILITY... IS FINISHED, I'M AFRAID.

36	 It is dusk, and the city of Philadelphia is surprisingly quiet.
	We see several large buildings. They are part of a low-income
	housing project, and their lack of grace is evident. They stand
	like tombstones as the first stars appear in the navy blue sky.

37	 Under cover of the growing darkness, activities of the S.W.A.T.
	Unit go unnoticed. Grappling hooks grab against the lip around
	the roof and silent figures climb to the top of the building.
	Men in armour vests, clutching the latest in special weapons,
	take position here and there about the development.

	Other men strategically place their cars and trucks in the court
	below.

38	 On the roof, at an entrance to one of the building's fire
	stairs, Roger squats silently alongside three other team
	members. The men check their weapons. Roger looks at his watch.
	The sweep hand reaches the 12...

	Roger:	(to himself) LIGHTS.

39	 In an instant, large searchlights bathe the side of the
	building. The troop commander, shielded with other Officers
	behind a large truck, shouts through an electric bullhorn.

	Commander:   MARTINEZ...YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING...YOU KNOW WE
			HAVE THE BUILDING SURROUNDED...

	The electronically amplified voice echoes through the concrete
	caverns between the buildings of the project. There are only a
	few windows which glow with lights from inside. At the sound of
	the bullhorn, the lights all blink out one at a time.

	Commander:   (not over the bullhorn)
			LITTLE BASTARD'S GOT 'EM ALL MOVED INTO ONE
			BUILDING...DUMB LITTLE BASTARD!

	Sergeant:    LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE GONNA TRY TO FIGHT US.

	Commander:   (on the bullhorn again)
			MARTINEZ...THE PEOPLE IN THIS PROJECT ARE YOUR
			RESPONSIBILITY...WE DON'T WANT ANY OF THEM HURT
			AND NEITHER DO YOU!

42	 There is no sign of life in the building. The great concrete
	slab is silhouetted silently against the darkening sky.

43	 Roger, and his team mates, crouch in readiness. The sound of the
	bullhorn rises to them easily and clearly.

	Roger:	I'M GIVIN' YOU THREE MINUTES, MARTINEZ...

	Commander:   (Bullhorn)
			I'M GIVIN' YOU THREE MINUTES, MARTINEZ...
			TURN OVER YOUR WEAPONS AND SURRENDER...

	Roger:	THERE ARE NO CHARGES AGAINST YOU...

	Commander:   THERE ARE NO CHARGES AGAINST YOU OR ANY OF YOUR
			PEOPLE...

	Roger:	YET.

	Commander:   THREE MINUTES, MARTINEZ.

	Roger:	AND COUNTING.
			(he looks at his watch)

	There is a long silence.

	Roger:	COME ON, MARTINEZ!

	One of the other S.W.A.T. team members is a big man, with a
	rough and vicious looking face. He is WOOLEY, a hardened
	veteran, and a red neck of the first order.

	Wooley:	 YEAH, COME ON, MARTINEZ...SHOW YOUR GREASY
			LITTLE PUERTO RICAN ASS...SO I CAN BLOW IT OFF...

	Roger looks over at the big man. He is distressed at the pent up
	violence in Wooley.

	Wooley:	 I'LL BLOW ALL THEIR ASSES OFF...LOW LIFE BASTARDS..
			BLOW ALL THEIR LITTLE LOW LIFE PUERTO RICAN AND
			NIGGER ASSES RIGHT OFF...

	Roger is greatly concerned. He looks at one of the other men, a
	young, smoothed faced rookie. The boy doesn't know now to react.
	He is obviously nervous.

	Roger:	KEEP COOL. JUST DON'T POP OFF IN THERE WHEN WE
			GO IN.

	The boy nods, grateful for a more human contact.

	Wooley:	 HOW THE HELL COME WE STICK THESE LOW LIFES
			IN THESE BIG ASS FANCY HOTELS ANYWAY? SHIT
			MAN. THIS' BETTER THAN I GOT. YOU AIN'T
			GONNA TALK 'EM OUTA HERE. YOU GOTTA BLOW
			'EM OUT. BLOW THEIR ASSES!

	Roger:	(to the boy)
			YOU GONNA BE ALRIGHT?

	The boy nods in the affirmative.

	Wooley:	 LET'S GET ON WITH IT. THIS IS A WASTE OF
			MY TIME!

44	 CRASH! Without warning, the metal door to the fire stair bursts
	open and several figures rush out of the darkness. Shots are
	fired from hand guns. A bullet smashes through the skull of the
	young boy next to Roger. He falls against Roger with a pleading
	expression on his face.

	Figures charge this way and that. More gunfire. The other
	S.W.A.T. men dodge and dive for cover. Wooley opens fire with
	his automatic weapon.

45	 On the street, the Commander, hearing the gunfire, barks into
	the bullhorn:

	Commander:   MOVE IN...MOVE IN...
			GODDAMMIT!

	Sergeant:    (into walkie talkie)
			ALL UNITS... FULL OPERATION!

46	 On the roof, Roger struggles under the dead weight of the young
	man. He tries to free himself and his weapons. Shots ring out.

	A handful of Black and Puerto Rican youngsters charge about the
	rooftop. Another S.W.A.T. patrol appears from behind a large
	elevator housing. The young civilians retreat. Several are mowed
	down.

	Another bullet smashes against the dead S.W.A.T. man's back.
	Just as Roger frees himself, a bullet catches him squarely in
	the chest, but his armour takes the impact. He is thrown back
	off balance, and he struggles to catch his wind as he scrambles
	over to recover his weapon which skitters away across the roof
	top.

	Before he reaches the gun, he is cut off by the looming figure
	of one of the Black youths, pistol in hand. Roger freezes. The
	young man aims his hand gun, but hesitates. A sudden barrage of
	bullets rips through the young Black and he falls in a pool of
	blood. It was Wooley's gun that killed him.

	Wooley:	 COME ON YOU DUMB BASTARDS...
			COME AND GET 'EM...

	He fires again and again, even though the skirmish is winding
	down.

	Roger charges for his weapon, snatches it up, and runs for the
	cover of an incinerator housing. He startles a young civilian
	who was hiding there, trying to load his gun. The boy makes a
	break...

	Roger:	HOLD IT...

	The boy freezes for a moment, then, thinking, breaks into a run
	across the roof.

	Roger:	HOLD IT, KID...DON'T RUN OUT THERE!

	The boy is mowed down in a crossfire.

47	 Inside the building, other S.W.A.T. teams along with units of
	the National Guard are crashing through hallways and breaking
	into apartment units. People are herded into the halls where
	they are held at gun point.

	Some men, although armed, surrender willingly. Others retaliate
	against the invading force, and little skirmishes develop on
	every floor of the complex structure.

48	 On the ground, the Commander barks into the bullhorn:

	Commander:   MASKS...

	Sergeant:    (into walkie talkie)
			MASKS FOR GAS...MASKS FOR GAS.

49	 Tear gas canisters crash through windows and the halls are
	filled with clouds of gas. Civilians trying to escape, are
	choked as they attempt to shoot their way out.

50	 The teams on the roof charge down the fire stairs into the
	building.

	S.W.A.T. 1:  WORK YOUR WAY DOWN. A FLOOR AT A TIME.
			HOLD 'EM IN THE HALLS 'TIL WE CAN WORK 'EM
			DOWN THE STAIRS.

	Roger and Wooley and the men in their unit, snap on their
	bizarre looking gas masks.

51	 The troopers break into an apartment on the floor. An old couple
	kneels in prayer at a small alter, while their children and
	their children's children huddle in a corner. The young husband
	surrenders his gun to a trooper, and Roger watches as the group
	is led into the hallway.

	Suddenly, a young Black man charges out of one of the
	apartments. A woman appears at the door, screaming for him to
	stop. He breaks through a cloud of gas and Wooley fires his
	automatic. The black man crashes to the floor. Wooley is crazed.
	He kicks in the door of another apartment and fires randomly
	into the room.

	The flurry of action causes panic among the civilians in the
	hall. The younger ones try to escape while the older people
	kneel or fall against the walls praying.

	S.W.A.T. 2:  WOOLEY'S GONE APE SHIT, MAN...

	Roger:	WOOLEY! (shouting)

	Wooley kicks in the door of another apartment. Roger charges at
	him and grabs him around the shoulders. The big man resists. His
	gun fires and bullets fly wildly. He struggles against Roger,
	but Roger manages to hold on.

	Roger:	GIMME A HAND...SOMEBODY...

	Another S.W.A.T. Trooper steps up out of the cloud of gas. He is
	very tall and he looks mysterious in the fog as he speaks in a
	deep voice.

	Trooper:	STEP AWAY FROM HIM.

	Roger:	GIMME A HAND.

	Wooley throws his body around and slams Roger against the wall,
	but Roger grabs him again just as the crazed man is levelling
	off his gun at the open apartment door.

	Roger:	GODDAMMIT...HELP ME...HE'S CRAZY!

	Trooper:	STEP AWAY FROM HIM!

	Just then, Wooley wrenches free and pushes Roger across the
	hallway. The Trooper carefully aims his weapon and fires one
	shot through Wooley's head. The big man falls back violently.

	The mysterious Trooper turns and hurries away down the hall.
	Other S.W.A.T. Officers face him threateningly. He stares at
	them through his mask. They let him pass. He disappears through
	the smoke as other officers begin to restore order among the
	civilians.

	Women scream and cry over their dead-loved ones. Roger is helped
	to his feet by another Officer. Roger's eyes are wide and
	staring through the insect-like lenses of his mask. They are
	locked on the sight he sees through the door of the apartment
	which Wooley kicked open. The other Trooper looks and his eyes
	widen as well.

53	 In the apartment, lying in a pool of blood, are the partial
	remains of what was a human body. It has been ripped to shreds.

	Roger staggers against the door frame. The other trooper moves
	inside. Another corpse, also mutilated, one leg missing, one arm
	badly mangled. It is trying to move. To reach the Troopers.

54	 A sudden loud scream. Roger startles and spins around. A woman
	in the hall has seen the grisly sight, and she runs screaming
	down the corridor. More confusion, as civilians push through the
	Troopers who try to hold them back.

55	 The Trooper in the apartment is revulsed...

	Trooper:	JESUS...HOLY JESUS...

	A third officer enters the apartment. He speaks to the Trooper
	which is closest to the writhing corpse on the floor.

	Trooper 2:   SHOOT IT...SHOOT IT THROUGH THE HEAD.

	The young officer is too dumb struck to respond so the third
	Officer pulls out his pistol. Then suddenly, from out of the
	shadows, a spectre-like figure lunges at the third Officer,
	flailing and biting at his arms. It is a wild-haired woman.
	There are several bleeding wounds over her body. She is one of
	the walking dead.

	The Trooper struggles to free himself, and Roger darts into the
	room. Although the Zombie is weak, she manages to hold on to the
	Trooper.

	Another creature suddenly appears in the bedroom doorway. A
	male, it staggers out into the room. The young Trooper struggles
	with his holster trying to free his hand gun. Suddenly, he feels
	something on his leg. The dismembered corpse is clutching his
	ankle, pulling itself closer, it's mouth open. The boy tries to
	pull away, but falls onto the floor, crashing over a table and
	lamp. He tries to crawl away, but the frail corpse keeps its
	hold and drags along behind the young Trooper, who still cannot
	free his pistol.

	Roger and the third Officer fling all their weight against the
	woman Zombie. She flies against a wall, but bounces back
	immediately, and attacks again. The third Trooper's rifle fires.
	A slug tears through the woman's chest but it doesn't stop her
	onslaught. Another shot rips through her neck. Still she comes.

	The boy on the floor manages to level off his pistol. He fires
	at the ghoulish head which draws closer to his leg. The thing's
	skull blows open and its grasp relaxes. The boy is shaking
	violently. His arm and gun stay in the air, still poised. He
	fires again...and again...and again.

56	 In the hall, the male Zombie appears, and the crowd panics. The
	Troopers try to keep things calm.

	S.W.A.T. 3:  IT'S ONE OF THEM...MY GOD...IT'S ONE OF THEM.

	S.W.A.T. 4:  SHOOT FOR THE HEAD.

	Woman:	NO! NO! MIGUEL...DIOS MIO...MIGUELITO...

	The woman pushes through the crowd. The Zombies advances. Before
	the Trooper can stop her, the woman throws her arms around the
	creature.

	Woman:	MIGUEL...MI VIDA...MIGUELITO...

	S.W.A.T. 3:  GRAB HER...GET HER OUT OF THERE...
			(his gun is levelled off, but he can't get a shot)

	The Zombie clutches at the woman. It bites at her neck...her
	arm. She screams with terror. She tries to pull away, but the
	creature holds her. It bites again. A Trooper comes up from
	behind and tries to wrestle the creature away. Another Trooper
	grabs the woman and tries to free her. She is screaming
	insanely. The Zombie pulls another piece of flesh off her arm.

	S.W.A.T. 3:  STAND CLEAR...FOR CHRISSAKE...STAND CLEAR!

57	 In the apartment, the female Zombie lunges at the third Trooper
	and the two tumble to the floor. Roger wrestles her free and,
	with all his might, throws her against the wall. She advances
	again. Roger raises his gun, She is just about to reach him. He
	fires. The bullet drops her.

58	 In the hall, a Trooper brings his gun butt slamming against the
	male ghoul's head. The creature loses his grip on the screaming
	woman. The Trooper who is holding her, pulls her free across the
	floor. S.W.A.T. 3 fires. The bullet tears through the Zombie's
	shoulder...another shot...through his neck...another...through
	the skull. It falls.

59	 There is finally a calm. A few of the citizens murmur prayers.
	Troopers and befuddled old people seem to drift through the
	clouds of gas in a totally dazed state.

60	 Roger and the third Trooper from the apartment drift to the
	hallway. The third Trooper moves into the crowd, but Roger
	stands against the open door jamb for a moment.

	A sudden, loud gunshot makes Roger duck and spin around. He
	looks into the apartment. The young Trooper has shot himself
	through the head.

61	 In the dark firestair, it is very quiet. Roger bursts through a
	metal door from one of the halls and falls against the stair
	railing. He is retching. He breathes heavily to contain himself.
	He removes his mask and coughs slightly from the gas mist which
	still clings in the air.

	Voice:	YOU'RE NOT ALONE BROTHER.

	Roger tightens, grabbing for his gun. The voice is present; very
	nearby. Roger looks up. Sitting on the stairs above is the
	Trooper who shot Wooley. His rifle is aimed at Roger.

	Voice:	YOU WAS IN WOOLEY'S UNIT.

	Roger:	I DIDN'T SEE NOTHIN.
			I DIDN'T SEE HOW HE DIED.

	Roger slings his rifle, so the Trooper relaxes and lowers his
	gun. He removes his gas mask. He is Black.

	Roger:	YOU RUNNIN?

	The Black man shrugs. He hasn't decided.

	Roger:	I DON'T JUST MEAN 'CAUSE OF WOOLEY.
			I JUST MEAN 'CAUSE OF...

	Voice:	YEAH. I KNOW.

	Roger:	THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE RUNNIN'.
			I COULD RUN.

	Roger stares up at the grim faced Black.

	Roger:	I COULD RUN RIGHT TONIGHT.

	The black man just stares levelly into Roger's eyes.

	Roger:	FRIEND OF MINE GOT A HELICOPTER. HE DOES
			TRAFFIC FOR J.A.S. GOT A HELICOPTER AND HE'S
			RUNNIN' OUT WITH IT. AS'T ME T'COME.

	The Black man smiles.

	Roger:	YOU THINK IT'S RIGHT TO RUN?

	The Black man shrugs again, then he stands and walks down the
	stairs. HE turns past Roger on the landing and continues down
	into the lingering gas mist. Roger follows.

62	 A few landings down...a noise. The two Troopers freeze. The
	stairwell is dark. The noise grows louder. The Troopers ready
	their weapons.

	The sounds are little scraping thumps, like the weary foot falls
	of someone...something...trying to negotiate the stairs...There
	is the low, wheezing sound of laboured breath.

	The men stare at the landing below. The Black man steps forward
	slightly, trying not to make a sound.

	Suddenly, a figure pops out of the darkness. It falls against
	the wall below. Both Troopers raise their guns. The figure pulls
	away from the wall. In the mist, it's shape is ghostly...
	robed...in black...is sees the Troopers...

	Figure:	 SENORES...
			PLEASE TO LET ME PASS...

	The voice weakens into a low wheezing cough. The figure slumps
	and sits on the steps, clinging to the railing. It is an old
	Priest, obviously from a local Puerto Rican Parish.

	Roger stoops next to the old man, who is struggling to keep his
	breath. He is weary. He seems to be near death. He clutches at
	his chest.

	Roger tries to support him.

	Roger:	LET'S GET HIM TO THE MEDICS...

	Priest:	 NO...NO...NO...PLEASE. JUST...LET
			ME PASS...MY SISTER...I GO UP TO SEVEN
			FLOOR...TO FIND MY SISTER...

	Roger:	THEY'RE TAKIN' EVERYONE DOWN...THEY PROBABLY
			BROUGHT HER DOWN...COME ONE...

	Priest:	 MY SISTER...SHE IS DEAD...THEY TELL ME...
			THE DEAD THEY DO NOT BRING DOWN.

	Roger and the Black Trooper shoot glances at one another.

	Priest:	 JUST LET ME PASS. MARTINEZ IS DEAD.
			THE PEOPLE OF 107 WILL DO WHAT YOU
			WISH NOW. THESE SIMPLE PEOPLE...
			BUT STRONG...THEY HAVE LITTLE...BUT THEY
			DO NOT GIVE IT UP EASILY. AND THEY GIVE
			UP THEIR DEAD...TO NO ONE!

	The Priest goes into a coughing fit. The Troopers look on. Roger
	wants to help in some way.

	Priest:	 MANY HAVE DIED ON THESE STREETS IN THE LAST
			WEEKS...IN THE BASEMENT OF THIS BUILDING
			YOU FIND THEM...

	The Troopers are shocked. The Priest struggles to his feet.

	Priest:	 I HAVE GIVEN THEM THE LAST RITES.
			NOW...YOU DO WHAT YOU WILL...

	The old man starts up the stairs. Roger moves to help him, but
	the big Black man stops him. The Priest weaves up through the
	gas mist, coughing.

	Priest:	 YOU ARE STRONGER THAN US...BUT SOON, I
			THINK...THEY BE STRONGER THAN YOU...

	The old man's voice trails off up the stairwell as he disappears
	in the cloud...

	Priest:	 WHEN THE DEAD WALK, SENORES...WE MUST
			STOP THE KILLING...OR WE LOSE THE WAR...

63	 In the basement of the large building, S.W.A.T. troopers pry at
	the boards which are nailed over the entrance to the storage
	area.

	The rest of the riot troops stand at the ready, weapons
	raised...high powered rifles...flame throwers...

	The nails creak loudly as they are pulled free. The men are
	silent, not knowing what to expect.

	There are three boards left...then two...

	With a great, tearing sound, the door flies open before the men
	remove the last boards. The boards fly and the door almost rips
	off its hinges. Like flood waters, a small army of Zombies
	pushes into the hall.

	They are wide eyed and terrifying. In life, they were mostly
	Blacks and Puerto Ricans from the neighbouring buildings. They
	are all ages, from the very old to the very young.

	The riot troops are stunned. They cannot react quickly enough,
	and the squeeze is so tight in the little hall that it is
	impossible to shoot accurately, or without the bullets injuring
	other troopers.

	The men fight back, wrestling and trying to back away. In the
	front line, Zombies bite at the flesh of the humans. Teeth tear
	into arms and hands. Some men are trampled in the crush.

	Commander:   BACK OFF...BACK OFF...SPREAD OUT...

	The rear lines retreat into the wider vestibule, and as the mass
	of struggling bodies spreads out, shots begin to fire. Some
	Troopers, at close quarters, are able to fire off accurate
	rounds with their hand guns. Others fall and are lunged at by
	clutching ghouls.

	Roger and the Black Trooper are in the middle of the battle.
	They fight off several of the creatures. The battle spreads into
	little skirmishes through the dark hallways. The highly
	organised Troopers are scattered and confused by the mindless
	onslaught.

64	 As the main action moves away from the entrance to the storage
	area, several Troopers move into the room.

	The walls are dank and grey. There is a dripping sound. All
	around lie remnants of human civilisation. Baby buggies and
	bicycles chained to pipes which ring the area. Large trunks and
	cartons of every size and shape; old beds and other furniture.

	And here and there throughout the large area lie the remains of
	corpses. They have been eaten away. Most of them are still
	moving, their heads uninjured.

	Two of the Troopers retreat, revulsed. The sound of the gunfire
	and screaming can be heard from the hall.

	The big Black man walks calmly into the room. Roger watches him.
	He walks up to the writhing creatures one at a time, and fires
	carefully aimed shots into their heads with his hand gun. Tears
	roll down his cheeks.

	Some of the creatures are without arms and legs. Some have been
	eaten away about the neck and shoulder. They moan with a
	gurgling, gutteral sound as they try to move.

	A young Black Zombie, pulling itself along the floor with one
	arm, draws close to the Black Trooper. The big man aims his
	pistol. It clicks...empty. He quickly and efficiently reaches
	for more ammunition and begins to reload. The Zombie pulls
	closer, its mouth wide.

	Roger steps up behind the other Trooper and fires into the
	creatures head with his automatic rifle.

	The Black man brushes tears from his eyes and continues to load
	the pistol.

	Roger disposes of several other creatures. he comes to a place
	where several are piled together. Some lie still, others writhe
	about. Two on the heap, although they cannot move about, are
	eating at parts of other bodies. Roger shoots them. They never
	look up. They don't seem to notice him at all.

	A loud creaking sound breaks the mood suddenly. Roger looks up.

65	 In the ceiling, a double set of loading doors has been opened.
	Several other Troopers look down into the storage area.

	Trooper:	JESUS CHRIST.

	He shines a light beam down towards Roger.

	Trooper:	YOU OK DOWN THERE?

64	 Roger nods.

65	 Trooper:	THIS MUST BE WHERE THEY DUMPED 'EM IN.

64	 Roger looks down at the pile of corpses beneath the opening.

65	 Trooper:	YOU NEED MORE MEN?

64	 Roger shakes his head "no".

65	 Trooper:	JESUS CHRIST.

	The trooper leaves the opening. He is replaced by two others who
	just stare down into the storage room through the weird, round
	lenses of their masks.

66	 The distant sounds of the battle in the hall flare up again. The
	big Black man snaps his loaded clip into his pistol and takes a
	few steps forwards. He sees a corpse wrapped in a bed sheet and
	tied securely with clothes line. It looks like a mummy. It is
	writhing, trying to free itself. he shoots it through the head.

	Nearby, a small corpse, that of a very young child, is also
	writhing, but the end of the shroud, where the child's feet
	should be, has been torn open and is bloody. A stump kicks
	around the blood where a foot has been eaten off. The Black man
	fires into the thing's head.

	Roger:	THEY...ATTACK...EACH OTHER...

	Black:	JUST THE FRESH CORPSES...BEFORE THEY REVIVE...

	Roger:	WHY DID THESE PEOPLE KEEP THEM HERE? WHY
			DON'T THEY TURN THEM OVER...OR...OR DESTROY
			THEM THEMSELVES...IT'S INSANE...WHY DO THEY
			DO IT?

	Black:	'CAUSE THEY STILL BELIEVE THERE'S
			RESPECT IN DYING.

	The big man fires into the head of another squirming Zombie.

67	 In the halls of the building, Troopers fall and are pounced on
	by ghouls. Other Troopers fire their automatics through the
	heads of attacking Zombies. The riot troops try to stay
	organised, but the onslaught is so mindless and random that it
	is turning into a riot.

68A	The buildings of Philadelphia loom in the moonlight. What few
	lights remain lit reflect in the waters of the Delaware.

68B	It is quiet except for the slight sounds of lapping water and an
	occasional wooden creak as the floating docks strain against one
	another.

	There are a few big Police launches still docked in the marina.
	They bob about silently. The chain, which normally restricted
	the area, is broken and dangling. The sign, which reads: CITY OF
	PHILADELPHIA - POLICE - NO ADMITTANCE clangs against the broken
	chain in the wind.

	Halfway down the long dock is a little guard house. Inside,
	sitting at a radio transmitter, is the corpse of a uniformed
	guard.

	Nearby is a separate floating dock on which is painted a large
	square pattern. It is a landing bay for Police helicopters.
	Alongside, afloat separately but securely chained fast, is a
	small fuel barge, with pumps and hoses for refueling the chopper
	and launches.

	The other bodies lie bleeding on the bobbing docks, another
	officer and a civilian. A bell buoy rings in the distance and we
	begin to hear the sound of an approaching helicopter.

	The blades of the J.A.S. Traffic Copter whine as they gear down
	for a landing. The whirlybird settles like a hummingbird on the
	gently bobbing heliport.

69	 With the blades still spinning loudly, Stephen hops out of the
	cockpit.

	Steve:	COME ON...I NEED YOU.

	Francine unbuckles her safety belt and jumps out of her side of
	the machine. Steve runs, ducking under the blades, around to the
	woman's side of the cockpit, grabs her hand, and they make for
	the fuel pumps.

	Steve:	I DON'T SEE ROGER. WE'LL GIVE HIM TEN MINUTES.

	Fran:	OH MY GOD!

70	 The woman freezes in mid stride, and her action brings Stephen's
	eyes around to see what she is staring at. The two bodies which
	lie near the fuel pumps.

	Steve:	YOU HAVEN'T BEEN OUT IN IT AT ALL.
			IT'S TOUGH TO GET USED TO IT.

	He pulls her quickly along. They have to actually step over the
	civilian corpse. Fran freezes again. She can't bring herself to
	walk over the body. Steve lets go of her hand and checking the
	tank gauge, he pulls the hose with him as he moves quickly back
	to Fran. The long hose is heavy, and it bobbles the civilian
	corpse, almost rolling it over. The back of the bodies head has
	been blown out by the exit wound of a powerful bullet. Blood
	still runs. The wound is fresh. Steve does not see this as he
	tugs the hose over the corpse and moves to the helicopter with
	Fran following.

71	 At the side of the machine, the blades still spinning overhead,
	Steve jams the hose nozzle into the fuel tank receptacle. He
	pulls one of Fran's hands into the nozzle mechanism.

	Steve:	JUST LIKE THIS...LIKE A CAR...

	Fran responds, getting the feel of the nozzle trigger.

	Steve:	THAT'S IT...JUST HOLD HER THERE 'TIL SHE
			SPITS OUT AT YA.

	The woman takes over and Stephen trots away toward the guard
	shed. The propeller blades still spin. They make an eerie,
	whispering sound as they pass over Fran's head. She can hear the
	lapping water now, and the creaking moans of the shifting docks.
	She looks this way and that, fear in her eyes.

72	 At the guard house, Stephen rushes in to find the dead radio
	operator. A signal is coming over the receiver in Morse Code.
	The corpse is slumped over the desk and it is covering the send
	key. A small entry wound is barely visible in the back of the
	dead man's head. As Stephen pulls the body up to an erect
	posture in its chair, he sees that the exit of the bullet all
	but obliterated the corpse's face. Again the wound is still
	running and bits of flesh and blood are splattered about the
	desk and the radio unit.

	Stephen clicks on the send switch and he quickly begins to send
	a message in Morse:

			OPERATOR DEAD...POST ABANDONED...

73	 Back on the fuel dock, the long hose brushes over the civilian
	corpse. A shadow moves nearby, making is aware of a presence
	other than Fran's.

74	 The woman switches hands on the pump nozzle. The blades still
	whoosh overhead. Then she hears the sound of another engine. She
	looks towards the mainland. The headlights of an approaching
	vehicle can be seen.

75	 At the guard house, Stephen, hearing the approaching engine,
	steps into the doorway and looks up the dock. He calls to Fran.

	Steve:	I HOPE IT'S ROGER.

76	 Fran:	WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

	Steve:	I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

77	 He ducks back into the shed. He snatches up a First Aid Kit and
	throws it into a khaki knapsack. He rummages in the darkness. He
	finds a toolbox.

	As he stands up, he backs into a tall figure which stands in the
	shadows. Feeling something sharp and hard against his back.
	Steve recoils and spins to face the figure. It is a uniformed
	officer. His rifle is levelled off at Steve's chest. From out of
	the shadows, a second Policeman appears with a hand gun cocked
	and aimed.

78	 Fran's eyes strain to discern the approaching vehicle, but
	suddenly she catches a movement in the corner of her vision.
	Through the open sides of the helicopter bubble, she notices a
	Police van. It has been there all along, it's doors flung wide
	open, as though abandoned hurriedly. Now one of the rear doors
	move. A figure appears carrying a large packing carton. The
	figure is uniformed, with two rifles strapped to its back. It
	rushes toward the launch docks.

	Voice:	JUST STAY COOL.

	Fran, already startled by the running figure, is now doubly
	shocked by the calm voice behind her. She spins and the fuel
	nozzle clatters out of it's receptacle to the wooden dock
	boards. She is facing another "Policeman", to aims a rifle
	directly at her head.

	Officer 1:   IF YOU DIE...IT'LL BE YOUR OWN FAULT.

	The Officer who is running with the carton shouts toward the
	Guard House.

	Officer 2:   COME ON SKIPPER...THEY GOT FRIENDS COMIN'.

79	 In the Guard House, Steve is held at bay by one of the Officers
	while the other uniformed man moves to the door to check the
	progress of the approaching vehicles.

	Officer 3:   WHO ARE YOU?

	Steve:	WE'RE WITH J.A.S...WE...

	Officer 4:   (at the door)
			ABOUT A MINUTE AND A HALF.
			(referring to the arrival time of the vehicle)

	Officer 3, the Skipper, pushes Steve with his gun barrel. Steve
	spins out through the open doorway. He looks up the dock and
	sees the vehicle which is just turning onto the pier which is
	almost a mile long.

80	 Officer 1 has moved around Fran and he reaches into the
	helicopter bubble pulling out Steve's rifle.

81	 Steve:	NOW WAIT A MINUTE...WE'RE JUST HERE TO REFUEL...
			THESE MEN WERE ALREADY DEAD...YOU WERE HERE...
			YOU KNOW THAT...IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY WAS
			AFTER THE LAUNCHES...WE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH...

	Officer 3:   (looking at the insignia on the helicopter)
			HEY...J.A.S. TRAFFIC WATCH...
			STEVE ANDREWS.

	Steve:	(trying to capitalise on his minor celebrity power)
			RIGHT...THAT'S ME...I'M STEVE ANDREW...

	Officer 3:   NO SHIT.

82	 Officer 1:   (shouting from the helicopter)
			WE'D GET A LOT FURTHER IN THIS BIRD, SKIPPER.

83	 Steve freezes again, sensing that these are not law enforcers.

84	 The man who was carrying the carton is now rushing back up the
	dock having deposited his load in one of the motor launches.

	Officer 2:   CAN'T ALL FIT.

85	 Officer 3:   (directly to Stephen)
			HOW MANY WILL THAT THING HOLD?

	Officer 4:   HEY, MAN, I AIN'T GOIN' NOWHERE IN NOTHIN' I
			CAN'T DRIVER MYSELF!

86	 Officer 2 has returned to the van and is carrying out another
	carton rushing back to the launch.

	Officer 2:   THAT'S TRUE...SOMETHIN' HAPPENS TO HIM AND
			WE'RE STUCK. STAY WITH THE LAUNCH!

	Officer 1:   GET A LOT FURTHER IN THIS BIRD!

87	 Suddenly, above the two white headlights of the approaching
	vehicle, we see a third light in red. It is the spinning
	"bubble-gum-machine" of a Squad Car. It is heralded by one
	blast of the car's siren.

88	 Officer 4:   HEY, THAT'S A BLACK AND WHITE!

89	 Officer 1 still holds his rifle aimed at Fran.

	Officer 1:   THEY SEEN US!

90	 Officer 3:   IT'S ALRIGHT...WE'RE POLICE...

91	 Officer 2 dumps his carton at the edge of the dock and pulls one
	rifle from his back.

	Officer 2:   BULL SHIT...LET'S GET TO THE BOAT!

92	 Officer 3 stares hard at Stephen. Then at the Squad Car. Then
	back at the nervous young pilot.

	Officer 3:   YOU'RE RUNNIN', AIN'T YOU, FLY BOY?

	Steve does not respond. He is terrified, not knowing what answer
	to be the safest.

	Officer 3:   YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS IS RUNNIN' OFF IN THE
			J.A.S. TRAFFIC BIRD...

	The man starts to grin with knowing. He suddenly feels in more
	control.

	Officer 3: SIT TIGHT, BOYS...THEY'RE RUNIN', TOO.

93	 It seems to take forever for the Police Car to pull down the
	dock. Stephen takes a few steps forward, squinting to see, but
	he is threatened by the "Policeman's" gun barrels.

94	 The car screeches to a stop and two armed S.W.A.T. Troopers
	immediately pop out of the front seat on either side. They are
	Roger and the Black Trooper.

	Roger:	WHAT'S THE PROBLEM, OFFICER?

95	 Officer 3:   CAUGHT YOUR FRIENDS HERE STEALIN' COMPANY
			GASOLINE.

96	 Roger:	WHAT DO YOU MEAN FRIENDS?

	Roger is trying to play dumb, assuming that the other Policemen
	are on official business...

97	 Steve:	THEY KNOW, ROG...
			THEY'RE TRYIN' TO GET OUT, TOO.

	Officer 3:   IT'D BE CRAZY TO START SHOOTIN' AT ONE
			ANOTHER, NOW WOULDN'T IT?

98	 Roger:	SURE WOULD.

99	 Officer 1:   ALRIGHT, LET'S LOAD UP...

	He slings his rifle and tosses the other gun back to Fran. She
	bobbles it and it falls, skittering across the dock.

	Officer 1:   YOU BETTER LEARN HOW TO USE THAT THING, WOMAN.
			TIMES IS TENSE.

100	The policemen start to unload crates and cartons from their Van.
	The big Black Trooper pulls a few supplies from out of the squad
	car and carries them toward the helicopter.

101	Fran trots over toward Stephen. He is just coming back out of
	the guardhouse where he picked up the toolbox and the knapsack
	full of supplies. The woman falls into his arms. Roger trots up.

	Roger:	YOU OK?

	Stephen:	(nods)
			WHO'S HE?
			(referring to the big Black)

	Roger:	HIS NAME'S PETER. HE'S ALRIGHT.

	The three are already moving toward the helicopter.

	Roger:	LET'S HUSTLE.

102	Peter has stowed the supplies in the rear of the cockpit, and he
	has noticed the fuel hose lying on the dock. He tries the nozzle
	in the receptacle on the chopper and holds it in until the tank
	fills.

103	The other "Policemen" are still moving cartons of supplies from
	their van down the dock.

	Roger:	(to the other Policemen)
			YOU GUYS BETTER MOVE IT. THERE'S A RADIO
			REPORT ABOUT THE DOCK BEIN' KNOCKED OUT.

104	They reach the cockpit. Fran climbs in and crouches on the floor
	in the rear of the bubble.

	Fran:	YOU SURE THIS'LL CARRY US ALL.

	Steve:	LITTLE HARDER ON THE FUEL, BUT WE'LL BE OK.

105	As Peter climbs aboard, one of the other policemen, carrying a
	final carton, speaks to Roger.

	Officer 2:   HEY...YOU GOT ANY CIGARETTES.

	Roger looks at the others one at a time. Fran shakes her head
	"no".

	Roger:	SORRY. (he trots around to the passenger seat)

	Steve:	WHERE YA HEADED?

	Officer 2:   DOWN RIVER...GOT AN IDEA MAYBE WE CAN MAKE IT TO
			THE ISLANDS.

	Steve:	WHAT ISLANDS? (he starts the engine)

	Officer 2:   ANY ISLANDS...WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHERE YOU HEADED?

	Steve:	STRAIGHT UP.

106	The Policeman rushes off with his two cohorts. As they untie one
	of the launches from the dock, the J.A.S. helicopter whines
	loudly. Then it lifts off the dock with a smooth motion.

	The Police launch starts without a problem, and it pulls out
	onto the dark river.

107	The lights on the helicopter blink as the metal bird swoops low
	over the Philadelphia skyline. We see an empty city.
	Independence Hall...Betsy Ross' House, which flies the original
	American flag...the oldest American heritages stand coldly in
	the night. The whirring engine fades overhead.

108	In the cockpit, Fran lights a cigarette. So does Roger. No one
	comments, but Peter smiles slightly.

	The big Black looks down at the city.

	Peter:	ANY OF YOU LEAVIN' PEOPLE BEHIND?

	Fran:	AN EX-HUSBAND.

	Roger:	AN EX-WIFE.

	Steve:	YOU PETER?

	Peter:	(still looking down)
			SOME BROTHERS.

109	The whirlybird cuts through the dark night sky. It flies over
	open country now, moving West. Some time has passed.

110	Roger is asleep in the passenger seat. Twisted in the cramped
	rear of the cockpit, Fran and Peter sit very close to each
	other. Peter still stares off into the night.

	Fran:	REAL BROTHERS?

	Peter looks at her. He has a strong face.

	Fran:	REAL BROTHERS OR...STREET BROTHERS?

	Peter:	BOTH.

	Fran:	HOW MANY REAL ONES?

	Peter:	TWO.

	Fran:	TWO.

	Peter:	ONE'S IN JAIL. THE OTHER'S A PRO BALL PLAYER.
			BUT WE CATCH UP TO EACH OTHER ONCE IN A WHILE.

	Fran doesn't quite know how to respond.

	Peter:	(nodding at Steve...the engine roars too loudly
			for the pilot to hear the conversation)
			HE YOUR MAN NOW?

	Fran is taken off guard. She smiles slightly.

	Fran:	MOST OF THE TIME, YEAH.

	Peter:	JUST LIKE TO KNOW WHO EVERYONE IS.

	Fran:	YEAH. ME TOO.

111	Light downs on the horizon. The little helicopter chugs through
	the shades of blue.

112	Now Fran is asleep and Roger still snores. Peter stares at the
	back of the pilot's head. Steve nods slightly, then shakes
	himself. Soon, he nods again...falling asleep. Peter kicks him
	in the shoulder.

	Steve looks back, surprised that the big man is awake. Peter
	just stares at him.

	Steve rubs his face violently with his free hand. He pulls at
	his lower eyelids.

	Steve:	ANY MORE WATER?

	Peter reaches into the supplies and produces a plastic container
	with water. Steve slugs some of it and pours a little onto his
	face. Then he passes it back to Peter, who also drinks.

	Suddenly, Fran stiffens and wakes up with a start. Peter looks
	over at her with a gentle expression. She takes a moment to
	orient herself.

	Peter:	(to Stephen)
			YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE?

	Steve:	I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE.

	Peter:	HARRISBURG?

	Steve:	PASSED IT ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

	Roger finally wakes up from the loud talking.

	Steve:	WE'RE PRETTY LOW ON FUEL. I'M JUST WAITIN'
			FOR FULL LIGHT SO WE CAN SEE WHAT WE'RE
			LANDIN' IN.

113	In the morning light, several fires can be seen on the ground,
	where buildings are burning.

114	The chopper flies over a National Guard convoy as it chugs up a
	winding country road.

115	Here and there on the ground, human activity can be seen. Search
	and Destroy units, made up of Police, Guardsmen and civilian
	volunteers move across the country side. Occasionally, a Zombie
	is seen staggering through the trees or over a field. Gunfire
	cuts the creature down.

116	Roger:	JESUS. IT'S EVERYWHERE.

	Steve:	WE'RE STILL PRETTY CLOSE TO JOHNSTOWN. WE'RE
			BETTER OFF AWAY FROM THE BIG CITIES.

117	A little country airfield lies quiet in the morning sun. There
	is no sign of life. A few private planes dot the area, but the
	tower is empty. The J.A.S. chopper buzzes very low just outside
	the tower windows.

118	As the whirlybird slowly sets down near the fuel pumps, its
	blades create a wind blast which raises great clouds of dust
	from the dry earth. Sheets of old newspaper and other light
	debris are sent flying through the air in all directions.

119	One piece of torn newsprint blows flat against a window in one
	of the little sheds.  It sticks against the glass for a moment,
	as though glued there, then it flutters to the ground. As the
	paper clears the glass, we see the face of a badly scarred
	Zombie peering out through the window.

120	As the group scrambles out of the helicopter, Stephen
	immediately checks the fuel pumps.

	Steve:	SHIT, MAN, DAMN NEAR EMPTY.

	Roger:	LOTTA PRIVATE PLANES IN FARM COUNTRY LIKE THIS.
			GUESS THEY ALL HIT THE PUMPS AND TOOK OFF.

	Steve:	TO WHERE? WHERE THE HELL CAN THEY GO?

	Peter:	WHERE WE GOIN?

	By now, Steve has drained the dregs from the first pump into the
	chopper's tank, and moved to the second pump. It spurts with
	more force.

	Steve:	THERE'S A GOOD BIT LEFT IN THIS PUMP.

	He stretches the hose toward the chopper but it doesn't quite
	reach.

	Steve:	DAMN. I GOTTA GET IT CLOSER.

121	Steve jumps back into the cockpit and the machine lifts off the
	ground.

122	Fran is watching the action, walking slowly backwards to a small
	rickety hangar area. She turns and looks down to the private
	hangars. Most of them are open wide, the planes they housed long
	gone. One or two of the old wooden double-doors are still closed
	and locked with chains and padlocks. The wind from the chopper
	blades blows her hair and sends more debris flying.

123	Peter kicks open the door to the chart house. The room is dusty
	and dilapidated. A few small chairs surround an old wooden
	table. Several half finished cups of coffee sit on top of
	wrinkled flight charts leaving brown rings on the paper. Flies
	buzz loudly. An old window shade clicks against its window from
	the gusting of the wind and it makes Peter flinch.

	He readies his weapon. When he sees the shade, he steps over to
	it easily, pulls it and lets it roll up on itself. It makes a
	loud, flapping noise.	

124	Outside, the chopper sets down. Roger is ready with the hose
	nozzle. Ducking under the blades he inserts the device into the
	tank receptacle even before Stephen has idled the engine.

	Stephen hops out of the cockpit and shouts over the engine
	noise.

	Steve:	I'M GONNA SEE WHAT'S LEFT IN THE HANGARS.

	He trots off after Fran.

125	In the chart house, Peter idly drops a coin into an old coffee
	machine at one end of the room.  The machine clicks loudly and
	spits out a cup. To Peter's surprise, the cup starts to fill
	with hot brown liquid.

	While he waits. Peter notices a series of notes taped to the
	machine and the surrounding walls. They are all written
	hurriedly in various hands and with all sorts of inks and 
	colours.

			LUCY - GONE TO JOHNSTOWN.
			CHARLES - I HAVE THE KIDS. LEFT WITH BEN.
			COULDN'T WAIT. GONE TO ERIE - JACK FOSTER.

	There are dozens of such messages. Peter takes the full coffee
	cup from the machine. As he sips it, his eyes fall on a closet
	door just across the room. It is moving slightly. It is locked,
	but it bangs against the lock...once...twice...more regularly
	than if caused by the wind drafts.

	Peter steps closer. Now the door bangs violently with a loud
	crash, but it holds. Peter sets his coffee on the chart table
	and takes his rifle in both hands.

	Again the door bangs hard, and a skeleton key is knocked out of
	the keyhole. It falls to the floor with a metallic clang, and
	Peter notices a caked blood stain where blood recently ran out
	of the closet, under the door and onto the linoleum.

	Another bang and a gurgling moan. One of the living dead is
	trying to break out of the closet.

	Quite calmly. Peter raises his rifle and aims it at the door
	about head high. The rifle roars in the little room, and a
	splintery hole appears in the old wooden door.

126	Outside, Fran and Stephen snap to attention at the sound of the
	rifle. Fran stands at the entrance to one of the little wooden
	hangars. Stephen is checking out the cockpit of an old Cessna
	inside. Immediately, Stephen runs out and grabs Fran's hand. As
	they turn the corner to run up the grade to the helicopter, they
	are confronted with two Zombies, staggering slowly towards them
	through the dust cloud from the chopper.

	Fran screams. They have no weapons with them.

	Steve:	ROGER...ROGER...

127	Under the whirling chopper blades, Roger continues to fill the
	fuel tank. In the roar of the engine, he cannot hear anything
	else.

	A third Zombie lumbers toward the helicopter. Roger's back is
	to the creature and he is unaware of the impending danger.

128	Inside the chart house. Peter stares at the closet door. It is
	still for a moment...then another moan and the door bangs again.

	Peter fires two shots, lower right and lower left of the first
	forming a triangle.

129	The two creatures advance slowly on Fran and Steve.

	Steve:	JUST RUN.

	Fran is petrified. She turns and looks behind them. They are
	boxed in by the hangars.

	Steve:	RUN RIGHT PAST 'EM...RIGHT AROUND 'EM.
			THEY CAN'T CATCH YOU.

	She hesitates. The Zombies draw closer.

	Steve:	RUN, FRANNIE. GODDAMMIT, I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
			WE CAN HANDLE THEM!

	Fran charges up the little grade. She runs to the right of the
	creatures and they move in her direction, arms outstretched. As
	she draws near to the dead things, she hesitates again in
	fright. The creatures claw at the air. The one in front is
	within a few feet of the woman.

	Steve:	RUN, FRANNIE. MOVE!

	Fran stares into the dead, staring eyes of the lead Zombie. She
	is almost hypnotised. At the last instant, she runs and just
	gets past the creatures. A little up the grade, she turns and
	looks back, stopping again.

	One Zombie turns slowly and starts up the grade after Fran. The
	other continues to advance on Stephen.

130	Stephen ducks back into the open hangar. It is very dark but for
	thin beams of sunlight which cut through between the wooden
	boards of the structure. Stephen roots around among the greasy
	tools which clutter the area. He finds an enormous sledge
	hammer. He runs out of the shed.

131	He dodges around the lead Zombie, who staggers on with inertia.
	Steve sees that Fran is still facing the second creature. The
	man takes a firm grip on the giant hammer as he charges up the
	grade toward the Zombie's back. As he reaches the creature, he
	brings the twenty pound steel head of the sledge slamming
	against the ghoul's skull with all his might.

	The creature staggers on for a few more steps, its head a bloody
	pulp, then it falls to its knees and finally flops face down in
	the dust.

	Without breaking stride, Stephen grabs Fran's hand and the two
	run toward the helicopter. The other Zombie at the hangar has
	turned around and is walking up the grade.

132	Roger is pumping the last drops out of the fuel hose when he
	sees the frightened couple making for the chopper.

133	As Steve charges up the grade he sees the Zombie approaching
	Roger from behind.  Steve shouts and Roger spins around. The
	stumbling creature is very close. It raises its arms and its
	hands clutch at the air. Roger lets the fuel nozzle drop to the
	ground. He is trapped at the side of the machine. He doesn't
	have his rifle. He fumbles with the snap on his hand-gun
	holster.

	Suddenly, the blank face of the Zombie turns red as the top of
	its head seems to disintegrate into a bloody pulp. The creature
	has walked into the spinning chopper blade. Its body staggers
	forward another step or two, then the thing collapses in a heap.

134	Stephen and Fran have reached the chopper. Steve let's go of the
	woman's hand and he drops his bloody sledge to the ground. He
	lunges into the cockpit and snatches up his rifle, ducking in
	the propeller draft.

135	The Zombie which is stumbling up the grade from the hangars
	almost loses its footing, but it regains its balance and
	advances steadily toward the helicopter.

136	The shot misses clean. He fires again. The bullet grazes the
	creature's face. It staggers from the impact, but does not fall.

137	Roger moves quickly for his high powered weapon. Steve fires
	two more rounds.

138	Another miss and another graze, this time on the arm.

139	He is about to shoot once more when Roger stops him, stepping up
	alongside.

	Roger calmly aims and fires one shot cleanly through the
	creatures' brain.

140	The Zombie falls and papers blow over its body.

141	In the chart house. Peter fires several more shots into the
	closet door. Bullet holes appear just where the creature's head
	should be. There seems to be no way that the volley could have
	missed.

	Silence for a moment. Peter still holds his gun high.

	Then, with a great crash, the closet door flies open into the
	room. Two small children burst out. One has no left arm; the
	other has been bleeding from a great wound in his side. They are
	dead. They move directly toward Peter. Their heads are at least
	a foot shorter than the bullet holes in the closet door.

	Peter stares down at the creatures, revulsed.  He is so startled
	that he cannot react quickly enough, and they are on him. The
	moment he feels their clammy grasp, he regains his survival
	instincts. He cannot effectively aim his rifle. He kicks and
	thrashes around. One creature flies against a wall. The other is
	about to bite the man's arm. The big Black grabs the small
	Zombie and flings it physically back. The other creature pounces
	on his back. He throws it over his shoulders and it crashes
	against its brother.

	Now Peter raises his gun. As the children try to scramble to
	their feet the man fires several shots in rapid succession.
	First one creature falls; then the other.

	Peter continues to fire, his eyes wide with desperation and
	disgust. Finally his weapon clicks. It is out of ammunition.

	Peter breathes heavily. He stares at the small corpses.
	Instinctively, he begins loading his weapon, without even
	looking at the action, as he backs wearily out toward the door
	of the chart house.


142	Behind him, in the brightly sunlit doorway, we see the Zombie
	who first appeared at the window. The creature staggers forward.
	Peter turns and startles. He reaches for more shells and backs
	away a few steps as he tries to load the bullets into his gun.
	The creature reaches out and takes another step into the room.

	Peter stares into the creatures eyes. Then suddenly, out in the
	sunlight, a few hundred feet behind the Zombie, Stephen appears
	with his rifle. Peter sees the man over the creature's shoulder.

143	Steve raises his gun and aims at the Zombie, but the barrel
	seems to be on a straight line with Peter.

144	Peter ducks quickly. Steve's gun fires. The bullet misses the
	creature cleanly and crashes into the room. It ricochets off
	the coffee machine. Another shot crashes through the glass in
	the front room.

	Peter crouches, still stuffing shells into his weapon. A third
	of Stephen's bullets tears through the Zombie's shoulder, but
	the creature still stands. It turns toward Peter slowly. Peter
	crawls under the table as another shot splatters into the coffee
	cups.

145	Once again, Roger steps up beside Stephen.  He fires one
	carefully aimed shot, looking through his telescopic range-
	finder.

146	Just as Peter finishes loading his weapon, the Zombie crashes
	into the room, falling over the table and onto the floor.

147	Fran is still kneeling in the dust, trying to keep herself from
	vomiting. Stephen rushes to her side. Roger, keeping his rifle
	poised, shouts toward the chart house.

	Roger:	PETER.

148	The big Black man appears in the doorway, snapping the safety on
	his rifle.

151	Fran's retching causes her to choke and cough. Steve tries to
	comfort her, not knowing what to say and shaking himself.

152	Peter advances with long strides.

153	Stephen looks up when the Black man is a dozen steps away.
	Immediately, he sees the anger in Peter's eyes. The big Trooper
	then raises his rifle and aims it a Stephen. Steve tries to
	stand, but trips and falls on his back in the dust. In an
	instant, Peter is looming over him with the barrel of his rifle
	aimed at point blank range for the shivering man's forehead.

	Fran screams through her choking...

	Fran:	NO...MY GOD...DON'T... WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

	Peter speaks calmly to Stephen, in low tones.

	Peter:	YOU NEVER AIM A GUN AT ANYONE, MISTER.
			IT'S SCARY.
			ISN'T IT?
			ISN'T IT?

	Stephen looks up at the tall man, shivering. Then Peter lowers
	his weapon and extends his hand, helping Stephen up onto his
	feet.

154	Roger clears the fuel hose from around the runners of the
	chopper. Peter climbs into the cockpit and sits in the rear
	without saying another word.

	Roger helps Fran climb aboard. Steve wanders around the front of
	the cockpit bubble and climbs into the Pilot's seat. Roger
	climbs in behind Fran as she squeezes into the uncomfortable
	space beside Peter. The big black offers the woman a sip of
	water, which she accepts. Then she lets her head flop wearily
	against the rear bulkhead.

155	Steve is urgently surveying his flight charts, shuffling the
	papers and trying to seem very busy after the embarrassment of
	the incident.

	Steve:	WE GOTTA FIND FUEL. MAYBE CLOSER TO PITTSBURGH.

	Roger:	NO, WE'VE GOTTA STAY OUT OF THE BIG CITIES.
			IT IT'S ANYTHING LIKE PHILLY WE MIGHT NEVER
			GET OUT ALIVE.

	Peter:	WE MIGHT NOT GET OUT OF ANY PLACE ALIVE.
			WE ALMOST DIDN'T GET OUT OF HERE.

	Roger:	WE'RE GETTIN' OUTA HERE FINE.
			AS LONG AS THERE'S NOT TOO MANY OF THOSE
			THINGS WE CAN HANDLE 'EM EASY.

	Peter:	YEAH, WELL IT WASN'T "THOSE THINGS" THAT
			NEARLY BLEW ME AWAY!

	Stephen turns around and is about to say something angrily.
	Roger stops him by speaking urgently.

	Roger:	WE GOTTA STAY IN THE STICKS. THERE'S BOUND TO
			BE MORE LITTLE PRIVATE AIRPORTS UPSTATE.

	Steve:	(reluctantly going back to his charts)
			THERE'S THE LOCKS ALONG THE ALLGHENY.
			FUEL STATIONS THERE, PRIVATE AND STATE.

	Roger:	PROB'LY STILL MANNED. WE DON'T NEED THOSE
			HASSLES EITHER.

	Steve:	THEY'RE JUST OUT AFTER SCAVENGERS...LOOTERS...

	Peter:	OH, YOU GOT THE PAPERS FOR THIS LIMOUSINE?

	Steve:	(angrily)
			I GOT J.A.S. ID. SO DOES FRAN.

	Peter	RIGHT. AND WE'RE OUT HERE DOIN' TRAFFIC REPORTS?
			WAKE UP, SUCKER. WE'RE THIEVES AND BAD GUYS IS
			WHAT WE ARE. AND WE GOTTA FIND OUR OWN WAY!

	There is a long silence. The engine drones, but the helicopter
	still sits on the ground. The men look at each other. Peter
	takes a long slug of water.

	Fran:	JESUS CHRIST. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE WE'RE
			GOING.  WE DON'T HAVE A RADIO.  WE'RE RUNNING
			OUT OF WATER. WE NEED FOOD....STEPHEN,
			YOU NEED TO SLEEP.

156	We see a wide shot of the little airfield. The J.A.S. chopper
	sits on the ground for a moment, it's props spinning. The, with
	a surge of power, it lifts off and flies away. The dry earth
	swirls up into clouds and blows more bits of paper over the
	wide-eyed corpses which lie in the morning sunlight.

157	We see the facade of an enormous structure. It is a huge,
	suburban shopping mall. The outer walls are all concrete, and
	their clean lines stretch upward for more than two storeys. The
	building looks like a giant domino lying flat on the ground.
	There are only four entrances, and the shops which are housed
	within have no windows opening onto the surrounding lot.

158	In the immense area around the building, lanes and stalls are
	painted for automobile parking. What few cars now dot the area
	are parked randomly, some with their doors open wide.

159	We hear the sound of the helicopter engine fading in, then we
	see the little machine as it approaches and eases down onto the
	roof of the building.

160	In the parking lot, walking among the abandoned vehicles, we see
	several of the living dead.  They look almost like normal
	shoppers at the mall for morning chores, but their lumbering	walk is unmistakably stiff.
161	At one of the mall entrances, we see a revolving door flanked
	by several regularly hinged doors, all made of glass and
	surrounded by large windows. A few of the Zombies manage to	negotiate the hinged doors and enter the building. Others bounce
	off windows and claw the transparent glass in confusion. One
	creature walks around in the revolving door endlessly.

	There are a good many of the creatures, but they are spread out
	and far between. They move with no seeming purpose.
	We do not yet see the mall interior.  The Zombies pay no	attention to the sound of the chopper engine stopping overhead.

162	On the roof, even as the blades of the helicopter still spin,
	the humans are out and moving to the edge of the building. They
	look down at the creatures which dot the parking lot.

	Fran:	OH MY GOD!

	Stephen:	NO CHANCE. FORGET IT, LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.
	Roger:	WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE...THEY CAN'T			GET UP HERE.
	Steve:	YEAH, AND WE CAN'T GO DOWN THERE!

	Roger:	LET'S CHECK IT OUT.
	Roger trots away.
163	Peter has moved directly to an area where a giant grid of
	transparent Plexiglas bubbles face down into the building. He
	stares through one of them and can see into the mall below.
	Roger trots up and peers through another of the bubbles.
	Peter:	MOST OF THE GATES ARE DOWN. I DON'T THINK			THEY CAN GET INTO THE STORES.164	The vantage point only reveals a small aspect of the interior,
	a square plaza with a garden beneath the sunroof of transparent
	bubbles. The space is open all the way down to the garden, which
	is two storeys below. Around the garden on the bottom floor can
	be seen the entrances to several shops. All but one have heavy
	metal cage gates down and locked into position.
	One or two Zombies are seen wandering about. They cannot enter
	the stores, except for the one which is un-gated.

	Halfway up the walls can be seen a balcony railing which rings
	the entire plaza, it is a second storey of shops. The same cage-
	gates seal off the visible store entrances, but none of the dead
	creatures are evident on the balcony.

165	Fran and Stephen come trotting up to the bubbles.

	Roger:	I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THEM UP ON THE SECOND
			FLOOR.

	Peter:	THE BIG DEPARTMENT STORES USUALLY USE BOTH
			FLOORS.

	Roger:	IF WE CAN GET IN UP TOP...

166	Peter is looking across the rest of the expansive rooftop. He
	takes off toward a series of other housings which jut up out of
	the otherwise flat surface. Roger follows.

167	Fran:	(still staring down through a bubble)
			WHAT ARE THEY DOING?
			WHY DO THEY COME HERE?

	Steve:	(also looking down)
			SOME KIND OF INSTINCT. MEMORY...OF WHAT THEY
			USED TO DO. THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT PLACE IN
			THEIR LIVES.

168	Below, the Zombies which are in sight wander aimlessly over the
	plaza. Some try the gates but cannot budge them. One wanders out
	of the single open shop, it is a female. The shop is an
	appliance store. As the creature leaves she drags a toaster idly
	behind her, pulling it by its power cable. It scrapes on the
	floor loudly.

169	We see an installation of large reflectors mounted in an
	intricate metal skeleton which stretches across a large area of
	the roof surface.  Behind the structures can be seen a large
	power generator.

170	Peter:	SOLAR SCREENS.

	Roger:	CAN'T BE ENOUGH TO POWER THIS PLACE.

	Peter:	EMERGENCY SYSTEM, MAYBE.

	Roger:	IT'S PRETTY LIT UP IN THERE.

	Peter:	GUESS THE POWER'S NOT OFF IN THIS AREA.
			A LOT OF PHILLY'S STILL LIT. COULD BE NUCLEAR.

171	Roger:	HEY LOOK AT THIS!

	Roger is peering down through a wire-hatched skylight. There are
	several laid out over this particular area of the roof. He moves
	to another while Peter looks down into the first. Fran and
	Stephen jog up.

	Roger:	THESE DON'T GO DOWN INTO THE MALL.
			WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

	Fran and Stephen peer down into the darkness. Peter pulls a
	flashlight from his utility belt.  He has stayed in full uniform
	all the while, where Roger has stripped off all but his
	ammunition belt and pistol holster.

172	The big man shines a light beam down into the space. The floor
	is only seven feet or so below the window. There is absolutely
	nothing in sight; clear floor, clear walls, all light grey.

	Peter:	DAMN.

173	Roger has moved to another window.

	Roger:	HEY, OVER HERE. THERE'S SOMETHIN' HERE.

174	Peter trots over and shines his beam down. They see a vast
	array of cardboard cartons...hundreds of them.

	Roger:	STORAGE?

175	Peter moves the light beam. Now it illuminates a collection of
	large drums, stacked floor to ceiling and running deep past the
	line of vision. On the face of each drum is the familiar symbol
	of a triangle within a circle, and the letters C.D.

176	Peter:	CIVIL DEFENCE. CIVIL DEFENCE WATER SUPPLY.

	Roger:	AND BOXES OF CANNED FOOD!

	Steve:	HOW DO WE GET DOWN THERE?

	Peter looks at Stephen as a street-wise-tough would look at a
	hopeless city-slick-sissy. Then the big man brings his rifle
	butt down against the glass and the shattered pane crashes to
	the floor below.

177	Inside - the vast space is impressive. It is quite dark but for
	rays of sunlight which drift through the occasional skylights.
	We see an enormous quantity of food cartons and water drums, it
	is very quiet. The space is barren except for the stacks of
	Civil Defence supplies.

178	Suddenly, a figure drops out of one of the skylights, landing on
	its feet in the sunray. It is Peter.	Instantly he readies his rifle, looking this way and that across
	the large room. Silence.

	Peter:	OK.

	He steps aside and Roger climbs in. He too drops cat-like to the
	floor.179	The two men instantly sling their rifles and move to the food
	cartons as by pre-arranged plan. They carry the big boxes
	quickly, one at a time, to the spot under the open skylight.	In a moment, they have built a pyramid out of the cartons. It
	creates a kind of stairway for a quick escape through the window
	above.

180	Now Fran lowers herself into the room and is able to climb down
	the cartons holding onto Roger's hand. She is followed by an
	anxious Stephen.181	Peter has already wandered off. There are only two doors in the
	enormous room, one at either end. The big Trooper moves up to
	one of them as Roger comes up behind him, gun ready.	Peter's hand turns the doorknob. It is unlocked, and the big man
	gives Roger a familiar nod. Roger stands several feet back, his
	rifle aimed directly at the door and ready to fire. Then, with a
	sudden, commando-like motion. Peter throws the door open and
	ducks away flat against the wall. Roger stiffens, his finger all
	but pulling his trigger, but there is no apparent danger.

182	The door opens onto another vast room, equivalent to the one the
	people are in. It also has stacks of C.D. supplies.

	The Troopers cautiously move into the area through the door. The
	room is empty. The same sunrays pierce the darkness through
	skylights. All is dead quiet. This room has no doors at all, but
	for the one Peter opened.
	Roger:	DOUBLE DAMN! LOOKS LIKE A FREE LUNCH, BUDDY.183	In the first room Stephen has started to rip open one of the
	cartons.

	Fran:	SPAM!

	Roger walks back into the room.
	Roger:	YOU BRING A CAN OPENER?

	Fran:	OH.

	Roger:	THEN DON'T KNOCK SPAM. IT'S GOT IT'S OWN KEY.

	The woman flips over the can in her hand and finds the little
	key.

	Peter has walked right past the group.  He is moving quickly
	toward the still-unknown door at the other end of the room.
	Again, Roger follows.

184	At the door, the two Troopers go through the same S.W.A.T.
	procedure. The door swings open, this time onto a very small
	space. Again no immediate danger.

185	As the men enter, they discover that they are on the top landing
	of a concrete and metal firestair. There are no windows, and the
	air is musty. There is one bare light bulb lit in the ceiling,
	but down the stairs at the next landing it is quite dark, and
	there the stairs wind even further down; they recede into
	blackness.

	Roger:	WHATD'YA THINK?

	The Black man just stares, first down into the darkness then
	back into the storage area.

	Roger:	THIS IS THE ONLY WAY UP HERE. WHATD'YA THINK?
			CUT.

186	A great barricade of food cartons has been stacked against the
	stairway door.

187	Near the pyramid under the open skylight, the group of refugees
	sits on the floor.

	Stephen is asleep. Fran sits next to his curled form, her hand
	in his hair. Roger leans against the pyramid and Peter sits in
	the lotus position, his gun across his legs, squarely facing the
	suspicious stairwell. He and Roger still pick at their food.
	Roger swills water from an empty Spam can which he has filled
	from one of the C.D. drums.

	Roger:	YOU BETTER GET SOME SLEEP, TOO, BUDDY.

	Peter:	THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF STUFF DOWN THERE THAT
			WE COULD USE, BROTHER.

	Roger:	I KNOW IT.

	Fran stiffens at the talk.  She doesn't believe what she is	hearing. She knows instantly that the men will try to raid the
	mall.	Peter:	THEY'RE PRETTY SPREAD OUT DOWN THERE.
			IT'S A BIG PLACE. I THINK WE WOULD OUT-RUN 'EM.

	Roger:	HIT AND RUN.

	Peter:	HIT AND RUN... MAYBE GRAB US OFF A RADIO...

	Fran:	YOU'RE CRAZY!	Roger:	THIS PLACE COULD BE A GOLD MINE.
			WE GOTTA AT LEAST CHECK IT OUT.

188	Roger checks his weaponry and quickly moves toward the door
	where he begins to remove the barricade of cartons. Peter still
	sits, checking his own guns.

189	Fran:	THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET AWAY
			FROM...LOOK WHAT HAPPENED AT THE AIRPORT...

	Peter:	THE ONLY PROBLEM AT THE AIRPORT WAS STRAY BULLETS!
			WE COULD OUTFIGHT THOSE DUMMIES BLINDFOLDED.

	Fran:	STEPHEN...(the exhausted Pilot is sleeping through
				it all)

	Peter:	(standing)
			LEAVE HIM BE. WE'RE GOIN' OURSELVES.

	The big Trooper bends over snatching up Stephen's rifle. He
	snaps off the safety and slams a shell into the chamber. He
	hands it to the woman.	Peter:	THAT'S READY TO SHOOT. BE CAREFUL.
	Fran holds the gun gingerly.	Peter:	THE TRIGGER SQUEEZES REAL EASY, BUT THE WEAPON'LL
			KICK YOU GOOD WHEN IT FIRES. BE READY FOR THAT.

	Fran	 WAIT A MINUTE, I...

	Peter:	ANYONE BUT US COMES UP THEM STAIRS, YOU GUYS
			TAKE OFF IN THE MACHINE. WE'LL TRY TO MAKE IT
			OUT TO THE PARKIN' LOT. YOU CAN PICK US UP THERE.

	Fran just stares up at the big man, with desperation in her
	eyes. She has stopped arguing seeing that the Troopers'
	decision is made.

	Peter:	IF WE DON'T SHOW UP AFTER A FEW MINUTES...
			WE'LL CATCH UP TO YOU SOME OTHER TIME.			YOU UNDERSTAND?190	In the dimly lit firestair, the door on the top landing pulls
	open suddenly. The stairway is still empty.	The Troopers move slowly out onto the landing. They look down
	into the darkness below. Then they move slowly and silently down
	the steps. Fran appears on the upper landing. She stands in the
	doorway clutching the rifle.	Peter stops for a moment, looking back up at the frightened
	woman.	Peter:	YOU'LL PROB'LY HEAR SOME SHOOTING.			JUST DON'T PANIC, OK.

	Fran sighs exhaustedly.

	Peter:	YOU'LL BE ALRIGHT. IT'S OUR ASSES THAT'S IN
			THE FIRE.

191	Two landings below, there is almost no light. Roger clicks on
	his flashlight and shines the beam around. He is in a very small
	concrete space. The stairs go down no further. There is only one
	door. Peter eases down the steps behind.	Roger:	THIS IS THE ONLY WAY UP THERE.192	We see the other side of the metal door. It stands in another
	cement walled space, which also seems small from our angle, but
	it is fully lit.	The door opens slowly, and the Troopers cautiously step out. As
	the camera swings around, we see that the men are at the end of
	a long narrow hallway. Directly across from them are two open
	supply rooms, one containing a stationery sink and a toilet.
	Both rooms are filled with cleaning supplies.193	Down along the hall can be seen a dozen or so doorways. Some
	doors are open, some are closed. Along the opposite wall there
	is nothing.	The far end of the hall, about a hundred yards away, opens out
	onto the second story of the mall proper.194	The men look at one another and slowly move down the corridor.
	They try the first two doors, which are locked. The third is
	wide open.
195	Roger ducks quickly into the room with his rifle raised. It is
	a large administrative office, with rows of desks which are
	fully equipped for a staff of secretaries and accountants.196	The next room has a closed door, but it is unlocked. Peter	swings the door open and silently jumps into the room. This is
	a much more spartan area, with two metal desks and a few chairs.
	There are several phones. It is a maintenance office. On one
	wall is a large map of the mall, with pin flags and scribbling
	over an acetate which covers the drawing. At the other end of
	the space is a huge electrical panel with circuit breakers and
	an entire series of master controls all keyed by a number code
	to another map of the mall showing electrical installations.	On the wall behind Peter is a large blackboard and two metal
	cabinets. One is open. It contains all sorts of tools, manual
	and electric. There are circuit testers, walkie talkie units and
	there are several enormous rings containing hundreds of keys,
	also colour and number coded. Peter grabs up one of the rings
	and Roger steps up behind him.	Roger:	THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM.197	Back in the hallway, Roger's hand tries another doorknob and	throws the door open. This opens onto beautifully plush offices,
	obviously the executive headquarters.	The rooms interconnect, and while Peter walks from door to door
	in the corridor, Roger moves through the inner doors, meeting
	Peter at each room. One office is more elegant than the next,
	with the latest in designer furniture and expensive decorations.198	The Troopers finally reach a room on which both the interior and
	corridor doors are closed and locked. The brass nameplate on the
	interior door reads C.J. Porter - President.199	Roger moves out to the corridor where he joins Peter. They move
	into the exterior corridor. They are very near the end of the
	hall, and the brightly lit shopping area is close at hand. They
	can only see a small section.200	The balcony on their side is railed off against the open drop
	down to the first floor, and across the great cavity they see
	the opposite balcony. On the far side only two store fronts can
	be seen. They are both gated and shut.
201	The two realise what dangers might face them in the mall proper.
	They look at each other and move forward, each clinging to
	opposite walls in the corridor.202	As they reach the mall proper they slowly and carefully peer
	around their respective corners.

203	The upper balcony totally surrounds the vast interior of the
	building, and at several points bridges across from one side to
	the other. Little shops of all types run along the entire length
	of the balcony, and at each far end, stands the entrance arches
	for a large department store.	Most of the stores are gated, but several seem open. The big
	department stores are gated and locked. Here and there tall
	trees grow up from the ground floor and reach up into view of
	the second storey. There are none of the living dead evident on
	the balcony.204	The two troopers move slowly and quietly to the railing. The
	crouch and peer down through the bars of the rail. Below, the
	sight is even more spectacular.205	Stores of every type offer gaudy displays of consumer items.	Everything from clothing to appliances. Photo equipment; audio
	and video outlets; sporting goods and weaponry; gourmet foods
	and natural organic foods. There is a Book Store, a Record
	Store, a Real Estate Agency and a Bank; A Novelty Shop, a Gift
	Shop; all with the absolute latest in American consumer items.
	And at either end of the concourse like the main Altars at each
	end of a Cathedral, stand the mammoth two storey Department
	Stores; great symbols of a consumer society.
	Down the centre of the ground floor, along with the gardens and
	park benches, are little stalls. One is a Tobacco Specialist
	another Jewellery; another is a small Photo Portrait stall where
	mothers had their children photographed. There are restaurants
	and Snack Bars and numerous coin operated machines selling
	everything from children's toys to Blood Pressure readings.
	There is a large turntable, designed to spin but which is now
	still, holding a late model car on exhibit. Another turntable
	displays futuristic household appliances.	The images are all too familiar, but in their present state they
	appear as an archaeological discovery revealing the Gods and
	Customs of a civilisation now gone.

	The ghosts of a civilisation, however, are not figments in the
	mind. They are quite real. And they walk below in the aisles of
	the great Cathedral. At least twenty Zombies can be seen from
	the Troopers' perspective.

206	Roger:	IT'S CHRISTMASTIME DOWN THERE, BUDDY.
	Peter:	FAT CITY, BROTHER. HOW WE GONNA WORK IT.	Roger:	WE GET INTO THE DEPARTMENT STORES UP HERE.			THEY PROB'LY HAVE THEIR OWN ESCALATORS INSIDE.

	Peter:	LET'S CHECK THOSE KEYS.

207	The Troopers stealthily pull away from the railing and back into
	the administrative corridor. Then they move quickly down the
	hall toward the Maintenance Office.

208	As the men leave the balcony, the camera pans. Several yards
	away a Zombie staggers out of one of the open stores. It is
	followed by a second creature, a female without one arm. They	are moving along the balcony toward the open corridor.

209	In the Maintenance Office, the Troopers are checking the keys
	against the coded map on the wall.

	Roger:	SEVENTY TWO...U. AND D. ...HERE IT IS...

	The men check the keys. Peter finds corresponding numbers.

	Peter:	HERE.
	Roger:	LET'S JUST HOPE IT'S RIGHT.	Peter:	LOOK HERE (on the map) THESE NUMBERS MUST ALL
			BE LOCKS (he points) FRONT...SIDE...BACK OUTSIDE,
			MUST BE LIKE LOADING DOCKS...BUT WHAT ARE THESE?

	The man points to several numbered spots which seem to be within
	the big Department Store they are studying.	Roger:	WASHROOMS...EQUIPMENT...I DUNNO.	Roger moves off toward the electrical control panel. Peter still
	stares at the map.	Peter:	I GUESS THESE GOTTA BE THE GATES.
	Roger:	HOW ABOUT A LITTLE MUSIC?
	Peter:	WHAT?210	The big Black moves up behind his partner. One of the controls
	on the panel is marked: MUSIC TAPE. It indicates a master switch
	which is in the off position. Another is marked FLOOR EXHIBITS
	and a series of others are marked ESCALATORS. There are dozens
	of master switches which are in the off mode.
	Peter:	POWER SWITCHES.
	Roger:	THE MUSIC MIGHT COVER THE NOISE WE MAKE.	Peter:	HIT 'EM ALL. MIGHT AS WELL HAVE POWER IN			EVERYTHING. WE MIGHT NEED IT.

	Roger hits the switches one at a time.

211	Throughout the mall, we hear the drone of the dull, mass
	produced music designed to lull a shopper's brain.212	Upstairs, Francine startles at the sound from below. She snaps
	the rifle into her hands, ready to fire. She has been standing
	just inside the storage area. She steps into the firestair and
	looks down into the darkness. The sounds of the insipid music
	drift up to her. She leans into the storage area again.

	Fran:	STEPHEN...
			STEPHEN!

213	Steve, still lying on the floor against the escape pyramid,
	slowly awakens.214	Down on the first floor of the big mall, things begin to work.
	The automobile turntable starts spinning; the great escalators
	move up and sown. Two of the living dead, caught just starting
	up two stalled escalator, fall and roll down as the mechanical
	steps begin moving.

	Lights blink on the exhibits, and mechanical window displays
	begin their robot-like motions. It is like a Carnival coming
	alive. The Zombies which wander the floor look about in
	confusion. Some of them swat ineffectively at the moving
	exhibits.215	In a very tall cage, which reaches from the first floor all the
	way to the ceiling, the Tropical Birds which are housed within
	begin to flutter and squawk.216	In a pet shop, there are puppies and kittens in a window
	display. They whine and scramble over one another in fright at
	the noise and the motion and the coloured lights.217	On one of the floor exhibits, a rear-projection movie starts. It
	is a dryly produced film about the merits of a Real Estate
	Developer's new tract of suburban houses. A narrator speaks in a
	friendly voice:
			... and for prices which anyone can afford,			you can live in these luxurious new homes
			by Brandon. Fully electric, central air, ..etc.

218	In the Maintenance Office, the Troopers ready themselves for
	their raid. Peter secures the vital key ring to his utility	belt and the move out.

	Peter and Roger move down the Hall and exit through door to
	exterior corridor.

219	Just as Roger moves through the door into the corridor, he is
	confronted by the Zombies from the balcony. He startles and
	ducks back into the room. The closest Zombie is reaching out
	with clutching hands. Peter raises his gun and fires two shots
	cleanly through the creature's head.220	As the shots ring through the area, Fran, standing at the top of
	the firestair, startles. Steve grabs the rifle from the woman.

	Steve:	JESUS CHRIST...
			THEY'RE MANIACS.

221	The Troopers step over the corpse. The second Zombie, the
	arm less female, is walking toward them. This time Roger fires
	his weapon. The creature falls in a heap.	Roger:	WHATD'YA THINK? BAG IT OR TRY FOR IT?
	Peter:	YOU GAME?	Roger nods and the two men run down the hall toward the mall.	Their rifles poised, they are like commandos on an important
	mission.

	The men at the mall mouth see the department store and start for
	it. They run from the corridor onto the balcony.222	The battle to win the mall has begun. The creatures which wander
	the first floor look about, attracted by the sound, but they are
	confused. They walk this way and that, in mis-guided staggering
	strides.223	Several of the Zombies try to move up the down-escalator. They
	fall over themselves and cannot negotiate the moving stairway.224	A few creatures who move onto the up-escalator also fall against
	each other from the movement, but one falls onto the moving
	steps and is carried upward. Then another manages to keep its
	balance holding on to the hand rail.
225	At another point down the length of the mall, there is a
	stationary stairway which runs from the first to the second	floor. Several creatures move up the steps.

226	At the top of the firestair, Stephen begins to move down the
	steps cautiously. His rifle is at the ready. Fran stays on the
	top landing.	Fran:	STEPHEN, DON'T GO DOWN THERE.			(he continues)
			STEPHEN PLEASE!

	Steve:	IT'S ALRIGHT.

227	At the huge gate which locks off the big Department Store,
	the two Troopers come to a crashing stop.

228	There is a side concourse which can be seen from this vantage
	point, and in the hall are four or five Zombies. They are about
	three hundred feet away.

229	Roger keeps his rifle levelled off in the direction of the
	creatures while Peter confronts the lock at the middle of the
	big roll gate.	He fumbles with the keys for a moment until he finally sinks	the proper key into the receptacle which is right at the floor.	The tumblers turn successfully.	Peter:	ALRIGHT!

230	On the escalator, the creatures which fell onto the moving steps
	are being carried up to the balcony. The one supporting himself
	on the hand rail is still standing. The head of the standing
	Zombie suddenly becomes visible from Roger's perspective.

231	The Trooper raises his gun and aims for the creature's forehead.

	Peter tries to life the roll gate. It won't move. It is still
	locked.	Peter:	YOU BASTARD!
	Roger:	WHAT?

	Peter:	STILL LOCKED...(he sees another assembly)
			ON THE SIDE...

	The big man moves to the far side of the gate. The same key
	fits. Roger re-focuses on the creature which is riding the
	escalator. It is quite near the top now. Roger is about to
	shoot when something catches his eye.

232	The fallen Zombies, which up to now could not be seen behind the	escalator rail wall, suddenly come tumbling out onto the balcony
	floor.233	Roger fires, but his aim is inaccurate.234	He hits the standing Zombie in the neck. The creature is thrown	off balance enough to lose its footing. It falls back down the
	escalator, but before it reaches the bottom, it stops rolling.
	The steps carry it back up toward the second floor again. It is
	still very much alive. The two creatures on the balcony struggle
	to stand.235	Roger looks back over his shoulder.236	The Zombies from the side concourse are now about a hundred and
	fifty feet away.

237	Peter turns the key in the lock, but again the gate will not
	lift. It moves slightly, as the middle mechanism and the one on
	the far right are free, but there is a third lock on the far
	left. Peter moves to it quickly.238	On the first floor concourse, other creatures are beginning to	take note of the action upstairs. They start to move.239	The Zombies on the stationary stairway are beginning to reach
	the second floor, but they are far down the main balcony. They
	will have to pass the administrative corridor in order to reach
	the Department Store.

240	Roger fires again.

241	One of the nearby Zombies falls in a heap.

242	At the sound of the rifle, Fran gets desperate.

	Fran:	STEPHEN...FOR GOD'S SAKE...LET'S GET UP ON THE
			ROOF...243	Steve is at the middle landing. He stares down into the darkness
	below. More gunfire can be heard from the mall.

	Steve:	IT'S ALRIGHT, I'M TELLIN 'YA. THOSE THINGS			DON'T MOVE FAST ENOUGH TO CATCH US.	More gunfire can be heard.244	Now the giant gate rolls up with a loud rumble. Peter ducks into
	the store even as the gate is still rising, but the inertia of
	the great metal cage carries the lip up out of Peter's grasp. He
	jumps to try to catch it, but he misses. It jerks up into its
	fully open position and rolls back down slightly, but still
	Peter cannot reach the lip. It slides back to rest about three
	feet above Peter's fingertips.245	The Zombies advance.246	Roger drops another with a clean shot through the head, then he
	backs into the archway of the Department Store entrance. Peter
	is desperately looking around for something to stand on to reach
	the gate.247	The Zombies are very close to the arch now, advancing steadily.

248	Peter grabs a small counter used to display shoes, but it is too
	heavy for him to move himself.

	Peter:	HERE...COME ON...

	Roger has to abandon his post at the arch long enough to help
	drag the little counter. The men drag it to a point just at the
	side of the open arch, and Peter instantly jumps up on the top
	of it. At that instant, a Zombie rounds the corner and grabs at
	Peter's legs. The big man kicks, startled, and the motion causes
	him to fall off the little counter. He lands on his feet, but
	out on the balcony beyond the arch. Roger brings his rifle butt
	around against the creature's head and the Zombie falls back,
	but is not dead.

	Other creatures are only a few feet from Peter, whose gun sits
	on the little counter inside the store. Roger levels off his
	rifle but cannot fire as Peter is in the line. Peter makes a
	move and, like a football player, jukes to the left, then to the
	right. He dives right at one of the creatures carrying it into
	the store.	Now Roger fires, dropping one, then another. Peter jumps back up	on the counter.	Peter:	BEHIND YOU...BEHIND YOU...

	The creature in the store has crashed against a cosmetics
	display and is regaining its footing. Roger turns and fires. The	creature falls. Peter grabs the lip of the roll gate and starts
	to bring it down.

	There are several creatures right in the archway, now they
	clutch with their hands. One blocks the downward progress of the	gate. Roger fires point blank and the Zombie flies back. The
	gate lowers but is stopped by the clutching hands of other
	creatures. Roger grabs the cage now and helps to pull it down.
	Peter, still gripping the lip, jumps off the counter to get more
	leverage.	The bottom of the gate is now four feet from the floor. The two
	men are able to move it steadily downward. The Zombies are very
	weak, but more creatures appear making it more difficult. Then
	one Zombie tries to crawl under the gate. Its torso just gets
	through as the gate slams down against its chest. Its arms grab
	for Peter's legs and its mouth is gasping. Its body is
	preventing the gate from engaging in the floor mechanisms.	Roger lets go the cage as Peter tries to hold it against the
	creatures outside. Grabbing his rifle, Roger brings the butt
	straight down on the clutching Zombie's skull. The Zombie goes
	limp. Then Roger tries to push the creature clear of the gate,
	but the pressure is too great.
	Roger:	LET UP A LITTLE...LET UP A LITTLE...

	The gate rises a few inches. More Zombies appear outside. Their
	hands clutch at the roll gate. The openings in the grid are only
	big enough for their fingers, their hands can't reach through,
	but they are pushing the gate higher and higher...more than
	Peter intended to clear the obstructing corpse.	With his rifle butt, Roger manages to push the dead Zombie clear
	except for one of its arms. From outside, a creature's hand
	suddenly grabs Roger's weapon. For a moment its like a Tug-O-War.
	Peter is having a harder time holding the gate. It is inching
	upward.	Peter:	COME ON...COME ON...	Roger lets go his gun barrel and the weapon is snatched away by
	the creature in the crowd. Roger grabs for the gate.	Peter:	THE ARM...THAT ARM'S IN THE WAY.	Roger squats again and manages to throw the dead Zombie's arm	clear. Then he grabs the gate again. Now it starts to move down
	more steadily.	At the last moment, another clutching arm juts into the store,
	but when the gate hits it, it withdraws, and the big cage clicks
	solidly into place.

	The two Troopers step back from the gate. The creatures still
	moan and gurgle, slamming against the gate, their fingers
	clutching at the grid, but they are unable to budge it.
	There are ten or twelve Zombies trying to get into the
	Department Store and several others are making their way along
	the balcony. At least six lie dead along the floor.	Roger:	WELL...WE'RE IN...NOW, HOW THE HELL WE GONNA			GET BACK?	Peter:	LET'S GO SHOPPIN' FIRST.

	The two men back into the aisles of the store. The creatures
	outside still push and claw at the gate. The one with Roger's
	rifle uses it as a bludgeon, but it has no effect.

249	Stephen opens the door into the Administration corridor.

250	From his perspective, the hall is inactive. He observes the
	washrooms and the long row of doors to the various offices.

251	He starts into the corridor, letting the firestair door close.

252	At the top of the firestair, Fran can see the beam of light from
	the open door below. As the door closes, the beam narrows, then
	it blinks out with a click as the door closes.	Fran:	STEPHEN...JESUS GOD...

	She is very frightened.  She backs into the storage area.253	She moves quickly to the pyramid of cartons which lead to the	roof. She sits on the bottom carton biting her fingers.254	In the Department Store, Roger is riding down an escalator. He
	has found a back pack, and it is obviously already filled with
	goods. As he steps off the moving stairs on the ground floor,
	the surroundings are eerily quiet.255	He moves through a clothing department. We see the dead looking
	faces of store mannequins. Roger runs into one and is greatly
	startled. He snatches up a lined windbreaker and ties it around
	his waist by its arms, then he trots off down another aisle,
	where he finds Peter.

256	The big Trooper has a radio under his arm and he is snatching up
	a small television.

	Roger:	HEY MAN, WE CAN'T CARRY ALL THIS SHIT...

257	Peter turns a corner and dumps the articles into something
	which we cannot yet see. As Roger trots up, he sees that Peter
	has a big gardening cart already heaped with goods.
	Roger:	OH...WE'RE GONNA JUST WHEEL RIGHT BY 'EM, RIGHT?	Peter:	WE GONNA TRY, BROTHER. WE AIN'T DOIN' THIS
			FOR THE EXERCISE. WE MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO
			GET WHAT WE CAN.

	Roger:	THERE'S NO WAY THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN...

	Even though he doesn't understand the plan, Roger helps Peter
	toss things into the barrow.

258	They race down the hardware aisle tossing in tools and other
	supplies. Electrical cables, flashlights, batteries. They scoop
	things up like contestants on a game-show who have five minutes
	in a store to grab whatever they can.259	Stephen is in the Maintenance office. He examines the maps and	electrical equipment, then rummages through a desk.260	At the open end of the corridor leading to the second storey
	balcony, Zombies wander past as they head for the Store entrance
	where many creature still claw at the roll gate.261	The Zombies move randomly. Some are leaving the gate as their	prey is now out of sight. They begin to wander here and there.

262	Three of the creatures turn into the administrative corridor and
	start toward the offices.

263	Stephen has found a large binder in the desk. It contains all
	the plans for the mall, duplicating the charts on the walls and
	many others. It is a complete maintenance manual revealing all
	the workings and layout of the huge structure.264	Elevator doors slide open with a loud whoosh. The two Troopers
	appear in the car, wheeling their barrow out onto the second
	storey aisles of the big store.265	Now, they can see the roll gate and the creatures pushing at it
	ineffectively. They roll their barrow very close to the gate.
	When the Zombies catch sight of the humans, their efforts are
	renewed. They moan and push harder at the gate.266	They Troopers leave the barrow, disappearing back to the aisles.	They run onto the interior escalator, bounding down faster than
	the moving steps, then they run across the first floor until
	they see the lower level-roll gate.267	There are creatures wandering the concourse, but none of them	are at the gate.	Peter:	LET'S GO BROTHER...THE OLD OKEY DOKE!

	The men move up to the roll gate. A Zombie lumbers past. Roger
	speaks to the creature.

	Roger:	HEY, UGLY!

	The creature turns instantly. Registers. Then dives for the
	gate with a moaning roar. Its mouth opens and its hands clutch.
	The gate pops forward from the creature's thrust, but it holds
	tightly. The action causes Roger to jump even though there is no
	immediate danger.	Peter:	LET'S RAISE SOME HELL...HEY...HEY...
			(he is shouting)

	Roger:	OVER HERE...LET'S GO OVER HERE...

268	Other creatures along the concourse turn toward the Department
	Store. They lumber along attracted by the sounds.

269	At the gate, several Zombies push at the metal grids. The
	Troopers back away, but stay in sight of the creatures.

	Peter:	JUST GIVE IT TIME ...GIVE IT TIME.

270	Upstairs, the Zombies at the upper gate are attracted by the
	commotion below. They begin to move away from the gate and
	lumber along the balcony to the stairways and escalators.

271	In the maintenance office, Stephen still rummages. He finds a
	loaded hand gun and stuffs it in his belt. He moves to the large
	cabinets containing the walkie talkies and the keys.272	In the corridor, the stray Zombies move in and out of the
	executive offices as they draw nearer to the Maintenance room.273	Several creatures fall over one another as they try to move down
	the up escalator. The down escalator push others onto the first
	floor. They scramble to their feet and move toward the
	Department Store.
274	In the concourse, many creatures are moving toward the gate.
	Already there are a dozen or so clutching and pushing at the
	metal grid. Through the crowd. Peter can see several other
	creatures lumbering down the stationary steps.

275	Peter:	OK...THEY 'RE COMIN'...

	The big man readies his walkie talkie, pulling the antenna out.	Peter:	GO ON UP...STAY OUTTA SIGHT BUT LEMME KNOW			WHEN ITS CLEAR ENOUGH.	Roger, clutching his walkie talkie, disappears among the aisles
	as he runs, crouching, into the store. Peter tries to hold the
	attention of the creatures at the gate.	Peter:	RIGHT HERE, BABIES...THIS IS WHERE IT'S AT...
			YOU DUMB ASS SUCKERS...YOU DUMB...YOU ARE DUMB!

276	Upstairs, the doors to the elevator glide open again and Roger
	moves through the second floor aisles stealthily.277	Stephen takes the maintenance manual and leaves the office. He
	walks down the interior corridor and opens the door to the
	exterior corridor. As the door opens, the Zombies attack. The
	Zombies clutch as Stephen tries to close the door on Zombie 13's
	arm. Stephen then runs back down the interior corridor.

278	Stephen starts up the firestair to the door. Just then he hears
	Fran call out. Realising he will lead the creatures to her, he
	closes the door and moves toward the Maintenance office and runs
	in.

279	Stephen runs into the office and slams the door.

280	A second creature is moving up behind the first, and another
	enters the corridor from the accounting office.

281	The metal door locks only with a key. Stephen fumbles for a
	moment with his rifle, then dives for the key cabinet. There are
	hundreds of keys on rings. He looks at the wall map. He can't
	focus in his panic.

282	In the hall, the first creature slams against the floor. It
	doesn't even have the intelligence to reach for the knob. It
	pounds on the door with its hands.

283	The pounding increases Stephen's panic. He stares at the map
	trying to focus on the maze of numbers.

284	The second creature reaches the door and claws at it. The third
	approaches slowly.

285	Stephen rattles among the keys. His fingers shake and he cannot
	decipher the numbers.

286	Outside, one of the creatures, in its random clutching, takes
	hold of the knob and pushes in and out, not yet turning it.

287	Stephen, clutching one of the rings, throws himself against the
	door, still trying to read the numbers. The knob finally turns.
	The door opens against Stephen's weight. He manages to slam it
	shut despite the pushing creatures. He throws the key ring down
	and grabs his gun.

288	Roger speaks into his walkie talkie:

	Roger:	I THINK WE CAN MOVE THE WAGON.

289	Peter, downstairs, talks into his unit:

	Peter:	CLEAR?

	Roger:	(over talking unit)
			NOT ALTOGETHER, BUT THEY'RE SPREAD OUT PRETTY
			GOOD...ENOUGH TO MOVE THE WAGON.

	The creatures slam against the first floor gate, but it holds
	securely. Peter stares at the beasts as he lowers his talk
	unit. He backs slowly away into the depths of the store.

290	Upstairs, Roger peers from behind a counter.

291	The second floor gate is clear.

292	On the balcony, several creatures wander aimlessly, but most of
	them have already moved down the steps and escalators.

293	Peter is still in sight of the Zombies at the first floor
	entrance. He clips his talk unit onto his belt, then ducks and
	disappears among the aisles.

294	He runs, crouching out of sight, until he rounds a far wall
	and comes up into the elevator.

295	He enters the car and pushes "2". The doors glide shut and the
	car begins to move up.

296	At the door of the Maintenance Office, the knob turns again. The
	door pushes open against Stephen weight. His feet slide on the
	linoleum floor. He cannot get the door closed this time. Biting
	his lip, he makes the sign of the cross, and backs suddenly into
	the room holding his rifle high. The door flies open with a
	slam, and three Zombies advance into the office. Stephen tries
	to aim carefully, and he fires.

297	Just as the elevator doors open. Peter hears the gunfire. He
	hesitates for a moment, then runs toward the entrance arch.

298	Roger is poised at one of the side locks on the gate. The
	gunfire stops him also as he is unlocking the mechanism.

299	Along the balcony, some of the creatures turn around in con-
	fusion. They walk this way and that, attracted  by the sound.

300	Peter thunders up behind Roger.

	Peter:	WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

	Roger:	FUZZ MAYBE?

	Peter:	OR MAYBE FLYBOY. WHERE'S IT COMIN' FROM?

	Roger:	CAN'T TELL.

	Peter:	COME ON. OPEN UP.

	Roger :	 MAYBE WE SHOULD SEE WHAT'S HAPPENIN'...

	Peter:	OPEN UP. I CAN GET THE WAGON OVER. IF IT
			IS FLYBOY, LET'S GET HIM ON OUR SIDE.

	Roger moves to the second lock. More gunfire.

	Peter:	(setting his weapon on the floor)
			YOU JUST COVER ME GOOD, YOU HEAR?

	Roger moves to the third lock as Peter stands and grabs on to
	the handles of the barrow.

301	The body of a dead Zombie hits the floor, its head shot
	through. Nearby lies the corpse of the first creature to break
	into the Maintenance Office.

	The third staggers into the room. Stephen stands fast now. He
	holds his rifle out in front of him. The creature walks toward
	the gun. Steve holds his hands on the trigger. The Zombie lunges
	suddenly, and grabs the gun barrel. Steve fires, but the blast
	tears through the creature's chest. Steve struggles to raise the
	barrel but the motion of the Zombie makes it impossible to aim
	accurately. The gun fires again, this time grazing the Zombie's
	neck. With a sudden burst of energy the creature wrenches the
	gun free. Steve backs against the wall. The creature tosses the
	rifle across the room where it slams the floor near a desk. The
	Zombie advances on Steve. Steve is next to the key cabinet and
	grabs at it, trying to find some weapon. He feels the tools in
	the cabinet and comes up with a hammer. The Zombie is about to
	reach him when Steve pulls the hammer out and upsets the
	cabinet. The Zombie fumbles with the cabinet at its feet, but
	doesn't fall. Steve tries to hit the creature's head with the
	tool, he misses and the Zombie grabs at his arm, trying to bite
	it. Steve wrenches free and the two bodies fall to the floor.
	The creature clutches at the man's legs, it's teeth bared like
	an animal. Steve kicks desperately and manages to land a blow
	squarely in the creatures face. The Zombie comes after him again
	and from his crawling position, Steve brings the hammer as an
	uppercut to the creature's jaw. The creature falls back enough
	for Steve to crawl across the floor. It follows, but Steve
	reaches the desk and grabs his rifle. Rolling on the floor, he
	fires several shots into the creature, finally destroying it.

302	The second floor gate rolls up with a rumble and Peter runs out
	of the Department Store with the barrow full of supplies.

303	The action attracts the attention of several of the creatures
	which are still wandering the balcony. They turn slowly.

304	Just as he rounds the corner. Peter almost collides with one
	creature, and can barely keep from upsetting the barrow. He
	manages to get past, and he runs as fast as he can toward the
	opening of the Administrative corridor.

305	Roger does not let the gate roll up too high. He stabilises the
	metal grid well within reach, then he stands his post with
	Peter's rifle. Several creatures approach from the opposite
	direction. Roger fires at the closest one. It falls. The others
	are still too far away to waste bullets.

306	Stephen steps over the corpses in the office and grabs the
	maintenance manual. He rushes into the corridor and runs out.

307	Three more creatures move toward him up the hallway.

308	At first Stephen freezes, then he starts backing toward the
	firestair, his rifle poised.

309	Just as Peter is reaching the mouth of the corridor, a Zombie	steps out of the hallway into his path. Peter slams the barrow
	squarely into the creature's legs. The Zombie falls in the
	barrow onto the supplies. The big man slams the load against a
	wall at the mouth of the corridor. Before the Zombie can get its
	balance, the big Trooper reaches down and grabs the creature's
	jacket lapels. With all his might he flings the creature out
	against the balcony railing. The creature flips over the rail,
	but does not fall. Its arms and legs flailing as Peter comes up
	quickly behind and flips it over the rail. The creature makes no
	sound as it plummets to the concourse below.310	Roger fires again at a Zombie drawing dangerously near. Other	creatures throughout the area are again converging on the
	Department Store entrance.311	Peter wheels the barrow into the corridor and sees Steve at the	other end, the three Zombies are still closing in.	Peter:	HOLD IT FLYBOY!312	Steve freezes. He can barely see Peter, his vision blocked by
	the Zombies. The creatures are about thirty feet away.313	Peter:	DON'T GO INTO THE STAIRWAY!314	Stephen is confused. The creatures advance.315	Peter:	DON'T OPEN THAT DOOR, BABY. YOU'LL LEAD 'EM
			RIGHT UP WITH YOU.

316	Steve is on the verge of panic.

	Peter:	RUN FOR IT.  RUN THIS WAY.
	The Zombies are drawing closer and closer.317	Peter:	COME ON, MAN. RUN THIS WAY. YOU CAN RUN RIGHT
			THROUGH 'EM. WE GOTTA LEAD 'EM AWAY FROM HERE!

318	Steve sizes up the corridor. It is narrow, but there is room to
	run past the Zombies.

319	Peter:	COME ON, FLYBOY. YOU CAN MAKE IT. COME ON!

320	With a sudden move, Steve breaks into a run. He passes the first	creature easily. The second grabs him as he runs past, but the
	man keeps his footing even though he slams against the wall. He
	keeps moving forward. The third creatures stands in his path.
	Steve lowers his head and slams into the Zombie's chest. The
	creature flies back and falls. Steve falls and tumbles toward
	the mouth of the passageway. He regains his footing as the
	creatures turn to pursue him, he runs to the end of the hall
	where Peter waits.	Peter:	NOW...HEAD FOR THE DEPARTMENT STORE...GO!321	The two men run across the balcony. They slam into two other	Zombies which clutch and grab at them without success.

322	At the entrance arch to the store, Roger fires at another
	creature. It falls. Other Zombies are approaching, but Steve and
	Peter dive into the arch and the three men manage to lower the
	gate without a problem.

	The Zombies converge on the area as they did before, clutching
	and pushing at the metal cage, which holds them out securely.

	The men breathe heavily as they back away from the gate.

	Peter:	DOWNSTAIRS AGAIN ...SAME TRICK.

323	The men move through the aisles of the store and go crashing
	down the escalator.

324	On the first floor they run toward the lower gate where they
	pull up wheezing with exhaustion.

	Steve:	WHAT DO WE DO...

	Roger:	LET 'EM KNOW WE'RE HERE...
			(shouting)
			WHOOOO HOOOOOO...OVER HERE...YEEE HAAAAAAAA.	Steve starts to laugh at the ludicrous situation. Peter smiles
	at the young pilot.

	Peter:	YOU DID ALRIGHT THIS TIME FLYBOY.
			HOW 'BOUT IT?

	Stephen laughs some more, nervously at first, then whole-
	Heartedly. Then he lets out a loud:

	Steve:	WHOOOOOOOOOOOPEEEEEEEEE...

	He has joined the cowboys. He is like a child, almost exultant
	with the joy of their victory...
	The three men shout through the cage at the creatures, which are	already gathering at the gate.

325	Out on the concourse, a few Zombies wander aimlessly, but most
	are heading for the commotion on the first floor arch.

326	On the upstairs balcony, Zombies again move toward the
	stationary steps and the escalators.

327	The three creatures in the Administration corridor move toward
	the open mall. Two walk out on the balcony, but the last one
	turns into an open office. Then it staggers back out and heads
	down the hall toward the firestair.

328	Fran can faintly hear the "whooping" of the men as she moves
	toward the stairway door, which is still open.329	She steps onto the landing and looks down into the darkness. The	shouting stops. Desperate with fear, she moves back to the
	storage room, then back onto the landing. Now her fear turns
	into anger.	Fran:	SHIT...	She takes a few steps down the stairs. Stops. Goes back up.
	Fran:	GOD DAMMIT!
	She starts back down again.

330	In the corridor below, the creature walks into another office.
	Then it moves back into the hall.

331	The Zombies crash against the first floor gate. It holds. The
	men crouch in the shadows of the gate.

	Roger:	WE JUST GOTTA WAIT LONGER BEFORE WE MOVE.

	Peter:	NO. THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE OF SOME OF THEM
			STAYIN' UP ON THE BALCONY.

	Roger:	YEAH, BUT WE CAN HANDLE THAT.  WE CAN BREAK THROUGH.

	Peter:	IF ANY OF THEM SEE OR HEAR US, THEY'LL JUST
			FOLLOW US ON UP.  IT'S NO GOOD.

	Roger:	WE CAN SURE AS HELL OUT RUN 'EM...LOAD UP WHAT
			WE CAN AND GET OUTTA HERE.

	Peter:	I'M THINKIN' MAYBE WE GOT A GOOD THING GOIN' HERE.
			MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T BE IN SUCH A HURRY TO LEAVE.	Roger:	OH, MAN...	Peter:	IF WE COULD GET BACK UP THERE WITHOUT THEM			CATCHIN' ON, WE COULD HOLE UP FOR A WHILE.
			AT LEAST LONG ENOUGH TO CATCH A BREATH.
			CHECK OUT THE RADIO. SEE WHAT'S HAPPENIN'...	Roger:	MAN, I DON'T KNOW...	Steve:	THERE'S SOME KIND OF PASSAGEWAY OVER THE TOP
			OF THE STORES.

	The Troopers look at the young pilot, almost surprised to hear
	him speak.  He has been quiet up until now.

	Steve:	I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S JUST HEATING DUCTS OR
			IF IT'S SOME KIND OF ACCESS. I SAW IT ON A MAP.

	Peter:	UPSTAIRS.  LET'S GO.

	The three move off down the aisles, then duck out of sight
	around a corner. The Zombies clutch at the metal gate, moaning
	and rattling the grid loudly.332	In the Maintenance hallway, we see the thick manual lying on the	floor. A lumbering foot kicks it as the Zombie in the corridor
	wanders into another office. The creature ignores the book, as
	it does the corpses strewn in the hall.333	In the fire stair, Fran is on the middle landing. She is
	suddenly overcome with a wave of nausea. She clutches at her	stomach, retching. She sits on the landing, letting her head
	flop against the wall. She is almost in tears.334	The upstairs doors of the Department Store elevator open and the	men trot out. As they clear a wall, they see the entrance arch.335	There are no Zombies at the gate, but two are seen drifting
	along the balcony outside.

336	Peter:	WATCH IT...DON'T LET 'EM SEE YOU.

	The men move stealthily along the aisles. They look up at the
	ceiling and see a series of large grillwork panels. Peter shines
	his flashlight beam into one.
337	The ceiling is about twelve feet high, but the light beam	penetrates the grille to reveal a fairly large space above.338	Roger:	LOOKS BIG ENOUGH TO CRAWL THROUGH.	Peter:	THEY'RE LOCKED.

	Roger:	DAMN. THAT'S THOSE OTHER LOCK NUMBERS WE
			SAW ON THE CHART.

	Steve:	WHY THE HELL WOULD THEY BE LOCKED?

	Peter:	JACKPOT, FLYBOY. YOU'RE RIGHT.
	Roger:	WHAT?	Peter:	THEY'RE LOCKED BECAUSE YOU CAN GET THROUGH			'EM EASY FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE BUILDING.	Steve:	OVER HERE.339	Steve notices that one of the ceiling grids is very close to the
	elevators. Peter looks at the grids, then down at the double
	doors.	Peter:	THE ELEVATOR SHAFT!
	He moves over and hits the button. The doors open.
	Peter:	HOLD 'EM.	Roger stands against the rubber safety bumper, holding the car
	doors open wide. Peter steps onto the hand railing and reaches
	up for the escape hatch, which is held in place by four knub-
	headed bolts. He removes the bolts quickly and dislodges the
	hatch cover and passes it down to Stephen.	Then the big man sticks his head up through the opening.340	He looks around the elevator shaft, shining his flash this way	and that. He sees another grid in the shaft wall.

	Peter:	IT'S HERE...AND IT AIN'T LOCKED. GET A SCREW-
			DRIVER AND SOMETHIN' TO STAND ON FOR IN HERE.

341	Roger:	I KNOW WHERE THE TOOLS ARE. GET ONE OF THOSE
			TABLES.

	Roger ducks off down an aisle and Steve moves to the nearby
	furniture department and grabs a lightweight lamp table. The
	elevator doors close. When Steve returns with the table he has
	to hit the button again. The doors open. Peter is already
	climbing out of the car into the shaft. Steve uses the table to
	hold the doors open and goes to get another.
	This time he gets a larger coffee table and sets it under the
	opening in the car and puts the smaller table on top. He climbs
	up and sticks his head out into the shaft. The doors close
	again.342	In the greasy black shaft, amid the cables and elevator	mechanisms. Peter examines the wall grid with his flashlight.	Peter:	IT'S ALRIGHT...WE CAN GET IT OFF.
			YOU FOUND IT FLYBOY.

	Even though he speaks softly, Peter's voice has an eerie,
	echoing sound in the narrow shaft.

343	The car doors open. Steve ducks down to see Roger bearing a
	screwdriver and pliers along with some other tools in a shopping
	bag.	Roger:	ONE-STOP SHOPPING ...ANYTHING YOU NEED RIGHT			AT YOUR FINGERTIPS.344	Steve relays the tools up to Peter, who immediately begins to
	work on the screws which mount the grid. He passes the
	flashlight to Steve who holds the beam on the work area.345	Fran sits in the stairwell, her hand over her mouth. It is very
	quiet for a moment, then she hears a slight clicking. Her head
	snaps to attention. She stares down at the bottom landing. There
	is a thump at the door.	Slowly the woman stands to her feet, her eyes transfixed on the
	door below.	Fran:	STEPHEN!

	The door starts to open. Light creeps in. The slow, lumbering
	figure of the Zombie moves into the firestair. Choking back a
	scream, Fran turns and runs up the stairs. The creature below
	follows, unsure of itself in the dim light.

346	At the top, Fran makes it into the storage area and slams the
	door. For a moment, she just backs away in terror. Then she
	gathers her wits and moves to drag the food cartons over as a
	barricade. She struggles with one of the cartons. It is very
	heavy and so large she cannot get a good grip. The smooth
	cardboard slips in her hands.347	The Zombie has almost reached the middle landing.
348	Roger looks down through a ceiling grid. He sees the interior of
	a Sporting Goods Store. Along one wall is an arsenal of the
	latest weaponry for the sportsman.349	Roger:	SWEET JESUS!
	Peter:	I SEEN IT. COME ON!	The men are in a large ductwork which seems to run along the
	entire length of the mall. They move as quietly as they can.
	There are several side tunnels branching off in both directions.

350	Steve passes another ceiling grid and looks down. He sees a
	full equipped radio and electronics shop.

	Roger:	I HOPE YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOIN', BUDDY.

	Peter:	(who is leading)
			THIS IS IT. COME ON.

351	Fran struggles with the carton. She gets it against the door
	finally and moves to haul another.

352	The Zombie has reached the top landing and makes for the door.

353	Before the woman can bring another carton over, she sees the
	door move. She throws herself against it, but can't plant her
	feet well because of the carton of the floor. The door moves an
	inch at a time. The creature's hand reaches into the room. It
	clutches at the edge of the door.

354	Fran panics and runs back towards the escape pyramid, where she
	turns and faces the door.

355	The creature is straining against the weight of the carton. Now,
	now both its hands clutch the door edge. The carton moves
	another inch...and another. Now, the creature's head can be seen
	as it strains to get through the widening space.

356	Fran's eyes are wide, almost hypnotised. She looks for something
	to use as a weapon. The room is bare but for the cartons and
	water drums. She is about to opt for the skylight, when she
	glimpses Roger's knap-sack in the shadows. She runs for it as
	the creature finally breaks into the big room.

357	The woman's hands tremble as she rummages through the cloth
	sack. Nothing appropriate. She dumps the contents out:
	ammunition, mace cans, batteries, flares...flares! She
	nervously grabs one of the cylinders and her shaking hands try
	to deal with the paper wrapping.

358	The Zombie moans as it draws closer. It is approaching the
	pyramid of cartons.

359	Fran manages to free the wrapping, and snaps the cylinder in two
	at the mark.

360	Now the Zombie is between her and the pyramid, cutting off her
	immediate route. It is very near. Fran backs away a few steps as
	she tries to strike the flare head on the small striker on the
	cylinder cap. It doesn't fire...she tries again...and again.
	Now, the Zombie has reached the knap-sack. It kicks through the
	items and knocks and rolls the other flares.

	Fran's flare finally catches with a great whoosh, the bright
	flame startling the woman as well as the Zombie. The creature's
	eyes go wide and it brings its arms up to avoid the brightness.
	The intense white flame casts an eerie light over the creature
	and throws the Zombie's enormous shadow against the cartons and
	wall. The creature backs away a few steps almost tripping over
	the articles on the floor.

	Fran manages to advance close enough to snatch two extra
	cylinders and skirt around the Zombie in a wide arc. The
	creature swats the air, keeping distance, but threatening.

	Fran considers the firestair door, but decides on the pyramid.
	She circles around to a point where she can climb up from
	behind the moaning Zombie. She rushes for the cartons and
	climbs, but loses her footing while trying to hold the flares
	and crashes into the topmost carton. It starts to slide off
	the pyramid and tumbles to the floor almost crashing into the
	Zombie. The creature starts to clutch at the pyramid.

	The stack of cartons is now too short and Fran can reach the
	skylight but can't pull herself up. She accidentally drops
	two flares, including the lit one. It tumbles to the floor
	behind the pyramid where it no longer offends the Zombie's
	eye's. Now the creature tries to climb to the woman.

	Fran grabs the last flare in her mouth and reaches with both
	hands for the skylight. She lifts with all her might and her
	feet come off the cartons but she cannot pull herself up. As she
	tries to lower her feet back to the cartons, the pyramid shakes
	and wobbles from the Zombie. The creature is making progress;
	its hands can almost touch Fran's foot.

361	Peter drops out of a ceiling grid into a plush office. Roger's
	legs appear through the grid and he too swings down, holding on
	with his hands to soften his landing.

	Suddenly, we are aware of a third person on the room in the
	large chair at the desk. Roger startles and grabs his gun.
	Peter just stares. They are in the President's office. Some
	days earlier, the President, shot himself in the head.

	Peter:	COME ON...

	Steve struggles overhead.

	Peter:	JUST DROP, I GOT YOU...		 

	Steve:	I CAN'T...I...

	Peter:	(to Roger)
			THE DESK...GIMME A HAND.

	The two Troopers grab the desk and slide it away from the
	President's corpse. The action causes the chair to spin slightly
	and his wide terrified eyes seem to watch the action.

	The desk in place. Steve's toes can reach its surface. He loses
	his balance slightly and pulls back up. He kicks a picture frame
	off the desk onto the floor, shattering the glass over photos of
	the President's wife and children.

	Peter:	COME ON!

	Steve finally gets footing on the desktop and lowers himself
	down. He stares at the corpse as Roger helps him off the desk.

362	Peter is already unlocking the door to the corridor. He opens it
	a crack and peeks out.

363	The corridor is empty. He sees the door at the end which leads
	to the exterior corridor.

364	As the other men come up behind, Peter opens the door quietly
	and slips into the hall. He starts to walk quickly toward the
	door to the exterior corridor. Roger follows as Stephen moves
	backwards toward the fire stairs.

365	Peter's hands grab the barrow and pulls the cart down the
	corridor backwards so as to face the mall opening.

366	In the corridor, Steve clutches the maintenance manual. Peter
	backs slowly up the hall. The wheels squeak and the big man
	bites his lip. Roger kicks the last corpse to the wall. Steve
	notices that the fire stairs door is open wide.

	Steve:	JESUS CHRIST!

	He bounds towards the door. Roger spins to see what happened.
	Peter turns and quickens his pace. Steve trots up the steps.

	Roger:	(to Peter)
			COME ON...YOU GOT IT.

	Peter runs with the cart the last few yards. As he gets to the
	doorway, Roger breaks up the steps.

368	Steve breaks into the storage area...he drops the manual...

	Steve:	FRANNIE!

369	The woman turns in Steve's direction. The Zombie swats the
	flare out of Fran's hand. She startles and the cartons feel as
	though they will topple. She steadies herself with both hands.
	The creature is grabbing at her legs. She kicks.

370	Steve raises his rifle and moves in for a close shot.

	Roger:	DON'T SHOOT...THEY'LL HEAR YA...

	Roger arrives and the two men charge the pyramid.

371	The creature is still clutching at Fran. She kicks violently as
	Roger pulls the back of the Zombie's clothing. The Zombie falls
	and hits the floor. As it kneels up, Steve swings the butt of
	his rifle and smashes it into the thing's head. Then Roger
	delivers a blow with his gun, straight down.

372	Steve rushes to Fran. She falls off the cartons into his arms
	sobbing and choking.

	Steve:	FRANNIE...ARE YOU ALRIGHT?
			YOU OK, FRANNIE? HEY...

	The woman is incoherent. She is clutching at her stomach.

373	Peter appears in the doorway carrying the TV and several other
	items. He dumps them on the floor.

	Peter:	LET'S GET THIS STUFF UP, COME ON.

374	Roger is dragging the dead Zombie to the door. Peter comes to
	help and Fran starts to wretch. Steve tries to calm her. He gets
	some water in a can and brings it over.

	Steve:	FRANNIE...IT'S OK...COME ON, IT'S OK...ARE YOU
			HURT, HUN? DID YA HURT YOURSELF? FRANNIE...

375	Downstairs, at the exterior corridor, Peter peeks out. He can
	see the mall at the far end. The coast is clear. He and Roger
	hurriedly carry the corpse into the hall and roll it onto the
	floor and retreat back into the fire stairs. Peter holds open
	the door slightly and watches the corridor for a moment.
	Convinced they've not been seen, he closes the door.

376	Peter:	I THINK WE'RE OK, BROTHER.

	They grab more supplies from the barrow and start upstairs.

377	Steve still tries to comfort Fran.

	Steve:	WE'RE OK...WE'RE ALL OK...WE GOT A LOT
			OF STUFF...ALL KINDS OF STUFF...

	In the background the two Troopers bring their load of supplies
	into the big room and deposit them near the TV. Then they go
	downstairs for another load.

	Steve:	THIS IS A TERRIFIC PLACE...FRANNIE. THIS PLACE
			IS PERFECT. WE GOT IT MADE IN HERE...FRANNIE.

	The woman still cannot stop sobbing and retching.

378	Now, the enormous barricade of food cartons is stacked against
	the door again. It is quiet except for the little noises of
	eating and occasional rustle of paper. We also head a faint
	electronic whistle, but we do not recognise it.

	As we see more of the room, we find our refugees sitting near
	the reconstructed pyramid on the floor. Peter seems to be asleep
	up against the pyramid. Roger is nibbling at delicacies from the
	Department Store's Gourmet department.

	Their "loot" is laid around them on the floor. Roger, as he
	eats, is leafing through the maintenance manual. There is a
	stack of tools, some still in wrapping; electric razors, still
	boxed; some clothing articles; the radio, which also plays small
	cassettes. There are soaps, toiletries, pens, pencils, and
	notebooks, flashlights, cigarettes and several decks of cards
	with a canister of chips. The items are clearly not all
	functional. Some are representative of the luxuries considered
	necessary by a consumer society.

	They are all bathed in the blue glow from the television which
	Stephen tries to tune in. Its power cable is spliced into the
	leads of a bare light fixture overhead. Fran cannot be seen at
	first.

	Roger:	WHAT THE HELL TIME IS IT, ANYWAY?

	Steve:	ONLY ABOUT NINE.

	Roger:	AND NOTHING? (referring to the TV)

	On the screen we see the Civil Defence logo, and realise that
	the high pitched electronic signal is coming from the TV set.

	Steve:	AS LONG AS WE'RE GETTING THE PATTERN,
			THAT MEANS THEY'RE SENDING.

	Roger snaps on the large, battery powered radio. He rolls the
	dial getting nothing but static. Finally, he hears a signal
	and tunes it in. A badly modulated voice is droning through
	the interference. It sounds like a war correspondent sending
	a signal from very far away.

	Radio:	...REPORTS THAT COMMUNICATIONS WITH DETROIT
			HAVE BEEN KNOCKED OUT ALONG WITH ATLANTA,
			BOSTON AND CERTAIN SECTIONS OF PHILADELPHIA
			AND NEW YORK CITY...

	Roger:	PHILLY...

	Steve:	I KNOW J.A.S IS OUT BY NOW...IT WAS A MADHOUSE
			BACK THERE...PEOPLE ARE CRAZY...IF THEY'D JUST
			ORGANISE...IT'S TOTAL CONFUSION...I DON'T
			BELIEVE IT'S GOTTEN THIS BAD. I DON'T BELIEVE
			THEY CAN'T HANDLE IT. LOOK AT US. LOOT AT
			WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO TODAY.

379	Peter's eyes suddenly blink open. None of the rest of his body
	moves, the others do not realise he is awake. The big man stares
	at Stephen, who is getting emotionally excited about their
	exploits as a team.

	Steve:	WE KNOCKED THE SHIT OUT OF 'EM AND THEY
			NEVER TOUCHED US...NOT REALLY.

	Peter:	THEY TOUCHED US GOOD, FLYBOY. WE'RE LUCKY
			TO GET OUT WITH OUR ASSES. YOU DON'T FORGET THAT!

380	The other men look at Peter. The radio drones on with more
	disaster reports.

	Peter:	 YOU GET OVERCONFIDENT...UNDERESTIMATE THOSE
		    SUCKERS...AND YOU GET EATEN! HOW YOU LIKE THAT?

	Peter speaks in a low, unemotional tone. Stephen is transfixed.

	Peter:	 THEY GOT A BIG ADVANTAGE OVER US BROTHER.
		    THEY DON'T THINK. THEY JUST BLIND-ASS DO WHAT
		    THEY GOT TO DO. NO EMOTIONS. AND THAT BUNCH
		    OUT THERE? THAT'S JUST A HANDFUL AND EVERY
		    DAY THERE'LL BE MORE.
		    A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE DIE EACH DAY
		    FROM NATURAL CAUSES. THAT PROB'LY TRIPLES OR
		    BETTER WITH FOLK KNOCKIN' EACH OTHER OFF THE
		    WAY IT'S GOIN'.
		    NOW SAY EACH ONE OF THEM COMES BACK AND KILLS
		    TWO, AND EACH ONE OF THEM TWO MORE...
		    YOU KNOW ABOUT THE EMPEROR'S REWARD?	 

381	We see Fran's face. She is listening. There is no answer
	audible. A tear rolls down the woman's cheek. The radio drones.

	After a time, Steve appears. He is surprised to find the woman
	awake. She sits on a new blanket from the store. Another is
	rolled up as a pillow. She wipes away her tears with her
	cigarette still in her hand.

	Steve:	HEY...YOU OK?

	The man kneels next to her, not knowing what to say. Stephen
	sits down next to her and puts his hands on her shoulders.

	Fran:	SO I GUESS WE FORGET ABOUT CANADA, RIGHT?

	Steve:	(taking her in his arms)
			JESUS, FRANNIE, THIS SET UP IS SENSATIONAL.
			WE GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED. WE SEAL OFF THAT
			STAIRWAY...NOBODY'LL EVER KNOW WE'RE UP HERE.
			WE'D NEVER FIND ANYTHING LIKE THIS...

	Fran:	I GUESS NOBODY CARES ABOUT MY VOTE, HUH?

	Steve:	COME ON, FRANNIE, YOU WERE SLEEPING.

	Fran:	WHAT HAPPENED TO GROWING VEGETABLES AND FISHING?
			WHAT HAPPENED TO THE IDEA ABOUT THE WILDERNESS...
			HUNDREDS OF MILES FROM ANYTHING AND ANYBODY...
			STEVE, I'M AFRAID. YOU'RE HYPNOTISED BY THIS
			PLACE. ALL OF YOU. IT'S ALL SO BRIGHT AND NEATLY
			WRAPPED THAT YOU DON'T SEE...YOU DON'T SEE THAT IT
			CAN BE A PRISON.

	She leans in to him, making a final plea.

	Fran:	STEPHEN, LET'S JUST TAKE WHAT WE NEED AND KEEP
			GOING.

	Steve:	WE CAN'T HARDLY CARRY ANYTHING IN THAT LITTLE BIRD.

	Fran:	(angry)
			WHAY DO YOU WANT? A NEW SET OF FURNITURE? A
			FREEZER? A CONSOLE TV AND A STEREO? WE CAN TAKE
			WHAT WE NEED. WHAT WE NEED TO SURVIVE.

382	Cut to a close up of Peter's face. His eyes pop open.

	Peter:	SHUT THAT THING OFF!

	Roger clicks off the radio. They listen. They hear slight sounds
	coming from the fire stairs. The end of the room with the
	barricade of cartons looks surreal in the blue glow of the TV
	screen which still shines.

	Roger crawls over and clicks the TV off as well. The electronic
	whistle slowly dies. Silence.

	Steve steps out from behind the wall of cartons. Fran peers
	around the corner to look, but she still sits on the floor.
	Another noise. The faint squeaking of the door to the bottom of
	the steps. Then footsteps on the metal stairs. Slow...
	lumbering.

	The faces of the humans all tighten. Peter and Roger pull their
	rifles. Roger makes his ready.

	Some thumping in the hall. Steve squats down and holds Fran.
	The sounds are closer now. The door behind the cartons clicks
	but does not move. More pounding...then silence.

	After a time, the footsteps recede down the stairs.

	Peter:	SOMEBODY BETTER SIT WATCH ALL THE TIME.

	Roger:	THEY'LL NEVER GET THROUGH THERE.

	Peter:	ENOUGH OF 'EM WILL. AND IT AIN'T JUST THEM THINGS
			WE GOT TO WORRY ABOUT. THAT CHOPPER UP THERE COULD
			GIVE US AWAY IF SOMEBODY COMES MESS' AROUND.

	Roger:	WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO? LAND ANOTHER PILOT TO FLY
			IT OUT. THEY'RE NOT GONNA MESS WITH A LITTLE BIRD
			LIKE THAT. THEY GOT ENOUGH ON THEIR HANDS. YOU
			KNOW BACK IN PHILLY WE FOUND A BOAT IN THE MIDDLE
			OF INDEPENDENCE SQUARE. SOMEBODY TRYIN' TO CARRY
			IT TO THE RIVER, I GUESS. DIDN'T MAKE IT. DAMN
			THING SAT THERE FOR EIGHT DAYS.

	Peter:	SOMEBODY FINALLY GOT IT, THOUGH. IT COMES DOWN TO
			HOW MUCH ITS WORTH.

383	Fran ducks back onto her blanket. She disgustedly lights another
	cigarette. Steve sits next to her again.

	Steve:	FRANNIE...

	She doesn't respond.

	Steve:	DAMMIT, FRAN, YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES WE'D
			HAVE TO LAND FOR FUEL TRYIN' TO MAKE IT UP NORTH?
			THOSE THINGS ARE OUT THERE EVERYWHERE. AND THE
			AUTHORITIES WOULD GIVE US JUST AS HARD A TIME...
			MAYBE WORSE... WE'RE IN GOOD SHAPE HERE, FRANNIE.
			WE GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED RIGHT HERE!

	Stephen curls up with his head on the rolled blanket.

	Steve:	COME ON...GET SOME SLEEP.

	The woman doesn't move.

	Steve:	FRANNIE. COME ON.

	She grinds her cigarette out on the concrete floor and stretches
	out next to the man. He puts his arm around her. His hands rub
	up and down her body as he curls next to her. He opens her
	blouse and reaches inside. He closes his eyes and he seems
	perfectly comfortable to rest in her softness. His hand moves
	under her clothing. She doesn't respond, at first, then her body
	relaxes somewhat and she brings one of her arms up around his
	head.

	Steve:	I'M NOT JUST BEING STUBBORN. I REALLY THINK THIS
			IS BETTER. HELL. YOU'RE THE ONE'S BEEN WANTIN' TO
			SET UP HOUSE.

	She stares off across the barren room. His hands continues to
	move under her blouse.

384	In the Administration Corridor, a few stray Zombies wander among
	the corpses on the floor. One large and severely wounded
	creature pounds on the door to the interior corridor. It had
	been the one which was pounding at the door upstairs.

	A female Zombie squats near one of the corpses in the hall. She
	lifts its arm and moves it to her mouth, but she drops it
	quickly, repelled by its coldness. She leans over and picks at
	another corpse, then she stands and drifts towards the mall.

	Slowly the creatures leaves the corridor and move out onto the
	second floor balcony. We begin to hear a voice fading in over
	the scene.

	Voice:	...NOT ACTUALLY CANNIBALISM...CANNIBALISM IN THE
			TRUE SENSE OF THE WORD, IMPLIES AN INTRASPECIE
			ACTIVITY... THESE CREATURES CANNOT BE CONSIDERED
			HUMAN..THEY PREY ON HUMANS...THEY DO NOT PREY ON
			EACH OTHER.

385	We see the mall balcony now. Zombies wander past the stores.
	Some move down the stationary stairs onto the main concourse.
	Below.

	Voice:	THEY ATTACK AND...AND FEED...ONLY ON WARM HUMAN
			FLESH...

386	At the mall entrances, some creatures drift out into the night.
	Others still enter the enormous building. There are not as many
	as there were in the afternoon, but there are certainly enough
	to be threatening.

	Voice:	INTELLIGENCE? SEEMINGLY LITTLE OR NO REASONING
			POWER. WHAT BASIC SKILLS REMAIN ARE MORE
			REMEMBERED BEHAVIOURS FROM...FROM NORMAL LIFE.

387	Several creatures are clawing at the roll gate to the department
	store. It is a strange and eerie sight. The staring, painted
	eyes of the mannequins within the store seem to watch the
	Zombies. The gate rattles but does not budge.

	Voice:	THERE ARE REPORTS OF THE CREATURES USING TOOLS,
			BUT EVEN THESE ACTIONS ARE THE MOST PRIMITIVE...
			THE USE OF EXTERNAL ARTICLES AS BLUDGEONS ETC.,
			EVEN ANIMALS WILL ADOPT THE BASIC USE OF TOOLS IN
			THIS MANNER.

388	Fran's eyes pop open the voice has awakened her. She has been
	asleep on the blanket.

	Voice:	THESE CREATURES ARE NOTHING BUT PURE, MOTORISED
			INSTINCT...

	The woman looks around. Morning sunlight is spilling in through
	the skylights above. She sits up and peers into the next area of
	the room. The men are gone. The television is playing. On the
	tube we see a dishevelled man sitting in an emergency news room
	reading the report.

389	Voice:	THEIR ONLY DRIVE IS FOR THE FOOD WHICH SUSTAINS
			THEM. WE MUST NOT BE LULLED BY THE CONCEPT
			THAT THESE ARE OUR FAMILY MEMBERS OR OUR FRIENDS.
			THEY WILL NOT RESPOND TO SUCH EMOTIONS. THEY
			MUST BE DESTROYED ON SIGHT....

390	Fran sees that the barricade of cartons is still in place at
	the fire stairs door. She looks up. The skylight above the
	pyramid is open. She realises that the men are on the roof.

391	At the edge of the roof, Peter looks through binoculars.

392	About a quarter of a mile away, he sees the large warehouse of
	a food processing chain. IN the yard and in the large open
	garages of the building, he sees a fleet on enormous trailer-
	trucks parked.

393	Steve:	YOU SURE WE CAN START 'EM.

	Roger:	YOU HAVEN'T SPENT ENOUGH TIME ON THE STREET.

	Peter:	WELL LET'S GET IT UP. THERE'S NOT TOO MANY
			OF 'EM AROUND YET THIS MORNIN'.

	The big trooper looks down to the parking lot below.

394	There are not as many Zombies as there were the day before, and
	they wander aimlessly, spread out rather than in clusters.

395	The men move for the skylight.

396	In the storage area below, Fran is examining the maps in the
	manual. The TV still drones in a low volume. The men climb
	down into the room.

	Roger:	HEY, FRAN...

	Fran:	I WOULD HAVE MADE COFFEE AND BREAKFAST, BUT I
			DON'T HAVE MY POTS AND PANS.

	There is a bitterness in her voice. Roger laughs. Steve senses
	the tension. Peter just straps on his equipment.

	Fran:	CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

	Steve:	SURE. WHAT DP YOU MEAN?

	Fran:	I'M SORRY YOU FOUND OUT I'M PREGNANT, BECAUSE I
			DON'T WANT ANY OF YOU TO TREAT ME DIFFERENTLY
			THAN YOU'D TREAT ANOTHER GUY.

	Steve:	HEY, FRANNIE, COME ON...

	Fran:	AND,...I'M NOT GONNA BE DEN MOTHER FOR YOU GUYS.

	They all look at her, attentive now.

	Fran:	AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. AND I
			WANT SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE PLANS. THERE'S
			FOUR OF US, OK?

	Steve:	JESUS, FRAN...

	Peter:	FAIR ENOUGH!

	Fran:	NOW. WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

	Peter:	WE'RE GOIN' OUT.

	Fran starts to say something, but this time Peter cuts her off.

	Peter:	...AND YOU ARE NOT COMING WITH US!

	Again the woman starts to protest, but Peter continues.

	Peter:	AND YOU WILL NOT COME WITH US UNTIL YOU CAN
			HANDLE YOURSELF. THAT MEANS LEARN TO SHOOT AND
			LEARN TO FIGHT.

	The big man starts back up the pyramid. Roger moves to
	follow him.

	Fran:	SOMETHING ELSE.

	The men look at her. She faces Roger and Peter directly without
	looking at Stephen.

	Fran:	I DON'T KNOW ANOUT YOU TWO, BUT I WANNA LEARN
			HOW TO FLY THAT HELICOPTER.

	Stephen is shocked. Fran looks at him and lowers her eyes.

	Fran:	IF ANYTHING HAPPENS...WE'VE GOTTA BE ABLE TO GET
			OUT OF HERE.

	Stephen doesn't know what to say. He looks at the woman,
	then up at the other men.

	Peter:	SHE'S RIGHT, FLYBOY. COME ON, LET'S GO.

	Fran:	AND YOU'RE NOT LEAVING ME WITHOUT A GUN AGAIN.

	Stephen thinks about protesting but he complies by slowly
	setting his rifle down on the cartons. Then he fishes in his
	pocket for a fistful of shells and dumps them next to the gun.
	He stares at the woman angry and hurt.

	Fran picks up the weapon and shoots a glance up at Peter. 
			
	Fran:	I JUST MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE
			IT.

	Peter and Roger disappear through the skylight. Stephen stands
	still. He looks down at the floor. Fran moves close to his side.

	Fran:	I'M SORRY, STEPHEN. (it is not an apology)

	Steve:	I KNOW...I KNOW...IT'S ALRIGHT!

	He starts up to the skylight.

	Fran:	STEPHEN

	Steve:	YEAH.

	He stops and turns to look at her. Her eyes are pleading for
	understanding, but he is incapable of it at the moment. Fran
	just shrugs off whatever she was going to say, and she sighs
	with exasperation.

	Fran:	BE CAREFUL.

	Steve:	YEAH, WE'LL BE ALRIGHT.

	He disappears through the skylight. Fran stares down at the
	weapon in her hands, then she steps over and clicks off the
	television.

397	The sudden, loud noise of the chopper engine as it hovers.
	Only Stephen is on board at the controls.

398	In the cab of one of the big trailer trucks Roger is crouching
	working on the wiring beneath the dashboard.

399	Peter sits on the cab of another truck. He tries the
	complicated shift mechanism and fidgets with the other controls.
	Then he pulls out. He stops the big vehicle with his cab just
	abreast of the cab Roger is working in.

	Peter:	HOW ABOUT IT?

	Roger:	GETTIN' IT.

400	Peter looks around. The mall can be seen in the distance. On the
	ground between, there are a few Zombies scattered about in
	little clusters. None of them present any immanent danger.

401	Roger sits up and is able to start his truck.

	Peter:	I'LL JUST RIDE PICK UP, I'M NOT TOO SURE OF
			THIS THING...

	Roger:	I GREW UP ON ONE OF THESE, LET'S GO.

402	The great trucks lumber away from the warehouse. They pull
	across the little loading lot and out a ramp toward the
	roadway. Stephen hovers overhead in the chopper, following
	the trucks as closely as he can.

403	On the roof of the mall, Fran clutches her rifle. She sees the
	big trucks roar up over the hill, the helicopter just above
	them. It is a strange looking convoy as it speeds toward the
	trucks as closely as it can.

404	Along the road, several Zombies try to stagger after the trucks
	but they are left in the dust of the speeding vehicles. The
	creatures lumber along slowly behind.

405	The vehicles pull into the little grade which loads into the
	mall's parking lot. They roar right toward the building.

406	At one of the building entrances, a cluster of Zombies is
	moving in and lot of the main doors. Others wander nearby in the
	parking lot. Attracted by the sounds of the engines, the
	creatures turn and face the trucks.

	As Peter pulls his vehicle in a wide arc, Roger drives his right
	up to the side of the building and roars toward the entrance
	doors. Then he skips his right wheels up onto the curb, and with
	a great, scraping crunch, the big truck pulls directly abreast
	of the building, flush with the entrance. The huge vehicle
	crushes several of the helpless creatures and knocks other
	flying back.

407	The trailer of the truck has totally blocked off the mall
	entrance. Several Zombies trapped inside try to push the glass
	doors open. The doors move, but cannot be opened wide enough
	for the creatures to get out.

408	The few creatures immediately around the truck begin clambering
	at its sides. Roger shuts off the engine and grabs his gun as
	other Zombies begin clutching at the windows of the cab.

409	Overhead, the whirlybird hovers very close by. Now Peter's big
	truck pulls up alongside so that Peter's passenger door is
	directly abreast of the free door on Roger's cab.

	Peter's truck also crushes one or two of the creatures, but
	there are still several in the immediate vicinity of the cab.

410	As Roger opens his door and scrambles into the other truck, one
	of the Zombies grabs hold. Roger just manages to kick the
	creature off as the big truck pulls out and roars across the
	lot.

411	The helicopter flies straight up and directly over the roof of
	the big shopping centre, where Fran has been watching the
	action. She now runs to the other side of the roof, the wind
	from the chopper whipping her hair.

412	The chopper turns and waits for the big truck to move up under
	it, then the whirlybird escorts the trailer back to the warehouse
	down the road.

413	Roger is whooping and hollering like a cowboy as the big rig
	pulls up beside another of the parked vans.

	Peter:	COME ON, COME ON... THREE MORE BABY.

	Roger:	LIKE A CHARM, HUH? LIKE A FUCKING CHARM!

	Roger grabs his knapsack and climbs into the new cab where he
	immediately goes to work on jumping the engine cables.

414	From the helicopter overhead, Stephen spots something moving
	around the warehouse. He jockeys the chopper slightly for a
	better look and he sees a small group of Zombies wandering out
	of the big garage directly toward Roger's truck.

415	In the meantime, Peter's truck pulls away from the cab Roger is
	in. The big vehicle rolls into the large paved area behind the
	warehouse where Peter can turn it around easily.

416	Stephen swoops down with the big bird. He buzzes as close as he
	can to Roger's truck, trying to signal the man.

417	Roger continues to work on the cables, still whooping like a
	child. The Zombies are very close at hand. They have just
	about reached the cab. Stephen buzzes again. Roger doesn't
	notice.

418	Peter has now backed up into a position which enables him to
	pull out. He looks up to see the helicopter heading straight
	for him.

419	The big chopper buzzes right over Peter's cab then spins around
	heading back for Roger.

420	Peter looks toward the other truck. He can now see the lumbering
	creatures. He tries to slam the truck into gear, but the
	complicated shift mechanism fights him.

421	One Zombie slams its hands against the driver-side window of
	Roger's truck. The man startles and tries to untangle himself
	from his cramped position under the big steering wheel. He is
	stuck for a moment. The other creatures appear at the passenger
	side of the cab, where the door is open. One grabs at Roger's
	legs. Roger kicks violently, but can't get a good position. He
	falls lower onto the floor of the cab, his body almost knotted
	among the controls and the shift sticks.

422	Peter's truck starts to roll, but it accelerates slowly.

423	The helicopter tries to buzz the clutching ghouls, but they do
	not even flinch. The wind from the propeller blades whip at the
	creatures' hair, making them look even more frightening as they
	claw at the desperate Roger.

424	The man kicks and kicks, but he cannot deliver a solid blow from
	his pinned position. His hand gropes on the seat of the truck
	for his rifle, which suddenly fires as the man's fingers
	inadvertently hit the trigger. A shell blasts through the chest
	of the lead creature, but the thing pays little attention.

425	Peter's truck is starting to roll faster. He heads right for
	Roger's cab.

426	The helicopter hovers as Stephen tries to see the action.

427	Now Roger has a good grip on his gun, but he cannot clear the
	long weapon from around the gear sticks. The lead Zombie is
	actually scrambling into the cab and is all but on top of the
	struggling Trooper.

428	The second creature is about to claw its way in when, with a
	great roar, Peter's truck swings up and crushes it.

429	Roger is desperately trying to keep the other Zombie's mouth
	away. They are wrestling now. The Zombie is weak, as usual, but
	Roger is still hampered by the position he is in.

430	Peter has pulled too far past the other truck. He slams his rig
	into reverse and backs up. Now his window is in a direct line
	with the open door on Roger's cab. He raises his rifle and aims,
	but he cannot get a clear shot. He shouts loudly trying to
	overcome the noise of the truck engine and the hovering
	helicopter.

	Peter:	GET ITS HEAD UP...GET ITS HEAD UP...

431	Roger realises that Peter is outside. He struggles with the
	creature, dropping his gun. His hands manage to get a
	stranglehold on the creature's neck. He pushes up with all his
	might. The Zombie's hands are clutching at the man's face. It's
	fingers push at the man's eyes.

432	Peter sees the opportunity and fires. The gun roars loudly.

433	The Zombie's head flies apart. Remnants of blood and brain
	tissue splatter the inside of the cab and the driver's window.
	The gummy stuff flies into Roger's face. The Zombie falls limp,
	but Roger is still desperate. The dead weight of the creature is
	now on top of him, and the bloody wound runs. Roger is frantic.
	He frees himself with great heaves of his body and he pushes the
	creature out of the cab. The man's eyes are wide with revulsion.
	He instantly brings up his sleeve to wipe the stains from his
	face. He is quivering in extremes of emotions.

	A sudden crash. Roger spins. The Zombie at the driver door has
	smashed through the cab window with a brick. Roger, still
	shaking, dives down to the floor for his weapon.

434	Peter tries to level off a shot but he cannot because Roger is
	in the way...

	Peter:	GET DOWN...STAY DOWN...I GOT IT!

435	Roger, in his adrenalised anger, sits up with his gun and levels
	off on the creature himself. He fires. The shell crashes through
	the already shattered glass and squarely into the creatures
	head.

	Roger:	YOU BASTARDS...YOU BASTARDS...	

	It seems as though his mind is snapping. His voice quivers as
	does his body.

	Roger:	WE GOT 'EM, BUDDY...WE GOT 'EM DIDN'T WE!

436	Peter:	COOL IT, MAN...GET YOUR HEAD...

437	Roger:	WE GOT THIS BY THE ASS...GOT THIS BY THE ASS!

	Roger is screaming. He dives down to work on the jumping again.

438	Peter:	HEY, ROG...GET YOUR HEAD MAN...COME ON...
			WE GOT A LOT TO DO...ROGER...

439	There is no response from the other truck. Peter is about to
	open his door and step out when suddenly Roger sits up again.
	The engine of the truck roars. He seems to have calmed down
	some. He looks across at Peter.

	Roger:	LET'S GO BABY...NUMBER TWO...

	Peter:	YOU ALRIGHT?

	Roger:	PERFECT, BABY...PERFECT!

	Roger guns the engine on his truck. The big vehicle lumbers out
	of the area. Peter follows suit.

440	The two Semis rumble out of the warehouse lot and start down the
	grade toward the road. The helicopter escorts them.

441	A few Zombies are walking up the road slowly.

442	Roger's eyes get wider with anger. He steers his big rig right
	for the creatures.

443	The front of the cab smashes into two of them. One is crushed
	under the wheels, the other flies back from the impact.

444	Fran watches with anxiety. She sees the two trucks pull up over
	the rise with the helicopter following. We hear spirited music
	as the convoy approaches the mall building.

445	The two trucks roar around the entrance ramps into the parking
	lot and again, the chopper zooms right over the roof.

446	Fran trots across the roof to see the action in the lot.

447	the trucks rumble toward the second set of doors. The music
	continues through the entire action.

448	Roger steers his giant vehicle directly broadside to the doors.
	The cab knocks over several creatures and scrapes the building
	as the trailer blocks off the entrance. This time there are
	still creatures alive in the immediate area. They clutch at the
	cab of the truck and leap at the doors.

449	Fran, watching from directly above, seems inspired, caught up in
	the bravery of the moment. As she sees the creatures converging
	on the truck, she aims her rifle at them. Before she fires,
	Peter's rig slides next to Roger's, cabs abreast.

450	Peter's truck knocks over several of the clutching creatures.
	One Zombie, caught directly under the front wheels, is still
	alive and clutching at the air. Several creatures jump at
	Peter's driver side window.

451	Roger, grabbing his gun, moves to leave his truck on Peter's
	side, but the trucks are too close. His door won't open
	enough to get out. He rolls down his window. Peter has noticed
	Roger's door won't open, and the Trooper fumbles with the gear
	shift in order to pull away, but he hears Roger shouting:

	Roger:	THE WINDOWS...OPEN YOUR WINDOW...YOUR WINDOW...

	Peter dives across the cab and rolls down the passenger window.
	Roger leans out his open window, trying to get his weapon into
	firing position. One or two Zombies are squeezing through the
	narrow space between the truck. They are just about to reach
	Roger when he fires, killing the lead ghoul. More Zombies move
	around Roger's cab, moments away from him.

452	The helicopter buzzes the area as Stephen watches the Zombies
	converge on the cab.

453	Fran, her hair blowing front he chopper, tries to aim her rifle
	into the pack of creatures. Her hair covers her eyes and she
	brushes it away with irritation.

	Fran:	ROGER...IN FRONT, ROGER...IN FRONT, ROGER...

	She shouts over the engine noises, getting very excited.

454	Roger fires again and again down the narrow space between the
	rigs. Another Zombie falls.

	Peter:	FOR CHRISSAKE COME ON!

	Roger is still emotionally crazed. He leans out of his window in
	a very vulnerable position. He is whooping like a child again as
	he tries to level off another shot.

	Suddenly, he's grabbed from behind by a Zombie and almost falls
	out the window. He struggles to hold himself and keep a grip on
	his gun. Peter leans over, trying to get a shot at the creature,
	but can't get a clean sight. Roger grabs the window frames on
	Peter's door and tries to pull himself up. Another creature
	grabs him from behind.

455	Fran watches with emotion in her eyes.

	Fran:	MONSTERS! MONSTERS!

	She fires her gun.

456	The bullet slams into the pavement kicking up a cloud of smoke.
	It narrowly misses a creature. Fran fires again. Her shot tears
	into the shoulder of the Zombie, but it doesn't stop him.

457	The chopper zooms very close. Peter still cannot aim his rifle,
	but Roger, using both hands, brings his gun butt in an uppercut.
	It slams against a creature which is grabbing him and drives the
	thing staggering back. Then with a desperate driving motion, 
	Roger climbs through the window of Peter's cab.

458	Peter pulls the big rig away even while Roger's legs still kick
	out the window. The Zombies grab at Roger's ankles, and one
	manages to hold on as the truck starts to move.

459	Fran fires again and again.

460	This shot rips into the Zombie holding Roger's leg. It lets go
	and falls, rolling across the pavement. The woman fires again,
	hitting the pavement. The creature struggles to its knees. She
	fires again and hits the creature's neck. Again.
	Shoulder. Again...head. The Zombie sprawls on the pavement. Fran
	is exultant, she aims and fires at another creature.

461	The helicopter passes overhead. The music is still stirring.

462	In Peter's truck, just rolling out the lot, Roger realises:

	Roger:	JESUS!

	Peter:	WHAT?

	Roger:	MY GODDAM BAG...I LEFT MY GODDAM BAG IN THE
			OTHER TRUCK.

	Peter brings his vehicle to a screeching halt.

	Peter:	ALRIGHT, NOW YOU SON OF A BITCH! YOU
			BETTER SCREW YOUR FUCKIN' HEAD ON, BABY!

	Roger:	YEAH, YEAH...I'M O.K. LET'S GO.

	Suddenly, Peter grabs the Trooper by his lapels and slams
	him back against the door of the cab.

	Peter:	I MEAN IT! NOW YOU'RE NOT JUST PLAYIN' WITH
			YOUR LIFE, YOUR PLAYIN' WITH MINE!

	The two men stare at each other for a moment. Roger is startled
	somewhat out of his emotional rush.

	Peter:	(softer)
			ALRIGHT, NOW ARE YOU STRAIGHT?

	Roger:	YEAH.

	Peter lets him go and returns to the wheel. He guns the engine
	and roars into a big arcing turn in the parking lot.

463	When Fran sees the truck returning, she looks up from her gun
	sight. The helicopter has already flown over the roof, and
	Stephen is confused as to why the truck hadn't appeared on the
	road. Fran turns and tries to signal to Stephen.

464	He finally sees her and flies closer. The woman waves a signal
	and the chopper buzzes back over the lot.

465	Her hair blowing wildly, Fran takes up her post again, her rifle
	ready. She thinks a moment, then begins to reload the weapon
	pulling the shells from her blouse pocket.

466	Peter's truck zooms back into position, colliding with some of
	Zombies in the vicinity.

467	Roger immediately climbs through the windows into the original
	cab. He snatches up his knapsack and several tools which are
	strewn over the seat and floor.

	Again, creatures converge on the cab area. Two more come up
	between the trucks, several come around the front of the cab.

468	Fran is still loading.

469	The helicopter buzzes.

470	As Roger climbs back through the window, his pack accidentally
	falls to the ground. With reflex action, he drops between the
	cabs, landing on his feet. He is facing the two creatures
	which are very close. He reaches up and with on hand on each of
	the open window frames, he swings his legs up hard. His kick
	sends the creatures sprawling. Then, he bends to collect his
	pack and is grabbed from behind.

471	Peter tries to level off his gun but he cannot get a shot.

472	Neither can Fran who is shouting from the roof.

473	Roger keeps his head this time. His first thought is for the
	pack of tools. He tosses the sack into the cab of Peter's truck
	as though he were making a hook shot with a basketball.

474	Peter catches the pack as several of the tools clatter out and
	onto the floor of the cab.

475	The creature which has a hold on Roger takes advantage of the
	man's imbalance from throwing the knapsack. It bites at the
	man's arm. Roger tears away, but blood appears at the wound.
	Then Roger squares off a solid punch right to the Zombie's jaw.
	The creature flies back and almost knocks over the Zombies
	behind it. Roger jumps, making a grab for the window of Peter's
	cab. The Zombies between the trucks, which Roger originally
	kicked away, have regrouped. They advance and grab at the
	struggling trooper. Roger's feet try to get hold on the side of
	the door, but they slip.

476	Peter moves to drop his rifle and grab Roger's hands, but Roger
	falls from the high window back to the pavement. Peter draws his
	hand gun.

477	Roger leaps again, his hands catching the window frame. The
	Zombies are clutching at him. Again he swings up his legs and
	kicks the creatures off balance. This time he manages to get his
	feet locked against the door and Peter grabs the Troopers arm
	with his free hand, but another Zombie is pulling at the man's
	shirt and still another makes a grab for his legs.

	Peter reaches out with his pistol and fires a point blank shot
	at one of the clutching ghouls. It flies back and Roger is able
	to pull himself higher. His torso is just about through the
	window when another creature grabs him.

478	Peter can no longer get a shot as Roger fills the window, so the
	big man drops his pistol and pulls Roger's arm with all his
	might.
	
479	Roger is almost all the way in but his legs still dangle,
	kicking. Peter starts the truck. As it begins to roll away, one
	of the clutching Zombies is able to get a solid hold on Roger's
	left leg. The creature opens its mouth and bites at the calf.
	Blood appears. The creature bites again and this time it comes
	away with bits of flesh tangled in a bloodstained strip op
	material from Roger's trousers.

480	Roger screams in pain and kicks violently. The truck
	accelerates and the Zombie finally falls clear.

481	It rolls on the pavement for a little way before it stops.
	Then it sits on the ground, looking like a gorilla. It still
	has a bloody mass of flesh and material in its mouth. With its
	hands it tries to separate the cloth from the more important
	morsels.

	A bullet pings into the cement near the chewing Zombie. Another
	tears through its shoulder. It still is concerned only with its
	prize.

482	Fran is firing, swearing through her teeth as the gun roars.
	She finally hits the seated creature squarely in the head.

483	We see it fall from her point of view on the roof. Others walk
	by the corpse without taking notice.

484	The helicopter escorts the big truck back to the warehouse.

485	As it rumbles along, Roger, in extreme pain, is tying his belt
	tightly around his leg as a tourniquet. He sucks air through his
	teeth in anguish.

	Peter:	THAT'S IT.

	Roger:	BULL SHIT.

	Peter:	WE GOTTA DEAL WITH THAT LEG!

	Roger:	I'M DEALIN' WITH IT...I'M DEALIN' WITH IT FINE!
			I WON'T BE ABLE TO WALK ON THIS AT ALL IF WE WAIT.

	Peter:	CAN YOU WALK ON IT NOW?

	Roger:	YOUR DAMN RIGHT, I CAN...DAMN RIGHT, I CAN!

	The wounded trooper struggles to wrap the bloody part of his leg
	with a torn off piece of trouser. He can hardly keep from
	screaming, and his words come out sharply and with great breaths
	between them.
 
	Roger:	I STOP MOVIN' THIS LEG...MAY NOT EVER GET IT GOIN'
			AGAIN...THERE'S A LOT TO GET DONE BEFORE...BEFORE
			YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE ME...

	The big Black man stares at his friend for a moment. Then he
	drives on to the warehouse escorted by the chopper.

486	There is now a huge trailer truck at each of the four main
	entrances to the mall. They are very close to the doors, if not
	completely flush. Some of the glass portals can be opened not
	slightly, but not enough for the Zombies inside to pass through.

487	In the parking lot, the creatures mob around the trucks,
	frustrated that they cannot pass into the building. They clutch
	and claw at the enormous vehicles but to no avail. Some try to
	climb up onto the cabs. Others try to claw at the doors on the
	trailers.

488	Some creatures are crawling under the rigs: When they reach the
	mall doors they cannot stand, so they have no leverage. The
	creatures inside are pushing the doors out, so the Zombies under
	the trucks cannot push them in. The doors swing both in and out,
	so it is very clear that some access could be had by the
	creatures if they were more organised.

	One creature, having crawled under a trailer, does manage to
	push open a mall door. The thing crawls into the building
	through the legs of other ghouls which are trying to exit. They
	behave as a swarm of insects.

	The revolving door offers the best access for the creatures,
	although its inherent complexity is baffling to their empty
	brains. Two creatures do manage to crawl under the truck which
	blocks the revolving door, and one of them negotiates the
	rotating action and enters the concourse.

489	Peter and Stephen are huddled over the maps of the building.
	They are back in the crawl space. The cartons are still piled
	against the firestair entrance.

	Peter:	IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW MANY OF THEM ARE STILL
			INSIDE. THAT'S A LONG HAUL BETWEEN THOSE ENTRANCES.

	Steve:	WELL IF WE CAN GET SOME MORE FLARES...OR MAYBE
			SOME OF THOSE PROPANE JOBS.

	Peter:	THE GUNS ARE FIRST. GUNS AND AMMUNITION.

490	Roger moans with pain. Nearby, Fran is applying a dressing to
	his leg. The wound is wrapped with several layers of cloth. The
	first aid kit is open on the floor. Peter crouches near his
	friend. He takes over from Fran. He ties more strips tightly
	around the wound and around the upper thigh.

	Peter:	YOU SURE YOU GONNA MAKE IT, BUDDY?

	Roger:	JUST HURRY UP WITH THAT!

491	Again, the military music. A tall figure drops out of a ceiling
	grid and lands on the floor of the Sporting Goods Store. It is
	Peter. His rifle is slung and there is an empty pack on his
	back. Several of the Maintenance Room key rings are strapped
	into his belt.

492	Suddenly a Zombie charges across the room. The gate to the mall
	balcony is open on this store. Another creature, attracted by
	the commotion, starts through the open entrance arch.

493	Stephen is starting down through the ceiling grid. He also has
	equipment strapped onto his body. He sees the charging creature.
	Peter is trying to unsling his rifle. Stephen conquers his fear
	of the height, and lets himself fall to the floor. He crumples
	up when he hits, and rolls into a store exhibit, knocking things
	flying.

	Peter manages to level off his gun and shoots the rushing
	creature. Stephen regains his footing. The second creature is
	moving up the aisle. Stephen grabs a powerful crossbow from a
	nearby exhibit. It is loaded. It fires with a strumming sound
	and the small shaft rips cleanly through the creature's skull
	and imbeds itself in a wall beyond. The Zombie walks forward a
	few steps before it falls.
 
494	The men run toward the entrance arch. Leaping up on an adjacent
	counter top, Peter manages to reach the lip of the roll gate and
	he swings it down fast. Stephen catches the cage below and slams
	it into place just as another ghoul falls against it moaning and
	clawing.

	Stephen unslings his gun and is about to level it off on the
	creature outside. Peter jumps down from the counter.

	Peter:	DON'T TRY TO SHOOT THROUGH THOSE GATES.
			OPENINGS ARE TOO SMALL. BULLET'LL WIND UP
			CHASIN' US AROUND IN HERE.

	The Zombie crashes all its might against the metal cage.
	Stephen startles.

	Peter:	HE CAN'T GET THROUGH...COME ON...

495	The men crash back through the store and Peter moves right to
	the racks of weapons. He pulls down a gorgeous high powered
	rifle which is equipped with a sophisticated scope for sighting.

	Peter:	AIN'T IT A CRIME!

	Steve:	WHAT?

	Peter:	(looking through the telescope)
			THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD EVER MISS WITH THIS
			GUN...IS THE SUCKER WITH THE BREAD TO BUY IT.

496	The cross hairs of the telescope zero in on the enlarged
	forehead of the Zombie, which is thrashing against the roll
	gates. The sight gives up a sense of the super-weapon's lethal
	accuracy.

497	Stephen dives into the ammunition and moves behind the counter
	where he pulls out boxes of shiny new hand guns.

	Peter finds elaborate holsters and ammunition belts. He pulls
	several other rifles from the rack. We recognise the firepower
	in the arsenal that the two men accumulate.

498	Other Zombies appear at the gate, but they cannot break in.

499	Peter:	(at the creatures)
			YOU JUST WAIT OUT THERE, SISSIES...
			WE COMIN'...AND WE READY!

500	With a swell in the music, the band of all four humans charges
	out of the Maintenance corridor and makes a break for the
	Department Store. They all wear new double holsters containing
	hand guns. Each has a rifle strapped over his shoulder and
	another in hand. They wear ammo belts and carry packs with
	other supplies. The wounded Roger is sitting in the big
	gardening cart which Peter earlier used to carry the first
	supply load out of the store. Peter runs, pushing the cart
	before him.

	There are only a few creatures on the balcony. The dead things
	turn in confusion at the sound of the attacking commandos.
	Roger, his hands free to shoot, fires his weapon several times
	at some of the creatures who are closest.

501	The creatures from the main concourse below begin to move up
	the stationary staircase and struggle with the escalators.
	The corpses of creatures slain in the earlier battles still
	clutters in the area.

502	Fran and Steve are the first to reach the entrance to the 
	Department Store. Steve falls immediately on the gate locks.
	Peter pulls up to a screeching halt at the gate. He turns the
	cart in a full 180 so that Roger is facing out toward the mall.

	Steve fumbles with the second lock. Peter faces the few Zombies
	which are converging along the balcony. He lift his new
	Super-gun and stares through the scope. The gun roars
	eloquently. Even its sound pronounces its power. The single
	shot rips cleanly through the centre-forehead of one of the
	creatures.

	The man aims at another head. Blam. Another perfect kill. Then a
	third. Roger fires several times.

	Fran stands ready at the roll gate. As Stephen finishes with the
	final lock, the woman pushes against the cage and it starts up.
	Steve stands, and the two roll the cage into the ceiling, but
	Stephen is careful not to let it get out of his grasp.

	Fran moves into the store and Peter pulls the cart behind him.
	Then Steve, Peter and Fran pull the gate shut long before any of
	the advancing creatures reach the area.

503	Again, the Zombies smash into the cage, but the humans are
	already running through the aisles of the big store.

504	Peter wheels Roger into the elevator and hits the button for the
	first floor. The doors shut and the car starts down.

	Peter:	HOW'S THE RIDE?

	Roger:	KIND BUMPY. WATCH IT.

	The stern Black face stares down at the back of the wounded
	man's head. Despite his attempt at humour, the stiffness in
	Roger's body evidences his pain. Peter puts his hand squarely
	on the Trooper's shoulder.

	Peter:	LOOK HERE...I...

	Roger:	I KNOW, I KNOW...SHUT UP.

	Something very serious is shared between the two men, some
	knowledge which we do not fully understand. We do see the
	kind of bond shared by soldiers in a battle.

505	The elevator doors glide open and Peter pushes the cart out
	into the first floor on the big store.

506	Fran and Stephen charge down the store escalator moving faster
	than the steps themselves.

507	They run through the hardware department where Stephen snatches
	up several propane torches. Fran stuffs extra bottles of gas
	into her back pack.

508	With a great hiss one of the propane nozzles spits a white-hot
	flame as it is lit with a new disposable lighter. Fran holds
	two torches as Stephen lights them.

509	Peter steps up to the first floor entrance gate with Roger in
	front of him. Several creatures outside of the cage fly into
	sudden frenzy at seeing the humans. They slam against the grid
	but it holds as usual.

	Peter:	UNLOCK THE MIDDLE ONE LAST.

510	Steve falls on the right hand lock with his keys. The Zombies
	all converge near the crouching man's side of the gate. They
	push and shove. Fran holds one of the lit torches very close and
	the creatures back away cringing. The lock opens and Steve moves
	to the extreme left.

	Again the Zombies follow and again Fran is ready with the torch.

	Peter:	ALRIGHT...THE TOUGHEST PART'LL BE GETTIN'
			BY THESE RIGHT HERE...

	Steve:	IT'S A LONG HAUL DOWN TO THE ENTRANCE.

511	Peter cranes his neck to see past the Zombies and down the
	concourse. Several other creatures are starting toward the
	Department Store. Behind them, about three hundred feet away, is
	one of the main entrances which is blocked off outside by a
	truck trailer.

512	Peter:	WE'LL BE ALRIGHT!

	Fran:	IT'S TOO FAR!

	Peter:	THERE'S NO BACKIN' OUT NOW. WE GOTTA LOCK
			THOSE DOORS!

	Fran:	WE'LL NEVER MAKE ALL FOUR. IT'S TOO RISKY.

	Steve:	YOU JUST STAY HERE AND BE READY TO UPEN UP FOR US.

	Fran:	THE CAR!

	Peter:	WHAT?

	Fran:	THE CAR!

513	Outside, we see the slowly spinning exhibit which displays the
	new automobile. It is a sleek, sporty model, which looks fast
	and manoeuvrable.

514	Peter looks down at Roger.

	Peter:	YOU OK TO START IT?

	Roger nods and reaches for his supply pack. He is cringing
	with pain, but he moves efficiently.

515	The Zombies clutch at the gate with new vigour. At the unlocked
	ends the grid gives a little, but still holds the creature out.
	Fran waves the torches closer and the creatures back away.
	Steve un-locks the middle lock.

	Steve:	IT'S GOIN' UP!

516	The gate swings up with a thunderous roar. The Zombies attack
	but Fran's torches make them hold back slightly. Steve grabs
	one of the propane canisters with one hand and draws a pistol
	with the other. Fran draws a hand gun also. The two fire into
	the pack of Zombies. One or two fall. The others try to move
	in but are afraid of the bright flames. One gets close to Steve
	but the man blasts his torch directly into its face. Its hair
	catches on fire and the creature throws itself wildly about,
	knocking other Zombies back.

517	Now Peter sees an opening and he makes a break with the cart.
	Roger holds on to the sides. They crash through the scattered
	pack of ghouls successfully and Peter makes for the car exhibit.
	There are a few creatures on the concourse on the cart's path.

	Peter:	(shouting)
			CLOSE THE GATE...CLOSE THE GATE...

518	Steve grabs the lip of the roll cage and it starts down. Fran is
	still inside the store with one of the torches.

	Fran:	THE KEYS, STEPHEN...THE KEYS!

	Steve tries to stop the downward progress of the gate but it
	slams shut with a metallic crash.

	Fran:	JESUS CHRIST!

519	Peter stops in his tracks when he hears the woman's shouts. He
	looks back. Several of the creatures have followed the cart.
	They advance slowly.

520	Several have stayed with Stephen, however, and they approach
	Stephen as he tries to pass the keys back through the gate.
	The big ring doesn't fit through the small openings.

	Steve:	 YOU MOTHER!

	Fran:	KEEP 'EM...JUST KEEP 'EM...LOOK OUT!

	The Zombies at Stephen's back are very close. Steve lunges at
	them with his torch. They back off slightly.

521	Peter:	COME ON, MAN! GET OUTA THERE!

	The creatures on the concourse are approaching the cart. A
	pained Roger levels off several shots, but he is very shaky from
	his extreme pain. He manages to down one of the Zombies.

522	Fran:	STEPHEN...FOR GOD SAKE...

	The woman holds up her torch so that the bright flame faces the
	ghouls. Stephen crouches and puts a key in the right hand lock.
	The Zombies converge on him.

523	Peter, seeing other creatures drawing near, starts to push the
	cart again. he manages to dodges two little clusters of the
	walking dead.

524	The lock clicks just as one bold creature grabs Stephen from
	behind, Fran tries to aim her torch closer. It disarms the
	Zombie for a moment, Stephen thrashes his body back knocking
	the think off balance. Then he quickly slides the keys under
	the gate which he can lift just high enough with the single
	lock undone.

	Another ghoul grabs Steve from behind. This time Steve's torch
	is knocked flying and rolls away. Fran is desperate. She tries
	to aim her pistol but cannot shoot through the grill. She holds
	her torch high.

	Steve kicks and scrambles, rolling on the floor. The Zombies
	are on him. He manages to knock one or two of them to the
	floor. Then he fires with his pistol, killing another, He
	crawls to the torch and grabs it, the creatures clutching and
	tugging at his pants and shirt.

	He brings the flame up and flashes it at the Zombies. They back
	away enough for him to crawl to an open space. Then he scrambles
	to his feet and charges down the concourse toward the car.

525	At the exhibit, Peter stops the cart. There are two of the
	lumbering creatures close at hand. The big trooper raises his
	rifle. Roger, using all his strength, manages to pull himself up
	out of the cart. He lips to the exhibit as Peter fires at the
	oncoming ghouls. The super-gun scores two perfect hits.

526	As Roger tries to step onto the spinning platform, he falls and
	rolls against the car. The turntable carries him around toward
	another creature. He is struggling in pain toward the driver's
	door of the vehicle.

527	Steve, who is approaching at a run, sees the action.

	Steve:	WATCH IS ROGER...ROGER!

528	Roger turns his head and sees the ghoul just before the creature
	grabs him. The things hands clutch at the wrapped wound, which
	is already leaking blood through its dressing. Roger screams
	loudly.

529	Peter jumps up onto the spinning turntable, leans across the
	hood of the car. His super-gun drills a hole through the
	creature's skull. It falls off the exhibit.

530	Peter hurriedly comes around to Roger's side. In extreme pain,
	the Trooper is desperately trying to open the driver door. Peter
	helps him. The door opens and Peter eases his friend into the
	seat. Roger immediately goes to work under the dash.

531	Zombies are advancing now from all over the concourse.

532	Peter:	GET IN!

	He is shouting at Stephen who is just rushing up to the
	platform. He and the Trooper scramble into opposite sides of the
	back seat. They slam the doors and make sure that all buttons
	are locked. Roger works as quickly as he can.

533	Several of the lead creatures reach the turntable. Some fall
	trying to step onto the moving disc, but others manage to
	struggle over to the car. They smash the windows with their
	hands. It is a nightmarish scene as the men huddle in the
	shiny, new car which spins very slowly in circles.

534	Fran has relocked the one open gate mechanism, and she stands
	now trying to see the action, but it is out of her line of
	vision. She can only hear the moaning of the creatures, and
	pounding on the car. She turns the valve on her propane nozzle
	extinguishing the flame.

535	The car's engine roars as Roger is able to jump the wires.

	Steve:	I'LL DRIVE IT...

	Roger:	I GOT IT.

	The Trooper's face contorts in agony as he moves himself into
	position behind the wheel. He is shaking, but he bites his lip
	and slams the car into gear. There are at least eight creatures
	crawling over the car, more approach. The platform spins. Roger
	waits until the car is aimed directly down the concourse. The
	men in the back seats are alert to the Zombies which pound at
	the windows. The ugly and distorted faces press close against
	the safety glass.

536	Now the car pulls out quickly. It rolls of the edge of the
	spinning display, knocking several of the creatures aside. The
	front wheels move off the platform and bounce onto the floor,
	but the frame of the car scrapes the top of the disc and is
	stuck for a moment. The disc spins on carrying the rear of the
	car with it. Then Roger gives it more gas. The rear wheels spin
	and finally catch.

537	The car shoots out onto the mall floor. Some of the Zombies
	cling for a moment, but they fall away quickly, scrambling to
	regain their footing and follow.

538	The car swerves and for an instant seems as though it will
	crash against the columns on the concourse. Roger manages to
	control it, and the shiny vehicle zooms ahead with tremendous
	energy.

539	One of the stray creatures in the concourse tries to intercept
	the speeding auto, but the car knocks him mercilessly aside as
	though he were a bowling pin.

540	Fran sees the car as it rounds the corner, heads directly for
	the main entrance which she can see from her position.

541	The Zombies at the entrance already started back into the mall
	attracted by the commotion. The car zooms down the concourse
	easily breaking their ranks.

542	Roger throws the manoeuvrable vehicle into a screeching
	tailspin, stopping just at the doors.

543	The big trailer blocks the entrance effectively. There are some
	creatures inside the doors. Under the van, several Zombies are
	struggling with the doors. one is just pushing in and seems as
	though it will be able to enter.

544	Peter and Stephen slam against the door. Stephen aims his torch
	directly at the crawling creatures. The one in front withdraws
	its arm. The grotesque things writhe, kick under the truck. The
	door slams and Peter produces another set of master keys. They
	are all coded. he falls on the lock mechanism.

	Peter:	THAT'S NOT 100%, BUT I DON'T THINK THEY'LL GET
			THROUGH.

	Steve:	CAN'T THEY SMASH THE GLASS?

	Peter:	SAFETY STUFF...PRETTY INDESTRUCTIBLE...THEY GOT
			NO LEVERAGE UNDER THE TRUCK.. GIMME THE ALARMS...

545	Steve rummages in his back pack. Produces two portable battery
	operated burglar alarms. Peter activates the units, stands them
	against the base of the now locked doors. As he crouches near
	the glass, creatures outside go into a frenzy clawing at the
	glass doors. They cannot get in.

	Peter:	I'M HOPIN' THEY'LL JUST GO AWAY AFTER THEY FIND
			THEY CAN'T GET IN...

546	The creatures moving slowly down the concourse are now getting
	close to the action.

547	The men hop back into the car, it roars off with Roger still at
	the wheel.

548	Again the sleek auto rips through the ranks of the advancing
	Zombies. They fall and scatter.

549	The car speeds down the concourse, turns the corner near where
	Fran watches at the Department Store game. We hear Steve's voice
	on the woman's walkie talkie.

	Steve:	WE'RE OK...WE GOT IT MADE...IT'GONNA WORK.

	Fran stares out through the roll cage. The Zombies are
	staggering weakly after the car.

550	With another tailspin, the auto pulls up at the second set of
	doors. The men scramble out of the back seat, the Zombies
	outside try to crawl under the second trailer. The men shut them
	out easily, locking the door and planting alarms. They stand to
	look down the concourse.

551	The creatures seem even more spread out now.

	Steve:	HOW MANY YOU FIGURE ARE ALREADY IN...

	Peter:	DUNNO. NOT TOO MANY. WE'LL GET 'EM EASY. WE
			GET IT ALL LOCKED OFF AND WE'RE GOIN' ON A HUNT!
  
	The big Trooper raises his super-gun and sights through the
	telescope.

552	As we see through the scope, cross hairs settle on the forehead
	of one of the creatures which is lumbering down the hall. The
	face is magnified, distorted by the telescope. The gun roars and
	the head in the scope explodes with red.

553	The creature falls against a column, hit squarely through the
	brain. We sense the supreme accuracy of the magnificent weapon.

554	It is night. The Zombies in the parking lot still group around
	the semis. They set up an eerie moaning in the moonlight. A slow
	piece of music starts to build.

555	The creatures crawl under the trucks but cannot enter the mall.
	They pound and scratch at the doors, to no avail.

556	From inside the concourse, the mob is muffled. Even the
	revolving door is locked now. It seems the most vulnerable, but
	the crawling creatures cannot quite get leverage to smash the
	glass panels and they have no tools to pound with.

	The auto is flush against the revolving doors inside, offering
	added protection. Several alarm units sit atop the car. They
	are the early warning devices against penetration.

557	They camera starts to dolly back, the music builds. We see slain
	corpses of many Zombies lying askew in various parts of the
	building. It is like a battlefield after a war.

558	The humans appear on the second storey balcony. Moving to the
	railing, looking down to the expanse of the building. They are
	guerrilla fighters, with their weapons strapped on. They have
	taken the Temple. The music hits a crescendo as the people look
	over their spoils. Even the wounded Roger seems triumphant as he
	limps to the rails, supporting himself on his arms.

559	We see a spectacular shot of the full expanse of the building.
	Zombies lie dead everywhere. The humans have captures the gold of
	the Gods...In this case the Gods of Consumer Heaven.

560	Peter's hand is on the maps of the Maintenance Corridor. He is
	drawing a line past the washrooms at the end of the hall near
	the firestair.

	Peter:	WE PUT UP THE WALL HERE. THERE'S NO DOOR FROM
			THE LAST OFFICE INTO THE WASHROOMS, SO NOBODY'LL
			GET NOSEY...AND THIS WAY WE CAN STILL GET TO THE
			PLUMBING...

	Steve:	WHY CAN'T WE JUST BOARD UP THE STAIRWAY. HELL,
			THEY CAN'T EVEN GET THROUGH A STACK OF CARTONS.

	Peter:	I'M NOT JUST WORRYIN' ABOUT THEM. SOONER OR
			LATER MIGHT BE A PATROL THROUGH HERE...LOOTERS
			MAYBE...I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO EVEN KNOW THAT
			STAIRWAY EXISTS.

	They look back at the map.

	Peter:	THE DUCTWORK RUNS ALL THE WAY INTO THE WASHROOMS.
			WE'LL HAVE TO GET IN AND OUT THAT WAY. WE'LL
			BRING UP ANY BUG STUFF WE WANT BEFORE WE PUT UP
			THE WALL.

561	The men sit huddled. The large storage area is filled with
	mounds of supplies brought up from the mall stores, but the
	stuff all sits around in disarray.

562	Behind the wall of cartons, Roger seems to be sleeping, but he
	is sweating feverishly, and his face twitches. Fran has been
	trying to soothe him with a wet cloth on his forehead. Now she
	stops, leaving the cloth on the shivering head. She moves out
	to Stephen and Peter.

563	Fran:	HE SEEMS TO BE SLEEPING.

	Peter:	GOOD.

564	The woman moves to where she has medical supplies on one of the
	cartons. There are bottles, vials and diabetic hypo syringes as
	well as bandages and dressings from the Pharmacy in the mall.

	Fran:	I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO...

	Steve:	YOU'RE DOIN' FINE.

	Fran:	HIS LEG IS AWFUL...THE INFECTION IS SPREADING FAST.
			CAN'T WE FLY HIM OUT OF HERE...TRY TO FIND A MED.
			UNIT...

565	Steve looks at Peter. The big trooper speaks softly.

	Peter:	I'VE SEEN HALF A DOZEN GUYS GET BITTEN BY THOSE
			THINGS...NONE OF 'EM LASTED MORE THAN THIRTY SIX
			HOURS.

566	Fran is stunned. Suddenly, Roger screams from behind the cartons.

	Roger:	PETER...PETER...WHERE ARE YOU?

567	Peter:	RIGHT HERE, BUDDY.

568	Roger is sitting up. His eyes look very dark and sunken. He is
	sweating even more profusely than before.

	Roger:	YEAH...YEAH...

	He licks his lips. He looks around the vast, barren room, trying
	to clear his eyesight.

569	Outside, Fran sits on a carton. The men are still huddled
	around the spoils. Roger occasional shouts from the other
	room.

	Roger:	WE DID IT, HUH, BUDDY? WE WHIPPED 'EM.

	Peter:	THAT'S RIGHT ROG.

	Roger:	DIDN'T WE? PETER? DIDN'T WE WHIP 'EM?

	Peter:	WE SURE DID, BUDDY.

	Roger:	WE WHIPPED 'EM AND GOT IT ALL! WE GOT IT ALL!

	The man's voice sounds pathetic as it echoes through the big
	storage area bouncing off barren walls.

570	A hammer slams into nails behind the fake wall which the people
	are working on. A great network of two-by-fours are braced at
	the rear of the corridor, more lumber is wedged against walls
	making a frame. Stephen is slamming large nails into the
	framework for reinforcement. On the frame's face a masonite
	panel is nailed into place on one side. Peter works in the
	corridor. He is carefully nailing in a moulding which makes the
	new partition look like a finished wall.

	In the corridor, there are power tools lying about and a vast
	array of other hardware in the gardening cart. Fran appears from
	out of the washrooms. She is carrying an old can of paint which
	has obviously been used.

	Fran:	THIS MUST HAVE BEEN FOR TOUCH UP...IT LOOKS
			PERFECT.

	Peter grabs the can and pries it open quickly with a screw
	driver. He dips his finger into the liquid and smears some onto
	the new wall where it butts against the corridor. It is a
	perfect match.

	Steve:	(to Fran) ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT BEFORE WE CLOSE
			IT OFF?

	Fran:	NO...

	The woman is staring down the corridor toward the mall proper.

571	The corpses from the hall have been carried out of the way.
	They are piled together at the corridor mouth on the balcony.
	It is a grisly sight. Fran turns away.

572	Fran:	NO.

	She steps back through the unfinished partition, leans against
	the framework. Her hand goes to her mouth as she tries to choke
	back a gag. Steve moves up behind her, but she feels another
	wave of nausea and she darts for the washroom. Steve sets down
	his hammer and follows.

573	The woman is kneeling on the floor, propped up by her hands on
	the toilet seat. She is vomiting. Steve approaches quietly. His
	hand falls on her back.

	Fran:	LEAVE ME ALONE...IT'S ALRIGHT...IT'S MY PROBLEM.

	Steve:	FRANNIE...

	Fran:	JUST GET OUTA HERE, STEPHEN...I DON'T WANT YOU
			HERE.

	The man doesn't move. Fran reaches up, taking his hand. She
	clutches it tightly, indicating that she is not angry.

	Fran:	I DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE ME THIS WAY...

	Another wave hits her and she wretches again. She pulls her
	hand back leaning over the toilet bowl.

	Fran:	PLEASE GO...I'M ALRIGHT...PLEASE...

	Stephen stands up reluctantly and drift out of the room. The
	woman wretches but she is dry. She tries to swallow. Then sits
	on the floor next to the toilet holding her stomach. She
	fumbles with the flush handle, depressing it. The rushing water
	makes an ugly sound. Fran looks down at her stomach thinking of
	her pregnancy.

574	Stephen steps out of the unfinished framework. Peter is gazing
	down the corridor at the pile of corpses.

	Peter:	THIS PLACE IS GONNA BE ROTTEN...WE GOTTA
			CLEAN UP, BROTHER.

	Flies buzz about the staring faces of the dead things on the
	balcony.

575	Peter's hands are on the round hatch wheel of an enormous safe.

	Peter:	THEY'RE USUALLY ON A TIMER...OPEN AT
			NINE...LOCKED AT FOUR...KEEPS THE BANKERS HONEST.

	The wheel spins and Peter swings the giant door open.

576	Inside is a huge safety deposit vault of a bank. The men stand
	for a moment in awe. The clean walls are lined with drawers and
	doors where depositors have stored their valuables. At one end
	of the room there are stacks and stacks of paper bills. The men
	approach the piles of money, stooping down.

	They each pick up packets of bills and flip through the edges...

	Peter stuffs several packets into his knapsack. Steve looks at
	him quizzically.

	Peter:	YOU NEVER KNOW, BROTHER.

	Steve takes several stacks and stuffs them into his kit. He
	looks about the enormous vault.

	Steve:	DON'T YA WONDER WHAT THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS ARE GONNA
			THINK...GUYS IN THE FUTURE...DIGGIN' THE PLACE
			UP. IMAGINE ALL THE STUFF IN THESE BOXES...
			JEWELLERY...MAYBE THEY'LL FIGURE IT'S ALL SOME
			KIND OF OFFERING TO THE GODS...LIKE IN THE
			PYRAMIDS...A BURIAL CHAMBER.

	Peter:	THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS, NOW.....

577	We see the men wheeling gardening carts piled with corpses. The
	sombre image is shocking as the figures move in silhouette
	against the bright store fronts with their displays of goods
	designed to attract shoppers to the sweet life the items
	pretend to represent.

578	At the bank, Peter wheels a cart with several dead Zombies
	through the lobby.

579	In the vault, the big Trooper dumps bodies out on top of
	several others, already deposited. The corpses lie askew, their
	arms and legs protruding. The stacks of money are upset by the
	limp action of the bodies as they roll around.

580	A finger flips a switch and we hear the mall music start up
	slowly.

581	We see a montage: Fran, Stephen and Peter walk slowly through
	the conquered building. They drift in and out of stores picking
	up various items. They use shopping carts.

582	Fran rummages idly through the cosmetic department.

583	Peter looks through a book store.

584	Stephen plays the pinball machines in a huge game room.

585	Peter tries on big colourful hats in front if a mirror.

586	Fran trims Stephen's hair as he sits in the mechanical chair of
	the mall Barber Shop.

587	Fran feeds the animals in the Pet Store, then with a bag of seed,
	she feeds the Tropical Birds in the tall cage out on the
	concourse. The birds flutter, flap about, screeching loudly.

588	Now the group walk along the upper balcony. They look down.
	They still have their weapons and kits, Peter is wearing a wide
	brimmed hat and Fran sports a new mink coat.

589	The concourse is empty now of corpses, but the group can hear
	the moaning and thumping at the main entrances. It is dark
	outside, the creatures claw at the doors but cannot be seen in
	the shadows under the big trailer trucks. The sound evidences
	their presence, however.

590	The people stand at the balcony railing overlooking their realm.

	Fran:	THEY'RE STILL HERE.

	Steve:	THEY'RE AFTER US...THEY KNOW WE'RE IN HERE.

	Peter:	THEY'RE AFTER THE PLACE...THEY DON'T KNOW
			WHY...THEY JUST REMEMBER...REMEMBER THAT
			THEY WANNA BE IN HERE!

	The noise at the entrance continues eerily. Fran starts to be
	afraid.

	Fran:	WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY?

	Peter:	THEY'RE US, THAT'S ALL. THERE'S NO MORE
			ROOM IN HELL.

	Steve:	WHAT?

	Peter:	SOMETHIN' MY GRANDADDY USED TO TELL US...YOU
			KNOW MACUMBA? VOODOO... GRANDADDY WAS A PRIEST
			IN TRINIDAD. USED TO TELL US...WHEN THERE'S NO
			MORE ROOM IN HELL...THE DEAD WILL WALK THE EARTH.

591	Roger is screaming wildly. He is sweating and his face looks
	sunken with an ashen colour. He thrashes about as Steve tries to
	hold him. His leg is swollen, almost all black. His arm, which
	was also bitten, is wrapped but oozing.

	Steve:	GET MORE VALIUM IN HIM...

	Fran fumbles with one of the hypodermics, but she drops the vial
	of serum and it shatters on the floor.

	Steve:	GET ANOTHER ONE...COME ON...

	Roger is throwing himself about wildly. Steve barely manages to
	hold on. Fran rushes into the other room.

592	The space is starting to look like living quarters. There is
	furniture. There are sectioned off areas with things still
	packed in cartons, but it is beginning to look like home.

593	The woman rushes to the medical supply area which is now more
	organised with little cabinets and a small refrigerator. She
	takes a new vial of serum from the freezer.

594	Downstairs, Peter is checking the covering at the floor base of
	the fake wall. He hears the violent screaming from above.

595	He climbs up a rope ladder in the ceiling, scrambles through the
	grill in the ceiling, enters the duct. Then he pulls up the
	ladder and closes the grill.

596	He crawls through the tight space for a few feet, and drops out
	of another grill into the washroom.

597	He moves through the internal corridor and into the firestair. 

598	All the while, Roger's screaming can be heard. Peter tramps up
	the stairs several at a time.

599	He rushes through the living space in the direction of the
	screams.

600	Fran is withdrawing a hypodermic from Roger's good arm. The man
	still thrashes wildly. Steve is struggling to hold him. Peter
	rushes in and helps. Fran drifts out of the room.

	After a short time Roger relaxes somewhat.

	Peter:	(to Steve) GO ON...I'LL STAY WITH HIM.

	Steve leaves the area.

601	In the living spaces, Fran is sitting in a chair. It is the
	inflatable kind, which can be collapsed like a balloon. Steve
	comes up to her and puts his arms around her neck from behind.
	She cups his hands with hers and holds them tightly. She stares
	off across the room.

602	Roger catches his breath and looks up at Peter. He licks his
	lips and tries to speak coherently.

	Roger:	YOU...YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF ME, RIGHT, PETER?
			YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF ME...WHEN I GO...

	Peter:	I WILL.

	Roger:	I DON'T WANNA BE WALKIN' AROUND LIKE THAT PETER...
			NOT AFTER I GO...I DON'T WANNA BE WALKIN' AROUND
			LIKE THAT...

	The man's eyes are terrified. He looks this way and that at the
	walls, the ceiling, at Peter...He can't focus...

	Roger:	PETER? PETER?

	Peter:	I'M HERE, TROOPER.

	Roger:	YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF ME...I KNOW YOU WILL...

	Peter:	I WILL.

	Roger:	PETER?

	Peter:	YEAH, BROTHER.

	Roger:	PETER, DON'T DO IT...TIL YOUR SURE...SURE I'M COMIN'
			BACK...DON'T DO IT TIL YOU'RE SURE...I MIGHT NOT
			COME BACK, PETER...I'M GONNA TRY NOT TO...I'M
			GONNA TRY...NOT TO COME BACK...

603	Later, the moon shines down through the skylight in the living
	area. A sturdy ladder has now replaced the pyramid of cartons
	up to the open hatch.

604	Stephen fiddles with the television. There is a faint signal
	coming in. He has the set wired to a makeshift antenna which
	stretches through the skylight. A table lamp sits on a small
	end table and is lit. Its cable is patched into a network of
	wiring which stretches about the room.

605	Fran is unpacking things. She is stacking dishes and silverware.
	It is a very orderly scene. The couple looks like a pair of
	newlyweds who have just moved into a new house.

606	On the television, two men are talking, a commentator and an
	official of the Government. The Scientist is in a suit, but his
	tie is rumpled and his collar open. He has not shaved and he
	seems very tired and nervously upset.

	Scientist:   I'VE GOT TO...BE CAREFUL WITH WORDS HERE...WE
			HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO STUDY THEIR HABITS...WE'VE
			REPEATEDLY ASKED FOR A LIVE CAPTURE SO WE CAN HAVE
			CONTROLLED STUDY...WE NEED SUPPLY AND DEMAND
			RATIOS.

	Comm.:	YOU MEAN...THEIR NEED VERSUS...

	Scientist:   VERSUS THE AMOUNT OF FOOD AVAILABLE. LETS BE BLUNT.

	There is a commotion in the TV studio. We hear noises and
	shouting, as we did J.A.S. earlier.

607	Steve:	JESUS CHRIST.

	He squats near the set, staring. Fran comes up behind him.

608	Scientist:   PROJECT OUT THEIR RATE OF GROWTH...THERE'S A
			CRITICAL BALANCE...AND IT'S THE WASTE THAT KILLS
			US. LITERALLY...THEY USE...THEY USE MAYBE FIVE
			PERCENT OF THE FOOD AVAILABLE ON THE HUMAN
			BODY...AND THEN THE BODY IS USUALLY INTACT ENOUGH
			TO BE MOBILE WHEN IT REVIVES. THERE'S AN ECOLOGICAL
			IMBALANCE AND THEY'RE INCAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING...

	Comm.:	WHAT ARE YOU PROPOSING?

	Scientist:   WE HAVE TO BE UNEMOTIONAL...WE HAVE TO PROVIDE
			COUNTER MEASURES OR WE'RE ALL...

	Comm.:	COUNTER MEASURES?

	Scientist:   THEY CAN'T CONTROL THE RATE OF GROWTH AND CON-
			SUMPTION...WE HAVE TO CONTROL IT FOR THEM!

	Comm.:	YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT WE HELP THEM?

	Scientist:   BY HELPING THEM IN THIS CASE WE SAVE OURSELVES...

	A great outcry is heard in the studio. The camera bobbles
	around. The scientist is fumbling for words.

609	Stephen:	GOOD GOD.

610	In the other room, Peter sits against a wall. He can hear the
	television. His eyes stare straight ahead at something.

	Scientist:   I'M PROPOSING THAT CERTAIN...NECESSARY MEASURES
			BE PUT INTO EFFECT AT ONCE...MEASURES APPLYING TO
			ALL OFFICIAL SEARCH AND DESTROY UNITS, WHILE
			THEY'RE STILL OPERATIVE...HOSPITALS...RESCUE
			STATIONS...AND ANY...PRIVATE CITIZENS...

	The camera pulls off Peter's face. We see that his rifle is
	stretched across his lap. The TV drones on from the other room.

	Scientist:   IN CO-OPERATION WITH THE MOBILE UNITS OF THE O.B.P.
			THE CORPSES OF THE RECENTLY DEAD SHOULD BE
			DELIVERED OVER TO THE AUTHORITIES FOR COLLECTION
			IN REFRIGERATED VANS...THEY SHOULD BE DECAPITATED
			TO PREVENT REVIVAL...

	We see now what Peter is staring at. On the floor, twenty feet
	away lies the corpse of Roger. It's face is covered with a
	blanket. It lies very still.

	Scientist:   THIS COLLECTION...THIS COLLECTION...

	The man's voice is heard almost shouting over the voices from
	the studio. The angry staff protests vigorously, with
	emotional language...

	Scientist:   THIS COLLECTION COULD BE...STORED...RATIONED...
			FOR DISTRIBUTION AMONG THE INFECTED SOCIETY...

	The shouts of anger continue.

			IN AN ATTEMPT...IN AN ATTEMPT TO CURB THE SENSELESS
			SLAUGHTER...THE SENSELESS SLAUGHTER OF OUR OWN
			SOCIETY...

	Suddenly the dead Roger's foot seems to move under the blanket.
	Peter's eyes pick up the movement immediately. His hands
	tighten on his weapon.

	Scientist:   THE DISSECTION...THE DISSECTION OF THE CORPSES CAN
			BE CARRIED OUT...CARRIED OUT WITH RESPECT FOR THE
			DIGNITY OF THE HUMAN BODY...

	Roger's arms seem to move, in slight twitching motions...

			THE HEADS...THE HEADS AND THE ...SKELETONS...
			WHENEVER POSSIBLE...COULD BE IDENTIFIED AND...
			AND BURIED IN CONSECRATED GROUNDS...

	The commotion in the studio reaches a fever pitch.

	From the movement beneath, the blanket starts to creep down off
	Roger's face. Peter stares with fascination and disbelief.
	The blanket clears the blankly staring eyes...the drooling
	mouth...Roger tries to sit up/ Peter's hands click a shell into
	his super-gun.

	Suddenly, the corpse sits up. It stares at Peter, blankly at
	first, then with purpose...it starts to move towards the Trooper
	who calmly raises his weapon...

611	On the TV, the commotion still rages. Stephen and Fran stare at
	the tube, hardly believing what they see. The scientist is
	shouting above the din. He is nervous. He wipes his brow with
	his sleeve...

	Scientist:   WE'VE GOT TO REMAIN UNEMOTIONAL...UNEMOTIONAL...
			RATIONAL...LOGICAL...TACTICAL! TACTICAL!

612	Steve:	THEY'RE CRAZY...THEY'RE CRAZY...

	Fran:	IT'S REALLY...ALL OVER, ISN'T IT...

	BLAM! The loud roar of Peter's gun from the next room. Fran
	startles and falls into Stephen's arms.

613	Roger's corpse is dumped on top of the stack of bodies in the
	Bank vault. His eyes stare with a puzzled expression. The arms
	and legs of the other bodies make the room look like a
	Renaissance Painting of hell itself. There is the familiar
	gunshot wound in Roger's forehead.

	The heavy door of the vault closes with a metallic slam which
	echoes through out the mall.

614	A small puppy lifts its leg and urinates on a table.

	Fran:	ADAM! NO NO!

	The woman's hands reach into frame and grab the little animal.
	She carries it through the room and drops it on some papers laid
	out in an unused part of the storage area.

	Fran's stomach is big now, her pregnancy evident. She wipes her
	brow like an exhausted housewife, and shuffles back into the
	living area. She fumbles with the sheets on the double mattress
	which she and Steve obviously share. There is an end table near
	the bed, with a reading light. Books lie strewn around, along
	with magazines and half drunk cups of coffee.

615	In the sitting room, we see a scene which could be comfortable
	suburban. The furniture is neatly arranged. There is a small
	portable stove which operates on bottled gas, a refrigerator,
	and cabinets with dishes and silverware.

616	There is a modern calendar on the wall, which has three months
	crossed off. There are a variety of radio and TV units and a
	stereo record player. There are even decorations: paintings
	hung, knick knacks on the tables. The room almost looks like a
	wealthy man's den, with all the gadget-oriented affluence.

617	In the Department Store, Stephen wanders about. He fiddles with
	a new supersonic calculator and he looks at adult games.

618	On the roof, in the bright sun of early morning, Peter plays
	tennis against one of the shed walls. He's dressed in a new
	sweat suit with brightly coloured Addidas sneakers. He has a
	sleek new racquet, slamming phosphorescent balls with all his
	might. His face is set in what is almost anger. He attacks each
	shot with determination and emotion.

619	One of his shots misses the shed. The ball bounces and banks off
	the lip of the roof, then it tumbles over the edge.

620	In the parking lot below, the ball hits the pavement. It bounces
	several times, rolling off among the feet of the army of Zombies
	wandering this way and that through the area.

621	The creatures mob around the trucks at the main entrances. They
	moan and gurgle, clawing at the building. There seem to be
	hundreds of them, all different ages, sexes, shapes. Some
	clothed, some naked, some wounded, some almost untouched.

622	Now Fran, the pregnant housewife, is cooking supper.

623	The men play cards with hundred dollar bills in the living space.

624	The three sit around the dinner table, just finishing their
	supper. The TV set is on, but only grey snow fills the screen
	and the speaker hisses as it receives no signal.

	Fran:	THERE HASN'T BEEN A BROADCAST FOR THREE DAYS.
			WHY DON'T YOU GIVE IT UP?

	Steve:	THEY MIGHT COME BACK ON.

	Fran angrily throws down her silverware and stomps over to the
	TV. She clicks it off. The woman returns to the table.

	Steve stands up and moves to the set. He clicks it back on.
	Peter watches the two sheepishly. It is a domestic scene. The
	group has become a family, with all the disadvantages of
	comfortable living, including the inability to communicate.  

	Fran:	WHAT HAVE WE DONE TO OURSELVES?

625	The thunderous roar of the helicopter engine. The machine is
	hovering over the roof of the mall.

626	Fran is at the controls. Steve sits in the passenger seat.

	Steve:	OK, NOW EASY...EASY...BRING 'ER DOWN...

627	The whirlybird starts down for the roof. It is somewhat
	unstable, but it eases down regularly.

628	In the cockpit, a flustered Fran manages to handle the controls.

	Steve:	EASY...STABILISE IT...THAT'S IT...

	The woman reacts efficiently. She handles the controls better as
	The chopper's runners are just about on the roofs surface.

	Steve:	THAT'S IT...THAT'S IT...YOU GOT IT!

629	The runners hit the roof surface and the chopper settles.

630	Fran throws her arms impulsively around Stephen's neck.

	Steve:	YOU DID IT...YOU DID IT, HON...YOU DID IT...

	The woman excitedly hugs and kisses Stephen with childish joy.
	She is bubbling.

631	Seen from a great distance, the helicopter atop the mall looks
	very small. Its engine dies and begins to whine.

632	A pair of binoculars is watching the action. The lenses pull
	away from a pair of beady eyes.

	Voice:	THEY MUST GET IN THROUGH THE ROOF.

	Voice:	SON OF A BITCH!

	Voice:	THERE'S TRUCKS BLOCKIN' ALL THE ENTRANCES.

	Voice:	NO SWEAT!

	Voice:	WHAT DO YA THINK? HIT 'EM NOW OR WAIT
			FOR TONIGHT?

	Voice:	TONIGHT.

633	We see the short wave radio speaker installed in the living
	space near the TV. A voice rattles over the unit:

	Voice:	WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE...SEEN THE WHIRLYBIRD
			ON THE ROOF.

634	Fran steps to the doorway attracted by the signal. Peter sits at
	the radio, not knowing whether to send. Steve listens.

	Voice:	HEY, ER...COULD YA USE SOME COMPANY IN THERE?

	Steve is about to say something. Peter stops him.

	Voice:	WE'RE JUST RIDIN' BY...WE COULD SURE USE
			SOME SUPPLIES...WHAT'S THE CHANCE US
			GETTIN' IN THERE TO STOCK UP?

	Peter listens intently, trying to read the voice's inflections.

	Voice:	HOW MANY OF YOU IN THERE, ANYWAY...THERE'S
			THREE OF US. COULDN'T YA USE THREE MORE GUNS?

	Peter:	RAIDERS.

	Fran:	WELL, THEY KNOW WE'RE HERE, MAYBE WE SHOULD...

	Peter:	(cutting her off)
			NO CHANCE.

	The little puppy scrambles up to Fran's feet, seeking attention.
	She picks the little dog up in her arms.

	Fran:	WELL, IF THERE'S ONLY THREE OF THEM...

	Peter:	WHO SAYS?

	There's a long silence. The radio sputters static. Voices are
	heard, but they aren't speaking into the microphone. They are
	obviously conferring among themselves. Steve starts to speak,
	Peter cuts him off.

	Peter:	SHHHH! QUIET!

	He is trying to hear the muffled conversation.

	Fran:	I THINK WE SHOULD...

	Peter:	JESUS CHRIST, SHUT UP AND LISTEN!

	More static. Slight laughter is heard. Steve looks into Peter's
	face. The bug trooper just stares at the speaker without moving.
	Finally, the voice again.

	Voice:	HEY...YOU IN THE MALL...YOU JUST FUCKED UP
			REAL BAD! WE DON'T LIKE PEOPLE WHO DON'T SHARE.

	Instantly Peter grabs his weapon and straps on his holster.

	Peter:	COME ON, MAN...GET IT UP.

635	Under the cover of darkness, a pair of hands stores a microphone
	on a portable radio unit. The radio is in a small van which is
	cluttered with junk. An arsenal of weapons is strewn about.

636	We see several men, and a few women, huddling inside the van.
	They look like banditos. One even wears a Mexican sombrero. The
	men are armed to the teeth, wearing ammunition belts criss-
	crossed on their chests. They are dirty and sloppily dressed in
	all sorts of surplus clothing.

637	Outside, in close-up shots, hands turn controls on big motor-
	cycles and feet stomp accelerators. The bikes roar, creating a
	thunderous sound. Clouds of dust and fumes rise into the air.

638	Peter and Stephen are running across the mall roof. The roar of
	the cycles can be heard in the distance.

639	Reaching the roof's edge, Peter stares off at the horizon, but
	sees nothing. The thunder draws nearer. Peter tries binoculars.

640	Through the lenses are vague shapes in the darkness. As the
	sound swells, we see the riders. Their powerful bikes come
	charging over a rise...two...then three more...three more...
	more...

	They are accompanied by two small vans. There are at least
	fifteen bikes. The sound is deafening.

641	Peter:	JUST THREE, HUH?

	Steve:	HOLY SHIT!

	Peter:	THEY'LL GET IN. THEY'LL MOVE THE TRUCKS.

	Steve:	THERE'S HUNDREDS OF THOSE CREATURES DOWN THERE.

	Peter:	COME ON, MAN. THIS IS A PROFESSIONAL ARMY.
			LOOKS LIKE THEY BEEN SURVIVIN' ON THE ROAD ALL
			THROUGH THIS THING...DAMN! HOW MANY OF THE
			STORES ARE OPEN?

	Steve:	I DUNNO...SEVERAL OF 'EM...

	Peter:	WELL LET'S NOT MAKE IT EASY FOR 'EM...COME ON!

642	The men charge down through the skylight. The roar of the
	convoy can now be heard in the living space.

	Fran is desperate. Steve rushes by her with Peter, who crashes
	on ahead through the door onto the firestairs.

	Fran:	WHAT'S HAPPENING?

	Steve:	THERE'S FIFTEEN OR TWENTY OF 'EM...
			WE'RE GONNA SHUT OFF THE GATES.

	Fran:	STEPHEN!

	Steve:	WE'RE JUST GONNA SHUT THE GATES.
			THEY'LL NEVER FIND US UP HERE.

	The man disappears through the stairway door. Fran drops the
	puppy which goes running after the men floppily.

	Fran thinks to chase the dog, but instead moves to the storage
	area and snatches her weapons. She starts to load her rifle.

643	Outside, the convoy makes a pass at one of the trucks. In the
	darkness the Zombies clutch at the fast bikes. The raiders
	fire their guns, dropping several of the creatures.

	The mob of creatures is impenetrable at first. The raiders
	leader signals the convoy to drop back across the parking lot.
	Some raiders have trouble keeping balance as Zombies claw them.

644	The lead bikes pull up on the other side of the lot.

	Raider:	 THEY'LL SPREAD OUT COMIN' AFTER US...
			THEN WE GO IN WITH THE VAN...

645	The other bikes ride to the leaders. A van pulls in and two
	bikers scramble aboard through the side doors. One of the women
	jumps into the driver's seat and revs the engine.

646	The Zombies are starting to move out after the convoy. The mob
	at the mall entrance is thinning somewhat.

647	In the mall, Peter drops from the grill in the exterior corridor.
	He charges out and into the Maintenance corridor, where he
	breaks for the mall proper. He is followed by Stephen.

	Peter:	(shouting)
			DOWNSTAIRS FIRST...

	Steve:	OK...

	Peter:	GOT YOUR TALK BOX?

	Steve:	YEAH.

	Peter:	KEEP IS HANDY.

648	Outside, the Raiders' van revs and roars towards the mall. The
	bikers stay at the other side of the lot, engines idling. Some
	of them whoop and holler like American Indians.

649	The van crashes through the advancing Zombies. Several of them
	are knocked flying. The vehicle pulls up to the truck cab. Three
	men pile out and scramble into the truck. The Zombies in the
	area clutch at the raiders, but they fight their way clear. The
	woman in the van revs the engine again. Zombies claw at her
	window. She squeals back to the main biker group.

650	The Zombies in the parking lot are approaching the ranks of
	motorcycles from a good distance. The raiders open fire. They,
	too, possess sophisticated weapons, the barrage sets up a great
	noise. Several creatures fall. The little van pulls up behind
	the bikes. The men still whoop and shout.

651	On the floor on the mall, Peter and Steve dash about slamming
	roll gates down on the open stores. They run desperately through
	the empty concourses. They hear the din from outside.

652	At the trailer cab, a raider fires point blank at the Zombies
	that claw at the passenger window. Another man checks cables.

	Raider:	 SHIT...IT'S STILL TAPED UP...IT'S ALL READY
			FOR US...

	The man sits at the wheel, revving the engine. Ghouls at
	windows.

653	Inside, the men hear the truck starting. Steve slams down the
	Pharmacy gate. Peter is already running to the Department
	Store. The big Trooper crashes up the escalator to the second
	floor aisles. Steve breaks for the open Hardware Store.

654	The huge trailer rolls away from the mall entrance. A shout of
	victory goes up from the raiders. The Zombies at the door do not
	yet enter the mall, their focus on the raiders now. From other
	entrances Zombies start converging on the parking lot.

655	Across the lot, the bikers rev their engines ready to make a run
	on the building. The raiders in the truck hop from the cab. They
	run to the doors, shooting Zombies at they move. Some creatures
	fall, others claw at the runners. One raider is brought down by
	the ghouls. His friends pay no attention.

656	One gunman slams into the mall doors to find they are locked.
	He levels his machine gun on the locks and rips open the
	mechanism. The men push through the doors. The little alarm
	units are knocked flying sending out a high pitched signal.

657	Peter is just slamming down the gates on the balcony when he
	hears the alarms go off.

658	One of the raiders hears the gates rumbling. He looks up and
	sees Peter running by the railing upstairs. He fires with his
	machine gun.

659	Peter dives, sliding across the balcony. The bullets miss him
	and he crawls around the balcony just out of sight from below.

660	Steve has just slammed down the Hardware Store gate, and makes a
	dash for the Department Store.

661	The raiders spot him as well, and open fire.

662	Steve runs zip-zag and dives into the big store, where he ducks
	into the shadows leaving the gate open.

663	Peter, at the balcony railing, levels his super-gun on the
	bikers.

664	One accurate shot fires and a raider falls with a giant wound in
	his chest.

665	The last raider at the doors ducks out of Peter's sight.

666	Steve now charges the roll gate and slams it shut on the store.

667	The bikers toward the building. Zombies scatter on the lot.

668	Just as the bikers are reaching the building, the raider inside
	rushes the doors. He holds them open as the big fleet of
	rumbling cycles comes screaming into the building.

669	Steve is in awe, watching from the Department Store grid.

670	The cycles pull down the concourse and Zombies lumber in after
	them. The raider at the door is grabbed by a Zombie. Then
	another. He manages to fight away.

671	Peter, shooting above, downs the raider and one of the ghouls.

672	The main band of bikers hear the gunfire and pull down a side
	concourse to regroup. They make their turn close to the
	Department Store and Steve backs into he shadows.

673	Peter moves down the balcony as Zombies are clamouring back to
	the big concourses. Peter's eyes are wide at the invasion.

674	Upstairs, Fran hears the noises. She is at the top of the
	firestair, weapons ready. On the landing below, the puppy
	scamper and barks. Fran calls the dog, but it doesn't listen.

675	The bikes arc around and several pull up to the Dept. Store.

	Raider:	 ALRIGHT...COUPLE OF YOU HOLD OFF THEM ZOMBIES...
			CHARLIE?...HIT THE GATES...WE GOTTA GET THAT
			SNIPER.

	The leader rolls out. Others follow. Peter fires and drops a
	raider, his bikes flying into the approaching Zombies.

676	The action is too fast and furious. Neither Peter or Steve can
	see the whole layout of the concourse.

677	The lead bikers pulls out of range behind a set of columns. A
	couple of bikers dismount and start up the stationary stairs.

678	Steve talks into his walkie talkie:

	Steve:	THEY'RE COMIN' UP, PETER...THEY'RE COMIN'
			UP THE STAIRS.

679	Peter moves to another spot on the balcony.

680	Suddenly the raiders at the Dept. Store door turn a machine
	gun on the roll gate locks. One flies open...another...

681	Steve runs into the store, about to charge up the escalator when
	he realises he'll be in the line of fire. he runs to the
	elevator, hits a button, and starts for the second floor.

682	Peter fires and drops one of the charging men on the balcony.
	The other takes cover. Just as Peter is changing position, the
	lights in the building blink out...the escalators stop... the
	power has gone off.

683	Upstairs, Fran is alone in total darkness. Below, she hears the
	puppy still barking. She starts carefully down the steps.

684	In the stuck elevator, Steve gropes and fumbles for his talk box.

	Steve:	PETER...PETER...

685	The big trooper charges through the darkness to the Maintenance
	corridor, ignoring the buzzing on his talk unit.

686	The raiders on the balcony approach quickly, ducking against the
	walls occasionally for cover.

687	The other bikers spill into the Dept. Store, raiding the
	counters and raping the displays. They throw things into sacks
	while others move to different stores and shoot off roll gate
	locks. They raid the arsenal in the Sporting Goods store.

688	The main pack of bandits are holding off the Zombies. The
	creatures charge with new vigour. Some raiders fall and the
	ghouls pounce on them, ripping flesh with teeth and hands.

689	The van pulls up outside the doors and two bikers ride out to
	it, loading supplies into it. The Zombies are everywhere, but
	the actions of the professional looters befuddle them.

690	Several creatures move onto the balcony. One Zombie pounces the
	raider Peter shot and tears at his body.

691	As remaining raiders appear at the mouth of the corridor, Peter
	opens fire, killing the lead raider with a clean shot in the
	heart. The man flies back over the railing, falling to the
	concourse below where Zombies attack it. The other raider falls
	back against the wall.

692	Peter dashes into the Maintenance Room and rushes to throw the
	emergency power switch.

693	The portable emergency light units blink on all over the mall.

694	Steve, who has crawled through the escape hatch of the elevator,
	suddenly feels the car move. He grabs onto the cables but his
	hands slip from grease and his rifle falls down and wedges
	between the wall of the shaft and the moving car.

	Suddenly, the car stops again, and Steve sees through the
	escape hatch as light spills in as the main elevator doors open.
	He thinks to jump down, but hears raiders below.

695	Two of the big, greasy bandits charge into the car. They whoop
	and shout as they see the open escape hatch.

696	Steve settles back out of sight against the wall.

697	Raider:	 COME ON, MAN...LET'S GO...

	The other raider whoops loudly and fires a barrage of bullets
	into the escape hatch.

698	The shells bang and clatter in the shaft and ricochet off the
	walls and gears. A shell nicks Stephen's arm, but he is silent.

699	Finally, the barrage stops. The raiders charge back to the
	store.

700	Other bandits battle with Zombies. The men crash through
	stores, collecting weapons, ammunition, tools, clothes, food.

701	Bikers shuttle goods out to the side doors of the van. The
	woman in the front seat is ready with giant pistols. Zombies
	try to pound their way in, but they cannot succeed.

702	In the mall, another biker drops to the Zombies. They pounce
	on him and start devouring his screaming body.

703	Several creatures now wander through the Department Store,
	having entered from the second storey gate. They move through
	aisles knocking against displays. One grabs a mannequin thinking
	it human, throws the dummy aside roughly.

704	The raider on the balcony is approached by several Zombies. He
	runs down the corridor to the Maintenance office. Peter is gone.
	Breaking into the various empty offices, the raider comes to the
	fake wall panel and assumes it goes nowhere. Then he hears the
	faint barking of the dog. He checks the panel again by running
	his hand along the edge.

	Suddenly a sound in the corridor and the raider turns. There
	are three ghouls coming. He fires and knocks off the ghouls one
	at a time and runs onto the balcony.

705	Bikes roar this way and that. It is a war zone.

706	The man is about to run downstairs when he hears a noise above.
	He spins and looks up. He sees Peter just too late.

707	The big Trooper, in an open ceiling grid, aims his super-gun
	squarely at the raider's head. The gun roars and the man flies.

708	Below, the raiders are starting to regroup. The bikes begin to
	peel out of the mall entrance one at a time.

709	Another raider is snatched off his machine by the Zombies.

710	The bikers toss a last bit of booty in the van and the woman
	driver gets ready to pull out. She lowers her window and fires
	point blank at the heads of the clutching creatures.

711	The last wave of raiders is at the first floor entrance. The
	Zombies are mobbing around the bikes outside. The men shoot and
	beat their way to the cycles. One man is brought down, but three
	manage to mount their cycles. The big bikes roar out.

712	Peter is crawling through the ductwork. Just as he opens a grid,
	he sees the last bike rolling across the concourse. He levels
	off with his scope.

713	He shoots one raider out of the saddle. Two others get out.

714	Regrouping in the lot, the band of twenty is now seven or eight.

715	One last cyclist revs his engine and roars through the
	concourse. He dodges several ghouls and heads for the entrance.
	He is the leader. The one who was on the radio. He whoops
	victorious just as he is about to drive through the doors.

716	Peter leans out of the grid work and settles the cross-hairs on
	the back of the riders head. He waits as the biker roars out
	onto the lot. The rider lets out one last victorious shout in
	the fresh air. Peter's scope is locked on the riders back and
	the super-gun roars. The biker is blown off his machine.

717	The bike flies into a pack of Zombies. Some fall back, but
	others advance on the rider. The man rolls over the cement,
	stops, not dead yet. He screams wildly as they move onto him.

718	The other bikers move off in the night and the engines fade
	away.

719	The puppy stops barking. Fran is tense in the darkness clutching
	her rifle. She stands on the now silent landing.

720	In the parking lot and main concourse the Zombies move freely.
	They fight over the remains of the corpses. They eat ravenously,
	the sounds of their feast the only thing in the area.

721	Peter peers down at the slaughter below from the ductwork.
	Suddenly he hears the beeper of his talk unit, hits the button.

	Steve:	PETER!

	Peter:	WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?

	Steve:	IN THE ELEVATOR!

	Peter:	LISTEN, THOSE THINGS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE.
			CLIMB UP TOP...I'LL GET YOU OUT THE GRID ON
			THE SHAFT...I'M COMIN.

	Peter starts to crawl through the ducts.

722	Steve hits the second floor button and the car moves. He
	clamours up on the hand rail on the car. His hands reach up and
	grab the escape hatch pulling his head and shoulders out the
	opening. He kicks with his legs to force himself up when the car
	stops. He sees the grid in the shaft wall.

723	Suddenly, the car doors open on the second storey and abruptly
	several Zombies dart into the car. They claw at Steve's legs and
	pull him out of the hatch. He screams, thrashes violently.

724	In the duct, Peter hears the screams. He stops and listens for a
	moment. He backs away heading for the Maintenance corridor.

725	In the elevator, Steve thrashes with all his might. The ghouls
	try to pull him out of the car while the elevator doors open and
	close repeatedly against the creatures which block it.

	A Zombie bites Steve's arm, another bites his neck. The man
	scrambles to unholster his gun. Although he is bleeding
	profusely, he finally pulls his gun and fires...once...twice...

726	Peter is dropping out of the washroom duct. He hears the pistol
	shots and realises Steve is not dead. He thinks about climbing
	back in the grid, but stops. He punches at the wall violently.
	He is angry and confused.

727	Again the pistol roars and rips through a Zombie head, flying
	out of the elevator. The doors still slam against the last
	creature and Steve fires. The Zombie flies back and the doors
	finally close.

728	Outside, Zombies fall against the elevator doors.

729	Inside, Steve falls to the floor. His neck runs red. His eyes
	are wide with terror. He sits stupidly staring at the pistol in
	his hand. He finds it hard to breathe.

730	Peter appears at the bottom of the firestair. The puppy runs to
	meet him, tails wagging and yapping. He hangs his head as Fran
	looks down.

	Fran:	NO.....NO!

	She runs down the steps. The big Trooper catches her bodily as
	she is about to charge out into the hall.

	Peter:	I HEARD HIS GUN...MAYBE HE'S ALRIGHT...WE'LL
			WAIT...WE'LL JUST WAIT A WHILE...

731	The mall stands silent in the blue haze of impending dawn.

732	Zombies move through the building freely, walking the halls,
	lumbering through the stores.

733	Several creatures still pound and scratch the elevator doors.
	As they push each other, one creature inadvertently makes
	contact with the elevator call button.

	The doors glide open. Steve is standing, his blood dry now.
	His eyes are blank as he steps forward. The creatures step
	away seeing that he is no longer prey...he is among them now.

	The doors slam against Steve and open again. Steve lumbers into
	the store down the aisle. Other creatures drift away.

734	Upstairs, Fran is packing her sack slowly and ponderously. Her
	face is red from crying.

735	Peter stands at the stair top looking down at the landing.

736	Fran sets the sack down at the escape ladder leading to the
	roof. She deliberately goes to fill another sack.

737	On the mall balcony, Stephen's corpse walks to the Maintenance
	corridor. He looks past other wandering Zombies and sees the
	fake partition. Something in him remembers. He moves forward.

738	Fran:	IT'S ALMOST LIGHT...LET'S GO.

	Peter looks at her silently from the stairway door.

	Fran:	HE DOESN'T ANSWER THE RADIO...IT'S BEEN HOURS...

	She starts to cry again.

	Fran:	FOR GOD SAKE. YOU BETTER COME ON BECAUSE IF
			I GET TO THINKIN' ABOUT THIS, I'LL JUST GO ON
			DOWN THERE AND LET THEM...LET THEM...

	The puppy suddenly growls. It charges between Peter's feet and
	runs floppily down the steps.

739	In the hallway, Steve pounds at the fake wall. Other creatures
	notice and they all move toward the partition.

740	Upstairs, the pounding can be heard. Peter stands stoically,
	looking down into the darkness. The dog barks below.

	Fran:	WHAT IS IT?

	Peter:	IT'S STEPHEN...THEY'RE COMIN' UP!

741	With a great crunching noise the partition gives way from the
	army of creatures.

742	Peter slams the door. He speaks quietly.

	Peter:	GO ON...YOU GET OUT OF HERE.

	Fran:	PETER...

	Peter:	I SAID...GET OUT OF HERE.

	From the firestair, we hear the sudden yelping of the puppy as
	it falls victim to the creatures. The sound echoes through the
	barren spaces of the storage area.

	Fran:	OH, JESUS, PETER...PLEASE...

	Peter:	I DON'T WANT TO GO...I REALLY DON'T...
			YOU KNOW THAT? I REALLY DON'T.

743	Suddenly, the door flies open and the creatures lumber into the
	living space. Peter stares at them. He smiles slightly. The
	creatures advance, led by Stephen.

744	Fran starts to scream.

	Fran:	STEPHEN...STEPHEN...

	She makes a slight move for her lover, but Peter raises his
	super-gun and shoots the Zombie through the head.

	As Stephen falls, Fran comes up short. The act startles her into
	awareness. Peter faces her as the creatures come up behind him.

	Peter:	MOVE, WOMAN!

745	Fran grabs the sacks and climbs the ladder to the roof.

746	The creatures advance on Peter. He backs away, trying to lead
	them from the skylight. They crash through the living space,
	upsetting the carefully planned room.

747	On the roof, Fran desperately starts the helicopter engine.

748	Peter backs into the storage room, slamming the door. The
	creatures approach the door and the super-gun roars one last
	time. The Zombies push through the door and move in for their
	feast.

749	Several zombies manage to scramble up the skylight to the roof.

	Fran stares, transfixed. The blades roar up to full speed.

	The creatures advance toward the machine.

	Fran steps out onto the running board; the creatures very close
	now. She crouches, watching for a moment, then looks up at the
	spinning blades.

	She stands straight up, driving her head into the spinning
	blades.

	A headless form falls to the roof. The Zombies advance.

750	In a wide shot, silhouetted against the dawn sky, we see the
	creatures huddled under the chopper blades, feasting on their
	last victim.

	The credits crawl up.

	Just as the credits end...

	the engine of the helicopter sputters...

	and dies.

DAY
OF
THE
DEAD
(The original script)
by George A. Romero



	FADE IN:

1	EXT. THE EMPTY STREET OF A CITY - DAY

No people. A FEW CARS AND TRUCKS are parked at odd angles, abandoned. 
A TITLE FADES IN, one phrase at a time.

FIVE YEARS...
SINCE THE DEAD FIRST WALKED.

2	EXT. THE CITY - DAY

We hear THE SOUND OF A STRONG WIND. DEBRIS flutters through the 
streets. A LARGE ALLIGATOR slithers into frame, stops and looks 
around.

MONTAGE: as MORE GATORS explore the empty streets, knocking over 
GARBAGE CANS, upsetting the MANNEQUINS in A DEPARTMENT STORE WINDOW. 
A GATOR crawls out through the open doors of AN ABANDONED BANK. LOOSE 
BILLS are dragged along under the animal's tail. They flutter away on 
the WIND.

3	EXT. THE CITY - DAY

GATORS crawl over A '79 CADELLIC. A FEMALE SKELETON sits slumped over 
the steering wheel. In the back a BABY'S BONES are strapped into AN 
INFANT'S SAFETY SEAT. One of the gators THUMPS its tail maddeningly 
against the windshield. ANOTHER TITLE APPEAR:

FLORIDA - 1987

4	EXT. THE CITY - DAY

CLOSE ON A SECTION OF PAVEMENT as we hear THE SOUND OF SLUGGISH 
FOOTSTEPS approaching. A SHADOW appears at the bottom of the frame. 
It gets longer and takes on the shape of a man.

TIGHT ON THE AFTERNOON SUN, blinding us. Into the FOREGROUND lurches 
THE FIGURE which cast the shadow. Glare obscures all facial detail 
until the head jogs into position directly in front of the fiery ball 
in the sky. Then we see its hideous, dead eyes, its blue-grey colour, 
the blackened wound where a large portion of jaw has been ripped 
away. This is a ZOMBIE! A MUSIC CHORD SOUNDS and THE MAIN TITLE 
APPEARS:

DAY OF THE DEAD

5	EXT. THE CITY - DAY

HEAD CREDITS ROLL over A MONTAGE: the CITY STREETS are now populated 
by the WALKING DEAD. In every shape, size and colour they wander, 
without purpose, up and down the avenues, in and out of buildings. 
The city is theirs, they have inherited the place. Man, in his human 
form, seems to be gone.

As the CREDITS END, we CUT TO:

6	EXT. A MAIN STREET - DAY

We are looking down from a HIGH ANGLE. The corner of A TALL BUILDING 
is in the FOREGROUND. A CORPSE is dangling from A NOOSE. It's been 
dead for some time. It's mostly bone now, its blackened flesh picked 
clean by scavenger birds and harbour rats. A SIGN flaps against its 
chest cavity. Its hurriedly scrawled message reads: TAKE ME, LORD! I 
LOVE YOU!

THE ROPE BREAKS suddenly and THE CORPSE FALLS out of frame.

7	EXT. THE STREET - DAY

We're at GROUND LEVEL now...SMACK!!! THE CORPSE HITS THE PAVEMENT and 
SHATTERS as though made of potter's clay. BONES bounce over a wide 
area. THE SIGN is carried off by the WIND.

8	EXT. AN ABANDONED MARINA - DAY

THE SIGN gallops across the grass of A HARBOUR PARK towards the water 
where A FEW DERELICT BOATS sway in the WIND.

Slowly, THE SOUND OF A MOTOR FADES IN.

9	EXT. THE MARINA (CLOSER ANGLE) - DAY

A FISHING BOATS, old and sea-worn, chugs into the harbour.

10	EXT. THE MARINA (CLOSE ON THE FISHING BOAT) - DAY

There are people on board, THREE MEN AND TWO WOMEN. They look like 
guerilleros from somewhere in Latin America. They're heavily armed, 
unshaven, covered with months worth of jungle crud. They are 
obviously exhausted. They gaze up to the city. Their deep-sunken eyes 
are too war-weary to show much emotion but we can read their despair.

TONY
Another dead place. I tol' you. Let's get 
out to the islands.

MIGUEL
The radio signals were coming from this 
area.

TONY
Not from the city. In every city it's the 
same. Dead. Let's get out to the barrier 
islands. If there are survivors sending 
those signals that's where we'll find them.

MIGUEL
Plenty of time for the islands. The rest of 
our...life...on the islands...I think.

Miguel is drifting. The sight of the dead city has pushed him a few 
inches closer to the brink of insanity. He catches himself and comes 
back toward reality.

MIGUEL
We gotta see if there are others here. We 
came all this way. We're gonna check it 
out.

11	EXT. THE MARINA (AT THE DOCKS) - DAY

CLOSE ON THE OPEN GASOLINE RECEPTACLE in the hull of AN ABANDONED 
BOAT. A WOMAN'S HANDS shove a LENGTH OF HOSE down into the hole.

The woman, MARIA, puts the other end of the hose to her mouth and 
sucks the air out.

At ANOTHER DERELICT BOAT, TONY sucks on ANOTHER HOSE.

TONY
Ptoooo! Nothing! Dry as a bone. No gas. 
Let's get outa here.

MIGUEL
Check them all. And check the tanks under 
the pumps.
	
MIGUEL and the other two guerilleros, SARAH AND CHICO, start to walk 
up the dock towards the harbour park, toward the city. MIGUEL has AN 
ELECTRONIC BULLHORN in one hand, his AUTOMATIC RIFLE ready in the 
other.

12	EXT. THE HARBOUR PARK - DAY

THE TRIO of refugees move across the grass. The WIND blows DEBRIS 
around them as they stare towards the downtown buildings. MIGUEL 
lifts THE BULLHORN to his mouth.

MIGUEL
HELLO. IS THERE ANYONE THERE? HELLO. 
HELLOOOOOOO....

13 	EXT. THE CITY - DAY

MONTAGE: as THE WALKING DEAD hear that human VOICE. Throughout the 
city they turned towards THE SOUND, at once confused and excited.

MIGUEL (o.s.)
HELLOOOOOOOOOOO....

THE DEAD start to GROAN hungrily, almost pleadingly. All over the 
city their VOICES RISE.

14	EXT. THE HARBOUR PARK - DAY

It comes to MIGUEL AND THE OTHERS as A MASSIVE WALL OF NOISE, THE 
SOUND of hundreds-of-thousands of damned souls moaning on one solid 
voice. The sound of hell on earth.

15	EXT. THE MARINA (AT THE DOCKS) - DAY

TONY AND MARIA hear it as well and feel the familiar grip of cold 
fear. Maria makes the sign of the cross.

MARIA
Dios mia.

TONY
I tol' him. I tol' him this is a dead 
place. Like all the others.

CUT TO:

16	EXT. THE CITY (FROM THE WATER) - DAY

We see the place FROM A GREAT DISTANCE. In the FOREGROUND THE FISHING 
BOAT, with all five REFUGEES back on board, chugs into open waters.

CUT TO:

17	EXT.	A SMALL PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

Away from the city, this dock is wooden, rickety. DERELICT BOATS rust 
at their moorings. THE FISHING BOAT is tied-on at one end of the pier 
and THE GUERILLEROS are moving through the area, scavenging. This 
time CHICO helps MARIA with the SIPHON HOSES. TONY lingers sullenly 
near the fishing boat which has its motor still idling.

MARIA'S SIPHON HOSE is stuffed into the gas tank of A LARGE TRAWLER. 
She sucks on the hose and, unexpectedly, foul tasting liquid fills 
her mouth.

MARIA
AY! GASOLINA! GASOLINA!

Without warning, A FIGURE pops up from behind the side wall of the 
trawler. He reaches out and grabs the woman, pulling her against the 
boat, his arm around her neck, a pistol to her head.

TONY sees the action. He dives into the fishing boat, crawls over to 
his RIFLE and scrambles towards the pilot's controls.

With a lightning move, MARIA pulls A KNIFE from her belt. She 
wrenches around and PLUNGES THE BLADE INTO HER ATTACKER'S CHEST. The 
man staggers back, screaming. MARIA breaks away and runs across the 
dock. THE MAN FIRES HIS PISTOL wildly.

MARIA IS HIT IN THE ARM. She tumbles forwards onto the decking.

TONY reacts, OPENING FIRE WITH HIS AUTOMATIC.

BULLETS RIP INTO THE ATTACKERS CHEST: HE FALLS OUT OF THE TRAWLER 
onto the dock, but TWO MORE GUNMEN appear behind him, mean-looking 
desperadoes with RIFLE SPITTING LEAD.

TONY ducks as low as he can. He grabs the controls and pilots the 
fishing boat along the edge of the dock toward the downed woman.

18	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

MIGUEL, SARAH AND CHICO react to the gunfire. They draw their WEAPONS 
and look for cover.

They are at the far end of the dock, their backs to the sea. There is 
a WORK SHED nearby. BULLETS WHIZ past them as they charge towards the 
wooden structure. They make it there safely and they begin to RETURN 
FIRE. A gun battle ensues between the two groups.

19	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

MARIA, her ARM BLEEDING, rolls off the dock and into THE FISHING 
BOAT. TONY guns the engine and the boat pulls out into open water.

THE ATTACKERS try to FIRE AT THE ESCAPING BOAT but they are forced to 
duck BULLETS which RICOCHET OFF THE TRAWLER pinning them down.

20	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

MIGUEL'S RIFLE is in his right hand. His left hand clings to the 
frame of AN OPEN WINDOW on his side of the shed. There's a SUDDEN, 
STARTLING MUSIC STING and, with it, A ZOMBIE appears inside the open 
window. Grotesque and drooling dark SALIVA, its hungry mouth lunges 
at MIGUEL'S left arm. ITS TEETH TEAR A LARGE STRIP OF FLESH OUT OF 
THE ARM six inches above the wrist.

MIGUEL screams. He pulls away from the creature, his terrified eyes 
staring at the BLEEDING WOUND. A zombie bite means infection and 
almost certain death.

THE ZOMBIE leans out through the open window, its hands clawing the 
air trying to reach MIGUEL. SARAH pulls A GIANT .45 from her holster 
belt. BULLAMN! BULLAMN! BULLAMN! She FIRES three rapid shots.

THE SKULL OF THE ZOMBIE INDENTS IN FRONT like a hard-boiled egg shell 
that's been whacked with a spoon bowl. BLACKENED BLOOD AND BRAIN 
MATTER FLIES OUT OF THE BACK where the bullets exit. The creature 
falls, destroyed.

21	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

SARAH acts quickly. She lunges towards CHICO and snatches A MACHETE 
out of his belt. CHICO shows concern but he's busy RETURNING FIRE at 
THE ATTACKERS on the trawler.

SARAH
I have to stop the infection... Querrida...
	
MIGUEL looks into SARAH'S eyes. He has started to tremble. A cry of 
primal panic is gurgling up in his throat. With a sudden move, SARAH 
slams her RIFLE BUTT into the side of his head with all her might. He 
reels backwards and slams into the boathouse wall. His eyes roll but 
he stays on his feet, still conscious.

CHICO steps away from his post and stands squarely in front of 
MIGUEL. WHAP! He slugs him with a powerhouse right-cross. MIGUEL 
still stands. WHAP! He slugs him again. WHAP! Again. Finally, MIGUEL 
collapses into the man's arms and CHICO lays the limp body down on 
the deck.

BUDDABLAM! RATTATATTATATTATATT! THE ENEMY, sensing an upper hand, 
starts FIRING WITH MORE INTENSITY. CHICO steps away from MIGUEL and 
SENDS SOME LEAD BACK their way.

22	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

SARAH is crying. It's not weakness. She's crying for MIGUEL, crying 
for his pain. But she doesn't hesitate in what she has to do. She 
crouches over the BITTEN ARM and raises the MACHETE over her head.

THUCK! SHE CHOPS AT THE ELBOW JOINT with all her strength. THE BLADE 
BITES DEEP BUT DOESN'T CUT THROUGH. SHE LIFTS IT AND CHOPS AGAIN AND 
AGAIN....THUCK! THUCK! Then SHE DIGS AROUND, searching for the joint 
the way she might on a turkey drumstick. Finding the spot, SHE PUSHES 
DOWN WITH BOTH HANDS, leaning all her weight on the top edge of the 
blade. TEARS are running down her cheeks when THE BIG KNIFE 
FINALLY.... THUMMMPPP!....CUTS THROUGH TO THE DECKING.

Repulsed, angry, SARAH SWEEPS THE SEVERED FOREARM AWAY WITH THE BLADE 
the way a butcher might sweep away unwanted fat. BLOOD IS SPURTING 
OUT OF THE STUMP at an alarming rate. SARAH has to act quickly again.

While CHICO continues to RETURN FIRE at the enemy, SARAH swings 
herself up onto the sill of the open boathouse window and disappears 
inside the place.

23	INT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY

The place is dark and cluttered (oars, bait buckets, fishing gear, 
life preservers, tools, paints, varnishes). SARAH snatches up AN AXE 
HANDLE.

THE ZOMBIE that bit Miguel lies nearby with its skull laid open. Its 
hand is jogged, startingly, when SARAH grabs A BOTTLE OF PAINT 
THINNER from the floor beside the corpse.

From out of the shadows...A HAND! It grabs SARAH'S ankle. She kicks 
violently and pulls away. ANOTHER ZOMBIE is crawling across the 
floor. ONE OF ITS LEGS IS MISSING AND THE OTHER IS BADLY DAMAGED.

SARAH draws her .45 and BULLAMM! BULLAMM! SHE PUMPS TWO ROUNDS INTO 
THE CREATURE'S BRAIN.

24	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

CHICO ducks the enemy's RICOCHETING BULLETS.

CHICO
HEY ! WHAT ARE WE DOIN' THIS FOR? WE CAN 
STICK TOGETHER. WE CAN USE EACH OTHER'S 
GUNS.

At THE TRAWLER, ONE OF THE ATTACKERS shouts a response.

ATTACKER #1
You could use our guns, maybe. We can't use 
yours. Unless you can get yer boat back 
here.

CHICO
You got a boat.

ATTACKER #1
Shit, man. We can drift this tub into the 
bay...tow her around with a dinghy...but 
she ain't gonna get us nowhere. Ev'ry boat 
you see here is long dead, soldier...else 
we'd be long gone. Can you get your boat 
back here?

CHICO
I don't know where they went, man. I don't 
know. I swear.

ATTACKER #1
Then, like I said...we can't use you. We 
ain't got the food nor the patience to put 
up with you.

The man FIRES A LONG BURST from his automatic.

CHICO
YOU....YOU MOTHERFUCKERS!

He reaches around the corner of the shed with his own rifle and FIRES 
blind in return. SARAH clambers out through the shed windows having 
wrapped A LARGE PIECE OF CLOTH around the end of the AXE HANDLE.
	
She reaches into a shirt pocket and produces A WOODEN MATCH. She 
strikes the match and touches the flame to the thinner-soaked cloth. 
PHOOOOOMPH! The axe handle becomes an angrily flaming torch.

25	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

As the gun battle continues, SARAH crouches over MIGUEL. BLOOD IS 
STILL FOUNTAINING FROM THE STUMP OF HIS LEFT ARM. The woman slaps THE 
FLAMING END OF HER TORCH ONTO THE STUMP. There's A SIZZLING SOUND as 
the raw flesh there cooks.

The pain reaches MIGUEL even though his unconscious state. He starts 
to breathe heavily. His head shakes from side to side silently 
pleading "NO, NO, NO." The flames do their job. THE FLESH CRUSTS OVER 
AND THE BLEEDING STOPS.

MIGUEL'S SHIRT CATCHES. Suddenly his eyes pop open and he screams 
like the man on fire he is. He lurches away from the flame, his body 
slamming against the shed wall. SARAH flings the torch into the water 
and dives on top of the man.

SARAH
MIGUELITO. MI VIDA. MIGUEL MIO.

MIGUEL, trying to scream but needing to vomit, is doing neither. His 
body is convulsing in the woman's arms. She rubs the sparks on his 
shirt until they disappear then she caresses him, holding his head 
against hers, rocking him back and forth.

26	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

CHICO is still busy RETURNING FIRE. BULLETS WHIZ through the air 
around his head. ONE KNICKS HIM ON THE SHOULDER, a superficial but 
painful wound.

CHICO
JESUS CHRIST! GET UP HERE, WOMAN! GET THE 
HELL UP HERE!

SARAH has no choice but to help in the fight. She lays MIGUEL as 
gently as she can on his back. He's gone into deep shock, shivering 
violently. Rubbing tears away from her eyes, SARAH jumps to her feet, 
takes up a post and begins to FIRE AT THE ATTACKERS.

THE ATTACKERS are grinning like old-fashioned pirates as their GUNS 
CHEW UP THE DOCK. Suddenly, just behind THE TRAWLER, we see A FLASH 
OF COLOUR SPEEDING BY...

It's THE FISHING BOAT! The WOUNDED MARIA is steering. TONY is 
standing on the prow with his RIFLE FIRING... 
RATTATATTATATTATATTATATT!!!!

ONE OF THE ATTACKERS IS HIT FROM BEHIND. HIS BACK TURNS SOLID RED and 
HE PITCHES FORWARDS, FALLING between the boat and the dock into the 
water below.

THE OTHER ATTACKER (#1) turns and FIRES IN RESPONSE. TONY IS HIT IN 
THE STOMACH. He falls to his knees and grabs the side of the boat but 
he KEEPS FIRING.

THE ATTACKER pivots against a mast. For a moment he doesn't realise 
that HIS NECK HAS BEEN RIPPED OPEN BY A LINE OF BULLETS. He tries to 
scream. Can't. A PLUME OF RED SHOOT OUT OF HIS MOUTH. Then he 
realises. He realises that he's a dead man. He falls.

MARIA
TONY....TONY....

TONY
PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.

TONY is clutching at his BLEEDING BELLY as MARIA, in pain from her 
own wound, circles the boat towards the edge of the dock.

27	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

Behind the boathouse, SARAH slings her rifle onto her shoulder and 
she leans over MIGUEL who is now catatonic.

SARAH
Help me get him to the boat.

CHICO
Leave him.

SARAH calmly raises her .45 and aims it directly at CHICO's head.

SARAH
Help me or die.

Reluctantly the man moves towards MIGUEL and the two survivors drag 
his limp body over the decking.

DISSOLVE TO:

28	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - SUNSET

The fishing boat is gone. Orange light from the western horizon 
paints the scene. FIGURES are moving about on the dock, slumped, 
lumbering figures....ZOMBIES.

They're clustering around THE TRAWLER, around THE CORPSES OF THE 
ATTACKERS.

THEY BEGIN PULLING THOSE CORPSES APART AND EATING THEM HUNGRILY.

ONE CREATURE has found MIGUEL'S SEVERED FOREARM. IT PULLS A BIG CHUNK 
OFF THE THING WITH ITS TEETH. It chews for a time, ITS DROOL TURNING 
RED. Then it spits out MIGUEL'S WRISTWATCH as though it was a 
bothersome bit of bone.

29	EXT. THE FISHING BOAT (IN DEEP WATER) - SUNSET

THE TWO WOMEN hover over their wounded, TONY AND MIGUEL. CHICO steers 
the boat. Suddenly, TONY arches his back and screams in pain.

TONY
Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily 
sorry...for having offended 
Thee....offended Thee...

MARIA
Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.

TONY
I detest all my sins...because... because 
of Thy just punishment... because of 
Thy...just...punish...

A coughing fit interrupts his Act of Contrition. From across the open 
cabin, from within SARAH'S arms, MIGUEL stares. His eyes have the 
glaze of a madman's eyes. Despite that, and despite the physical 
trauma he has endured, he seems remarkably in command.

MIGUEL
He is dying. I will end his pain.

MIGUEL draws his PISTOL.

MARIA
NOOOOOOOOO!

TONY
...but most of all because...they offend 
Thee, my God...Who art all good...and 
deserving...deserving of all my love...

MIGUEL
He is dying. He knows it.

MARIA
You are dying, too.

MIGUEL
No. The disease was cut away from me. I 
will live. I will live.

TONY
I firmly resolve...with the... with the 
help...the help of...of Thy grace...

TONY collapses. A long, gurgling breath of surrender spills out of 
him and BLOOD TRICKLES FROM HIS LIFELESS MOUTH.

MARIA
Tony...TONY!

The woman folds TONY'S corpse into her arms as though trying to give 
it life from her own wounded body. For a long moment there is only 
the CHUG-CHUG-CHUG of the tired engine. Then the woman, sensing 
something, turns back towards MIGUEL. His pistol is raised, aimed at 
TONY'S head.

MARIA
NO! YOU CAN'T!

SARAH
It must be done. You know this. It must by 
done to keep him from...

MARIA
It won't happen to him! It won't happen to 
him! You heard his prayer. His prayer will 
save him. He could never become one 
of...one of those... devils.

MIGUEL
Prayers have no power to save. The knife 
can save. It can cut the disease away. The 
bullet. It can shatter the brain where the 
evil takes seed. These are saviours...our 
new saviours...our only saviours.

MARIA
We must wait. One day the curse will pass. 
One day a dead man will... will...

MIGUEL
One day a dead man will refuse to return, 
and that man will be a saint. The first 
saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. 
A catechism. Something the priests tell us 
to believe.

MARIA
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you 
if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do 
it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to 
be done.

MIGUEL
No. You won't be able to do it. He will 
rise. He will rise and you... you will die.

That madman's glaze is wet in MIGUEL'S eyes again. A grin curls his 
mouth into an odd shape. He freezes, staring, waiting. SARAH shows 
concern.

30	EXT. DEEP WATER (WITH THE FISHING BOAT) - NIGHT

A CRESCENT MOON lies on its back. Below, on the pitch black water, 
its reflection, a vertical stripe, breaks open as THE BOAT passes 
through it...CHUG-CHUG-CHUG.

31	EXT. THE FISHING BOAT (IN DEEP WATER) - NIGHT

CHICO has fallen asleep at the tiller. SARAH is asleep as well, and 
so is MARIA.

A SILENT SHADOW moves over the side rail. HANDS reach out and grip 
MARIA'S shoulders, lifting her up, up from sleep. Her eyes flutter 
open.

TONY'S face is blue-grey in the moonlight. It takes the woman a 
second or two to recognise that HE IS ONE OF THE LIVING DEAD. His 
hungry mouth lunges towards her neck. His DROOLING TEETH SINK DEEP. 
The woman screams.

SARAH wakes with a start. MIGUEL is already awake. He's been watching 
all along. Now he watches still, his PISTOL idle in his one good 
hand, his mouth curled in that strange grin, as MARIA'S screams 
shatter the quiet night.

At the tiller, CHICO sees what's happening. He fumbles for the 
AUTOMATIC RIFLE that's strapped over his shoulder.

A PORK-CHOP-SIZE CHUNK COMES OUT OF MARIA'S NECK IN THE CLENCHED 
TEETH OF THE TONY-CREATURE. BLOOD SQUIRTS UPWARD IN A FIVE-FOOT ARC.

SARAH lifts her RIFLE from her lap. She is the first to FIRE. An 
instant later, CHICO FIRES as well.

THE HEAD ON THE TONY-CREATURE IS HIT BY RAPID-FIRE LOADS from each 
gun and IT COME APART ABOVE THE EYES. Its body staggers stiffly into 
MARIA. She tries to stand, tries to pull away, screams still bubbling 
in her torn throat. She topples backward over the side rail. The 
corpse, taller and heavier, flips rigidly over, its feet kicking 
skyward, and splashes in to the deep, black Gulf. 

MARIA, the small of her back balanced precariously on the side rail, 
grabs at the air trying to swing her weight back on board. SARAH 
springs forward. She reaches the other woman a second too late. Their 
hands brush but don't catch. MARIA slips over the side. A LOUD SPLASH 
CUTS OFF HER SCREAMS.

CHICO brings the boat about in as tight a circle as possible. He and 
SARAH stare out over the water. The blackness out there is absolute. 
Visibility zero.

Silence....but for the CHUG-CHUG-CHUG of the boat's engine.

MIGUEL slowly raises his hand and aims his PISTOL at a LARGE, TURTLE-
SHAPED SPLOTCH OF BLOOD on the hull across the cabin, the spot where 
TONY died. With that odd grin still on his lips, HE BEGINS TO FIRE 
one shot at a time in deliberate, slow rhythm.

THE BULLETS PUNCH HOLES through the wooden side-wall, most of them 
hitting squarely in the blood stain.

SARAH looks over toward CHICO who returns her look with frightened 
eyes.

32	EXT. GASPARILLA'S ISLAND (EST.) - DAY

It looks like a tropical paradise. Greatly separated from the other 
smaller islands on the horizon, its vegetation is dense and lush. 
There's no sign that civilisation ever invaded the place, no power 
lines, no buildings. What meets the eye is all natural and inviting.

THE FISHING BOAT chugs into a tidewater basin on the afternoon side 
of the island.

33	EXT. THE FISHING BOAT (IN THE BASIN) - DAY

CHICO
It looks uninhabited. What do you think?

MIGUEL
I think we should burn the church. Kill the 
priest and burn the church. It's the only 
way. The only way.

MIGUEL is sweating profusely yet shivering as though cold. FLIES ARE 
BUZZING in a cluster around his WRAPPED STUMP. He's over the edge 
now, insane. And worse than that, the infection from the original 
bite is spreading. The amputation was not done quickly enough to 
prevent the parasites from racing through his veins to the brain and 
elsewhere.

SARAH turns towards the madman once her lover. Her heart is too 
callused for emotion to reach it. She just stares, her eyes dead cold 
like the eyes of a shark.

CHICO
I'm pullin' in.

34	EXT. THE ISLAND (WITH THE FISHING BOAT) - DAY

THE BOAT noses into a swamp water backwash. Tall reeds and cypress 
moss camouflage it completely. It's at though the boat is sailing 
right onto dry land.

SHOCK CUT TO:

35	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE INLET - DAY

THWOCK! CLOSE ON A MACHETE. The blade chops into the top of a 
coconut.

CHICO drinks the milk. SARAH sits on a nearby rock, her RIFLE AND A 
BACK-PACK full of supplies strapped over her shoulders.

MIGUEL, his madman's eyes wide with excitement, is trotting urgently 
from spot to spot where a spectacular specie of sub-tropical plant 
grows. There are hundreds of them, six-feet tall and flowering. Their 
red-gold blossoms are shaped like trumpets hanging with their bells 
down.

MIGUEL
DATURA!!! DATURA!!! MIRA. DATURA!!!

CHICO
What's he saying?
	
SARAH shrugs, not knowing. CHICO looks down at her, empathising.

CHICO
His madness....could be from shock.

SARAH
No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I 
know.
(She speaks softly, matter-of-factly)
Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like 
Maria. I'll shoot him.

MIGUEL
DATURA!!! DATURA!!! DATURA METEL!!!

36	EXT. THE INLAND JUNGLE - DAY

THE GUERILLEROS hack their way through thick undergrowth with 
MACHETES. MIGUEL is ineffectual. He lags behind the others who are 
doing trailblazing. THE SOUNDS OF WILDLIFE, excited by the intruders, 
fill the close, humid air, sometimes beautiful, sometimes grotesque, 
sometimes startling.

37	EXT. A SWAMPY AREA - DAY

ALLIGATORS lurk and SNAKES slither among the reeds. A FOURTEEN FOOT 
GATOR opens its jaws wide making a SOUND LIKE ESCAPING STEAM. CHICO 
draws his PISTOL but SARAH reaches out to grab his hand.

SARAH
No. No shooting. Not until we're sure we're 
alone on this island.

MIGUEL
No. No, thank you. No ice. Straight up, 
please. No ice. Thank you.

MIGUEL'S eyes roll up into his head. His knees buckle. SARAH grabs 
him under the arms barely keeping from falling face first into the 
muddy swamp water. CHICO comes to help.

38	EXT. THE SWAMP - DAY

THE TWO drag MIGUEL to the edge of dry land. They flop him onto his 
back and SARAH puts her canteen to his lips.

MIGUEL
NO ICE, I SAID!!! NOOOOO ICE!!!

He slams his good hand against the canteen, knocking it away. It 
plops into the marsh water, its contents lost.

MIGUEL
Burn the church. Kill the priest and burn 
the church. Burn....

His mouth keeps on shaping words but no sound comes out. He squirms 
for a moment, then he seems to fall asleep.

CHICO looks down at him. Unable to help, he moves off towards solid 
ground and disappears in the thick brush. After a time, SARAH follows 
after him.

39	EXT. THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

CHICO is at the edge of a clearing when SARAH reaches him. His eyes 
are wide, frightened by what they see.

In the ground before them there's AN ENORMOUS IRON PLATE, fifty feet 
by ten, all painted in brown and green camouflage patterns.

SARAH
What is it?

CHICO
I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I 
dunno.

Suddenly there's A GREAT RUMBLING, like the giant gears and pistons 
of a drawbridge being activated. The iron plate shudders and starts 
to move, downward, into the earth. SARAH AND CHICO duck into the 
nearby jungle.

40	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

They take cover in a thicket, both their GUNS up and ready. OTHER 
SOUNDS can be heard now, clunking sounds of metal on metal, and a few 
heavy thuds. There are also VOICES on the wind but their words are 
indistinguishable.

CHICO
It's some kind of....elevator. There must 
be something under the ground 
here....maybe....military.

SARAH
Look.

41	EXT. THE CAVE ENTRANCE (THEIR P.O.V.) - DAY

SEVERAL FIGURES are rising up in to view, a dozen, maybe fifteen. 
Details are obscured by FOREGROUND FOLIAGE but we can read helmets, 
heavy armaments, packs, utility belts. The impression is of a ghostly 
cadre of soldiers rising from hell.

SARAH (o.s.)
Jesus Christ!

CHICO (o.s.)
It is military. I don't believe it.

42	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

CHICO
What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or 
what?

SARAH
Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better 
look.

She moves to another spot a few feet away. CHICO follows.

43	EXT. THE CAVE ENTRANCE (THEIR P.O.V.) - DAY

THE PLATOON OF SOLDIERS, still obscured by foliage, moves off into 
the jungle carrying A COLLECTION OF PARAPHERNALIA.

There are THREE SOLDIERS who do not move off with the others. They 
are standing still with their shoulders slumped, their heads lolling 
listlessly from side to side. They have the body attributes of 
prisoners yet there's something menacing about them. We HEAR A SERIES 
OF ELECTRONIC BEEPS, something like computer beeps, and, as though in 
response to that signal, the three slumped figures start to walk. 
They move slowly, stiffly, their feet shuffling, their arms dangling 
lifelessly at their sides.

SARAH (o.s.)
Oh....oh, my God.

44	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

SARAH'S eyes are wide in their sockets with disbelief, revulsion, 
horror. Beside her CHICO, also astonished, makes the sign of the 
cross.

SARAH
OH, MY GOD!!!

45	EXT. THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

As we CUT IN CLOSER we see that the three slumped figures are 
ZOMBIES. They are wearing khakis and they are armed with RIFLES AND 
PISTOL BELTS. Their HELMETS have been painted an identifying bright 
RED and they wear slipover vests dyed the same bright colour.

All the others in the platoon are humans. They, too, wear vests but 
theirs are not red but WHITE, WITH LARGE ORANGE CIRCLES emblazoned 
front and back. Two of the men wield LONG ELECTRIC CATTLE PRODS for 
use should the ZOMBIES misbehave, but the creatures, amazingly, are 
shambling along with the rest of the platoon voluntarily, co-
operatively, even somewhat excitedly....the kind of excitement seen 
in a puppy that's just learned a new trick.

46	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

CHICO
It can't be. Are we truly in hell?

SARAH
Come on.

Stealthily the woman moves along the edge of the thicket, crouching 
all the while. CHICO hesitantly follows.

47	EXT. A CLEARING - DAY

The mysterious PLATOON begins "setting up" their equipment, which 
includes TRIPOD MACHINE GUNS. TWO MEN don BLACK RUBBER GLOVES AND 
LONG BLACK LABORATORY APRONS. They strap LARGE REFRIGERATED CARTONS 
around their necks and open the sealed lids. VAPOUR mushrooms out 
like dry-ice vapour out of Good Humour wagons on a hot day.

48	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

SARAH AND CHICO watch. Suddenly THE HUGE, FULL-THROATED SOUND OF A 
SIREN startles them. They look around, up into the trees. SARAH spots 
something and points.

CLOSE ON A SIREN HORN, high in the cypresses, its wires running down 
to the brush and disappearing under ground.

49	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

First ONE comes....then TWO MORE....THREE MORE. ZOMBIES are shuffling 
out of the jungle and converging on the platoon.

They seem to come from everywhere. Soon there are twenty or more. 
Most are tattered and ragged but others wear vests, the same type as 
worn by the platoon. These are solid colours, some white, some blue. 
None are red and none have orange circles.

As THE ZOMBIES push in closer they seem to get agitated. They start 
growling and reaching out. THE MEN WITH THE CATTLE PRODS poke at the 
more unruly creatures and ZAPPING SOUNDS can be heard.

The creatures form a kind of ragged queue, lining up in front of the 
"Good Humour" men. From inside their freezer cartons those men 
produce GREAT BLOODY CHUNKS OF RAW MEAT. THE ZOMBIES docilely take 
the hand-outs and go lurching out of the queue, some starting to eat 
immediately, others retreating into the cool of the jungle to enjoy a 
more private supper.

50	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

SARAH
What is that? Could that be....?

Behind her, CHICO gets the dry heaves. He slams his hand into his 
mouth to keep from making noise.

SARAH
No. They must have gotten them to 
accept....other things. They wouldn't be 
feeding them with....they wouldn't...

51	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

The man in command of the platoon is obvious, strutting around while 
others do the dirty work. This is CAPTAIN RHODES. He's 
conscienceless, the low of the low, and a weasely-looking guy, to 
boot. He watches the operation almost hoping for trouble. (He loves 
to torture disobedient zombies.)

Behind him, their AUTOMATICS ready, are SEVERAL TROOPERS especially 
assigned to protect the captain. One of these troopers is TOBY TYLER, 
a good guy. TOBY is revulsed by the scene in the clearing. He drops 
his head, almost gagging. RHODES notices.

RHODES
You'll get used to this, Tyler. It's the 
only way. They don't bite the hand that 
feeds.
	
TOBY looks up. He can't conceal his contempt for the captain. RHODES 
reads it in his eyes and is about to say something when a SOUND 
distracts him.

ONE OF THE RAG-TAG ZOMBIES is running amok. THE ZAPPERS poke at the 
creature but that just makes it angrier.

RHODES
GET THAT THING AWAY FROM THE OTHERS!
BRING IT HERE!

ONE TROOPER has A LONG POLE WITH A WIRE NOOSE ON THE END. He drops 
the noose over the wild zombie's head and the wire tightens, biting 
into the dead flesh on the thing's neck. The pole is long enough to 
control the creature while keeping it out of reach.

52	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

SARAH watches, repulsed but fascinated. CHICO is still fighting the 
heaves. Without warning, A ZOMBIE looms up directly behind CHICO. The 
man jumps forward, terrified. He crashes into SARAH who spins and 
sees the danger.

TWO MORE ZOMBIES appear. Then A THIRD. These have no vests. They're 
rag-tag, bad ass and hungry as hell. ONE OF THEM grabs SARAH. She 
manages to pull away but behind her CHICO panics. He raises his RIFLE 
and...RATTATATTATATT!

53	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

RHODES hears the GUNFIRE. He seems pleased. He grins.

RHODES
We have visitors. Let's go men.

He moves slowly towards the thicket followed by TOBY TYLER AND 
SEVERAL OTHER SOLDIERS. He reaches down to his belt and pushes one of 
THREE BUTTONS on A UNIT that resembles a pager. ELECTRONIC BEEPS, 
like the ones we heard earlier, come from the unit, this time in a 
different pattern.

THE RED COAT ZOMBIES respond quickly. They draw their PISTOLS and go 
marching off after their leader, grunting and snorting like bull 
apes. RHODES' grin breaks into a wide-open laugh.

RHODES
Hah! If only the rest of you ladies would 
obey orders the way they do.

54	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

Their cover blown, SARAH now raises her RIFLE. BUDDABUDDA!!!

THE SECOND ZOMBIE'S HEAD TURNS TO RED PULP and the thing pitches 
forward, dead.

CHICO FIRES and THE THIRD ZOMBIE IS DESTROYED.

Suddenly there is DISTANT FIRE, from the clearing. BULLETS WHIZ 
through the brush. The guerilleros duck for cover.

55	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

THE RED COAT ZOMBIES, shuffling forward abreast in a line, have 
OPENED FIRE. It's a grisly parody of foot-soldiering. The creatures 
are unsteady on their feet, their hands shake when they squeeze the 
stiff Army-issue triggers. BULLETS FLY this way and that, most of 
them grossly off target.

RHODES
THAT'S IT, YOU WORM-EATEN SLIME ! YOU FOUL-
SMELLING, PUSS-FACED MAGGOTS! I TOLD YOU 
I'D FIND YOU REAL ACTION, DIDN'T I? YOU 
CORRUPTION! YOU FILTH! YOU'RE LEARNING! 
YOU'RE GETTING BETTER....GETTING 
BETTER...GETTING BETTER, YOU SCUM!

The trooper beside TOBY is another young man whose nickname is 
TRICKS. He and TOBY exchange glances as they trudge along behind the 
captain and his zombie red coats. Their eyes tell us that they both 
think Rhodes to be insane, which of course he is.

56	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

SARAH moves to retreat but CHICO lifts his rifle and FIRES wildly 
into the clearing.

CHICO
NO! NOOOOO! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

57	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

TWO OF THE RED COATS ARE HIT, but not in the head. Their brains keep 
functioning and they march on.
	
RHODES
SPREAD OUT, MEN! OPEN FIRE!

Whatever else he is, RHODES seems fearless. He stands in the open as 
his human soldiers fan out. He notices that the RED COATS are out of 
ammunition. He pushes another button on his belt unit and MORE BEEPS 
SOUND. THE RED COATS stop in their tracks. They dump the SPENT SHELLS 
from their weapons and reload using fresh rounds from their belts. 
Their fingers are stiff. Three bullets fall to the ground for every 
one that finds its way into a gun chamber.

The SOLDIERS HAVE OPENED FIRE NOW. They are closing in on the 
thicket.

58	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

CHICO IS HIT high on the right side of his chest. SARAH FIRES A QUICK 
BURST out into the clearing as she tries to pull the man deeper into 
the jungle.

Suddenly, from right behind SARAH's back, comes A BLOOD CURDLING 
SCREAM. A DARK FIGURE LOOMS UP startling us all.

MIGUEL
BURN THE CHURCH! KILL THE PRIEST!

It's MIGUEL, sweating, his eyes sunken into deep black sockets. He is 
charging toward the clearing with his AUTOMATIC BLAZING in his one 
good hand. He thunders right past SARAH almost knocking her down.

59	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

MIGUEL breaks out of the thicket into clear view of the SOLDIERS. 
RHODES sees the one-armed wild man and his grin dissipated slightly. 
He draws his own PISTOL, an enormous Magnum, an elephant stopper.

SOLDIERS, taken by surprise, scatter, TOBY AND TRICKS among them. 
MIGUEL'S BULLETS DRAW A LINE ACROSS ONE SOLDIER'S CHEST. He dies 
instantly.

MIGUEL
KILL THE PRIEST! BURN THE CHURCH!
BURN! BURN! BURN! BURN! BURN!

NOW MIGUEL IS HIT but he keeps coming, his GUN SPITTING.

ANOTHER SOLDIER goes down, HIT IN THE MID SECTION.

THE PLATOON RETURNS FIRE.

MIGUEL IS HIT SQUARELY IN THE CHEST. He falls to his knees. His RIFLE 
FIRES A LINE OF BULLETS INTO THE EARTH and the kicking of the gun 
knocks him back on his ass. He sits there bewildered for a moment, 
then he looks up to find himself directly facing CAPTAIN RHODES.

RHODES lifts his MAGNUM but MIGUEL is faster with his RIFLE. In the 
next instant the muzzle is aiming straight for the captain's stomach. 
RHODES' smile disappears, re-placed by a sudden flush of fear. He 
freezes.

MIGUEL
Kill the priest.

MIGUEL squeezes the trigger and his weapon CLICKS sharply. It's 
empty.

The captain's smile slowly returns. He pushes the "Attack" button on 
his belt unit.

THE RED COATS advance, their PISTOLS reloaded. THEY FIRE, stiff-armed 
and fumble-fingered, at MIGUEL. He sees them moving towards him. 
Something in his mind clicks and he recognises the creatures for what 
they are...walking dead.

THE FIRST FEW BULLETS MISS. Then ONE HITS HIM IN HIS STUMP and 
reality gets even clearer. He starts to scream.

THE READ COATS walk closer, their dead eyes showing enjoyment of the 
sport. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!

ANOTHER ROUND HITS MIGUEL IN THE STOMACH. ANOTHER CREASES HIS HEAD. 
He tries to stand up but he's too weak. A BULLET IN THE NECK stops 
his screaming. Then HE'S HIT IN THE HEART. A BALL OF BLOOD PROJECTS 
OUT OF HIS MOUTH and he plops onto his back, dead.

THE READ COATS KEEP FIRING until their guns are empty again. RHODES 
calmly pushes the "Reload" signal and the creatures obey.

MIGUEL'S CORPSE twitches for a short time, then goes rigid.

60	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

SARAH sinks against a cypress when she sees MIGUEL die.

CHICO, in a state of blind panic, takes off along the edge of the 
thicket, his WOUND BLEEDING PROFUSELY.

61	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

CHICO breaks through some brush to find himself face-to-face with 
TOBY TYLER'S GROUP OF SOLDIERS. He stops, reverses course, and ducks 
into a cluster of palms. ONE OF THE SOLDIERS FIRES. 
RATTATATTATATTATATT!!!

BULLETS RIP THE PALM FRONDS APART. There's a scream and CHICO 
somersaults out into view. NEW WOUNDS BLEEDING ACROSS THE CENTER OF 
HIS CHEST.

62	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

SARAH realises that this is her last chance to escape. She takes 
advantage of the confusion and the NOISE and bolts into the jungle at 
a full run.

63	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

CHICO is still alive. He fumbles for his HOLSTERED PISTOL but before 
he can draw it THREE TROOPERS are on top of him. TRICKS tromps a boot 
on his hand. TOBY TYLER aims his RIFLE squarely at his sweating brow.

CHICO
Yes...yes, do it...please...you can't let 
me die this way...please. Destroy me. A 
bullet...in the head...I don't want to 
become...one of...one of them.

TOBY looks down at the man, at his TERRIBLE WOUNDS, clearly fatal 
ones. TOBY clicks a shell into the firing chamber of his RIFLE. His 
finger is just sliding under the trigger shield when CAPTAIN RHODES 
strides up behind him.

RHODES
Take his weapon, Tyler.

TOBY is startled by the voice at his back. He turns towards the 
captain, then he looks back down at the guerillero, hesitating..

RHODES
Take his gun, ass hole. He still has the 
strength to pull a trigger.

Reluctantly TOBY obeys, reaches down for CHICO'S PISTOL.

CHICO
Please...senor...destroy me...one 
bullet...please.
	
RHODES
Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. 
Then....maybe...I can help you out. String 
him up.

THE THIRD SOLDIER reaches down and grabs the wounded guerillero under 
the arms. TRICKS stoops to help. CHICO screams in agony when he is 
moved. TOBY lunges in to help the others, thinking to ease the man's 
pain.

RHODES
They can handle it, Tyler. You've been 
buckin' for a shit detail lately so here's 
one you're gonna love. We've got two dead. 
Cut the heads off and get the bodies 
underground to the refrigerators. Fast. 
It's a hot day.

TOBY grimaces but doesn't speak. He turns and moves briskly towards 
the clearing. RHODES watches him go.

64	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

TOBY nears the spot where MIGUEL lies sprawled in A POOL OF BLOOD. 
RHODES calls from the edge of the thicket.

RHODES
Tyler. Just our men. Not him.

TOBY looks down at the remains of the one-armed guerillero.

RHODES
His head stays where it is. He and I never 
really had the chance to get acquainted. 
When he comes back...I'll get another shot 
at it... Ha ha ha ha...

65	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

CLOSE ON CHICO. He's dangling from A ROPE which is tied over a tall 
tree, his feet ten feet off the ground.

ZOMBIES wander here and there. They've all received their rations. 
The picnic is breaking up now. Occasionally one of them gets surly 
but it doesn't amount to anything. SOLDIERS stand ready with ELECTRIC 
PRODS, OTHERS with GUNS.

PARAPHERNALIA is being packed away. MEN CARRY EQUIPMENT in the 
direction of the elevator.

RHODES walks up beneath where CHICO is hanging. He's careful not to 
step in too close. He doesn't want to get any DRIPPING BLOOD on his 
uniform.

CHICO
Please....shoot me.

RHODES
And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back 
after your death. You'll come back and find 
yourself hanging there...wanting to 
eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate 
that thought, don't you? That's the 
ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't 
it?

CHICO is weeping now. With a found spurt of energy he struggles 
against the rope. No use. It only brings pain.

RHODES
After hanging up there a few days you will 
be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for 
it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM!

CHICO
NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! 
SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!

RHODES
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are 
on the island?

CHICO
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
(He nods towards MIGUEL'S CORPSE.)

RHODES
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your 
headquarters? On the mainland?

CHICO
The mainland...is dead...a dead 
place...nobody there...

RHODES
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me 
or I'll let you hang there 
forever...FOREVER!

CHICO
There are no...headquarters. There are 
no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't 
you see. They have won.

RHODES
Then why did you come here?

CHICO
To look...look for a place...a place to 
live in...an empty place...a... 
new...place...

RHODES
How did you know we were on this island? Do 
others know? Will others come?

CHICO
Nooooo. Believe me. There are no 
others...no rebels...nobody...it's 
over...it's ooooo....

The man collapses, unconscious.

66	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

CLOSE ON THE DISEMBODIED HEAD OF ONE OF THE DEAD SOLDIERS. TRICKS is 
dropping the thing into A LARGE PLASTIC BAG which obviously already 
contains THE SECOND HEAD. TOBY wraps the mouth of the bag and begins 
to walk off. RHODES stops him.

RHODES
Where are you going, Tyler?

TOBY
My..."detail", sir. We're going to bury the 
heads.

RHODES
No time for that. I'll take care of them.

TOBY
Just....following procedure, sir. They're 
entitled to burial.

RHODES
I said, I'll take care of them. Just leave 
them there. Go help with the rest of the 
gear.

RHODES has it in for TOBY (we'll find out why later), and of course 
the feeling is mutual. TOBY sets the bag down on the ground and, 
seething, he trots off towards the rest of the platoon. TRICKS 
follows.

After a moment, RHODES motions with his head. THE SOLDIER WITH THE 
LONG NOOSE POLE steps into view with the CAPTIVE ZOMBIE, the one that 
ran amok earlier. The man follows RHODES towards the jungle, dragging 
the gurgling creature along, the wire noose digging into the thing's 
neck.

67	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

CLOSE: as RHODES' GLOVED HAND jams A HAND GRENADE into THE CAPTIVE 
ZOMBIE'S gaping mouth. THE SOLDIER WITH THE POLE releases the noose 
and the two men take off, running.

68	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

They run to the middle of the clearing where they turn around to 
watch. RHODES lifts A PAIR OF BINOCULARS that are strapped around his 
neck. He stares through the lenses, focusing, grinning.

69	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

THROUGH THE BINOCULARS: We see THE ZOMBIE staggering in the bush, 
clawing desperately at the thing jammed in its mouth.

70	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

TOBY AND TRICKS are the only ones who seem to notice what RHODES has 
done. TOBY drops THE CRATE he was going to carry off. He stares in 
disbelief, hatred on his face.

71	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

WIDE SHOT as THE HEAD OF THE ZOMBIE DISINTEGRATES WHEN THE GRENADE 
EXPLODES.

72	EXT.	THE CLEARING - DAY

RHODES grins as he watches the spectacle.

Suddenly, A LOUD GUNSHOT startles the captain. He drops the 
binoculars and spins around. He sees...

...CHICO'S BODY DANGLING ON THE ROPE. CHICO'S HEAD IS BLOODY. He's 
dead...and won't come back to life. He's been shot through the brain.

RHODES
WHO FIRED THAT SHOT? WHO FIRED THAT SHOT?

SOLDIERS stand around dumbly. Those with RIFLES in their hands 
quickly sling them onto their shoulders. They're all afraid of the 
captain's wrath. RHODES walks towards the line of men with fury in 
his eyes.

RHODES
Goddammit, somebody's gonna tell me who 
fired that shot or I'll have every last one 
of you chopped up for feed!!!

His eyes spot TOBY, standing behind the crate he dropped earlier, his 
rifle slung.

RHODES
Step up here, Tyler.

TOBY
Sir!

TOBY shouts the word like a West Point cadet and he bravely steps 
forward. RHODES stares him down, his anger turning sinister.

RHODES
You fired that shot, didn't you?

TOBY
No, sir.

RHODES
Let me see your weapon.

TOBY hands over his rifle. RHODES feels the barrel, sniffs it.

RHODES
It's been fired.

TOBY
In the battle, sir.

RHODES is sure he's found the guilty man and he's glad it turned out 
to be his favourite whipping boy. His body relaxes visibly.

RHODES
It may be that none of these chicken-shits 
will talk while the whole troop is 
present...but I know some of these men 
well. I'm sure that a few private 
conversations will tell me what I already 
know. You may have earned yourself some 
time in the Stalag, Tyler.
(Rhodes glances over at CHICO'S body)
Cut him down. That's another head for you 
to chop off. Leave it with the others. Take 
the rest of his body down to the freezers. 
Move it, shit hill.

TOBY moves off. RHODES' grin returns.

CUT TO:

73	INT. THE CAVE ENTRANCE - EVENING

There's that GIANT SOUND again, the RUMBLE OF THE ELEVATOR. We're 
inside the place called THE CAVE, in a huge under-ground concrete 
bunker. TECHNICIANS AND ARMED GUARDS bustle around. Enormous 
hydraulic pistons are bringing the camouflaged iron plate down from 
the surface. Riding on board, RHODES AND HIS PLATOON prepare to 
unload their paraphernalia.

74	EXT. THE JUNGLE - EVENING

SARAH, sweating, exhausted, BLEEDING FROM CUTS made by jungle 
branches, wrings out a piece of cloth torn from her sleeve. She has 
dipped it into a jungle stream. Cautiously she tastes the water, 
decides to chance it and squeezes the cloth into her mouth.

The NIGHT BIRDS suddenly stop their singing and the quiet makes SARAH 
look up. Standing across the stream, only ten feet away, is A 
PARTICULARLY GROTESQUE ZOMBIE. VULTURES stand on the marshy ground 
beside the creature's legs, THEIR SHARP BEAKS PICKING BLOODY HOLES IN 
ITS ANKLES AND FEET.

SARAH jumps to her feet, fighting back exhaustion one more time. She 
unslings her RIFLE, aims it, then thinks better of firing. Grabbing 
up her SUPPLY PACK she runs into the darkening jungle.

75	EXT.	THE JUNGLE - EVENING

WHAM! TWO BIG HANDS GRAB SARAH by her shoulders. She starts to scream 
but one of those hands shoots up to cover her mouth.

JOHN
It's alright. It's alright. Don't be 
afraid. We're friends.

SARAH looks into the strong, good face of JOHN, a tall muscular man, 
a Caribbean Islander with shiny black skin and enormous brown eyes 
that seem instantly trustworthy.

JOHN
There are soldiers near here. Guards. I'll 
take my hand away if you won't scream.

SARAH nods and JOHN lets her go. There are two other humans standing 
behind the big man. There's BILL McDERMOTT, wearing the grease-
covered jump-suit of a mechanic and swilling generous shots of brandy 
from a hip flask, and there's a smallish woman with a sensitive face 
who, apparently out of character, is armed to the teeth. She's a deaf 
mute, nicknamed SPIDER, and she is urgently signing "Come on! Let's 
get outa here!" with her hands.

JOHN
Right. We better get away from that Bee. He 
might have friends.

THE GROUP starts moving. SARAH follows voluntarily. We notice that 
all three strangers are wearing the same pullover vests that we saw 
on the foot soldiers, the ones with big orange circles.

76	EXT. THE JUNGLE - EVENING

THE GROUP trudges through thick brushland, occasionally needing to 
chop a path with their blades. JOHN speaks in low tones as they move.

JOHN
Bees. That's what we call the dead... the 
walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.

 SARAH
Gasparilla?

JOHN
He was a pirate who sailed these waters 
long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these 
days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.

SARAH
Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?

JOHN
That's the man. He's been holed up here 
ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and 
his family owned these islands 'round here. 
They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The 
whole underneath is dug out. There was 
missiles here and laboratories and bomb 
proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. 
Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... 
private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his 
cronies from all the best golf courses in 
Tallahassee...and his private army, of 
course.

SARAH
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. 
There were actually walking dead...in 
uniform...with guns.

JOHN
Captain Rhodes and his Red Coat Bees. They 
could sting, sister. We know you came up 
against 'em. We been watchin' you since you 
landed. Couldn't help. I'm sorry for that. 
We ain't supposed to be outside. If we was 
spotted it could....well, it could be the 
end of everything.

SPIDER is signing for everyone to be quiet. They all stop in their 
tracks. BILL McDERMOTT swigs some more brandy. With the stealth of a 
Mohican SPIDER pushes aside the branches of a giant oleander and 
peers through.

77	EXT. ENTRANCE TWO - EVENING

There's A HATCHWAY in sight built into A CONCRETE, BUNKER LIKE 
STRUCTURE. FOUR OR FIVE SOLDIERS are coming up out of the ground. 
They're armed with PRODS AND RIFLES.

Behind the men, lurching on unsteady feet, come A HALF-DOZEN OF THE 
LIVING DEAD, all wearing vests of white and blue.

Behind the lumbering creatures come A WOMAN AND A MAN both wearing 
white laboratory coats and carrying clipboards. The woman is MARY 
HENRIED, one of the top behaviouralists in The Cave. (We'll learn a 
lot more about her later.)

THE ZOMBIES are pushing through the undergrowth right in the 
direction of SARAH and her friends. SARAH shows some alarm at this 
but JOHN calms her with a strong hand.

SPIDER has seen the approaching danger. She silently draws A FARMER'S 
SICKLE from her belt. (With her other hand she draws A PISTOL for 
good measure.) BILL McDERMOTT unarmed, nervously takes another 
swallow from his flask.

THE ZOMBIES are getting closer. Too close for comfort.

Finally, MARY HENRIED and THE OTHERS turn and disappear into the 
bunker. The last man down pulls the hatch shut.

The moment the coast is clear, SPIDER AND JOHN jump up from cover. 
THE OTHERS follow their lead. But it's too late. THE ZOMBIES have 
spotted them. The creatures begin to growl and make AGITATED, APE-
LIKE SOUNDS. SPIDER brings her BLADE up chest-high, ready to repel an 
attack. SARAH lifts her own MACHETE but JOHN reaches over and takes 
it away from her.

JOHN
Give that to me. Get behind me. Stay behind 
me.

(SARAH resists, not understanding, somewhat 
insulted.)

You ain't wearin' a vest. They been taught 
not to touch the ones with the circles. 
There ain't no hundred percent, all-a-time 
rules with the Bees, but most-a-time they 
leave us alone. The colour on their vests 
tell ya how much schoolin' they got. It's 
the ones without colours you gotta watch 
out for.

SARAH gets behind JOHN, his orange circle acting as her shield. He 
reaches around with one strong arm and pulls her in tight against his 
back.

THE ZOMBIES, snarling and showing teeth, move through the thicket. 
ONE shuffles right past SPIDER AND McDERMOTT. It gets stuck in the 
bramble, changes course and moves on without attacking.

ANOTHER ZOMBIE, a "white", trudges within arm's reach of JOHN, 
growling all the while. Suddenly it reaches its arms out and takes 
two angry steps towards the humans who back away.

THE ZOMBIES charges. Things happen quickly. JOHN pushes SARAH away 
and swings the MACHETE. THE BLADE SINKS INTO THE CREATURES SKULL. 
BLACKENED BLOOD FLIES. An instant later SPIDER'S SICKLE PUNCHES IN 
BESIDE THE BIG KNIFE. THE ZOMBIE twitches for a moment, its eyes 
rolling, then it falls, lifeless, to the ground.

McDERMOTT trots up beside SARAH. He takes a huge swallow from his 
flask then offers some to her. She puts the flask to her lips but 
nothing comes. She holds it out, neck down, to show that it's empty.

McDERMOTT
Sorry. Guess I don't know my own strength.

JOHN wipes SARAH'S MACHETE on some thick leaves, cleaning off most of 
the gore, then he returns the weapon to the woman.

SARAH
Thanks. I can fight my own battles.

JOHN
I know you can. Like I said, we been 
watchin' you.

McDERMOTT
We better get as far away from here as we 
can. We can work the other side of the 
island tonight.

JOHN
(explaining) We found nine entrances to the 
Cave so far, and we ain't got the whole 
thing near charted yet. That's what we was 
doin' out here today. Huntin' for 
entrances.

McDERMOTT
Come on. They find a Bee done like this and 
they'll know somebody's been out walkin' 
where they shouldn't have been.

JOHN bows his head over the downed ZOMBIE. He mumbles softly. We 
can't hear the words but we can tell that he's praying, reciting the 
good words over the corpse of the "white-coat".

SARAH
The man I was with...until today... 
believed that praying was for blind men who 
couldn't see the truth.

JOHN
How we gonna break the curse without a 
prayer or two.

SARAH
Curse?

JOHN
What is it if it ain't a curse?

SARAH
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite 
that infects the brain.

JOHN
That sounds like a curse to me.

SARAH
We thought we were escaping here. We 
thought we'd found an uninhabited island. 
Christ! This place is a worse nightmare 
than anything I've seen yet!

JOHN
I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why 
we're doin' what we're doin'. What's 
happenin' underground here is just what 
Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' 
man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're 
gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.

SARAH
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus 
nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a 
bullet from one of those storm troopers and 
prayer won't keep one of those monsters 
from eatin' your liver for lunch.

JOHN
That's why we didn't use prayers on this 
here white coat 'til after he was 
destroyed. We ready to fight when we have 
to. And we gotta fight now.

SARAH
Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been 
fightin' for what feels like a hundred 
years and I'm finished. I don't need 
religion. I don't need prayers. I need a 
couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail 
on outa here. Find another island where 
there ain't so much....traffic.

JOHN
You think you can find your boat? There's a 
thousand little inlets and backwaters all 
through here. You remember all the ways you 
turned to get where you are now? You leave 
yourself a trail?

SARAH is stopped by this. She stares at the big man suspiciously, not 
sure whether to believe him.

JOHN
We didn't see the exact spot but we know 
about where you landed. But we ain't ready 
to take you there. Not yet. You see...we 
need guns, too.

SARAH looks around her at the unlikely band of guerillas. She thinks 
for a moment...not very long...then she turns and starts off into the 
jungle.

SARAH
I can find it myself. I didn't come that 
far.

JOHN
Farther than you think. You'll get lost. 
You will. And there's Bees all through the 
jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos 
don't lie.

SARAH
No. They just try to hold you for ransom. 
Fuck you, Moses! I'm outa here!

SARAH plunges into the brush and without so much as a look back over 
her shoulder she disappears.

McDERMOTT
We can't let her go, John.

JOHN
We don't need her guns that bad. Billy boy. 
(He's joking.)

McDERMOTT
The hell we don't! But that's not what I 
mean. She'll be dead in ten minutes out 
there alone. That or she'll be firin' off 
her automatics and wakin' up the troops.

JOHN
We'll split up. Billy, you go with Spider. 
Just an hour or two tonight, that's all. 
Rhodes might have extra guards on after all 
the commotion. We'll meet up at number six 
and go back home together.

McDERMOTT
God save us. And me with me flask dry. I'll 
never make it.

THE GROUP splits up, moving off in two different directions through 
the darkening underbrush.

78	EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE - NIGHT

DARKNESS has fallen. The jungle is as black as the background on a 
velvet painting.

SARAH is moving cautiously. She bumps into something, jumps back, her 
MACHETE high, and freezes. Cautiously she moves ahead...one 
step...another...another...

SPLASH!!! She steps down off a hidden ledge into A KNEE-DEEP RIVER. 
She manages to keep her balance but her MACHETE falls into the water 
and drops to the bottom invisible in the dark silt. Slowly she bends 
down and reaches into the water. A SNAKE swims past just inches away. 
SARAH recoils. Before she can reach down again she hears A LOUD, 
ANIMAL SNORT followed by A GREAT SPLASHING SOUND. Then ANOTHER. She 
squints to see.

SHAPES approach on the black water. ALLIGATORS, big ones, just their 
very tops showing as they move on a straight course toward the woman.

She backs up feeling for the shore, for the ledge behind her. THE 
FIRST ZOMBIE GRABS HER SHOULDERS. She spins and sees the thing. It 
has one eye dangling out of its socket and there's a broken-off 
length of wooden pole stuck clean through its torso just under the 
left breast.

SARAH smashes her RIFLE BUTT INTO THE THING'S HEAD. AGAIN. AGAIN. It 
keeps coming. (So do the gators. They're getting to within a few 
yards.) SARAH swings a fourth time. THE ZOMBIE grabs her rifle. She 
pulls with all her might and the creature, hanging on to the gun, 
topples off the ledge and into the water.

When SARAH starts to climb up on the ledge, ANOTHER ZOMBIE lurches 
towards her from dry land. She spins around, looking for options. The 
gators are just about close enough to bite her ass and THE ZOMBIE 
that fell into the river is rising up again, covered with moss and 
slime and looking pissed.

SARAH faces THE ZOMBIE on the bank. She has no choice. She aims her 
AUTOMATIC. She's just about to fire when SOMETHING FLASHES out of the 
darkness. It's A MACHETE. IT CLEAVES OPEN THE ZOMBIE'S SKULL. From 
out of the night big JOHN appears. He struggles to free his blade 
from the dead creature's head.

SARAH scrambles up onto the muddy ledge. THE GATORS are still moving 
in and THE ZOMBIE, its moss-covered arms reaching out rigidly like 
the arms of Frankenstein's monster, is growling ferociously (almost 
swallowing its own dangling eyeball in the process).

SARAH
Are you gonna pause to say words over the 
dead this time or can we be on our way?

Without answering, JOHN steams off through the bush pulling SARAH 
along behind him, his big hand tight around her arm.

79	INT. THE CAVE - NIGHT

CLOSE on: A TELEVISION SCREEN. First there is only VIDEO NOISE, then 
an image blinks onto the screen.

MONTAGE: OTHER VIDEO SCREENS on MONITORS in various places throughout 
the huge underground facility. ZOMBIES watch the screens gathered in 
groups of four, six and eight, like children in ranked classes.

The screens show scenes of ZOMBIES taking FOOD from humans in ORANGE 
CIRCLE VESTS. GUNS are pointed at ORANGE CIRCLES then lowered 
harmlessly. GUNS are pointed at HUMANS without orange circles and 
FIRED. The images repeat and repeat and repeat. THE ZOMBIES watch the 
scenes with dumb curiosity.

80	INT. COMMUNICATION CENTER IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

This is the central area for all varieties of communication. There 
are RADIO CONSOLES, both intercom and outgoing, there are VIDEO 
CONTROL PANELS and there are LARGE COMPUTER TERMINALS. Reflecting the 
panic to set up operations back when the disaster first struck, much 
of the equipment is placed haphazardly and not built in. WIRES run 
every which way, BARE ANTENNAS AND LOOSE CONNECTORS clutter the 
place. ENGINEERS scurry with TOOL BOXES constantly repairing, 
patching, trouble shooting.

Most of the personnel are TECHNICIANS but there is a group of 
SCIENTIFIC TYPES, obvious in their white lab coats. Among these is 
MARY HENRIED, who we caught a glimpse of outside Entrance Two.

At A SECURITY STATION, A GUARD notices something on one of his own 
VIDEO SCREENS which monitor key locations inside The Cave.

GUARD
There's activity in the dormitory!

MARY and one of her assistants, JULIE GRANT, a younger girl, move 
over to the video console. ONE SCREEN there shows what looks like a 
prison corridor. CELLS WITH HEAVILY BARRED DOORS run down both sides. 
We can see the distinct MOVEMENT OF SHADOWS in the corridor. MARY 
reacts instantly stepping over to AN INTERCOM and pressing A SEND-
BUTTON.

VOICE (o.s. - filter)
Gate twenty-three.

MARY
This is Mary Henried. Did anyone enter the 
dormitory?

VOICE (o.s. - filter)
Yes, ma'm. Captain Rhodes.

MARY clicks off, infuriated. She hurries towards AN EXIT followed by 
JULIE GRANT.

81	INT. THE DORMITORY IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

CLOSE ON: THE MOUTH OF A LARGE PLASTIC BAG. A HAND wearing A BLACK 
LEATHER GLOVE pulls A HUMAN HEAD out of a bag by its hair. It's the 
head of one of the dead soldiers from Rhode's platoon. The hand 
belongs to RHODES himself.

In the darkness of A CELL, A RED COAT ZOMBIES takes a hesitant step 
forward. RHODES tries to shove THE HEAD through the bars but IT 
STICKS. When RHODES lets go it stays there, wedged at shoulder 
height.

RHODES
Take it, friend. Take it. It's a present. 
From me to you.

THE RED COAT steps forward and lays its hand on THE HEAD.

RHODES
Just remember who gives you favours.

THE ZOMBIE pulls hard and THE HEAD pops through onto its side of the 
bars. The creature lurches off towards A COT in the shadows at the 
rear of the cell where it hunkers down and begins to RAVISH THE HEAD, 
TEARING FLESH OFF, EATING IT hungrily.

On the cell door we notice A PLAQUE with a number (5) and, written in 
marker, the Red Coat's nickname, "BLUTO".

RHODES moves past OTHER CELLS, each holding A NICKNAMED RED COAT. 
GRUMPY stands way back in the shadows. TONTO stands near the bars, 
growling. FATSO is swaying back and forth like a chubby five year old 
who needs to pee.

RHODES stops at A CELL marked "BUB!". Inside we see A SILHOUETTE, 
tall, erect, not moving a muscle. RHODES grins.

RHODES
Well, Bub. I've heard about you. Miss 
Henried's pride and joy.

RHODES steps closer and BUB snarls warningly.

RHODES
Surly sonofabitch. I want to make friends, 
Bub. Friends. I have one more goodie in my 
sack here.

A LOUD, CLANGING SOUND interrupts. RHODES turns to see.

82	INT. THE DORMITORY - NIGHT

MARY HENRIED AND JULIE GRANT have entered through A STEEL DOOR WITH 
ELECTRONIC LOCKS. THE ZOMBIES send up A CHORUS OF MOANS AND GROWLS. 
The women start down the corridor checking cells as they pass. 
Suddenly they stop in their tracks, their horrified eyes staring into 
A CELL marked "SAMSON!".

SAMSON is nibbling on ANOTHER HEAD. Much of the flesh is already 
gone, but we can still recognise...CHICO. The zombie turns the thing 
up-side-down, reaches way inside, through the neck, and pulls out 
grey matter.

JULIE backs away, fighting nausea. A spasm rises in MARY'S stomach as 
well and she reels away from the hideous sight.

RHODES
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen 
worse.

MARY
God....damn you, Rhodes!

RHODES
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities 
worse than yours?

MARY
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've 
been trying to wean these specimens onto 
alligator meat!

RHODES
No wonder they're so....hungry.

Suddenly JULIE SCREAMS, her hands flying to her mouth.

THE PLASTIC BAG is still dangling from RHODES' GLOVED HAND. Inside, 
pressed into the thin plastic, we can see the rough outline of THE 
FINAL HEAD. THE THING IS SQUIRMING causing the whole bag to wiggle.

RHODES drops the bag instantly to the floor. Taking care, he grabs 
the bottom by a loose corner and pulls up hard. THE HEAD ROLLS OUT 
AND SETTLES AGAINST A WALL. IT'S EYES ARE OPEN AND DARTING CRAZILY, 
ITS MOUTH IS CHEWING, GROTESQUELY, ON THE AIR.

MARY stares in shock. JULIE runs towards the exit, trying to scream 
but gagging on her own acids. She's hysterical.

RHODES calmly draws his PISTOL, cocks, and FIRES. THE SQUIRMING HEAD 
IS SHATTERED by the powerful bullet.

83	INT. MARY'S OFFICE IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

A 9 BY 12 CUBICLE with A SMALL COMPUTER TERMINAL, A DESK AND THREE 
CHAIRS. There's A LIGHTBOX on the wall displaying GROUPS OF CRANIAL 
X-RAYS.

MARY guides JULIE GRANT into a chair. RHODES stands cockily in the 
open doorway.

JULIE
I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I 
didn't know that....de-caps... revived!

RHODES
Any dead whose brains are intact will 
revive.

JULIE
But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must 
be torture for them!

RHODES
They are brutes without feeling. Though I 
admit that I've requested cremation for 
myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, 
even more ridiculous now than it ever was. 
To say nothing of the...spacing 
problem...on a small island like this.

JULIE
I thought the purpose of decapitation was 
to...to...

RHODES
The purpose of decapitation is to preserve 
as much...food...as possible. The purpose 
for feeding is to keep the beasts on our 
side. The fact that they can be taught to 
clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a 
convenient side benefit, not the primary 
goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves 
from becoming their supper. Keep them fed 
and they behave. Keep them hungry and they 
revert back to being the animals that they 
have always been. You saw them in there.

MARY
You gave them a fresh taste of blood!

RHODES
They will never be satisfied with anything 
else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. 
I'm prepared to take whatever steps are 
necessary to see to it they don't get mine! 
Not while I'm still using it!

JULIE has calmed herself down. Now she feels angry, betrayed. She 
looks at MARY accusingly.

JULIE
Did you know? About the de-caps?

MARY
I'd never seen it before.

JULIE
But you knew.

MARY nods in the affirmative. Tears form in JULIE'S eyes.

JULIE
What else is there, doctor? What else do 
you people know that the rest of us don't?

They stare at one another. Whatever bond once existed between them 
has been severed forever.

84	INT. A CONDITIONING ROOM IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

There are CARDIOGRAPHS, E.E.G. MONITORS, AND ALL SORT OF PHYSICAL 
CONDITIONING DEVICES. On TABLES lie SYMBOLOGY CARDS AND COLOURED 
BLOCKS for dexterity testing. There are LARGE CUT-OUT SHAPES on the 
walls, TRIANGLES, SQUARES and familiar ORANGE CIRCLES.

MARY storms into the room flinging the door shut behind her. RHODES 
catches it with his BLACK LEATHER GESTAPO BOOT.

RHODES
You can't run away from the planet, Miss 
Science. You can't even run away from the 
island, heh heh.

MARY
Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!!

RHODES laughs loudly. MARY faces him, hatred boiling away her 
vocabulary. She can't think of word that are adequate.

MARY
You're....you're disgusting! 
You're....FILTH!

RHODES
And you're the one who builds the bomb and 
they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be 
used'.

MARY is stopped...by her own guilt. She turns and busies herself 
gathering books and papers, then she CLICKS OFF A LIGHT and moves 
toward the doorway where RHODES stands.

MARY
(calmer, with method) Julie Grant is a 
behaviouralist. She's not medical. She 
hasn't been as...exposed to...to 
things...as some of the rest of us. She'll 
be alright. I'll talk to her. She'll be 
alright.

RHODES
Oh, I have no doubt.

MARY
(recognising threat in his voice) If you 
put her on the shit list because of her 
reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.

RHODES
Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to 
favour you lately. I understand he assigned 
you a roommate of your choice. The rest of 
us have to pick names out of a hat. 

MARY
(reading his jealousy) Rhodes, you and I 
had a roll in the hay together when I first 
got here. It was a wholly unsatisfying 
experience which I do not want to, and 
which I never will repeat! So give up, 
mister! I'm going home...to that roommate 
you mentioned.

MARY pushes past RHODES into the hallway.

85	INT. THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE CONDITIONING ROOM - NIGHT

MARY starts down the hall but RHODES grabs her from behind. He leans 
in close, lusting, pressing his lips against the back of her neck.

MARY
Take your hands off me! Right now!

An evil grin returns to RHODES' flushed face. He stares at the woman 
for a long moment, then he lets go. MARY walks away, bristling. 
RHODES calls after her.

RHODES
Maybe you'll change your mind when it 
starts getting too lonely for you.

MARY stops dead. She turns back to see him gloating.

RHODES
I'm not entirely without influence myself, 
Miss Science. I had your roommate 
assigned...by Gasparilla... to my platoon. 
What's his name? Tyler? Yes. Toby Tyler.

A bubble of fear pushes up in MARY'S throat but she is only letting 
her anger show. Her stare is fierce, her eyes daggers.

RHODES
I had an unfortunate little run-in with him 
today. In fact...you might say that Mr. 
Tyler is in big trouble with 
the...authorities.

MARY
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd 
love to serve your balls to those Red Coats 
for lunch! Think about it!

RHODES
No, Miss Science. You're the one who needs 
to do some thinking.

He turns and walks away. MARY stands still for a time, THE SOUND OF 
RHODES' CLICKING BOOTHEELS surrounding her, swallowing her. In the 
DEEP BACKGROUND we can HEAR THE MOANS OF THE CAGED DEAD.

86	INT. THE CENTRAL CHAMBERS OF THE CAVE - NIGHT

MONTAGE: as MARY walks through HUGE OPEN AREAS CARVED OUT OF NATURAL 
ROCK. We are stunned at the enormity of the place. JEEPS AND TRUCKS 
RUMBLE back and forth. Storage areas hold MOUNTAINS OF CRATES, 
CARTONS, WATER AND GAS CANISTERS. FORK LIFTS shift loads from here to 
there.

MARY comes to a place where the natural rock surrenders to man-made 
walls. She enters past TWO SECURITY GUARDS, showing her I.D.

87	INT. THE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

MARY moves down A CORRIDOR with NUMBERED DOORS on both sides. We HEAR 
THE SOUND OF LIFE, MUSIC BLASTING, VOICES LAUGHING, ARGUING, CRYING. 
PEOPLE move by. A MAN AND A WOMAN are fighting. She slaps him, he 
punches her, she kicks him in the balls. THREE HOOKERS pound on a 
door. The door is opened by A NAKED MAN WEARING A DILDO on his nose. 
OTHER MEN, behind him, laugh wildly as the hookers enter their smoke-
filled room.

MARY stops in her tracks when she sees that outside A DOOR NUMBERED 
83 (the door to her quarters) there are TWO OF RHODES' SOLDIERS with 
RIFLES in hand. The door itself is open and SHADOWS move inside.

MARY turns quickly, before she is spotted, and starts back through 
the hallway. As she turns a corner she is grabbed by TOBY TYLER.

MARY
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find 
out what's goin' on.

TOBY
Hey. Slow down. What is it?

MARY
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.

TOBY
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his 
move so fast.

MARY
It's because of me.

TOBY
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is 
a prick.

MARY
I want you to leave. Then maybe...

TOBY
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. 
I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we 
can smuggle out one of those inflatable 
rafts. They're crated up real small. 
They've got air canisters. There's food 
inside. Even a little motor.

MARY
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm 
not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong 
that way. I need...

TOBY
Need what? Civilised order like we have 
down here? Christ!

MARY
I can work here. Maybe my work can 
help...help everyone. I can do more good 
with access to this equipment than I can 
off in some wasteland.

TOBY
For the good of mankind. That's what every 
monster-maker says.

MARY looks into TOBY'S eyes. She's hurt, yet angry. The kind of anger 
that comes involuntarily when somebody strikes an already sensitive 
guilt-nerve.

TOBY
We're gettin' out. Me and Tricks. I want 
you to come with us. I want that more than 
anything. I'll send word. I'll let you know 
a time and a place to meet. We probably 
won't be able to wait around so if you're 
not there on the dot...well...if you're not 
there, I'll know you're not comin'.

She grabs him, holding him tightly against her. They kiss, hard and 
long. TOBY pulls away, looks at her lovingly, then turns and starts 
toward the guarded apartment. MARY follows.

TOBY
(walking) I don't know what they're gonna 
do to me. I figure they'll just send me out 
to Stalag Seventeen but if...if it's worse 
than that...Tricks will know. Stay in touch 
with Tricks.

As they approach the door to number 83, THE SOLDIERS there raise 
their RIFLE to ready positions.

SOLDIER
You Tyler?

TOBY
Yes.

SOLDIER
You're under arrest. I'll take your weapon.

TOBY hands over his RIFLE and begins to unbuckle his PISTOL BELT. TWO 
MORE SOLDIERS appear from inside the open apartment.

MARY
What's he supposed to have done? What are 
the charges?

SOLDIER
Dunno, ma'm. We're on orders.

MARY
Look...I'm Mary Henried. I'm with the 
special conditioning center. I'm not 
without influence...

TOBY
(calmly) Mary.

MARY
I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll 
have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand 
here and...

TOBY
(more insistent) MARY!

She gives up. She looks into TOBY'S eyes.

TOBY
I'll be alright. Just remember the things I 
said. Take care of yourself.

THE SOLDIERS escort TOBY down the hall without force. MARY watches 
their backs for a time, then she flings her BOOKS AND PAPERS angrily 
into the open apartment. She begins to cry.

88	EXT. ENTRANCE NUMBER SIX - NIGHT

HATCHWAY NUMBER SIX is surrounded by PROTECTIVE FENCING and, from it, 
A FENCED ALLEYWAY runs off through the brush toward...we don't know 
what yet.

THE HATCH OPENS and TOBY, along with TWO OTHER PRISONERS, also 
disarmed troopers, is led down that alleyway by THREE GUARDS.

JOHN, SARAH AND BILL McDERMOTT peer out from nearby foliage. They 
watch the procession. John whispers.

JOHN
The fences make a safe pathway to Stalag 
Seventeen. That's where we live. That's 
where you gonna live, too. Hell's half 
acre. It's not a nice place. Them boys 
there is prisoners. What's their 
punishment? They sent out to the Stalag for 
a few weeks. That's punishment enough.

SPIDER seems to appear from nowhere. She motions and the others 
follow her through the thick jungle.

89	EXT. ENTRANCE TO STALAG SEVENTEEN - NIGHT

THE RUNNING FENCE LEADS TO A GATE IN A BIGGER FENCE. This one is 
ELECTRIFIED. We know this because we see A COLLECTION OF ZOMBIES, 
mostly "civilians" with no vests, clambering there, HANDS AND FACES 
SPARKING WHEN THEY TOUCH THE CHAIN LINKS.

THE ZOMBIES send up wild MOANS AND GURGLES when TOBY AND THE OTHER 
PRISONERS are led through the gate.

Inside the compound is A SCATTERING OF OPEN-SIDED MILITARY TENT-
BUILDINGS, resembling those on M*A*S*H. There's A DIN coming off the 
place, a mixture of MUSIC AND VOICES that forms a disturbed blanket 
of noise. The place seems to seethe like a hornets' next.

THE SOLDIERS head back for The Cave as POSTED GUARDS shut the gate 
behind THE PRISONERS. TOBY and the other captives move toward the 
"village".

90	EXT. STALAG SEVENTEEN MAIN STREET - NIGHT

PEOPLE wallow in the mud. ONE MAN has just taken a shit and is wiping 
his ass. Nearby A DRUNK lies unconscious. SEVERAL MEN are fighting. 
It's a brutal fight with BOTTLES AND PIPES AND LENGTHS OF CHAIN. The 
men are really hurting each other. PEOPLE SMOKE AND SNORT AND SHOOT 
UP in wide open disarray.

A HUGE PREGNANT WOMAN plants herself right in TOBY'S path.

PREGNANT WOMAN
How 'bout it, baby. I'm big but I'm 
beautiful.

TOBY pushes past her and bumps into A SURLY DRUNK.

DRUNK
HEY, YOU FUCK! YOU FUCK!

He grabs TOBY and flings him violently against an upright on one of 
the long huts. THE OTHER TWO PRISONERS move on, abandoning TOBY, 
disappearing into the crowd. THE DRUNK pulls A RUSTED, HOME-MADE 
KNIFE.

DRUNK
I OUGHTA SLICE YOU UP, YOU FUCK! YOU CAN'T 
PUSH ME AROUND LIKE... PUSH ME 
AROUND...LIKE...

Suddenly VOMIT rises in the man's throat and he doubles over. TOBY is 
aware of SOUNDS behind him. At his back, in the hut, A HAIRY FAT MAN, 
still wearing his boxer shorts and his muddy boots, is wham-bam-
bamming A WHORE, who is wearing everything but underwear and boots. 
There are needle tracks on the woman's arms and her face looks as 
though she's been beaten brutally. She purses her deep red, damaged 
lips and blows TOBY a kiss that's meant to be seductive.

TOBY moves on down the street. The place is a cesspool full of human 
dregs, stinking with refuse, filled with the fury and desperation of 
man in his last days.

91	EXT. ENTRANCE TO STALAG SEVENTEEN - NIGHT

JOHN leads his followers to within sight of the Stalag gates. ZOMBIES 
still claw at the ELECTRIFIED FENCE. BLUE-WHITE SPARKS fill the air 
like flashbulbs.

JOHN
This is home, darlin'. Home for us that 
don't make the grade. Us that ain't...good 
enough to live inside The Cave. We grow a 
little food, do a little light 
manufacturin'...like these here vests, we 
make these for the massers. We live in our 
own filth, with bugs and snakes and disease 
and jungle fever...all the time waitin' to 
become breakfast for the Bees.

JOHN is doing a sales job on SARAH but everything he says is truth. 
She hears it all, softening to JOHN'S cause.

SPIDER has silently lifted A LARGE WOODEN ROUND out of the weeds. 
It's a camouflaged tunnel entrance.

JOHN
It's a tunnel. It's a couple hundred yards. 
Just keep goin' 'til you reach the end. 
I'll be right behind you.

SARAH starts down into the hole. JOHN and the others prepare to 
follow. JUNGLE SOUNDS cover the noises they make.

92	INT. THE HOSPITAL IN STALAG SEVENTEEN - NIGHT

We see ROWS OF HOME-MADE COTS, each with A BODY lying on top. What 
faces we see are gaunt, showing the boils and lesions of consumptive 
diseases and tropical fever. INSECTS BUZZ and there is THUNDER in the 
air.

An Oriental orderly, LUKEY, moves through the maze of bodies. He 
lifts the wrist of A WOMAN WHO LOOKS DEAD and he discovers that she 
is dead indeed. He hurries off.

93	INT. HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

This is a room with walls, an operating room with JURY-RIGGED 
APPOINTMENTS. On A TABLE, under A HALF-DOZEN LIGHT BULBS, lies A 
CORPSE. Another orderly, a Nordic type names DIESEL, an enormous man, 
assists while DOCTOR LOGAN methodically SAWS OFF THE CORPSE'S HEAD.

LUKEY rushes in out of breath.

LUKEY
Doc Logan! Doc Logan! Dere's a lady dead 
out dere! Gotta hurry! Gotta hurry! Dunno 
how long she been dat way! Maybe she 
gettin' ready to come back.

THE CORPSE'S HEAD ROLLS AWAY FROM ITS BODY. DOC LOGAN picks up AN 
ELECTRIC DRILL WITH A LONG BIT. WHZZZZZZZZZ! HE DRIVES THE SPINNING 
BIT INTO THE DISEMBODIED HEAD, DEEP INTO ITS BRAIN. When he pulls it 
out, MATTER FLIES as the motor winds down.

LOGAN is a middle aged man. He looks exhausted, demoralised, a bit 
mad. And he looks as ill as some of his patients. There are OPEN 
SORES on his face and he hasn't shaved for days. He's covered with 
two week worth of BLOOD STAINS. He starts around the table leaving 
DIESEL to dispose of the "DE-CAP".

LOGAN
Bury the head. Call the guard for the rest. 
Get it off the table for now. We'll bring 
this new one in.

DIESEL doesn't respond right away. He's heard something.

LOGAN
What is it?

DIESEL
The tunnel.

LOGAN hears it now, A SCRATCHING, SCUFFLING SOUND. He looks at his 
watch.

LOGAN
God. It's almost sun-up.

LOGAN AND LUKEY move to a spot at the back of the room. They remove 
SEVERAL OF THE PLANKS in the floor. SARAH'S head pops out, gasping 
for air. Logan recoils, his eyes wide and frightened.

LOGAN
Who are you? Who are you?

He stands up too quickly. Dizziness makes him reel. He smashes into 
AN INSTRUMENT CART, comes up with A LONG-BLADED SCALPEL and holds the 
thing threateningly aimed at the stranger.

JOHN
It's OK. It's OK, Doc. She's with us.

In the next moment, SARAH and the others climb out of the tunnel.

JOHN
This here's the hospital. That's Diesel 
over there, the big guy. This here's Lukey 
and that's Doc Logan who's about to cut 
your tonsils out.

SPIDER, the last one to climb into the room, quickly begins 
collecting WEAPONS, what few the rebels have.

JOHN
This here's all the weapons we got. That's 
why your fancy automatic looks so good to 
us. We gotta stick it over here with the 
others for now. They catch us with any kind 
o' weapon and its death without even askin' 
your name.

SARAH lets SPIDER take her GUN. The deaf mute signs something which 
SARAH can't decipher.

JOHN
Ammunition. You got ammunition in your pack 
there? I hope you do or the gun ain't worth 
much.

SARAH roots through her SUPPLY PACK and produces THREE LOADED CLIPS 
AND SEVERAL BOXES OF LOOSE SHELLS. JOHN notices SOME TINS OF FOOD, 
MEDICINES, A KNIFE, A COMPASS...

JOHN
We better just hide the whole pack, 
darlin'. That stuff is just shoutin' out 
that it come from the mainland. The shit we 
get is all C.D. rations. Aspirins and 
crackers from 1958.

SPIDER snatches THE PACK away rather roughly. SARAH is a little 
disturbed by the action. THE MATERIAL is stashed under FLOOR BOARDS 
beside the tunnel entrance.

JOHN
Let's go. You look like you could use some 
shut eye. Me too. We can all get acquainted 
tomorrow.

LUKEY escorts JOHN AND SARAH out of the operating room into the main 
hospital area. BILL McDERMOTT pulls out his empty flask.

McDERMOTT
Doc, I need a fill up. I'll help m'self if 
it's alright with you.

LOGAN nods distractedly and BILL moves to A SUPPLY CABINET which 
contains, among other essentials, SEVERAL BOTTLES OF BRANDY. He fills 
his flask eagerly.

LOGAN
How do we know she's alright? How do we 
know?

McDERMOTT
She's alright. Christ, Rhodes and his 
cossacks wiped out her whole party. Dan 
near got her.

McDERMOTT pockets the refilled flask, takes a long slug from the 
cabinet bottle before putting it back, and moves out of the room. 
LOGAN is left alone with DIESEL AND SPIDER.

LOGAN
How do we know she's alright? How do we 
know?

LOGAN repeats his question, intoned identically as it was before. 
He's twitching slightly and sweat is pouring down his face. THE 
THUNDER suddenly seems LOUDER.

DIESEL
Are you alright, Doc? You look... you look 
real bad.

LOGAN
I have looked bad for four years. Everyone 
in the world has looked bad for four years. 
Thank God looks don't matter as much as 
they once did.

LOGAN, a wild gleam in his eye, moves out of the room, following 
where the others went, that LONG-BLADED SCALPEL still clutched in his 
hand. The others follow.

94	INT. THE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

JOHN, SARAH AND LUKEY are facing out across the compound. A TEEMING 
TROPICAL RAIN has started to fall.

JOHN
This just ain't your day, is it, darlin' 
Sarah.

SARAH can't help but snicker. Suddenly her head spins exhaustion is 
conquering her body as last. JOHN puts a big arm around her.

JOHN
Three more minutes. Then you can sleep. You 
gotta stay with it for three more minutes.

McDERMOTT joins them and the group moves out into the rain. LUKEY 
waddles back through the maze of cots.

LOGAN, SPIDER AND DIESEL have moved to about the center of the big 
room. The patients around them, their eyes bulging, look like lemurs.

LOGAN
How do we know she's alright? How do we 
know?

The same intonation again. This guy's wrapping is definitely coming 
loose.

THE ZOMBIE rises up behind LOGAN'S back. It's the woman whose wrist 
Lukey checked earlier. Its teeth are dripping with drool, its hands 
reaching out wantingly.

LOGAN turns around. Calmly, but with the swiftness of a rattlesnake, 
he shoots out the hand that's holding THE SCALPEL. THE BLADE SINKS 
DEEPLY INTO THE ZOMBIE'S FOREHEAD. LOGAN pulls it out and strikes 
again, and again, and again, like a swordsman thrusting, thrusting, 
thrusting. Finally the creature collapses. LOGAN wipes the scalpel on 
his already blood-covered apron. RAIN WATER drops onto him from holes 
in the roof above. He doesn't seem to notice.

95	EXT. STALAG SEVENTEEN MAIN STREET (RAIN) - NIGHT

THE STREET SCENE is toned down due to the late hour and the rain, but 
just as vile, just as vicious. JOHN AND McDERMOTT escort SARAH. JOHN 
speaks softly, and only when others on the street are far enough 
away.

JOHN
They supply us with disinfectant and dope. 
Sex, drugs and rock-and-roll. What more 
could anyone ask for? Most around here 
ain't interested in changin' their lives. 
The folks you met...me and them and a 
couple others is the whole rebel army. 
Nobody else gives a shit...and they're 
afraid o' Rhodes.

They pass A STRUCTURE WITH AN OVERHEAD SIGN that reads: JOE'S CORNER 
TAVERN. If there were walls they'd be pushed out by the MASS OF 
HUMANITY inside. MUSIC BLARES and VOICES form a wall of noise louder 
than the THUNDER. A FIGHT spills out onto the muddy street, PUSHERS 
selling all sort of delights accost JOHN and his group.
	
SARAH
They seem to be havin' a good time. Some 
punishment.

JOHN
You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a 
knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer 
veins. You get lost out here and nobody's 
gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It 
all makes for food in the freezers.

They come to A LONG HUT WITH A SIGN that reads: THE RITZ.

JOHN
This is your hotel. I'm not gonna stay here 
with you but I'll always be close. You 
gonna hafta take care o' yourself like you 
said you was able to do.

SARAH nods. JOHN smiles at her. His warm, trustworthy eyes seem to 
glow in the dark.

JOHN
Some may notice that you're new. Just deny 
it. You'll get away with it. Nobody really 
looks at each other around here. Go on in. 
Get some sleep.

He squeezes her hand tightly, then he turns away and moves off with 
McDERMOTT. SARAH moves into THE RITZ.

96	INT. THE RITZ (RAIN) - NIGHT

It resembles the hospital. There are ROWS AND ROWS OF COTS. SOME 
PEOPLE SLEEP, alone and in pairs. OTHERS are awake, drinking, 
screwing, shooting up. SARAH finds an empty cot and flops down. 
Beyond the open walls she can see THE BLUE-WHITE FLASHES coming from 
the electrified fence. RAIN LEAKS in on her but it doesn't keep her 
from falling asleep.

97	INT. THE CONDITIONING ROOM IN THE CAVE - MORNING

TECHNICIANS are working with ZOMBIES while ARMED GUARDS stand ready. 
We FOCUS ON A BLUE COAT. Under supervision, the thing is fumbling to 
tie a shoelace. It's failing miserably but trying hard. ANOTHER BLUE 
is busy placing LITTLE WOODEN SHAPES into their proper HOLES IN A 
BOARD.

TWO RED COATS sit at a table attended by HUMAN TECHNICIANS. We've 
seen these zombies before, in the dormitory. TONTO, is...or was...a 
native American, probably Seminole. In front of him is A PLATE 
containing SEVERAL BITS OF MEAT. He has A FORK in his hand and he is 
idly stabbing at the meat.

The other RED COAT, BLUTO, looks just like Bluto from Popeye, bulky 
with a thick, black beard. Tired of THE JIG SAW PUZZLE he's working 
on, he snarls and suddenly lunges for the meat on TONTO'S plate. He 
snatches a handful and stuffs it in his mouth. As soon as he tastes 
it, however, he pulls it back out, dribbling and spitting 
disgustedly.

FISHER (a technician)
They won't accept a substitute. They want 
their Alpo.

TONTO has succeeded in forking a piece of meat. He moves it to his 
mouth and pops it in.

FISHER
Alright! Way ta go, Kemosabe!

MARY HENRIED has entered the room. She pulls up and watches  TONTO 
with a kind of dubious interest. TONTO stops chewing. He looks up 
with exaggerated sadness on his face. Slowly his mouth opens and the 
chewed piece of meat slides out between his lips. He throws his fork 
down angrily.

MARY
They won't learn to use forks if they don't 
like the breakfast you're serving, Ted.

FISHER
The fork is like a game to them. If they 
get into the game maybe they'll learn to 
like the food.

MARY
It won't work.

Suddenly BLUTO jumps up from the table. He flings his chair aside and 
tromps right over to MARY. His arms are outstretched and he is making 
a pleading, Karloff-like SOUND. GUARDS come after him but MARY waves 
them off.

MARY
It's alright! Leave him alone!

MARY extends her right hand to meet BLUTO'S right and they shake 
vigorously. Then the dumb creature drops his arms and looks around. 
His brain sends no signal as to what he should do next. THE GUARDS 
lead him away.

98	INT. THE FIRING RANGE IN THE CAVE - MORNING

BLAM!!! A RED COAT is FIRING A PISTOL right AT THE LENS.

CLOSE ON: A TARGET, a flat, cut out silhouette of a man, BLACK 
TRIANGLES painted on the instant-kill-zones, brain, heart. BULLETS 
STRIKE the neck, the to torso, SOME RICOCHET off the wall behind. 
None hit the kill-zones.

MARY HENRIED enters. The place resembles a Police Department target 
range. RED COATS stand in stalls and FIRE down LONG ALLEYS at TARGETS 
which pop up against the opposite wall. THE NOISE is deafening. TWO 
TECHNICIANS are watching the shooters and keeping score. MARY walks 
up to one of them.

MARY
Have you seen Julie Grant this morning?

TECHNICIAN
She should be in the behaviour rooms.

MARY
She's not. Hasn't shown up yet.

There's AN OFF-SCREEN GROAN, the sound of a zombie trying to 
communicate. MARY turns and sees the tall RED COAT names BUB standing 
in the closest stall trying to attract MARY'S attention. (He was the 
one Rhodes referred to last night as "Mary's pride and joy".) He is 
wearing WESTERN-STYLE GUN BELTS, SIX-SHOOTER hang in HOLSTERS on both 
his hips. MARY faces BUB full with her body and delivers a military 
salute.

MARY
Good morning, Bub.

BUB replies with one of those pathetic sounds that obviously mean 
something to him. Then he, too, salutes. MARY pulls away, heading for 
AN EXIT, but BUB calls after her. He makes inarticulate sounds but we 
catch his drift.

TECHNICIAN
I think he wants you to watch.

MARY
OK, Bub. Do your stuff.

BUB turns towards the target wall looking like a gunfighter on a 
western street. There's A HUMMING MECHANICAL SOUND. KATCHUNG! A 
SILHOUETTE pops up. BUB slaps leather...fast... lighting fast. BOTH 
GUN come up. BLAM-KA-BLAM-KA-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM!!!

HOLES APPEARS IN THE TARGET...WOP-WOPPETY-WHUMP!!! All in the kill-
zones, or damn close.

BUB slaps ONE PISTOL back into its HOLSTER. He clicks open the shell-
chamber on THE OTHER, dumps the SPENT CARTRIDGES and begins to reload 
from his belt.

MARY stares at the creature's back, mixed emotions showing on her 
face. BUB turns to face her. Dropping a bullet, he salutes again. 
MARY hesitates, then salutes back.

MARY
Very good, Bub. That's....very good.

99	INT. A LOCKER ROOM IN THE CAVE - MORNING

PEOPLE are changing clothes, going on and off duty. JULIE GRANT 
rushes in and moves to a locker where she pulls out her LAB COAT. 
MARY HENRIED enters the room, spots JULIE, and rushes towards her.

MARY
Where the hell have you been?

JULIE doesn't respond. She buttons her coat never looking up.

MARY
Julie. Are you alright?
(still no response)
You were missed this morning. I need you. I 
don't want you getting your ass in hot 
water. I won't be able to help you if...

JULIE
I don't need any help from you!

JULIE slams the locker door and storms away toward the exit.

MARY
Julie...JULIE!

But she's gone. The locker door has bounced open. MARY slams it and 
it bounces again. She pounds it with her fist. Suddenly, A LOUD BELL 
SOUNDS. MARY looks at her watch then exits.

There are TWO WOMEN cleaning the locker room with MOPS AND PAILS. One 
of them turns to watch MARY HENRIED exit. We recognise her. It's 
SPIDER.

100	INT. THE COUNCIL CHAMBER IN THE CAVE - MORNING

This is a large Situations Room that is serving now as GOVERNMENT 
HEADQUARTERS. In A BIG, STUFFED OFFICE CHAIR behind A DESK FLANKED 
WITH FLAGS sits GOVERNOR HENRY DICKERSON (former of Florida, now of 
the world) A.K.A.... GASPARILLA.

At TABLES sit A DOZEN OR SO COUNCILMEN, Dickerson's cronies from the 
old Doral Country Club, close friends who were offered asylum in the 
private underground shelter. Now they sit in council, "yessing" 
everything the boss man says.

A STATE PROSECUTOR has a DESPERATE-LOOKING PRISONER on the floor, 
standing with his hands cuffed.

PROSECUTOR
He was found with a government-issue short-
wave transmitter in his quarters. He's 
charged with the theft of that equipment 
from a government installation and with 
possession of an illegal radio.

GASPARILLA munches on SOME FRUIT. He's a fat man with a handlebar 
moustache that makes him look like Pancho Villa. As an indication of 
rank we wears a military jacket but underneath is a Hawaiian shirt 
with a bold flamingo and palm tree pattern. Around his neck, nestled 
in the rolls of fat there, is enough gold to stake a small business.

PROSECUTOR
I can only suggest that the court rule in 
favour of the ultimate penalty for this 
traitor.

GASPARILLA
You always recommend the ultimate penalty, 
Tommy Lee. You and Rhodes.

We now see that RHODES is present, looking on with a smile.

GASPARILLA
All those...AGAINST...the ultimate penalty 
raise yer hands.

None of THE COUNCILMEN move a muscle. GASPARILLA scans them slowly as 
he takes a big, wet bite out of a peach.

GASPARILLA
Ya mean ta say nobody's gonna object to the 
ultimate penalty in this here case? Well, 
what if I object? What if I object to the 
ultimate penalty.

THE COUNCILMEN look nervous, apprehensive. GASPARILLA'S flexing his 
power-muscles.

GASPARILLA
There's been a whole lotta swingin' 
influence and swingin' weight arountyere 
lately. Does anybody at all give two shits 
fer what I think any more? Well, I'm a-
gonna let this guy off. How d'yall like 
that? And I want the word ta git out I let 
'im off. I let 'im off. Not this council. 
Maybe I can improve my image rountyere.

THE PRISONER looks up at GASPARILLA, hatred boiling inside him. 
GASPARILLA meets his gaze with a power-mad sneer.

GASPARILLA
Yer sentenced ta hard labour. Stalag 
Seventeen. A year.

PRISONER
WHY DON'T YOU KILL ME! I PREFER TO DIE! I 
DON'T WANT TO LIVE WITH... WITH THIS KIND 
OF...SIN!

GASPARILLA
WELL, PISS ON YOU, MISTER! I JUST SAVED 
YOUR ASS! YOU DAMN WELL BETTER NOT GO 
HOLLERIN' LIKE THAT IN HERE!

PRISONER
I SPIT ON YOU! THE ULTIMATE PENALTY FOR 
YOU! BURN IN HELL...FOR THE ULTIMATE SIN! 
PIG! ALL OF YOU! PIGS!

GUARDS drag the screaming PRISONER from the room. GASPARILLA flops 
back in his chair, flustered but unscarred. His skin is about a foot 
thick. He pitches the peach and grabs up a mango. MARY HENRIED enters 
the chamber and rushes toward an empty chair. GASPARILLA checks THE 
DOCKET on his desk, smiles, and looks up at MARY.

GASPARILLA
Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence. 
You're just in time fer a case that seems 
ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about 
the other proceedin's we been dealin' with 
here this mornin'.

MARY
I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.

GASPARILLA
Well, you managed ta make it here jus' in 
time fer this case, didn't ya?

RHODES replaces THE PROSECUTOR on the floor. He smiles at MARY 
pointedly as he starts his speech.

RHODES
Sir. In the matter of the State versus 
Private Tyler, I don't want to...

MARY
(standing) Sir, Tyler is innocent of any 
crime against the State. Captain Rhodes 
is...

GASPARILLA
(with a mouthful of mango) Miss Henried, I 
think you better...

MARY
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...

GASPARILLA
(spitting a wad of chewed pulp into his 
hand) MISS HENRIED, SHUT THE HELL UP!!!

MARY'S eyes indicate her frustration and anger but she does shut up. 
GASPARILLA plops the handful of fruit pulp onto the floor wiping his 
fingers on his military jacket.

RHODES
I don't want to take up a lot of time with 
this. Mr Tyler shot a prisoner against 
orders. There are eyewitnesses. I've 
reprimanded Tyler and I've had him sent 
outside. It's as simple as that.

GASPARILLA
Ya had 'im sent ta the Stalag? That's all 
ya did to 'im?

RHODES
The prisoner was dying, sir. Tyler acted 
out of a sense of mercy. I don't believe 
Tyler to be dangerous, General. He just 
needs...discipline. Two or three months 
outside will teach him...discipline.

MARY
Sir. It's quite clear that...

GASPARILLA
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!

MARY
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...

GASPARILLA
SIDDOWN, YOUNG LADY! I DONE YUP A SHIT-LOAD 
O' FAVOURS AND I AIN'T NEVER YET ASKED FER 
NOTHIN' IN RETURN! NOW HOW'D YOU LIKE TA 
SPEND TWO WEEKS UP T'THE VEGETABLE FARM 
YERSELF? THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE IF YA DON'T 
SIDDOWN AN' SHUT THE HELL UP!

MARY checks herself. There's a perverse air of danger fuming off the 
fat General. His attitude toward MARY has clearly changed. RHODES has 
been working on him. MARY seems to have lost this round. She can only 
hope that's all she's going to lose.

GASPARILLA
Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, 
considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got 
shit ta complain about.

MARY
(softly, carefully) I'm sorry, General, if 
I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr 
Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has 
no representation. I don't believe due 
process is being served by...

GASPARILLA
Listen, Missy. I am the only due process 
that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one 
of the people doin' the servin' from now on 
is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' 
aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer 
long enough! All that's

GASPARILLA
gonna change, young lady. Now if you still 
got a statement you'd like ta make, you can 
jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.

MARY
Tonight?

GASPARILLA
That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits. 
We'll start out in my gymnasium an' 
progress on from there...to various other 
forms o' physical therapy.

MARY shoots a hate-filled eye full at RHODES. THE CAPTAIN responds 
with a phoney look of sympathy.

101	INT. GASPARILLA'S GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

The place is full of EXERCISE EQUIPMENT, TREADMILLS, WEIGHTS, A 
NAUTILUS, ETC. There are other items which seem contradictory, PLUSH 
PILLOWS, A HUGE CIRCULAR BED SURROUNDED BY MIRRORS. Delicacies of 
FOOD AND DRINK lie about on LOW TABLES. The room is a cross between 
Elaine Powers and a harem chamber.

A HUGE COFFIN-SHAPED DEVICE opens and we see that the inside is lined 
with ULTRAVIOLET TUBES which are covered with plexiglass. GASPARILLA 
lounges inside the thing, sweating, having just taken a long dose of 
fake sunshine.

All around are THE COUNCILMEN, some with COUNTRY-CLUB TYPE WOMEN, 
conservatively dressed and wearing suitable jewellery (obviously 
wives left over from the good old days), and some with SCANTILY CLAD 
COURTESANS.

OTHER SCANTILY CLAD "BUNNY" TYPES are serving HORS-D'OEUVRES and 
pouring WINE, offering SMOKE AND SNORT.

MARY HENRIED is sitting on the floor, lost in fluffy pillows, her LAB 
COAT incongruous. RHODES watches her from nearby.

GASPARILLA
AWRITE. C'MON LADIES. OFF WITH IT... AND ON 
WITH IT...HA HA HA...

MUSIC BLARES and SEVERAL OF THE COURTESANS spring up, stripping off 
what few clothes they are wearing. Some strip naked, others down to 
panties. They hop onto various exercise machines and begin to 
"workout", tits flopping, thighs pumping...GASPARILLA'S kind of 
entertainment.

GASPARILLA
Oh, Lordy, Lordy...I'm drunk as a skunk. 
Look at this...will ya jus' loooooook at 
these lovelies! Say, Henried, you ever try 
it with another woman?

MARY looks up at the General, not knowing whether or not she should 
answer, afraid of what he might try to make her do.

GASPARILLA
I've tried it with boys. Too strenuous.

FOUR MORE WOMEN have brought in SILVER PLATTERS full of NEW HORS-
D'OEUVRES, prepared carefully and laid them out like sushi. They're 
distributed and people eat them

GASPARILLA
Folks...I just couldn't resist. How d'yall 
like those? How do those taste?

GUESTS look up, not knowing what to expect. MARY fears the worst. She 
looks around to see RHODES grinning. A knot comes up into her throat. 
She tries to swallow it down.

GASPARILLA
Fresh from the freezers, folks. It's 
what...THEY...EAT!

A FEW OF THE GUESTS are revulsed. ONE MAN starts to vomit and he runs 
from the room.

GASPARILLA
Just kiddin' folks. Just kiddin'. Would I 
do a thing like that? I ask ya now, would 
I? Hah ha ha ha ha...

Relief spreads and the bacchanalian atmosphere restores itself. 
GASPARILLA spills himself out of the tanning coffin and flops down on 
some pillows near MARY. He grabs up a goblet and swills red wine 
which runs down his front.

GASPARILLA
The great state of Florida. People came 
here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. 
The rest o' the country used ta think we 
was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and 
fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new 
Capital o' the World! Hah! They came 
here...died...went to hell...and the Devil 
sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General 
Gasparilla's army...MY ARMY!

MARY
We think there are other cities surviving. 
We think maybe Detroit... there's some 
signalling out of Philly.

GASPARILLA
There's no place like this place. Warm 
climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't 
nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the 
Feds knew that. That's why they stored so 
much o' their shit down here. It's all mine 
now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come 
after us down here, which they will some 
day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' 
come after us. They'll hafta get past my 
army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha 
ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA 
HA....

MARY
It's not a very big army. And small as it 
is you won't be able to continue feeding it 
for very long. We've got to find ways of 
getting them to respond without relying 
on...

GASPARILLA
You'll find the ways, Miss Mary. And when 
ya do...we'll sail on over to the 
mainland...or any other damn mainland fer 
that matter...and start us a recruitin' 
program. There's millions o' Bees out there 
jus' waitin' fer' a General ta lead 'em on 
ta vict'ry!

GASPARILLA swallows another huge quantity of wine.

DISSOLVE TO:

102	INT. THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

The room is empty now. Remnants of food and drink clutter the place. 
THE FAT GENERAL is asleep, snoring loudly, one of his pudgy arms is 
draped across MARY HENRIED'S lap. She is trying to move out from 
under without waking the man. She slides on the floor...a few 
inches...a few inches more. GASPARILLA snorts and rolls over. His 
eyes pop open, focus on MARY, and a smile pushes his fat cheeks back.

GASPARILLA
Well, hi there, y'all.

Mary looks down at the man, repulsed and afraid. Suddenly he grabs 
her LAB COAT. She pulls away and he crawls after her, his belly 
bouncing along the floor. BUTTONS POP and the coat falls open. He 
reaches for her blouse. It tears away and for a moment he gets a 
chubby handful of bare breast. He dives into her but he's unconscious 
before his face reaches her chest.

MARY pulls herself out from under his dead weight. Shivering, she 
clutches her blouse together and hurries out of the room.

103	EXT. ENTRANCE TO STALAG SEVENTEEN - DAWN

Light is just breaking through the trees when THE GATES ARE OPENED 
admitting FIVE UNIFORMED MEN into the compound. Outside the fence 
ZOMBIES clamber excitedly as always.

104	INT. THE RITZ - DAWN

SARAH jumps, awakened by A VOICE AND THE LOUD POUNDING OF RIFLES 
against the upright of the sleeping hut.

RHODES
REVEILLE! REVEILLE! RISE AND SHINE!

RHODES is standing near the entrance. FOUR SOLDIERS are doing the 
pounding. Stunned, disease-ridden faces look up as CITIZENS are 
awakened from sleep. Fear sweeps through the place like a tropical 
wind.

RHODES
We found two white Bees in the jungle with 
their heads chopped open. I want to know 
who's going outside the compound. I want to 
know how they're going out. I want to know 
why they're going out. Until I get these 
answers...each morning...some of you will 
die.

Without warning RHODES draws his MAGNUM and...BLAM! BLAM! He shoots 
TWO COT PEOPLE who happen to be at close range. They tumble to the 
dirt floor, dead before they hit.

RHODES scans the rest of the hut. He spots a familiar face, THE 
PRISONER from the Council Room, the one Gasparilla saved from a death 
sentence. The man makes the sign of the cross, knowing what's coming. 
BLAM! BLAM! RHODES FIRES TWO RAPID ROUNDS and THE PRISONER'S CHEST 
TURNS RED. He flies off his cot into one adjacent, landing on top of 
a SCREAMING WOMAN.

RHODES AND HIS MEN leave as abruptly as they entered. SARAH is 
stunned. As PEOPLE around her react with sobs and more screams, she 
locks her eyes on RHODES.

He is moving authoritatively down the street just outside the open-
walled structure. He passes within inches of SARAH'S cot which is 
right against the outside rail. Her emotions well up inside her. She 
is about to jump out into the street when A BIG BLACK HAND grabs her 
arm. It's JOHN, who has pushed through the gathering crowd outside.

SARAH
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is 
all happening because of me. If I turn 
myself in...

JOHN
He's just finding another reason for 
bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us 
ta die. He needs our bodies. 

Behind JOHN on the street TOBY TYLER is looking on. He has heard the 
conversation. JOHN turns and sees him. His eyes go dark with 
apprehension.

TOBY
It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and 
so do you. What's a safe place to talk?

JOHN
Ain't no place safe.

TOBY
Look...I know you have no reason to trust 
me. I've got friends in the Cave. I got 
some stuff comin' out this mornin'. I'm 
gonna try to get off the island.

PEOPLE are pushing in closer attracted by the commotion inside the 
Ritz. TOBY has to make it fast. He whispers.

TOBY
I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the 
hospital...

JOHN
The hospital? (surprised, worried)

TOBY
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red 
crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me 
at the hospital after the supplies come in. 
Maybe we can find a place there to talk.

JOHN
Maybe.

TOBY drifts off into the crowd. JOHN AND SARAH exchange glances.

105	EXT. ENTRANCE TO STALAG SEVENTEEN - MORNING

SUPPLIES are being brought in through THE MAIN GATES, CRATES, 
CARTONS, BAGS OF GRAIN, SEED, FERTILISER.

TRICKS is in charge of the patrol from the Cave. He's checking items 
as they're picked up by WORKERS from the compound. TOBY TYLER sidles 
up to his friend.

TOBY
Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.

TRICKS
Not as bad as yours, pal.

TOBY
(whispering) What'dya get?

TRICKS
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.

TOBY
We need fuel, and a couple automatics.

LUKEY, the orderly, picks up A DOLLY which is LOADED DOWN WITH CRATES 
MARKED WITH RED CROSSES.

TRICKS
Hey, you. Those two on the bottom. Don't 
open those yet. They might be from the 
wrong shipment. Just keep 'em around 'til I 
can check.

LUKEY
Yessir. I never open 'em. Nossir. I keep 
'em innaback for you.

106	EXT. FRONT STREET OF STALAG SEVENTEEN - MORNING

Watching from the shadows of A BUILDING are JOHN, SARAH AND DIESEL.

DIESEL
He's a spy. A spy for Rhodes.

JOHN
Give him a chance.

They see TOBY pull away from TRICKS and start down the street 
following LUKEY. They move out and catch up with TOBY, flanking him.

JOHN
What'dya tell that soldier, soldier? You 
tell him we was rebels?

TOBY
He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two 
crates. Can you get me into the hospital?

SHORT CUT TO:

107	INT. STORAGE BAY IN THE HOSPITAL - MORNING

CREAK! A CROWBAR pries open A CRATE. JOHN AND LUKEY guard the 
entrance while TOBY AND DIESEL work at opening the "Red Cross" boxes. 
SARAH stands nearby. THE LIDS LIFT and we see TWO ARMY-ISSUE LIFE 
RAFTS.

TOBY
There ya go. Complete with air 
canisters...little motors.

JOHN
We got a boat.

TOBY
What?

JOHN
I say we got a boat. Can you get other 
stuff?

TOBY
I got some fuel comin' out and, I hope, 
some automatic rifles.

DIESEL
He's just tryin' to win us over. This 
doesn't prove anything.

JOHN
I'm gonna trust him, Diesel. He already 
knows who we are and we ain't got a bunch 
o' time to mess around with Rhodes shootin' 
up the joint every mornin'.

TOBY, rooting through the open crates, finds THE PISTOLS TRICKS told 
him about and A FEW BOXES OF AMMO. He tosses one of the guns to JOHN. 
The big man walks over and puts the weapon back inside the crate.

JOHN
Can't walk around here with these. Let's 
just leave 'em here 'til we ready ta use 
'em.

108	INT. HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM - DAY

CLOSE ON: HANDS carefully...very carefully...pouring DROPS OF CLEAR 
LIQUID INTO A TEST TUBE. The liquid is sweating slowly out of A 
MILDEWED AND ROTTING STICK OF DYNAMITE which has been softened to 
near-melting by jungle heat.

A DOZEN TEST TUBES stand in a rack, already filled. SPIDER, another 
woman, SALLY, and a man, JACK, each have their own DYNAMITE STICK. 
Each is transferring LIQUID SWEAT...which is, of course, nitro 
glycerine...into A GLASS TUBE. They work in tense silence on the 
operating table.

DOC LOGAN works with them, doing the same delicate procedure. 
Suddenly his hands starts to tremble.

LOGAN
Take it away from me. Quickly. Take it! 
Take it!

SPIDER reaches over and, as gently as possible, takes the VIAL and 
THE DYNAMITE out of the doctor's hands. She sets the tube in the rack 
and returns the dynamite to AN OPEN CRATE, years old and crusted with 
mildew and mud, still half-filled with sticks yet to be drained. The 
danger passed, they all breathe a sigh of relief. LOGAN wipes the 
river of sweat from his face. His hands are shaking quite violently 
now. He pops pills, dry, from his pocket.

LOGAN
Sorry. I'm sorry. I'll, er...I'll be 
alright...in a moment.

JOHN
You're sick, Doc. You been sick for a while 
now. Too sick to be workin' with us on this 
raid.

JOHN, SARAH AND DIESEL are standing in a corner of the room. TOBY 
TYLER is with them, sweating and obviously nervous.

JOHN
You've helped us enough, providin' cover, 
hidin' us out. Let the rest of us handle 
the physical stuff. It's too much for you.

LOGAN
It's my fight as much as yours. The things 
they made me do...the things they 
made...me...do. I want so see Rhodes 
destroyed. I want to see all of them, all 
of them destroyed. It's my duty...in the 
eyes of God. In the eyes of God.

LOGAN is really flipso now, over the edge into banana-land.

TOBY
It won't work. That's pure nitro you're 
dealin' with there. That stuff can blow if 
you look at is funny. What're you gonna do, 
walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on 
feather pillows? You don't have a complete 
layout of the place. Even if you manage to 
avoid a fight you won't know where to go.

JOHN
We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, 
Toby.

TOBY
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island 
alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not 
goin' in there on a suicide mission. What 
can you hope to accomplish? Some radios 
maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be 
killed and in a few weeks they'll be back 
to business as usual. That place was built 
to withstand nuclear attack! What are you 
gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few 
sticks of nitro?

JOHN
We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.

TOBY
What?

JOHN
We know what's down there. We did the 
loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came 
ashore in the early days. A direct hit 
oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' 
damage.

TOBY
A direct hit'll blow the top off this whole 
island! How're you gonna fuse the stuff? 
How're you gonna leave yourself time to get 
out?

LOGAN
If we don't get out it's a small price to 
pay.

TOBY
You're fuckin' out of your minds! There's 
two hundred people down there. You gonna 
murder two hundred people?

LOGAN
Sinners! Animals! Filth! Doing the work of 
the Devil!

TOBY
What about the people here in the camp? If 
they don't get blown to kingdom come their 
food'll be destroyed, their water, medical 
supplies. They won't have any more power. 
This island can't support them all, they'll 
be doomed. Count me out, friends. I'm gonna 
get my ass outa here. Anybody wants to come 
along is welcome.

Silence falls over the room. Finally JOHN moves towards the door. 
TOBY follows but before exiting he turns back to face the group once 
more.

TOBY
I wanna see Rhodes burn just a much as you 
do...but all those people. We don't have 
the right to be their judges... just like 
they don't have the right to be our judges.

JOHN opens the door and TOBY exits. SARAH follows. JOHN looks around 
at the faces in the group, then he leaves, shutting the door behind 
him. There's a long silence, then LOGAN speaks.

LOGAN
We know what we must do. It's written for 
us in the Bible. "They shall be driven from 
the land of the living down to the world of 
the dead. That is the fate of those who 
care nothing for God."

109	INT. STORAGE BAY IN THE HOSPITAL - DAY

LUKEY stands guard. McDERMOTT has joined SARAH AND JOHN in a strategy 
huddle. TOBY stands nearby, feeling strangely guilty.

SARAH
Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around 
with their fingers up their asses while we 
bust up their toys.

JOHN
Datura.

SARAH
What?

JOHN
Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't 
worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's 
a flower that grows on these islands. Where 
I come from the voodoo priests used it 
whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's 
toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink 
or inject it...or...in a sealed area it 
might be introduced through the ventilation 
system.

SARAH
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was 
shouting! Datura Metel!

JOHN
We always planned to use it. We got some 
ground up already...but we could never find 
enough.

SARAH
There's hundreds of 'em. Right where we 
landed our boat.

TOBY
This stuff really works? No shit?

JOHN
Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot 
prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts 
ya under fer a good night's sleep.

TOBY
If you could knock out the central 
communications room you could foul up their 
whole intercom system. Then, if you move 
fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without 
bein' able to signal each other, they might 
have a hard time catchin' you.

JOHN
I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. 
The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' 
doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha 
ha...

110	EXT. THE BACKWATER - NIGHT

THE FISHING BOAT that bought SARAH and her friends to the island sits 
still in the channel. There are SOLDIERS ABOARD, two of Rhodes' men, 
pacing the deck, passing a bottle back and forth.

JOHN (o.s.)
Well, we found yer boat, lady, but so did 
they.

JOHN, SARAH AND TOBY are huddled behind green cover peering out at 
the boat.

SARAH
Looks like just two. We can take 'em when 
the time comes.

JOHN
We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave 
entrance number five.

TOBY
That entrance is closest to the labs and 
the Bee cages.

JOHN
Come on. Let's go.

They move off stealthily.

They enter the clearing with the spectacular PLANTS that Miguel 
discovered. Six feet tall, their red-gold blossoms like trumpets with 
their bells down, these are Daturas, nightshades indigenous to 
southern Florida and parts of the Caribbean.

SALLY AND JACK, who we saw working on the nitro sticks, are chopping 
off the eighteen-inch blossom and stuffing them into LARGE LEAF BAGS. 
They're wearing HOSPITAL MASKS over their mouth and noses. JOHN moves 
in to help. TOBY AND SARAH follow but JOHN stops them.

JOHN
Just stand guard for now. Spell us after a 
while. Can't breathe this grass too long or 
somebody hafta carry you home.

Work goes on in silence.

111	EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE THE RITZ - NIGHT

MUSIC ROCKS AND VOICES SHOUT. The street scene is as wild as ever. 
HOOKERS, PUSHERS AND DRUNKS pack the hot darkness.

112	INT. THE RITZ - NIGHT

At A COT near the open wall, in DIM LIGHT FROM AN OVERHEAD BULB 
OUTSIDE, SARAH, JOHN AND TOBY huddle. The DIN from the street makes 
it impossible for others to hear them. TOBY is drawing A MAP.

TOBY
Maintenance shafts run behind all the main 
rooms. Nobody's in those at night. You can 
use them to get around in. Hit the power 
governors first. Kick a surge into their 
computer network and you erase everything 
stored in the memory. Then...over in 
here...that's where the cages are...

On the street outside, a puffing BILL McDERMOTT pushes through the 
unruly crowd, his face showing alarm.

McDERMOTT
The Doc's gone. Diesel and Jack and Spider 
with him. They took the guns... and the 
nitro.

CUT TO:

113	INT. HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON: LUKEY, beside himself, almost to the point of tears.

LUKEY
I coulden stop 'em, boss. No way I coulda 
stop 'em, I sweah. They tie me up and stick 
dis...
(He's waving a pillowcase in his hand, the 
action accentuating his frenzied state.)
...they stick dis in my mouf. You b'lieve 
dis?

JOHN is in the room with SARAH, TOBY, SALLY AND BILL McDERMOTT. This 
is now the entire rebel force. THE FLOORBOARDS TO THE TUNNEL have 
been thrown aside. The weapons are gone.

McDERMOTT
I was in the Cave yesterday workin' 
repairs. Spider was in on clean up. I seen 
her talkin' ta some insiders... well, she 
was scribblin', they was talkin'...mighty 
palsy.

 TOBY
Jesus! They're gonna try to do it! They're 
goin' in! They got somebody to help 'em 
from the inside!

LUKEY
They din' get da pistols. You know dem 
pistols you buddy send in widda raffs.

TOBY
I gotta get Mary out. Tricks. We gotta go 
now! Tonight! Right away!

McDERMOTT
Oh, Lord! (He polishes of what's left in 
his flask and moves to refill it from the 
bottles in Logan's cabinet.)

SALLY
We're not ready.	

JOHN
Well...if ya think about it...we as ready 
as we ever gonna be. How was they carryin' 
the nitro, Lukey?

LUKEY
Oh, me. You ain't gonna b'lieve dis, 
neider. You ain't, I sweah. They put it 
inta Spidah's body.

TOBY
They what?

LUKEY
De Doc. He cut up Spidah here and here and 
here...all ovah. He stick dem tubes in 
dere, like undah da skin...an' den he sews 
'em all up. I sweah. I sweah, sweah, sweah!

114	EXT. THE JUNGLE - NIGHT

JACK AND DIESEL are chopping a path through the undergrowth with 
MACHETES. Behind them DOC LOGAN is walking slowly along with SPIDER, 
guiding her carefully around obstacles. SPIDER is in major pain. 
She's sweating rivers, her fists are clenched, she's biting her lover 
lip so that it bleeds.

LOGAN
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then 
all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you 
could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO 
HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO 
HURT SO!

DIESEL
Quiet!

LOGAN
Oh, yes. Quiet. Yes. We must be quiet.

Suddenly, A ZOMBIE lunges from the underbrush, its FACE BADLY 
DETERIORATED and one of its hands; lost during its human life, 
replaced by A MECHANICAL HOOK. SPIDER stumbles. She holds her breath 
and stiffens all her muscles. Miraculously the nitro vials inside her 
do not explode. LOGAN throws himself quixotically in front of THE 
ZOMBIE.

LOGAN
FALLEN ANGEL! THIS IS THE JUDGEMENT DAY 
WHEN YOU WILL BURN FOR YOUR SINS! THE LORD 
WILL CAST YOU DOWN TO THE LOWER REACHES AND 
YOU SHALL FOREVER KNOW....

THWOK!!! THE ZOMBIE'S STEEL HOOK SINKS DEEPLY INTO LOGAN'S UPPER 
CHEST. The man's eyes reflect no immediate sensation. His speech 
falters but only slightly.

LOGAN
...YOU SHALL FOREVER KNOW THE PAIN... THE 
PAIN...

THE ZOMBIE pulls LOGAN towards its DROOLING, WIDE OPEN MOUTH. It's 
just about to bite when DIESEL CHOPS HIS MACHETE INTO THE CENTER OF 
THE CREATURE'S SKULL. The thing falls, pulling LOGAN, still hooked, 
to the ground with it.

LOGAN
YOU SHALL FOREVER KNOW THE PAIN OF HELL... 
THE PAIN OF HELL.

DIESEL frees the doctor's shoulder from the hook. BLOOD FLOWS FREELY. 
DIESEL grabs a handful of DRESSINGS from LOGAN'S PACK and goes to 
work on the wound.

LOGAN
...the pain of Hell...the pain...the 
pain...

115	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE VENTS - NIGHT

SARAH, SALLY, LUKEY AND McDERMOTT stand by while JOHN AND TOBY swing 
open THE RUSTED GRILLWORK OF AN AIR-VENT in the ground. TOBY is able 
to swing his upper torso completely down inside.

116	INT. THE VENT - NIGHT

TOBY hangs up-side-down in A RUSH OF AIR. He tightens A HOSPITAL MASK 
over his nose and mouth.

TOBY
Okay. Lemme have 'em.

A LEAF BAG is passed in from above. TOBY flags the bag open and BITS 
OF FLOWER AND POLLEN DUST FLY through the tight space, sucked off 
into the duct.

117	INT. THE COMMUNICATION ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON: A GRILL NEAR THE CEILING. BITS OF TOXIC POLLEN and AN 
OCCASIONAL PIECE OF FLOWER blow into the room.

There are SIX TECHNICIANS AND TWO SECURITY GUARDS posted at various 
stations. A RADIO MAN looks up.

RADIO MAN
What's that? Smell it?

TECHNICIAN
Dunno. Must be comin' from outside. Kinda 
nice.

118	INT. ENTRANCE NUMBER SEVEN - NIGHT

There are only TWO GUARDS posted at the sealed entrance. One is 
eating from A CAN OF SPAM. The other is reading an old, dog-eared 
PLAYBOY. A RIFLE BARREL jabs suddenly into "Playboy's" back.

JULIE
Don't move!

It's JULIE GRANT, Mary's disgruntled assistant. A YOUNG MAN, another 
behaviouralist in a WHITE LAB COAT is with her. They both have 
RIFLES.

JULIE
Open the outer door. Move it!

"Playboy" slowly gets up and starts towards A CONTROL PANEL. At the 
last minute, he spins around, grabbing JULIE'S GUN BARREL and pushing 
it away. JULIE'S YOUNG ACCOMPLICE swings his RIFLE BUTT and knocks 
"Playboy" cold. Then he trains the weapon on "Spam man" again.

JULIE moves to the controls, examines them, trips A TOGGLE marked 
"LOCK" and pushes A LARGE GREEN BUTTON.

THE DOOR TO THE OUTSIDE SWINGS OPEN. Beyond is blackness with an 
occasional patch of MOONLIGHT ON JUNGLE GROWTH. JULIE walks slowly, 
carefully toward the opening. Just as she is about to cross the 
threshold into the night, A HUGE FIGURE leaps at her, grabbing her 
RIFLE and enclosing her in a strangle hold. It's DIESEL. Behind him, 
comes JACK, his RIFLE (Sarah's rifle) levelled off at JULIE'S YOUNG 
FRIEND.

"Spam man" makes a break for it down the hall. Reacting nervously, 
too quickly, JACK FIRES. "SPAM MAN" IS HIT SQUARELY IN THE BACK. He 
pitches forward, dead.

THE YOUNG SCIENTIST raises his gun.

YOUNG MAN
Hey! What the hell.....?

JACK FIRES ANOTHER BURST and the ORANGE CIRCLE ON THE YOUNG MAN'S 
CHEST SHOW A DOTTED LINE OF RED. He flies back, a surprised 
expression on his face, and he flops, dead, right on top of the 
"Playboy" guard who is lying near the control booth.

LOGAN
ENOUGH! ENOUGH! ENOUGH! ENOUGH!

THE DOC comes slowly out of the night guiding SPIDER over the 
threshold and into the hall. LOGAN reminds us of a crazy John 
Houston, floating on air in a madman's bubble.

JULIE
What...what is this? Who...?

LOGAN
It's alright, it's alright, my dear. You've 
simply helped us do the Lord's work.

LOGAN'S SHOULDER WOUND IS BLEEDING THROUGH ITS DRESSINGS but the 
doctor, on a holy mission, seems to feel no pain. He guides SPIDER 
into the light and opens her shirt. DIESEL shoves JULIE against a 
wall. JACK covers her with his AUTOMATIC.

LOGAN removes RED-SOAKED DRESSING from SPIDER'S skin. All over her 
bare chest and upper belly we see LONG, EIGHT-INCH SCARS, HASTILY 
STITCHED WITH SUTURE SHOWING. Beneath each is A CIGAR-SHAPED BULGE 
where a vial of nitro has been implanted. The woman stands on 
crumbling legs, her arms open outward, a grotesque lampoon of a 
stigmatic.

JULIE
What...what have you done to her?

LOGAN
God forgive us. Forgive us the pain we 
inflict as surgeons. We'll be in Heaven, 
child. Soon. We'll be with Him in Heaven.

SPIDER
Na...na...ak...aaaaaaaaaa...

SPIDER is trying to signal something. She has seen that "PLAYBOY" is 
crawling into the control booth. LOGAN follows her alarmed gaze.

LOGAN
NO YOU DON'T I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT! I 
CAN'T!

LOGAN charges toward the booth. THE GUARD is half-in-half-out of the 
glass chamber, his hands reaching for the control panel inside. LOGAN 
starts to kick him, again and again.

JACK
Outa the way, Doc! Outa the way!

There's vengeance on LOGAN'S face. He's kicking THE GUARD brutally, 
but that doesn't stop the man from reaching the controls. He hits A 
RED ALARM BUTTON. THE PANEL BUZZES AND COLOURED LIGHTS BLINK. THE 
DOOR to the jungle starts to swing closed. DIESEL dives at it but 
can't stop the steel slab. It slams with A LOUD THUNNNNNG!

JACK swings into another position to get a clear shot and he FIRES A 
LONG BURST into the control booth. "PLAYBOY" IS STRUCK BY SEVERAL 
ROUNDS. He bounces around in the booth and collapses to the floor, 
dead.

LOGAN, his SHOULDER WOUND POURING BLOOD, aggravated by his physical 
exertion, falls to floor himself, in a faint.

JACK
Shit!

DIESEL
Keep the woman covered.

JACK levels off on JULIE again. DIESEL moves over to SPIDER. Pulling 
FRESH DRESSING from LOGAN'S BAG, the big man begins to pack them onto 
SPIDER'S BLEEDING CHEST.

119	INT. THE COMMUNICATION ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON: A BLINKING RECTANGLE OF RED LIGHT. Written on its face is: 
ALARM - GATE 7. A BELL RINGS LOUDLY in the room. THE SHOT WIDENS and 
we see FIVE MEN, all slumped, unconscious, none able to react to the 
alarm.

ONE OF THE SECURITY GUARDS has made it to THE EXIT. He manages to 
push the door open, but then he falls in a heap.

A RADIO MAN staggers into A WEBBING OF WIRES, then he too falls.

THE OTHER SECURITY GUARD inches his hand towards A LEVER WITH A 
PROTECTIVE COVER. He flips the cover up, then collapses. The falling 
action causes his fingers to trip the lever. A HUGE KLAXON SOUNDS. A 
BLINKING RECTANGLE, huge over the doors, reads: GENERAL ALERT!

120	INT. GASPARILLA'S GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

The usual scene here, GASPARILLA AND HIS COURTESANS entertaining THE 
COUNCILMEN AND THEIR LADIES. THE KLAXON SOUNDS over THE LOUD ROCK 
MUSIC. MARY HENRIED, a prisoner for the evening again, hears THE 
SOUND. Her eyes widen. She looks over at RHODES, who jumps to his 
feet. The party gradually goes silent.

RHODES
Don't be alarmed. We're impregnable. Stay 
where you are. Nothing will happen to any 
of you. You're safe here. Men.

This last word to A SMALL UNIT OF FOUR TROOPERS standing guard at THE 
EXIT. RHODES goes steaming through the doors. TWO OF THE TROOPERS 
FOLLOW, THE OTHER TWO unsling their RIFLES and take up posts just 
outside in the corridor. THE STEEL DOOR SLIDES SHUT locking 
GASPARILLA AND HIS COURT inside the gymnasium...MARY HENRIED with 
them.

GASPARILLA
Well, c'mon, ladies and gents. Who says we 
gotta let our evenin' get spoiled? Simon 
sez...GET DOWN!!!

MOST OF THE GUESTS are willing to let the party get back to full 
swing. GASPARILLA grabs A TOPLESS COURTESAN and rocks his fat belly 
around in an attempted dance. MARY seems to be the only one concerned 
about the alarm.

121	EXT. THE JUNGLE - NIGHT

Even outside THE KLAXON CAN BE HEARD. TOBY AND THE REBELS stop in 
their tracks.

TOBY
That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta 
got in!

JOHN
What you wanna do?

TOBY
Come on!

THE GROUP moves out urgently.

122	INT. ENTRANCE NUMBER TWO - NIGHT

A CIRCULAR LIGHT BLINKS GREEN with A BUZZING SOUND. THE TWO INSIDE 
GUARDS punch up A VIDEO MONITOR. The screen shows TOBY TYLER AND 
LUKEY holding PISTOLS on SALLY AND BILL McDERMOTT.

GUARD
(into intercom) What's goin' on?

TOBY (filter)
(on video) LET US IN. THERE'S BEEN A 
REVOLT...AT STALAG SEVENTEEN...THERE'S 
REBELS CRAWLIN' EVERYWHERE!

GUARD #2
I know him. That's Tyler.

TOBY (filter)
(on video) FER CHRISSAKE! LEMME IN, DAMMIT! 
LEMME IN!

THE FIRST GUARD HITS A BUTTON AND THE BIG STEEL ENTRANCE DOOR SWINGS 
OPEN. THE REBELS storm in like an ocean wave taking the hapless 
GUARDS completely by surprise. They knock them unconscious and take 
their WEAPONS. TOBY pushes A BUTTON which causes the outer door to 
swing shut, then he leads the band down the corridor.

They go through A DOOR about a hundred yards from the entrance.

123	INT. MAINTENANCE SHAFT - NIGHT

This is one of the WORK CORRIDORS that TOBY mentioned earlier. THE 
REBELS run, single-file, deep into the Cave.

124	INT. ENTRANCE SEVEN - NIGHT

JULIE GRANT has been ROPE-TIED to an eyelet in the wall. DIESEL sets 
down A PISTOL AND A BOX OF AMMO beside DOC LOGAN who is sitting on 
the floor beside the control booth. He's having trouble catching his 
breath. His WOUND has turned his ENTIRE FRONT RED.

DIESEL
You'd hold us back. We have to go on.

LOGAN
Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on.

SPIDER, her shirt buttoned again over her new dressings, is carefully 
signing something. DIESEL reads her fingers.

DIESEL
Maps. Yes. She was supposed to bring us 
maps.

JACK steps over to JULIE. He frisks her pockets and finds TWO HAND-
DRAWN MAPS showing complete layouts of the Cave.

DIESEL
Alright. Let's go.

They move out, DIESEL supporting SPIDER, JACK with his RIFLE ready.

125	INT. A SUPPLY CLOSET - NIGHT

TOBY breaks open A CARTON and pulls GAS MASKS out. He passes them 
back to BILL McDERMOTT AND SARAH.

126	INT. THE COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT

THE REBELS, all wearing GAS MASKS, burst into the room. TOBY moves 
right toward AN INTERCOM. He punches in a code and waits while the 
INTERCOM BUZZES.

TOBY
Come on, Mary. Answer. ANSWER!

Nothing. Toby punches up another code while the others drag THE 
UNCONSCIOUS GUARD out of the doorway, letting the doors shut behind 
them. A VOICE comes over the speakers.

TRICKS (o.s. - filter)
Yeah.

TOBY
Tricks, it's Tyler. We're inside.

TRICKS (o.s. - filter)
What? Was that you that set off the alarms?

TOBY
No. There's some loonies from outside. 
They're gonna try to blow the powder 
magazine.

TRICKS (o.s. - filter)
Where are you? What's the plan?

TOBY
Find Mary. If you can get help do it. We're 
gonna hit the power station and haul-ass 
outa here. We'll be at exit five...that's 
exit five in exactly ten minutes.

TRICKS (o.s. - filter)
I think I can get a couple guys.

TOBY
And Mary! You gotta find Mary!

TRICKS (o.s. - filter)
I'll try, Tob. I'm gone.

TRICKS clicks off. TOBY levels his AUTOMATIC at the RADIO CONSOLE and 
FIRES. SPARKS FLY, CHUNKS OF WOOD AND METAL SHOOT OFF IN EVERY 
DIRECTION.

McDERMOTT
HOLD ON! HOLD ON! Yer wastin' yer 
ammunition. Hit 'er in here...then around 
back in the circuit boards.

TOBY levels off again, this time at the "kill-zones". BULLETS FLY. 
MORE SPARKS DANCE as THE UNIT BREAKS APART.

McDERMOTT
(shouting) AND OVER HERE. THE ALARM 
SYSTEMS. THESE CENTRAL PANELS HERE. THESE 
CIRCUITS.

SARAH AND SALLY step up and start BLASTING. A PROFUSION OF SPARKS 
this time as THE ALARM SYSTEMS SEEM TO EXPLODE.

Suddenly A COLLECTION OF RED LIGHTS START BLINKING URGENTLY. A BELL 
SOUNDS. THE LARGE RECTANGLE OVER THE EXIT IS FLASHING A NEW WORD: 
EVACUATE! EVACUATE! EVACUATE!

McDERMOTT
Jesus, Mary and Joseph! (he slugs from his 
flask) By blowin' the alarm panels...we 
signalled an Evac!

127	INT. CORRIDORS IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

MONTAGE: A LOUD BUZZING IS HEARD as DOORS OPEN everywhere, some 
sliding, some swinging back, some rolling into the walls. TROOPERS 
caught trotting through halls are taken by surprise. CITIZENS spill 
out of apartment doors that have opened electronically.

128	INT. ENTRANCE SEVEN - NIGHT

THE DOOR TO THE JUNGLE SWING OPEN. JULIE GRANT looks over at DOC 
LOGAN. The madman struggles to his feet. Supporting himself against 
the wall of the control booth, he reaches inside and starts pushing 
buttons.

JULIE
Those buttons won't work! The evacuation 
command overrides them.

JULIE looks through the open entranceway. Barely visible in the DIM 
BLUE MOONLIGHT are the hulking shapes of TWO...NO THREE ZOMBIES, 
approaching the open hatch.

129	INT. THE COMMUNICATION ROOM - NIGHT

McDERMOTT is explaining to the others.

McDERMOTT
All the doors in the Cave have been sprung 
open...all the ones that work on electric. 
It's so nobody'll get trapped anywhere.

130	INT. ENTRANCE SEVEN - NIGHT

LOGAN stares dumbly, without comprehending, at THE ZOMBIES which are 
lurching forward out of the night.

JULIE
CUT ME LOOSE! PLEASE! CUT ME LOOSE!

131	INT. THE DORMITORY - NIGHT

THE LATCHES ON THE CELL DOOR CLICK. With BUZZING, MOTOR NOISES, THE 
DOORS OPEN OUTWARD. THE ARMY OF RED COATS marches out into the hall. 
We might recognise TONTO, BLUTO, SAMSON....we certainly recognise big 
Bub.

132	INT. A HOLDING PEN IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

We see A LARGE PEN, its GATE SWINGING OPEN. From inside, MOANING 
HUNGRILY, come FORTY OR FIFTY ZOMBIES, BLUE COATS AND WHITE.

GUARDS outside the pen start to panic. They OPEN FIRE. A FEW ZOMBIES 
ARE HIT but there are too many, way too many. THE GUARDS turn tail 
and retreat off into the Cave.

THE ZOMBIES are out! Free to find their own suppers!

133	INT. THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

THE DOORS have opened here, too. THE CROWD, having heard the 
EVACUATION SIGNAL, is panicking. MANY are running out past THE GUARDS 
and into the hallway. GASPARILLA is trying to reinstate calm.

GASPARILLA
STAY HERE! STAY PUT! WE'LL BE ALRIGHT! 
WE'RE SAFE HERE! JUST AS SAFE AS ANYWHERE 
'TIL WE FIND OUT WHAT'S GOIN' ON!

MARY HENRIED takes advantage of the confusion. She slips out behind 
TWO COUNCILMEN AND THEIR LADY-FRIENDS.

134	INT. NURSERY CORRIDOR - NIGHT

THE HALLWAY is in chaos. TROOPERS run by, CRAZED CITIZENS flee in 
both directions. MARY HENRIED is stopped by A NURSE standing in AN 
OPEN DOORWAY.

NURSE
What is it? What's happening?

MARY
It's an evacuation signal. The radios are 
out. People are panicking.

NURSE
What should we do?

MARY looks past THE NURSE into A ROOM where A GROUP OF CHILDREN, a 
dozen or so, ranging from twelve-years-old down to infancy, are 
huddled. Some are crying.

MARY
God. I, er...I dunno what to say. It could 
be a real evacuation or it could just be a 
glitch in the system. Wait here for now. 
I'll...I'll make sure you get the word what 
to do, okay?

NURSE
Please...hurry...

MARY takes off down the hall.

135	INT. ENTRANCE SEVEN - NIGHT

CLOSE ON: JULIE GRANT'S FACE, screaming, in agony, on the brink of 
insanity. THE ZOMBIES have reached her. They're started to pull at 
her arms, her legs. ONE BITES HER HAND, ANOTHER HER ARM, ANOTHER HER 
CALF.

DOC LOGAN is watching from the control booth, all the while fiddling 
with BUTTONS, DIALS, LEVERS.

LOGAN
We'll be in Heaven soon. We'll all be in 
Heaven soon.
(Julie's screams penetrate the fog in his 
brain. He frowns.)
Pain. God forgive the pain inflicted by 
surgeons. We must atone. We must atone for 
our sins.

His eye is attracted to A LARGE LEVER seemingly separate from 
everything else. It's marked: SIREN. He pulls it.

LOGAN
We must...atone. We must.

136	EXT. THE SIREN HORN - NIGHT

Slowly, THE THROATY WAIL RISES and calls out over the jungle. It's 
the "Feeding Signal" we heard earlier.

137	EXT. THE JUNGLE - NIGHT

MONTAGE: as everywhere in the jungle ZOMBIES turn toward the call of 
THE SIREN. They start to walk...toward the SOUND, toward the place 
where there is food.

138	INT. ENTRANCE SEVEN - NIGHT

JULIE is still screaming wildly. THE ZOMBIES ARE TEARING HER APART, 
LITERALLY.

DOC LOGAN inadvertently kicks THE PISTOL left by DIESEL and is 
skitters across the floor. He flops down on his knees.

LOGAN
WE WILL ATONE. WE WILL BE THE 
SACRIFICE...THE COMMUNION...WE OFFER 
OURSELVES UP...OUR SOUL...AND OUR BODIES...

JULIE GRANT finally loses consciousness. MANY MORE ZOMBIES are 
pressing in through the entrance now. They reach LOGAN and start to 
tear at him. Something clicks in his brain and he realises what's 
happening. He starts to scream. His hands find THE PISTOL on the 
floor.

ONE ZOMBIE TAKES A BITE OUT OF HIS LEFT ARM. He shrieks and brings up 
THE PISTOL, FIRING. THE FIRST SHOT RIPS OPEN THE CREATURE'S SKULL. 
The next FIVE SHOTS are wasted, FIRED WILDLY. The GUN CLICKS emptily 
as THE ZOMBIES engulf him, TEARING, BITING, EATING HIM ALIVE.

MORE ZOMBIES come out of the jungle...a lot more...called by the 
SIREN. In waves they enter the Cave looking for food.

139	INT. A CORRIDOR IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

TRICKS is running through the hall with TWO BUDDIES. MARY HENRIED 
jumps out of the crowd.

MARY
Tricks! What's going on?

TRICKS
Toby's in the Cave. We're gonna make our 
move. There's rebels out to blow the powder 
magazine. Come on. Come with us.

MARY
Where are you goin' out?

TRICKS
Exit five.

MARY
See ya there.

She turns away and starts back in the direction she came from. TRICKS 
calls after her.

TRICKS
SEVEN MINUTES, MARY. EXACTLY SEVEN MINUTES!

140	INT. THE MAIN CHAMBER OF THE CAVE - NIGHT

RHODES AND EIGHT TROOPERS turn a corridor and there, before them, is 
a sight out of Dracula's tomb. Moving through the lava-stone arches, 
between the giant earthen pillars, is THE ARMY OF BLUE AND WHITE 
ZOMBIES. RHODES and his men can't possibly fight them, there are too 
many. RHODES spots A DOOR WITH A CAGED RED LIGHT OVERHEAD. They can 
get to it by slicing through only A FEW OF THE ADVANCING GHOULS.

RHODES
THIS WAY. OVER HERE! SHOOT! SHOOT THEM! 
SHOOT TO KILL! IN THE HEAD!

Their RIFLES BLAZE as they drive through the edge of THE ZOMBIE 
HORDE. SEVERAL OF THE CREATURES GO DOWN, THEIR HEADS BLASTED OPEN BY 
RAPID-FIRE ROUNDS.

ONE grabs RHODES by the sleeve of his jacket. The captain turns on 
his heels and stares at the thing with outraged disbelief. He raises 
his MAGNUM and pumps TWO QUICK SHELLS INTO THE CREATURE'S BRAIN.

THE PLATOON finally reaches the door. RHODES holds it open while his 
MEN run inside. He holsters his PISTOL and unslings his AUTOMATIC. 
THE ZOMBIES press towards him. He selects A FEW OF THE CLOSEST ONES, 
aims, and FIRES, with a look of enjoyment on his face. For a moment 
he resembles Doc Logan, madness bristling inside him.

THE ZOMBIES fall, THEIR HEADS SHATTERED, ONE OF RHODES' MEN calls 
from inside the doorway.

TROOPER
Captain...CAPTAIN!

RHODES FIRES ANOTHER QUICK BURST, then he turns and moves through the 
doorway.

141	INT. A CORRIDOR IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

SPIDER is walking along, careful to avoid jolts, support-under her 
arms by the giant DIESEL. JACK walks with them, his nervousness 
irritated by the need to move slowly. CITIZENS run past, none of them 
paying attention to the desperadoes.

Suddenly they encounter A TROOP OF SOLDIER who come trotting around a 
corner. Nervous JACK OPENS FIRE. TWO SOLDIER GO DOWN. A gunfight 
erupts as the rest of the TROOPS scatter in the hallway, CIVILIANS 
are caught in the crossfire. TWO ARE HIT.

DIESEL manages to steer SPIDER around a corner to safety. JACK keeps 
FIRING but he's trapped in A HAIL OF BULLETS. A RED LINE CUTS ACROSS 
HIS CHEST and he flies back, dead, his GUN STILL FIRING.

Out of the Troopers' sight, DIESEL checks his map and moves into A 
DOORWAY, one of several on the area, guiding SPIDER through beside 
him.

142	INT. ANOTHER MAINTENANCE SHAFT - NIGHT

They find themselves in one of those work corridors. The giant man 
shoulder his RIFLE and gently lifts SPIDER into his arms. He moves, 
as smoothly as he can, down the shaft and around a bend.

143	INT. A CORRIDOR IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

TOBY leads JOHN AND THE REBELS out into A HALLWAY. They break across 
to an opposite door. Before they can escape, A TROOP OF SOLDIERS 
appears. A GUNFIGHT ENSUES.

TWO SOLDIERS GO DOWN. JOHN IS WOUNDED IN THE SHOULDER but he stays on 
his feet. THE SOLDIERS have them divided in the two opposite 
doorways.

Suddenly, TRICKS AND HIS BUDDIES come charging around a corner. THEY 
OPEN FIRE. THE SOLDIERS RESPOND. TWO MORE SOLDIERS GO DOWN. ONE OF 
TRICKS' MEN IS KILLED. TRICKS himself IS WOUNDED BADLY IN THE 
STOMACH.

Caught in a crossfire, THE LAST FOUR TROOPERS throw down their guns. 
They flee wildly down the corridor. THE REBELS pick up and file 
through one of the doors. TOBY rushes to aid his BADLY WOUNDED BUDDY.

TOBY
Tricks...Jesus...

TRICKS
I'm alright. Let's go.

They follow after the others.

144	INT. THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

A SCREAM GOES UP! A WOMAN near the exit has spotted something 
terrifying in the hallway. THE GUARDS panic. ONE OF THEM OPENS FIRE.

145	INT. THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

A MASS OF ZOMBIES COME SHUFFLING DOWN THE CORRIDOR. Their VOICES ECHO 
IN GROTESQUE HARMONY, the song of the living dead that we've heard 
before.

146	INT. THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

THE GUARDS are trying to close the entrance doors manually. The big 
slabs won't budge. Suddenly GASPARILLA appears. Drawing A PISTOL from 
A HOLSTER he wears, without warning he SHOOTS ONE OF THE GUARDS. THE 
OTHER GUARD flees.

GASPARILLA falls onto the dead man and rips off his ORANGE-CIRCLE 
VEST. THE ZOMBIES are pressing in now, into the gymnasium. GASPARILLA 
AND SEVERAL REMAINING PARTY-GOERS (none with vests) are trapped.

147	INT. A CORRIDOR NEAR THE DORMITORY - NIGHT

MARY is running along with THE NURSE AND THE CHILDREN. Suddenly, from 
out of a doorway, comes CAPTAIN RHODES WITH HIS STORM TROOPERS.

RHODES
HENRIED! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

Without answering, MARY leads her band through A MANUAL DOOR that 
leads to the Dormitory.

RHODES
STOP THEM! SHOOT!

SOLDIER
The...the children, sir.

RHODES
After them then! I want them stopped! That 
woman is dangerous!

148	INT. THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE DORMITORY - NIGHT

MARY AND HER REFUGEES are stopped in their tracks by BUB AND HIS 
CADRE OF RED COATS. THE NURSE screams and tries to back away. THE 
CHILDREN cling to her, petrified, shrieking, starting to cry.

BUB lumbers up to MARY and...salutes. MARY returns the formality.

MARY
It's alright. I don't think they'll hurt 
us. Try to stay calm.

149	INT. THE OUTER CORRIDOR - NIGHT

THE MANUAL DOOR has been locked from inside.

RHODES
SHOOT IT OPEN!

THE SOLDIERS follow orders, TWO OF THEM FIRING AT THE LOCK.

150	INT. THE FIRING RANGE - NIGHT

MARY is at A CABINET pulling out PISTOLS AND RIFLES, passing the 
weapons around to TONTO, BLUTO, SAMSON. BUB is strapping on his TWO-
GUN HOLSTER SET all by himself, fumbling a little, but succeeding.

151	INT. THE CORRIDOR WITH RHODES - NIGHT

RHODES' MEN kick open the door and charge into the Dormitory 
corridor.

152	INT. THE FIRING RANGE - NIGHT

THE NURSE slams ANOTHER MANUAL DOOR, locking and bolting it.

NURSE
They're coming! They're coming!

She hurries along the caged alley behind the firing stalls guiding 
THE CHILDREN to an opposite exit.

BLAM! BLAM! MARY IS FIRING at AN ORANGE CIRCLE VEST on one of the cut 
out target figures in the range. THE RED COATS are watching with 
curiosity, cocking their heads.

MARY moves to fire again but BLUTO grabs her hand.

MARY
NO...BLUTO...I'M TRYING TO...

The dumb creature keeps his grip. MARY has to appease to him. She 
grasps his hand and shakes vigorously. When he finally lets go, she 
aims her PISTOL again and FIRES AT THE VEST SEVERAL MORE TIMES.

MARY
Look. It's good to shoot the circles. Good. 
Good.

THE ZOMBIES are confused. Exasperated, MARY tears off her own vest 
and tosses it down the alley. THE RED COATS look befuddled, and a 
little angry. MARY FIRES at the vest she threw down. TWO BULLETS HIT 
IT before MARY'S PISTOL CLICKS...empty.

There's A POUNDING AT THE DOOR. It's RHODES AND HIS TROOP.

Suddenly BUB steps into position. WHAP! One of his famous quick 
draws! BLAM!!! HE FIRES. THE VEST ON THE FLOOR, MARY'S VEST, IS HIT. 
BUB FIRES AGAIN, the other gun this time. THE VEST ON THE TARGET IS 
HIT squarely in the center of its orange circle.

TONTO now turns. He lifts his PISTOL and FIRES. THE VEST ON THE 
TARGET IS HIT AGAIN, off center, but hit.

MARY
THAT'S IT! THAT'S IT!

Suddenly THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE RANGE FLIES OPEN. THREE OF 
RHODES' MEN RUSH IN, wearing, of course, orange circles. THE RED 
COATS OPEN FIRE. THE TROOPERS ARE CUT TO RIBBONS. Others outside the 
door duck back behind the walls.

THE ZOMBIES lumber toward the open doorway, STILL FIRING AS THEY GO. 
MARY is backing away through the opposite exit. BUB sees her leaving. 
He calls to her with a deep, pleading moan. MARY stops and looks at 
him sadly. He shoots off a military salute. MARY salutes him back. 
There are tears in her eyes.

She turns and hurries off. BUB joins his fellows in pursuit of 
Rhodes' and his men.

153	INT. THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

A WOMAN'S FACE IS FULL SCREEN. She is screaming in agony as she is 
TORN APART BY ZOMBIES. The creatures have invaded the gymnasium. 
They're CLAWING AT THE FAT-CAT COUNCILLORS, MAULING THEIR WOMEN.

GASPARILLA AND TWO OTHER MEN are rolling around crazily, bumping into 
exercise machines, knocking over wine bottles and tables full of 
hors-d'oeuvres. The single vest they are fighting over rips apart 
into two pieces, its orange circle severed into two useless halves.

GASPARILLA backs across the floor, his blubber bouncing. He has a 
tattered piece of the vest clutched in his hands. He tries to spread 
it out on his chest but it's too late... and THE ZOMBIES are too 
hungry...much too hungry.

MONTAGE: as ALL OVER THE ROOM THEY STRIKE. This is it, gore fans. The 
gross finale. The intestine-tugger. THE ZOMBIES GET THEIR SUPPER. 
THEY FEAST AMONG THE PILLOWS, like Romans at an orgy. MUSIC still 
plays over the gymnasium speakers, rock-a-billy in a gleeful tempo.

GASPARILLA has retreated into his tanning-coffin but a pudgy arm and 
a leg are dangling outside. ZOMBIES CHEW HUNGRILY on the juicy 
morsels. From inside the coffin, where ultraviolet glows brightly, 
come the piercing, agonised screams of the fat General.

154	INT. THE MAIN CHAMBER OF THE CAVE - NIGHT

DIESEL guides SPIDER through the huge earthen archways. ZOMBIES here 
are scattered now, but they provide for delays. DIESEL FIRES and 
ZOMBIES ARE HIT but few are hit fatally. DIESEL'S free arm can't fire 
accurately while he's trying to support the walking bomb beside him.

DIESEL stops to check his map. A ZOMBIE looms up behind him and takes 
a HUGE BITE OUT OF HIS SHOULDER. DIESEL screams. He lets go of SPIDER 
who stumbles away from him, almost falling but saving herself. Her 
eyes are bugging with pain.

DIESEL FIRES POINT BLANK AT THE ZOMBIE, BLOWING ITS HEAD TO BITS. 
MORE CREATURES are pressing in close. DIESEL bats at one, kicks 
another, punches a third. Then he rushes to SPIDER'S side and scoops 
her into his arms again. Wincing in pain from THE BLEEDING WOUND IN 
HIS SHOULDER he manages to move out of immediate danger.

THE ZOMBIES lumber after the two, groaning in chorus as they walk.

155	INT. THE CORRIDOR AT EXIT FIVE - NIGHT

MARY, THE NURSE AND THE CHILDREN come charging down the hall. TOBY, 
SARAH, AND JOHN are waiting for them near the open door which leads 
out into the jungle. TOBY AND MARY rush into each other's arms and 
they flee, with the others, out into the night.

156	INT. A CORRIDOR NEAR THE DORMITORY - NIGHT

RHODES AND HIS MEN rush into another corridor where they are met by a 
crowd of DROOLING ZOMBIES. THE MEN OPEN FIRE but the ZOMBIES are too 
close in. They get the upper hand.

RHODES FIRES HIS MAGNUM, his eyes insane, his face boiling red with 
disbelief. After TWO SHOTS BLAST OPEN THE HEADS OF THE CLOSEST 
ZOMBIES, THE MAGNUM just CLICK-CLICK-CLICKS! RHODES is out of lead.

He's grabbed by ONE ZOMBIE, then ANOTHER. He fights to free himself 
but HE'S BITTEN ONCE...TWICE...

BLEEDING, he fights on. He struggles to a doorway and pushes through.

157	INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR - NIGHT

RHODES comes face-to-face with...you guessed it...big BUB. THE ZOMBIE 
faces off, ready to draw those SIX-GUNS that hang at his hips. RHODES 
turns and runs.

WHAP! BUB slaps leather. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! RHODES turns a corner but 
ONE BULLET BITES HIM ON THE BACK OF HIS SHOULDER. Terrified, fighting 
pain, he staggers on with the gun-totin' RED COAT following behind.

158	EXT. THE JUNGLE - NIGHT

THE REBELS lead MARY, THE NURSE AND THE CHILDREN through the 
underneath. TRICKS is bleeding badly. TOBY helps him along. Suddenly, 
as they break into a clearing, SARAH stops cold. There on the ground, 
lying where we last saw it, is THE CORPSE OF MIGUEL.

JOHN
What is it?

SARAH
It's...he was...one who came to the island 
with me.

TOBY
Come on. No time.

SARAH
He was killed...five days ago.

MARY
Maybe...maybe he wasn't dead. Are you sure 
he was dead when you left him?

SARAH
Look at him. A hundred bullets. You tell 
me. Was he dead?

There are tears in SARAH'S eyes.

SARAH
Five days...and he hasn't...risen. He 
hasn't risen.

TOBY
Come on. There's no time. There's no time 
to lose.

THE GROUP pushes ahead. SARAH kneels. She blesses herself and makes 
the sign of the cross over the corpse. Then she stands to see that 
JOHN is waiting for her. He holds out his hand, she takes it and 
follows the others.

159	EXT. THE BACKWATER - NIGHT

THE SOLDIERS aboard THE FISHING BOAT hear NOISES coming from the 
surrounding jungle.

SOLDIER
WHO IS IT? WHO'S OUT THERE?

JOHN (o.s.)
WE WANT THE BOAT! DROP YER GUNS OR WE'LL 
BLAST YOU!

THE SOLDIERS hesitate, looking around at the dark jungle.

TOBY (o.s.)
WE GOT YOU SURROUNDED!

A SUDDEN BURST OF AUTOMATIC FIRE LIGHTS UP THE BLACK FOLIAGE. THE 
SOLDIERS react, flinging their WEAPONS over the side into the water.

THE REFUGEES spill out of the undergrowth and scramble over to the 
boat, lifting THE CHILDREN and THE WOUNDED TRICKS on board carefully.

JOHN pauses to look back into the jungle.

JOHN
Damn you, island. Damn you ta Hell and 
worse!

McDERMOTT
We ain't outa here yet. Get yer ass movin' 
ya dumb bastard.

McDERMOTT tries to slug from his flask, finds it empty. With a shrug 
he tosses the thing into the backwater. THE ENGINE STARTS as JOHN 
climbs aboard, SARAH AND TOBY giving him their hands.

160	INT. THE MAIN CHAMBER WITH DIESEL AND SPIDER - NIGHT

161	INT. THE LABORATORY AREA WITH RHODES AND BUB - NIGHT

(These two sequences will be intercut for parallel action)

ZOMBIES are crawling all over DIESEL now. He fights them off 
valiantly but his super strength is waning. HE IS BITTEN AGAIN AND 
AGAIN but he tries to keep himself between THE CLUTCHING CREATURES 
AND THE LITTLE DEAF MUTE who is stumbling along ahead. She's getting 
very close to a huge SET OF CONCRETE SLABS...THE DOORS TO THE POWDER 
MAGAZINE.

Meanwhile RHODES approaches another corner in the hallway near the 
Conditioning Room. BUB follows, his boot heels CLICKING the way 
RHODES' own heels once clicked.

RHODES dives for the corner. BUB slaps leather and FIRES OFF ALL 
TWELVE. RHODES rolls on the ground crazily. HE'S HIT SEVERAL 
TIMES...but he's still alive. He pulls himself, in agony, out of 
range. Calmly, BUB dumps out his spent shells and starts to reload.

IN THE MAIN CHAMBER, DIESEL IS OVERCOME, DRAGGED DOWN BY A MOB OF 
ZOMBIES. THEY START TO TEAR HIM APART BIT BY BIT.

SPIDER walks on alone. She is just a few feet from the POWDER 
MAGAZINE now. A ZOMBIE grabs her from behind but just gets a handful 
of shirt. SPIDER reaches forward but the creature holds her back. Her 
SHIRT IS RUNNING RIVERS OF BLOOD NOW where the vials are implanted 
underneath.

RHODES crashes through a doorway into THE CONDITIONING ROOM. He 
realises, too late, that there's no exit. BUB'S BOOTHEELS are getting 
LOUDER. RHODES crawls around behind THE TABLES FULL OF TESTING 
EQUIPMENT, WOODEN SHAPES, FLASH CARDS SCATTER. Over near the LARGE 
COLOURED SYMBOLS which are mounted on the wall there's A WEAPONS 
CABINET. RHODES grabs a chair and smashes open the glass.

BUB steps into the open doorway, still reloading his PISTOLS. He 
stands there, a golem, his fingers slowly, calmly working. He drops a 
shell or two but soon the barrels are filled with fresh loads.

RHODES reaches in through the broken glass and pulls out AN 
AUTOMATIC.

BUB slaps his PISTOLS back into their HOLSTERS and face off.

RHODES lifts the AUTOMATIC...aims...

BUB DRAWS! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! 
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! EACH ONE OF THE TWELVE BULLETS HITS RHODES 
SOMEWHERE, many of them in the "kill-zones". He screams when the 
first few rounds hit, but his screaming stops about halfway through 
the barrage. That's when he dies. His leg bones support his corpse 
long enough for the last six bullets to reach him. Then, as THE SOUND 
OF BUB'S GUN ECHOES AWAY down the corridors, RHODES BODY slides down 
the wall and crumples to the floor in a heap, leaving MUCH OF HIS 
BLOOD on the ORANGE CIRCLE that's mounted behind him.

IN THE MAIN CHAMBER, A ZOMBIE TAKES A BITE OUT OF SPIDER'S SHOULDER. 
IT PULLS OUT A BIG CHUNK OF FLESH, AND WITH IT, STUCK IN THE 
CREATURE'S TEETH, COMES ONE OF THE NITRO VIALS.

SEVERAL ZOMBIES are pulling at the woman. She is still reaching for 
the POWDER MAGAZINE DOORS but the ghouls are pulling her away.

THE CREATURE WITH THE TEST TUBE IN ITS MOUTH pulls the bothersome 
thing out from between its teeth. It studies the vial curiously for a 
moment, then it tosses it angrily towards SPIDER, toward THE MAGAZINE 
DOOR...

KA-BLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!

162	INT. THE MAIN CHAMBER (EFX) - NIGHT

A HALLACIOUS FIREBALL RIPS THROUGH THE CAVE.

163	INT. THE CONDITIONING ROOM - NIGHT

BUB stands in the open doorway staring at RHODES' still twitching 
corpse. He slaps his SIX-GUNS back into their leather HOLSTERS, then 
he shoots off one of those military salutes of his....just as the 
walls fall in on him.

164	EXT. THE FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

THE REFUGEES stare toward the island as A HUGE BOOOOOM FILLS THE 
NIGHT. Some of the YOUNGER CHILDREN start to cheer as though watching 
fireworks on the Fourth of July.

165	EXT. GASPARILLA'S ISLAND (THEIR P.O.V.) - NIGHT

THE TOP BLOWS OFF THE ISLAND, just as TOBY predicted is would. It's 
as though an enormous underground volcano is exploding. It's a 
frightening...yet beautiful sight.

166	EXT. THE FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

TOBY looks back over his shoulder. THE NURSE is kneeling beside the 
body of TRICKS. He's dead. The woman pulls a blanket up over his 
head. TOBY steps forward, his PISTOL drawn. He pulls the hammer back 
and aims at TRICKS' head.

SARAH
No. Don't. Wait. Wait to see if... wait 
until it's necessary.

TOBY turns and looks at MARY. She nods. He releases the PISTOL HAMMER 
without firing.

DISSOLVE TO:

167	EXT. ANOTHER ISLAND (WIDE EST.) - MORNING

Gorgeous, a paradise. BIRDSONG fills the air.

168	EXT. A RIVER ON THE ISLAND - MORNING

THE REGUGEES are all gathered. THE CHILDREN walk, one by one, through 
the shallows as JOHN baptises them. SARAH, MARY AND THE NURSE carry 
the infants. When the infant in SARAH'S arms has been touched by 
JOHN'S hand, SARAH doesn't move on. Instead, she looks up into the 
big man's warm eyes.

SARAH
Me too...please.

JOHN gently cups a handful of river water and pours it on the woman's 
forehead.

THE OTHER ADULTS, led by LUKEY, file into the river, all lining up 
before the baptist, waiting their turns to be blessed into this tiny 
new society.

169	EXT. A BEACH ON THE ISLAND - MORNING

TRICKS' BODY lies covered in the sand. THE REFUGEES are gathered 
again, heads bowed, while JOHN speaks.

JOHN
Satan ain't sent this man back. Not yet, 
anyway. So we all hopin' that maybe he's up 
there with you, Lord. This might be the 
first decent soul we been able ta offer ya 
in quite a few years. That's a fact. We 
just gonna... pray, Lord. We gonna pray 
that what seems ta be happenin' here...is 
really happenin'...and I'm gonna take the 
chance and speak these words that I ain't 
been able ta speak for so long...

May he rest in peace

THE OTHERS
Amen.

170	EXT. THE BEACH - NIGHT

THE CORPSE lies in the MOONLIGHT. NIGHT CRITTERS SCREECH AND BURBLE 
in the jungle behind the sand. It's an eerie scene.

SARAH is sitting up, her RIFLE ready in her lap, watching the body. 
JOHN steps in behind and she startles.

JOHN
Just me. I'll take the next shift.

He settles easily down beside the woman. The two stare together at 
the shrouded corpse.

SARAH
How long do we have to watch him?

JOHN
Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta 
dust and blows away on the wind.

THE BODY lies silent, rigid under the KHAKI ARMY BLANKET that rises 
and falls, rises and falls with the Gulf breeze.

Suddenly...A LOUD MUSIC CHORD! A SUDDEN MOVEMENT!

It's the movement of RED LETTERS that spin up off the head of the 
corpse and settle before our eyes.

The letters read: "THE END (I PROMISE)"

	THE DAY THE CLOWN CRIED 
	ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY 
	By 
	JOAN O'BRIEN 
	And 
	CHARLES DENTON 
	Based on a Story Idea by 
	JOAN O'BRIEN 
	Additional Material by Jerry Lewis

	I TOOK A CHILD BY THE HAND... 
	TO LEAD HIM ON HIS WAY. 
	I TOLD HIM OF THE LOVE OF GOD... 
	AND TAUGHT HIM HOW TO PRAY. 
	AND AS I SEARCHED FOR BETTER WAYS HIS GUIDE AND HELP TO BE... 
	I FOUND, AS WE WALKED HAND IN HAND, THAT HE WAS LEADING ME. 
	"THE DAY THE CLOWN CRIED"

				    COLD OPENING

	EXT. PARIS CIRCUS - NIGHT

	The normal activity and excitement of showtime around the 
	circus is in evidence where we see the half dark street and 
	alley directly adjacent to the circus tent which (in Paris 
	is an enclosure)... the animals, the midgets, the people and 
	the roustabouts moving with a fixed speed and getting faster 
	as we now know showtime is momentarily due.

	We MOVE TOWARD the action, slowly but definitely picking up 
	SOUNDS and actions of the busy people as we go.

						    STRAIGHT CUT TO:

	EXT. CIRCUS - FRONT OF CIRCUS - PEOPLE ENTERING - NIGHT

	We see barkers, children, people, pushing... buying tickets, 
	hats, candy... SOUNDS of children laughing, MUSIC playing 
	from o.s. within the tent area... and we...

								   CUT TO:

	EXT. BACK OF CIRCUS - NIGHT

	A continuation of the animals, trainers, clowns INTERCUT 
	with the action of the circus customers jamming the 
	entranceway to get in... (complimented CUTS from backstage 
	to out front... building to the final crescendo... as we see 
	the alley empty and clear out vs. the front area clearing 
	and also becoming empty.)

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. CIRCUS PROPER - NIGHT

	The fully dressed orchestra playing the oncoming people to 
	their respective seats as we PAN ALONG the happy faces and 
	excited children... DOWN and BACK within the circus backstage 
	and SLOWLY COME TO A STOP OUTSIDE: "CLOWN ALLEY".

	CLOWN ALLEY - NIGHT

	The heartbeat of any circus... The long row of unkempt, yet 
	beautifully neat trunks where the clowns make up, with many 
	of the clowns just coming in and setting their clothes and 
	things around their own little areas... midgets running and 
	playing, like the little children they are about to 
	entertain... MUSIC is in the deep background... as we COME 
	TO A STOP at the large trunk with the letters clearly printed 
	...'GUSTAV - EUROPE'S PREMIER CLOWN."

	We PULL BACK and AWAY from the lettering on the trunk and 
	REVEAL the face of a gentle but drawn man, a man whose body 
	and movements indicate he has been at this for a long time.  
	As he sits, the little midgets run close to see what they 
	can do to help; one pulls the chair for him to sit on; another 
	brings a hot cup of coffee; another takes his coat and hangs 
	in on the hattree, adjacent to his trunk... as we PUSH PAST 
	HIM to introduce the other clowns... some half made up, others 
	finishing their make-up... and some just sitting and rapping 
	together, smoking, drinking coffee, waiting for showtime... 
	and in the very distant b.g., almost against the wall of 
	clown alley, we see the trunk and the body of a "CLOWN" in 
	silhouette... we CRAWL TOWARDS the body and the trunk... and 
	COME TO A STOP... HOLDING FULL FRAME.  The clown, already 
	made-up and dressed in his tramp outfit, has his head in his 
	hands, leaning down on the trunk table top, a depressed and 
	sad looking hulk of a man... an o.s. voice:

				  MIDGET
		Coffee?  It's nice and hot.

	The MIDGET slides the cup in front of the clown's face... as 
	he picks up his head and smiles and nods yes... he sips the 
	coffee and we see the clown is HELMUT DORQUE (pronounced 
	Doork).

	He is a depressed and very unhappy clown... the frown on his 
	face shows years of knocking around... plus fear that those 
	years are now over.  From o.s. we HEAR the SOUND of a small 
	air horn being blown and carried by one of the midgets.  He 
	is yelling through an old megaphone.

				  MIDGET
		15 Minutes to circus... 15 minutes 
		to circus.

	Upon hearing this, "Clown Alley" really gets busy... all the 
	clowns get up and put their last minute touches together... 
	touching up their make-ups... getting their coats and props 
	together... and as they get themselves up and ready, they 
	exit the clown alley area and start for the arena.  The last 
	one to go is Helmut, lingering behind intentionally as we:

								   CUT TO:

	INT. CIRCUS ARENA - CLOSEUP RINGMASTER - NIGHT

				  RINGMASTER
		Ladies and gentlemen, we proudly 
		present... "The Clowns"!

	INT. CLOWN ALLEY - NIGHT

	Helmut hangs back until the very last clown exits Clown Alley, 
	as we:

								   CUT TO:

	INT. CIRCUS PROPER - NIGHT

	The MUSIC is really going strong... and the clowns come on 
	like all forty.  They explode in the ring... doing all their 
	bits and pieces which ultimately brings them back to the 
	entrance area they just came from and they make the "West 
	Point" arch for the TIMPANI DRUM ROLL and the grand entrance 
	of "Gustav" the Great.

	CLOSER SHOT

	"Gustav" makes his famous comedy walk into the tent with the 
	longest pair of tails ever seen (at least 75 feet long) and 
	at the end holding them from dragging on the floor is Helmut, 
	the "Tramp Clown".

	WIDER SHOT

	We see Gustav taking the applause, and it is tremendous.  He 
	stops center of the ring, but Helmut keeps walking and doesn't 
	see the post in front of him as he walks around the post, 
	still holding the tails and goes on his butt, pulling Gustav 
	down as well.  The audience screams with laughter, believing 
	this all part of the act, as we:

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. CLOWN ALLEY - NIGHT

	All the clowns are sitting around their respective trunks 
	and there is a sense of gloom permeating the air, as Gustav 
	and MR. SCHMIDT pace back and forth behind Helmut, both going 
	at him unmercifully.

				  MR SCHMIDT
			(in the middle of his 
			tirade)
		Not to mention how unprofessional 
		that was...

				  HELMUT
		But it was an accident...

				  GUSTAV
		Oh, sure it was... A very well planned 
		and calculated accident!

				  HELMUT
		I swear to you... it was an accident!

	Gustav stops and grabs Schmidt's arm, and with a threatening, 
	pointing finger...

				  GUSTAV
		I don't want to hear any more...  
		You will get me another stooge. I 
		don't want this man!!

				  SCHMIDT
		Don't get excited, Gustav, you shall 
		have it.

				  GUSTAV
		You bet I will, or you shall have no 
		show.

	Gustav walks away, sits at his trunk, starts taking his make-
	up off.

				  SCHMIDT
			(moving to Helmut's 
			trunk, leaning over 
			into Helmut's ear)
		You will run with the other clowns 
		and that's all you will do... is 
		that clear?

	Helmut, shattered, nods his head yes.

				  SCHMIDT
			(continuing)
		And if there is another one of your 
		cute tricks... I promise you will do 
		your bits for the "Cats" while 
		cleaning their cages!

	Schmidt walks away... leaving Helmut stunned and shocked.  
	Helmut lifts his trunk cover, which opens on a hinge and 
	stays upright, as we SLOWLY CRAB AROUND to REVEAL the "One 
	Sheets" glued to the inside of the trunk lid... as Helmut 
	reaches for a towel to clean his face, we read:

		   RINGLING BROS. & BARNUM AND BAILEY

				 PRESENTS

		  THE WORLD'S GREATEST CLOWN "HELMUT"

				 SCHMIDT

				    From Germany

	The one sheets are battered and torn and certainly appear to 
	be many years old.  As we PAN the "Lid" to see them all, 
	Helmut's face is reflected in the mirror as we see the tears 
	rolling down his face.  As we FREEZE FRAME, MUSIC hits for:

	MAIN TITLES:

	THE DAY THE CLOWN CRIED

	FOLLOWING CREDITS:

	EXT. DESERTED STREET AND BISTRO - NIGHT

	Helmut, dejected and as sad as any man could be, strolls 
	down the deserted street, alone.

	INT. BISTRO

	He comes to a small bistro and walks in... stands at the 
	bar.

				  HELMUT
		Clause... give me a double whiskey 
		with beer chaser.

				  CLAUSE
			(who knows him)
		You won't get "Funny" out of a bottle.

				  HELMUT
		And you won't make a dime sticking 
		your nose in other people's business.

	Clause pours the whiskey, and places the beer next to it; as 
	Helmut gulps the drink down and chases it with the beer from 
	the bottle... we:

						    STRAIGHT CUT TO:

	INT. THE APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Standing at the window looking out is a beautiful WOMAN, 
	simply dressed, no make-up and clean; she has the look of a 
	woman who has just bathed and one could almost smell the 
	fragrance of bath oil on her body.  She is tense and 
	concerned.

	She sees something and moves toward the door and opens it.  
	There is a beat and finally the o.s. SOUNDS of feet scuffling 
	get to the door.  It is Helmut, fairly crocked at this point.

				  ADA
		Helmut, darling, are you all right?

				  HELMUT
			(nastily)
		Do I look like I'm not all right?

				  ADA
		I was so worried about you...  Your 
		dinner is cold and I couldn't imagine 
		what happened to you...

				  HELMUT
		Were you really worried about me or 
		your stupid dinner was getting cold?

	Ada is hurt by this, but knows something is really chewing 
	away at him... and deals with it even more tenderly, which 
	only digs in deeper on Helmut.

				  ADA
		Sweetheart, I care about you...  I 
		love you... I worry about you...  I 
		can't help those feelings...

	During the above Helmut is at the small bar in the living 
	room pouring another "blast" and gulps it down... he hears 
	the words but tries to ignore them.

				  HELMUT
		If there is anything I don't need 
		right now... it's your super-
		sentimentality...

	He flops down in the armchair and stares straight ahead... 
	Again, Ada is hurt by his blasting her, but she's wise enough 
	to know this isn't the man she loves... she has to get what's 
	eating him out of there.

				  ADA
		Helmut... what's tormenting your 
		soul?  Please let me help you... 
		talk to me...  I don't care what it 
		is... I love you...  I'm your 
		friend... you can trust me to 
		understand...

				  HELMUT
		I can't trust anybody... I don't 
		know how to trust anybody...

				  ADA
		I'm not anybody!  I'm your wife!

	Helmut, hearing these words, looks up at her and sees the 
	beauty in her eyes, and he is affected by this.  He stands 
	up and takes her in his arms... almost breaking her in two.

				  HELMUT
		I'm sorry, my love... I'm so sorry...
		You're right!  You're not anybody.  
		You're my wife and I love you, too...
		So very much I just have no one to 
		fight back at... I'm lost and alone,  
		I can't handle the disgrace of 
		failure... the pain of being a has-
		been is more than I can bear...

	Ada knows now what's happened.

				  ADA
		Schmidt again?  Gustav again?  When 
		will you learn they fear you and 
		they know how vulnerable you are 
		now...  if they can beat you down 
		then they needn't worry about you 
		coming back to haunt them.

				  HELMUT
		They worry about me?  Don't be 
		ridiculous...  they just took the 
		last comic bit away from me... because 
		of a silly accident...  I'm now down 
		at the bottom, just a stooge assisting 
		a not-so-funny clown.

				  ADA
		But they can't take your talent 
		away...  That's your strongest force!

	Walking away from her, getting angry again...

				  HELMUT
		What the hell are you talking about?
		What talent?  And if I had any it's 
		being suffocated into nothing...  
		And that's just what I am now...  
		nothing... No one... just empty...  
		a prop to be used and mis-used...  
		how does my great talent stand up to 
		those odds?

				  ADA
		By not quitting... You must fight!  
		Creative survival is even more 
		difficult than human survival...  
		You must fight!!!

	Helmut gets quiet and listens, and it makes sense... Ada 
	knows she's got him now.

				  ADA
			(continuing)
		Go to Schmidt... Force a 
		confrontation...  Don't let Gustav 
		win...  make Schmidt see what an 
		injustice they are imposing on you...  
		Please, my love, fight!  Make your 
		world better by fighting for it...  
		You can do it... I know you can...

	Helmut hears it all and it sounds so good and right.

				  HELMUT
		I will go now and see Schmidt...
		I will tell him I won't take any 
		more degradation... I will tell him 
		I am a "clown" not a stooge...  A 
		"clown"... A special person...  A 
		special clown...

	Ada happily gets his hat.

				  ADA
			(placing the hat on 
			his head)
		Go, my love... Go and fight for what 
		you know is right... I will warm 
		your dinner and wait for you to come 
		home.

	She kisses him, opens the door for him and he goes.

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. THE EMPTY CIRCUS - NIGHT

	The low key light and the silence of the circus is almost 
	ominous and a little frightening for Helmut as he walks across 
	the empty arena... with a small light burning from up high.  
	All the equipment is tied off.  Slight ANIMAL SOUNDS in the 
	deep background... and the faintest SOUND of circus music is 
	heard.  Helmut is now center of the main ring and stops and 
	looks around.

	HIS POV - THE EMPTY STANDS

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	His face tense, then eases as he looks around.

	HIS POV

	The stands are full, the lights come up, and the audience is 
	standing, applauding thunderously!

	MED. CLOSE - HELMUT

	In his clown outfit bowing and acknowledging the ovation.

	HIS POV - THE AUDIENCE

	as they stop applauding and sit down.

	WIDE SHOT

	Helmut -- the chair and the trombone --

	THE TROMBONE PANTOMIME

	As the completion of the "Trombone Pantomime" Helmut walks 
	away from the position he was in with the trombone and bows 
	and milks the crowd for reactions and as he bows the second 
	time... WE SHIMMER:

								  BACK TO:

	CLOSE - HELMUT

	In bowing position as he looks at the crowd.

	HIS POV - THE EMPTY STANDS

	CLOSE - HELMUT

	His face shows signs of utter despair and dejection... the 
	dream is gone and the memory of what was really hurts deep 
	down.  He looks around making sure he hasn't been noticed by 
	anyone and takes that deep sigh and strolls towards the back 
	of the circus tent area on his way to find Schmidt.

	WIDE ANGLE

	TRUCK WITH HIM, HOLDING the many empty seats in the b.g. as 
	he walks... trying to muster up the courage he's going to 
	have to call... something that has now become totally foreign 
	to him.

	HIGH SHOT - THE EMPTY CIRCUS

	We see Helmut as the tiny figure he feels like, walking out 
	of the tent area and into the backstage section.

								   CUT TO:

	BACKSTAGE OFFICE AREA - NIGHT

	Helmut enters the section of the circus where Schmidt has 
	his "Temp" office quarters.  It is a tent-like arrangement 
	with the canvas flap as his door and we see light streaming 
	from the half open canvas flap.

	HIS POV - THE TENT OFFICE

	Helmut looks and sees a shadow of a body moving around in 
	the tent office area and starts for it.

	INT. TENT OFFICE - NIGHT

	Schmidt pacing up and down... thinking, as we PULL BACK to 
	see Gustav seated in one of the fold-up chairs with a "I am 
	waiting" look on his face.

				  SCHMIDT
		Naturally, I agree... Doork is a 
		nuisance, but to just let him go 
		seems a little unfair.

				  GUSTAV
		Schmidt!  Don't make me put it on a 
		"either him or me basis".

				  SCHMIDT
		All right... all right... I'll give 
		him --

								   CUT TO:

	OUTSIDE OFFICE TENT - HELMUT - NIGHT

	listening.

				  SCHMIDT (V.O.)
		-- his two weeks notice tomorrow. 
		Will that satisfy you?

				  GUSTAV (V.O.)
		Perfectly!!  Let's have a drink...

	Helmut drops his head, completely discouraged and saddened 
	by what he knows is a losing battle.  As he starts to walk 
	away we can HEAR the tinkling of glasses and the slight 
	laughter of the two men as we watch Helmut slowly scuff his 
	way towards the backstage circus exit, as we:

	DISSOLVE (12-ft) HOLDING his walk over his limp body at bar.

	INT. THE BAR - NIGHT

	Helmut has had more than a few and really looks beaten and 
	shoddy -- he waves for the bartender to bring another.

				  CLAUSE
			(pouring still another 
			blast)
		It's your funeral.

				  HELMUT
			(not too clearly)
		A funeral is usually in order when 
		someone dies.

	Up to now, we have no idea, whatever, as to the time (in 
	history) we are indeed in Germany, but as Helmut downs another 
	blast we SLOWLY CREEP our CAMERA to include more of the bar 
	than we have seen before and it includes pictures, framed, 
	of soldiers, arms interlocked (looking somewhat like summer 
	camp stills), the German flag (1933 vintage / crisscrossed 
	with the Swastika), a large banner marked "Deutchland" Ober 
	Aliss... and finally, the larger than life photograph of 
	"Hitler".  Helmut slowly CROSSES CAMERA as he takes another 
	drink and starts spouting again.

				  HELMUT
		The trouble with man today is that 
		he takes everything for granted...  
		he thinks things he's told to think...  
		and accepts it! Just because we know 
		meanings of words we use them and we 
		fool ourselves...  people should use 
		the dictionary more...  look up words 
		like good... bad... honest... loyal...
		especially loyal,  I know what loyal 
		means, and I have always been that...  
		but does anyone care?  No!  Of course 
		not...  Only when it is expedient...  
		When it isn't ---
			(he slashes his throat 
			with his finger)
		--- ZIPPPP!  You're out!

	Helmut stops with his BACK TO CAMERA looking straight at 
	"Hitler" and screams:

				  HELMUT
		And that goes for you too... Mine 
		Fuhrer...

	He shoves his right arm up and out at the photograph of 
	"Hitler".

				  HELMUT
		... you, too, are a fool.  You allow 
		yourself to think you have "loyal" 
		followers...  Ha!  Wait until they've 
		had it with you...  You'll get 
		yours... all the smiling, bowing, 
		heel clicking idiots will shaft you 
		too.  And you will deserve it because 
		if you allow people like Herr Schmidt 
		to got about his business of lying, 
		and cheating, and being disloyal, 
		one day all the Schmidts in Germany 
		will turn on you and you will finish 
		as the dumb little corporal you 
		started as, and never know what hit 
		you...

	During the above dialogue, two S.S. men along with two Gestapo 
	men walk into the bar and sit at a table unseen by Helmut, 
	and as they sit, Helmut continues:

				  HELMUT
		He really has to be stupid --
			(indicating Hitler)
		I could help him by telling him about 
		the people he thinks are good 
		Germans... Ha!

	The two S.S. men and the two Gestapo men just happened to 
	stop in the pub, they can't really believe what they are 
	hearing, and the two S.S. men make a move to get up and secure 
	Helmut.  The head Gestapo man nods to them to stay seated 
	and wait and listen.  Helmut continues his rave and gets 
	more violent as he goes on.  Clause, the bartender, would 
	love to tell him the Germans are there, but chooses to go 
	about his business.

	Helmut is really getting the effects of the booze now and is 
	bordering on flipping his lid, completely.

	(He does the stagger routine trying to get to the table on 
	the other side of the bar furthest away from where the S.S.  
	men and Gestapo men are sitting)... We play this for visual 
	humor, but at the same time showing just how swacked he is!!!  
	Helmut finally reaches the table he has been trying 
	desperately to get to and falls into it, exhausted and 
	emotionally drained.  He looks around at the few people who 
	have been watching him, most of which are frightened at what 
	he has said, trying vainly to stay out of it.  Helmut catches 
	the eyes of the four men (S.S. and Gestapo) just looking at 
	him.

				  HELMUT
			(angrily)
		What are you staring at?  Didn't you 
		ever see a man drink before?

	The four men just stare at him with no answer.

				  HELMUT
		What's the matter?  Haven't you guys 
		got a sense of humor?  You must have!  
		Look how you're dressed!  Grown men 
		in their little soldier suits... And 
		the black coats and gloves... Like 
		in a movie...

	Helmut gets up and walks over to their table... mumbling, 
	and staggering as he goes...

				  HELMUT
		Real cloak and dagger stuff...  Didn't 
		you Gestapo guys ever know that 
		everybody can spot you a mile away?
			(leaning over and 
			whispering)
		Listen, if you really wanted to be 
		unnoticed...  You should dress like 
		plain people, then nobody would  
		know you... You might even wear straw 
		hats and shorts...

	He hears this and gets hysterical laughing.

				  HELMUT
		Straw hats and shorts!!  That's funny!  
		Now that's really funny, isn't it?  
		Straw hats and shorts!

	They just stare!

				  HELMUT
		Well, isn't that funny?   Think of 
		it...  That's funny!   Why don't you 
		laugh?

	HELMUT'S POV - THE S.S. AND GESTAPO MEN

	They are really staring now, hard to believe their ears and 
	eyes.

				  HELMUT
			(gets an idea)
		I know why you're not laughing...  
		Because things you hear, you have to 
		think about... I'll show you something 
		that you'll laugh at because all 
		you'll have to do is watch...

	DIRECTOR'S MEMO!!!    (INSERT CHAPLIN FOOTAGE)

	Helmut goes over to the bar, where a little man is standing 
	drinking his beer.  Alongside of the beer is a small plate 
	with crackers and brown jam.  Helmut takes a comb out of his 
	pocket, dips it in the man's glass of beer, combs his hair 
	down over one eye, takes a finger full of the brown jam and 
	makes a shicklegruber mustache from it... and turns on the 
	four men yelling:

				  HELMUT
		Ve vill conquer the world...  Heil 
		me!  Heil me!  Heil me!

	He screams the last "Heil" and collapses on the floor.  The 
	four men get up and proceed to pick him up and carry him out 
	of the bar.  As they get to the doorway and exit we STAY 
	on... Ada who has just arrived to see them pick him up and 
	carry him away.  She is shocked.  We STAY on a CLOSEUP OF 
	HER FACE showing the strain, pain and sadness as we:

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. LT. REICHER'S OFFICE - OUTER OFFICE - BERLIN GESTAPO 
	HEADQUARTERS - DAY

	We OPEN on the shiny black boots swinging the door open in 
	front of him and as we PULL BACK we see Helmut seated in a 
	slumped position on the hard wood bench as we introduce the 
	wearer of the black boots -- LT. REICHER -- he enters his 
	office as we go with him... (Feather Edge Set)... he walks 
	briskly to the desk where there are briefs and papers stacked 
	high on his desk... he bellows, after looking at the top 
	folder.

				  REICHER
		STEINER !!!!  Get in here!

	A frightened and spineless like corporal springs into his 
	office and clicks his heels and screams.

				  CORPORAL
		Heil Hitler!
			(shooting that stiff 
			arm out like on a 
			spring!)
		Reicher flips his wrist in answer to 
		the heil, showing complete annoyance 
		at having to do it.

				  REICHER
		Do I see what I think I see here?

	The corporal leans over the desk, and in order to see puts 
	his hand on the desk to brace himself... Reicher smacks his 
	arm, knocking his face flat on the desk... he stays there 
	with his ass in the air, waiting for instructions.  Reicher 
	leans down putting his nose right to the corporal's nose.

				  REICHER
		Never put your hands on my desk...  
		is that clear?

	Still in the same position, the Corporal extends his arm for 
	a heil Hitler, which is virtually impossible in the position 
	he is in.

				  CORPORAL
			(meekly)
		Yes sir!

				  REICHER
		MOVE IT!!

	The Corporal rises and stands stiffer than ever...

				  REICHER
			(picking the folder 
			up)
		Now tell me, is this brief correct?  
		Is that prisoner, the drunk, the one 
		that impersonated the Fuehrer?

				  CORPORAL
		Yes sir!  It is!

	Reicher paces behind his desk... the Corporal still stiff at 
	attention... waits and watches in mortal fear.

				  REICHER
			(to himself)
		I get all the weirdos...  Alright, 
		Corporal, send him in!

	The corporal clicks his heels, thrilled that he can go.

				  CORPORAL
		Yes sir!!!!

	He exits, and returns with Helmut and one more guard.  Helmut 
	stands in the doorway, frightened and unsure, Reicher still 
	pacing behind his desk feels Helmut's presence...

				  REICHER
		Alright, come in, sit down!

	Helmut walks to the chair in front of Reicher's desk... The 
	spineless corporal moves towards the door... turns... and 
	takes his position on the opposite side of the door that the 
	guard is standing at...

	Reicher picks up the folder again, fingers through it.  As 
	he looks through the folder, he looks at Helmut and looks 
	and fingers pages and the silence and the anxiety is getting 
	to Helmut as he sweats and waits.

	Reicher is toying with him, and each time Reicher looks up 
	the sick, little-boy smile crosses Helmut's face, hoping to 
	endear himself to this Prussian pig!

	Reicher finally sits down beside his desk in a chair that 
	resembles a throne.  It is high and it looks down on Helmut.

	(Props:  This chair must be higher and taller than Helmut's 
	chair... for POV shots diminishing Helmut seated there.

	OVER REICHER ON HELMUT

				  REICHER
			(soft spoken)
		Are you Helmut Doork?

				  HELMUT
			(nervously)
		Doork, yes sir, Helmut Doork!  I am 
		he!  Yes sir, that is correct, Doork!

				  REICHER
		And are you a clown in the circus?

				  HELMUT
			(ego setting in and 
			forgetting for a 
			moment his trouble 
			and danger)
		Not JUST A CLOWN!  I am Helmut Doork, 
		Premier Clown!  I've clowned for the 
		royal heads of many of our finest 
		countries, why there were times when 
		I had to...

				  REICHER
			(breaking in)
		That was years ago... According to 
		these papers you are now just a helper 
		in the circus with little or no 
		importance!!

	This stuns Helmut, his facade destroyed... His face drops 
	along with his fear...

				  HELMUT
			(meekly)
		Some things are only temporary...  
		Lt. Reicher!  Only yesterday, I had 
		calls from one of the great circus 
		owners in all of Europe... he...

				  REICHER
			(breaking in, strong 
			and angry)
		You are NOTHING!!  You are a HAS 
		BEEN!!  You WERE A CLOWN...

				  REICHER
			(continuing)
		You are now a prisoner of the State 
		and that's not funny... Can you make 
		something funny out of that, Clown?

	Helmut sinks even lower in the over-stuffed chair, despair 
	in his eyes and a weight on his heart... the truth slashing 
	at his very being.

				  HELMUT
			(softly)
		No!  Lt. Reicher, I can't make 
		anything funny from that thought...

				  REICHER
		It is no thought... It is fact, Clown, 
		unquestionable fact!!  Now down to 
		the issues at hand...  Did you 
		willfully and with malice attack the 
		State and impersonate the Fuhrer?

				  HELMUT
			(softly)
		I was drunk!  It was a mistake!  I 
		meant no disrespect... Sir... 
		Honestly, I was drunk and not 
		responsible for my actions and 
		thoughts!  And my actions were 
		subconscious!

				  REICHER
			(screaming)
		Subconscious??  Meaning it was all 
		motivated by truth that came out 
		under the influence of alcohol!

				  HELMUT
			(still softly)
		I am a LOYAL German!

				  REICHER
		And what kind of commendation would 
		you expect for being a loyal German?

				  HELMUT
		I want nothing!  But I'm more loyal 
		than most Germans I know...

				  REICHER
		Like who?

	Helmut realizes this was the wrong thing to say... he 
	sweats...

				  HELMUT
		Ah, like... re...

				  REICHER
		Names!   Names!!!  Who?

				  HELMUT
		I don't know...

				  REICHER
		Sir!!!

				  HELMUT
		I don't know, sir...

				  REICHER
		But you said other Germans... What 
		OTHER Germans...  Who are they?  Why 
		aren't they loyal?  Who?

				  HELMUT
			(trying desperately 
			to cop out)
		I'm not responsible for what I say 
		now...

				  REICHER
		Why?  You're not drinking... you 
		said you weren't responsible last 
		night because you were drunk!  Are 
		you drunk now?

				  HELMUT
		No, sir!

				  REICHER
		Then why are you not responsible 
		now?

				  HELMUT
		I don't know!!

				  REICHER
		SIR!!!

				  HELMUT
		I don't know -- sir !!!

				  REICHER
		Why are you not responsible?  Why?  
		Why?  Why?  Why?

	On each attack of the word "why", Reicher creeps up closer 
	and closer to Helmut, really intimidating him... and the 
	sound of his voice echoes and becomes monotone and ominous...

	[THE NEXT TWO PAGES OF THE SCRIPT ARE MISSING AS THEY ARE IN 
	THE ORIGINAL]

	The corporal gets Reicher's point and marks his notebook, 
	flips the cover closed, snaps to attention as we:

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	INT RAILWAY STATION - DAY

	Ada walking as briskly as a woman can walk without running 
	and then her walk becomes a panic running, looking, sweating, 
	and the look on her face is evident that she is frightened 
	and close to shock... she gets to a train gate where she 
	sees the S.S. men pushing men through the gate to the train... 
	she knows she is where she has to be... she approaches one 
	of the S.S. men...

				  ADA
		Excuse me, sir, but I wonder if you 
		would help me... you see...

				  S.S. MAN
			(very briskly)
		No!  Go away!

				  ADA
		You don't understand...

				  S.S. MAN
		You don't understand...  I said go 
		away !!

	Ada backs away from the gate, and stands to one side watching 
	the prisoners being moved from the back of the huge truck 
	backed up to the railway area... she is looking through the 
	iron bars (we SHOOT the bars holding depth of field snugly 
	so that the prisoners and the bars are in sharp focus)... we 
	make QUICK CUTS between Ada and the prisoners exiting the 
	huge truck... as we see the change of expression on Ada's 
	face we know she sees what she's been looking for... Helmut... 
	he is walking in a slow rhythm following a group of men who 
	look equally as broken and sad as he looks... Ada yells 
	through the bars...

				  ADA
		HELMUT !

	Just as she yells, the voice of an S.S. Man drowns out her 
	scream as he yells...

				  S.S. MAN
		Move along... you swine... move...  
		we haven't got all day... move...  
		move... one-two-three-four --

	His voice rings loudly in echo in the vast station it's as 
	though he is timing his yells to each scream of hers... we 
	see her mouth moving with the SOUND of the S.S. Man's voice 
	coming from it... she is screaming Helmut... as the S.S. Man 
	screams...

				  S.S. MAN
		Move it... move it... move...  move... 
		hurry... faster... faster...

	Helmut and the other men push ahead faster and faster... 
	with INTERCUTS of Ada, tears streaming down her face... with 
	CUTS of Helmut walking with his head down, embarrassed and 
	shattered...

	MED. - ADA

	We MOVE the CAMERA SLOWLY towards her, peering through the 
	bars of the huge gate... and as we MOVE, we HEAR the doors 
	of the train slamming... the whistle... and the slow start 
	of the locomotive moving the train out of the station... by 
	the time we get to the (choker) of Ada... the train is almost 
	out of listening range... She drops her head, wipes her eyes 
	with her handkerchief, as we hear so.:

				  S.S. MAN
			(the same one at the 
			gate who told her to 
			go away)
		Now I would be glad to help you, 
		Fraulein... shall we start with a 
		drink?  There is a lovely little bar 
		around the corner...

	During the above dialogue we see another S.S. Man closing 
	and locking the gate to the train platform... She looks at 
	this "Pig", then down and up as though she were examining a 
	rare, never seen insect... and then right into his face... 
	and softly whispers:

				  ADA
		Go away !!

	She turns and slowly walks the long walk down the empty 
	station corridor as we

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. THEIR APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Ada is sitting at the kitchen table, the table is empty, the 
	light is low and we see the picture of a lonely heartbroken 
	woman, she has a small bowl of soup in front of her and the 
	spoon in her hand is doing nothing more than swirling the 
	soup around in the bowl... she can't eat, which is evident 
	and as she swirls the spoon around, we MOVE IN SLOWLY and 
	into the bowl of soup (choker)... and HOLD on the spoon in 
	the bowl as we

						    STRAIGHT CUT TO:

	INT. CAMP MESS HALL - INSERT - BOWL OF SLOP - DAY

	We see wooden spoon doing exactly what Ada was doing, just 
	swirling the spoon around in what looks like dirty water 
	with a carrot in it, the bowl is chopped and cracked, the 
	spoon is old and almost white from use... the handle still 
	retains its wooden look... as we PULL BACK we see Helmut is 
	swirling the spoon in the slop... behind him is a Guard just 
	watching his actions... after a beat, the Guard taps Helmut 
	on the shoulder...

				  GUARD
		Tsk!  tsk!  tsk!  shame on you, 
		Doork... shame...  don't you want to 
		grow big and strong like me?

	Helmut knows he's in trouble and just waits indifferently 
	for the fireworks to start...

				  GUARD
		We must eat our food!  Do we want 
		Uncle to feed the little man?

	The guard pulls the man next to Helmut out of his seat and 
	practically throws him to the floor to make room for himself 
	to sit down next to Helmut which he does... he half turns 
	his body towards Helmut and turns Helmut around in the same 
	fashion so they are almost facing one another.  The Guard 
	takes the wooden spoon and fills it with the soup and proceeds 
	to feed Helmut... he stuffs the spoonful of soup into his 
	mouth... and Helmut takes and swallows... then the Guard 
	takes another spoonful and makes believe he is blowing it 
	(like a mother blows the hot soup not to burn the baby's 
	mouth)... and forces the spoonful into Helmut's mouth.

				  GUARD
			(continuing to feed 
			him as he puts the 
			spoon in his mouth)
		And now one for Aunt Ada...

	As the Guard uses the name Ada, Helmut bites down on the 
	spoon and won't let it go... but if looks could kill... he 
	stares at the Guard with hate...

				  GUARD
			(pulling the spoon)
		Let go, Doork, let go... it's the 
		soup that makes us big and strong... 
		not the spoon... LET IT GO!

	Helmut still holds it clenched in his teeth, and the Guard 
	smacks his face full force.  Helmut lets it go... and holds 
	his face, embarrassed and humiliated as any many would be...

				  GUARD
			(continuing)
		Now let's try it again...

	He fills the spoon and sticks it toward Helmut's mouth, but 
	Helmut clenches his teeth keeping his mouth shut.

				  GUARD
		I said let's try it again...

	He shoves the spoon into his lips, as the soup drips all 
	over the front of Helmut's shirt.  The Guard uses the spoon 
	to clean the front of his shirt and forces the liquid he 
	took from the shirt front into Helmut's mouth... Some of the 
	men at the table and surrounding tables feel for Helmut, 
	others think it's funny... they laugh quietly.

				  GUARD
		Oh, I know why you're unhappy... 
		soup without bread is terrible...

	The Guard takes the large loaf of brown bread and rips a 
	huge piece out of the center of the loaf and proceeds to 
	stuff Helmut's mouth with bread, until he looks like his 
	cheeks are eight times their normal size.

				  GUARD
		Isn't that better?  Now take some 
		soup...

	He pushes a spoonful of soup into his mouth which is so full, 
	nothing can get in... consequently the bread spills out, the 
	soup spills out... and he is a mess... (We play this scene 
	for plot value, but it will work comically as well.)

				  HELMUT
		I've had enough, thank you... No 
		more, please...

	The Guard just stares at him...

				  HELMUT
		Please!

				  GUARD
		I'm surprised at you, Doork, you've 
		been here two years now, you should 
		have learned we, of the Third Reich, 
		never acknowledge the weak, sniveling, 
		begging of you swine...  that's all 
		you're good for... begging... 
		pleading... praying...  you're a 
		disgrace to the human race.  That's 
		why we of the superior race must do 
		away with all of you...

	The guard turns to the other men at the table, and goes into 
	one of his mentally unbalanced tirades...

				  GUARD
		And we will!  We will!  Do away with 
		all of you.  You're worthless pigs... 
		with no courage, no guts, why if 
		anyone did to me what I just did to 
		Doork I would kill him!
			(turning to Helmut)
		Why don't you kill me, Doork?  Go 
		on...  kill me... kill me... take 
		the knife from the table and kill 
		me...

	Helmut looks at the knife on the table, picks it up, holds 
	it in stabbing style, thinks about it... and we know by his 
	look, he would love to...

				  HELMUT
			(with knife in hand)
		I would kill you... but I am getting 
		my release any day now... and I won't 
		do anything that would spoil my 
		chances...

	Helmut digs the knife into the table top and buries his head 
	in his hands... totally shook from the encounter...

				  GUARD
		Your release?

	He begins to laugh, but hysterically.

				  GUARD
		Release?  They told me you were 
		funny...  but I never realized just 
		how funny you are...  RELEASE ????

	And the hysterical laughter really echoes throughout the 
	mess hall as the Guard makes his way towards the exit.  The 
	men at the table slowly get up and exit the scene, as do the 
	others at the surrounding tables... leaving Helmut just 
	sitting there... we PULL BACK to reveal the empty mess hall, 
	and the lonely sad body of Helmut, as he looks around 
	realizing he's alone, gets up and slowly creeps out of the 
	hall like a puppy with his tail between his legs... as we

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. PRISON YARD - FULL SHOT - DAY

	There are two rows of prisoners quarters, wooden buildings, 
	weather beaten each row consists of about a dozen barracks 
	each... joined at the ends, farthest from the CAMERA by the 
	administration building, a two story type making a "U" shape 
	of the compound... The entire yard is surrounded by two high 
	wire fences about ten yards apart and fifteen feet high.   
	At intervals of about twenty-five yards, in the area between 
	the fences, are the guard towers, each about eighteen feet 
	above the ground equipped with searchlights, sirens, machine 
	guns, with three Guards on duty.  Along outer fence, also 
	about twenty-five yards apart, other powerful lighting 
	equipment mounted on high poles.

	It is morning and although the sun shines brightly it doesn't 
	in any way alter the drabness of the compound... nor does it 
	help change the look of the men...

	There are about three hundred men milling about, some still 
	chewing what was their breakfast, some pulling brown bread 
	from their shirt fronts and exchanging bread for cigarettes 
	or just making deals, one with another... some sit along the 
	barracks walls trying to get some sun... others walking in 
	circles... some talking, laughing, even playing cards... 
	doing whatever they can to kill time...

	PAN the entire camp.  At completion of the long PAN 
	introducing the prison camp, we pick up the sixtyish JOHANN 
	KELTNER (formally ANDERLICH), a warm, sensitive looking 
	greying man, thin but with a dignity and a serenity about 
	him... He walks briskly (and we know he'd love to walk slowly 
	and tiredly, but we can see he knows his attitude and conduct 
	will help those that can't help themselves...)

	His face tells us he is good, kind and the reason men want 
	to live, he is special and he smiles at all those he passes, 
	greets the men and is generally what man wishes he could be 
	under the same circumstances...

	He walks into the building, which we learn is the barracks...

	INT. BARRACKS - DAY

	The barracks are empty... Keltner enters the huge room and 
	looks around and sees Helmut at the other end of the barracks 
	just walking back and forth like a caged lion... angry, hurt, 
	sad, and generally out of sorts... he can't even hear Keltner 
	approaching him... he finally stops at the back wall of the 
	barracks and lays his head against the barracks wall...

				  HELMUT
			(not aware Keltner is 
			behind him)
		Dear God, please hear me!

				  KELTNER
		He hears you, my son...

	Helmut jumps, scared... throwing his back against the wall, 
	like a man who fears being attacked at any time...

				  KELTNER
			(sympathetically)
		Here, here, easy, you can't do this 
		to yourself...

				  HELMUT
		You frightened me, Johann, I'm 
		sorry...

				  KELTNER
			(softly)
		You have nothing to be sorry for...  
		Fear isn't something controlled by 
		man...  fear can not be conferred 
		with...  there isn't anyway known to 
		mankind where man can say to 
		himself...  "I will not be afraid"... 
		Oh, certainly man can try to fight 
		it... but faith and believing are 
		man's only chance...  You must have 
		faith... you must!

				  HELMUT
		I have faith... but not always...  
		sometimes it eludes me...  I can't 
		remember to remember it.

				  KELTNER
		But that's natural... you can't expect 
		to be perfect in what you try to 
		do...

				  HELMUT
		I don't know...

	He starts pacing again.

				  KELTNER
		I heard what happened at breakfast 
		this morning with ROTHMAN, the 
		guard...

	Helmut spins around, frightened again...

				  HELMUT
		Will they do something to me? What 
		have you heard?

				  KELTNER
			(putting his arm around 
			him)
		Nothing, absolutely nothing... don't 
		worry about it... I just wanted you 
		to know that I believe you handled 
		yourself admirably...

				  HELMUT
		That was one time I didn't care for 
		the laughs I was getting from some 
		of the men...

				  KELTNER
		Of course you didn't... but I'm sure 
		you know man laughs for two reasons... 
		one because something is funny... 
		two, because they fear showing fear... 
		they laughed because "there but for 
		the grace of God go I!"

				  HELMUT
		Do you really think so?

				  KELTNER
		I'm certain of it!

	Helmut smiles and takes Johann's hand, tenderly, and warmly:

				  HELMUT
		Thank you, Johann.  I always feel so 
		much better after you talk to me...

				  KELTNER
		I'm glad, Helmut, I'm very glad...  
		you know you can always talk to me, 
		about anything...

				  HELMUT
			(remembering)
		Oh!  I almost forgot...

	Helmut puts Johann around the back of the barrack area near 
	the wall out of sight of anyone coming in...

				  HELMUT
		Before breakfast this morning,  I 
		spoke to one of the guards, a very 
		intelligent one, and he seems quite 
		nice and friendly too.  Well, he 
		said that the Gestapo has set up a 
		special review board to handle cases 
		just like mine.  And he said he would 
		get me a form, a special form.  Just 
		been printed up.  And I'm to fill it 
		out.  Isn't that good?

	Keltner looking at him, like a child that believes in the 
	boogie man:

				  KELTNER
		How many times since you've been 
		here, have you filled out forms?  
		Twenty?  Thirty times??

				  HELMUT
			(in fast)
		But this is different.  It's entirely 
		new.

	Helmut takes out a set of papers from his back pocket to 
	show Keltner.

				  HELMUT
		See?  These are made up by the Gestapo 
		itself... and the form will go 
		directly to Berlin, to Gestapo 
		headquarters.  That's the important 
		thing about this... the Gestapo's in 
		on it.  That's a very good sign.
			(a beat)
		Isn't it a good sign?

				  KELTNER
			(sympathetically)
		Yes, my son, it is a good sign.

				  HELMUT
			(in fast, excited; 
			scanning the papers)
		And I have to be very careful of 
		everything I put down on the form.  
		The tiniest detail could make the 
		difference.  Don't you agree?

	Helmut looks up and notices Johann is looking up towards the 
	ceiling of the barracks... watching something... Helmut looks 
	up, too.

	THEIR POV - THE BIRDS

	Up and under the eaves of the barrack just above their heads, 
	two small birds are perched (apparently they flew in from 
	outside and decided to nest there).

	BACK TO HELMUT AND KELTNER - TWO SHOT

				  KELTNER
		Isn't it strange?  They are free to 
		go anywhere they want, and they come 
		here to nest.

	Helmut doesn't react to Keltner's dialogue, but goes back to 
	his creased and soiled papers that he's read a thousand times 
	before, and reads them again... as he reads... Keltner takes 
	a piece of brown bread from his shirt pocket and crumbles it 
	and throws the crumbs up to the little birds...

	HIS POV - THE BIRDS

	They scramble to chew the crumbs, and they do...

	DOWN SHOT - KELTNER

	watching.  Johann just watches, smiling at the birds, turns 
	and looks to see if Helmut is watching, too...

	HELMUT - CLOSE

	Intense at scanning through the papers and totally oblivious 
	to Keltner and the birds...

	KELTNER - CLOSE

				  KELTNER
			(softly)
		Watch the birds eat, Helmut... it's 
		so cute...

				  HELMUT
		I'm sure I've got everything here...  
		The important facts from the moment 
		I was arrested, the questions the 
		Gestapo officer asked me...  now 
		what was his name again?  I can't 
		seem to remember what his name was...

				  KELTNER
		HELMUT...

				  HELMUT
		What the devil was his name?

				  KELTNER  (LOUDER)
		HELMUT !

				  HELMUT
			(coming out of it)
		Oh, yes, Johann... I'm sorry... you 
		were saying?

				  KELTNER
		You're not a religious man, are you, 
		Helmut?

				  HELMUT
			(thinking about it)
		Well, I... ah...

				  KELTNER
		Not sure I am myself anymore.

	Helmut quite surprised by this remark.

				  KELTNER
		Yet... when I see those birds, I 
		wonder...  were they sent here to 
		let us know this place really isn't 
		God forsaken?

				  HELMUT
		He should have sent them elsewhere...  
		they could be eaten here!

	Helmut goes back to studying his papers, Keltner ponders 
	Helmut's remark, looks backup at the birds... his face full 
	of compassion, as we:

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT (DUSK)

	We now see the Barracks completely (SHOOTING from flat on), 
	the wooden bunks are housed in a low wooden building with 
	eight two tier bunks on each side.  A group of men are 
	clustered around Keltner's bunk.  Here we meet:  ADOLF, a 
	large, once powerful man, in his mid thirties.  LUDWIG, once 
	a fairly prosperous businessman before his politics landed 
	him in prison, is older, and his bitterness is written all 
	over his face.  FRANZ, is the youngest.  He is a sensitive 
	looing twenty five year old, more than likely the "rebel" 
	type of the 1930s.

	Helmut is in his upper bunk over Keltner writing on an old 
	piece of paper with a scruffy pencil, which he bites to make 
	a point of, and wets with his tongue like any fat butcher 
	selling liverwurst and marking the price on a brown paper 
	bag... (i.e. Brooklyn, circa 1928).

	We TRUCK the CAMERA down the long barrack to include the 
	other men doing their things.  A couple of men are getting 
	ready for a card game... several others are comparing 
	clothing, mending and helping one another, a couple play 
	chess.  A few are sleeping, but for the most part, most of 
	the men lay in their bunks staring at the ceiling... The 
	floors are spotless... suffice to say they better be... the 
	walls have nothing hanging but a few socks drying... a torn 
	calendar, wrong year, etc.

	CLOSE - KELTNER GROUP

	Johann sits with his back to CAMERA... at the edge of his 
	bunk, leaving room on his bunk for Adolph, Ludwig, Franz.

	He is showing something to them that we cannot see.  Keltner's 
	body covers whatever it is that the three men are gawking 
	at, facing CAMERA... and they are indeed gawking with delight 
	and admiration.

				  LUDWIG
			(seriously)
		I think we should eat it!

				  KELTNER
		Not on your life...
			(catching himself)
		Er, that is... I wouldn't...

				  FRANZ
		Put it somewhere so it can brighten 
		up the place.

				  LUDWIG
			(sourly)
		It would take a hell of a lot more 
		than that to brighten up this place.

				  ADOLF
		It'll be better than looking at your 
		long face.

	Chuckling, Keltner rises.  We BOOM UP with him, and as his 
	head comes up over the top of the bottom bunk... he holds 
	out the object for Helmut to see... It is a potato, a sorry 
	looking spud... that Keltner has put in a small can of water 
	and is beginning to sprout two sick-looking shoots.

				  KELTNER
			(to Helmut)
		Do you see the way it's sprouting...  
		I told you it wasn't completely 
		rotten.

				  HELMUT
			(his mind on his thing)
		That's nice, Johann.  Do you remember 
		when I filled out those last forms?  
		The date might be important.

				  KELTNER
			(almost annoyed)
		About four weeks ago, I think.

	LOOSER SHOT

	As Keltner walks away from Helmut's bunk.

				  KELTNER
		I'll put it up here on the window 
		sill, it'll get the morning sun.

	He reaches the window and starts to reach up, to place the 
	potato on the sill... a hand shoots out holding the hand of 
	Keltner...

				  STOUT PRISONER
		Think you can trust your potato so 
		close to me, Reverend?

				  LUDWIG
		The potato he TRUSTS... it's you he 
		doesn't trust!

	All the men laugh, including the "stout prisoner" who laughs 
	the loudest... Keltner hands the stout prisoner the potato, 
	who in turn takes same and places it gently on the window 
	sill just adjacent to his bunk... after placing it on the 
	sill, he gestures ala the trapeze artist after making a super 
	truck, looking for applause... Keltner pats his leg in a 
	gesture of "thank you".  He starts back towards his bunk 
	when the front door of the barracks flings open and the Guard 
	enters.

				  GUARD
		ATTENTION !

	The men jump, but quickly, to their feet, and stand at 
	attention at the front of their bunks, ala inspection in the 
	army.  They are rigid and waiting to hear what's up.  The 
	Guard takes a few steps into the barracks... behind him we 
	see several prisoners carrying bunks waiting to enter the 
	barracks.

				  GUARD
		All the prisoners from the other 
		side of the camp are being moved 
		over to this side of the camp over 
		to this side of the camp.  Barracks 
		"H" will make room for three 
		additional bunks.

	He takes a few steps down the aisle...

				  GUARD
		I want all the bunks moved down toward 
		the far end.  Get them as close 
		together as possible. Now! GET MOVING!

	LONG SHOT

	The men scramble back to their own bunks and immediately 
	begin pulling, shoving, and grumbling comments about being 
	too overcrowded as it is...

				  THE MEN
			(ad lib)
		Gotta have more room... We need more 
		space...  Hey, watch where you're 
		going. This is stupid!

				  GUARD
			(yelling)
		YOU!  You down there at the end...  
		get those bunks right up against the 
		wall.

	CLOSE - HELMUT AND KELTNER

	As bunks are moved towards the far end of the barracks, 
	Keltner and Helmut prepare to move their bunks, the last 
	ones on their side.  Helmut and Adolf, who have already made 
	their move, come up to Keltner to help him with his bunk... 
	Helmut sees that Keltner has help so he decides to back off 
	and hide in his little corner with his pencil and scrap of 
	paper... totally involved with his own pain and his undying 
	fantasy about his ultimate release...

	WIDER SHOT - THE ENTIRE BARRACKS

	The guard looks down the barracks as the men just about finish 
	the moving job...

				  GUARD
		Hurry it up!  Come on, get moving!

	The guard turns towards the door and motions for the SIX 
	PRISONERS to enter the barracks... they enter by pairs, each 
	pair carrying a double-tier bunk.

	Their personal belongings are piled on the bunks and slung 
	over their shoulders in sacks (barracks bags)... the Guard 
	motions for the two bunks to be placed next to Helmut's and 
	one on the opposite side... next to the Stout Prisoner... 
	NOTE:  This arrangement leaves space for one additional bunk 
	right by the door.

	The guard motions for the Stout Prisoner and Herman to give 
	the new arrivals a hand with the placement of their bunks.

				  GUARD
		Get them close.
			(he looks around the 
			barracks)
		You're all going to be nice and cozy 
		in here.

				  STOUT PRISONER
			(in a loud voice)
		Yeah, like triplets before they are 
		born to a mother weighing 98 pounds...

				  HERMAN
		That's what I call cozy!

	The guard smiles, and all the men laugh...

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	The guard starts for the door, satisfied with the 
	arrangements... as he gets the door open, Helmut runs over 
	to catch him before he makes his exit...

				  HELMUT
			(anxiously)
		Excuse me, sir, the papers...  Did 
		they arrive yet?

				  GUARD
			(annoyed)
		They'll have to wait!

	He exits, closing the door behind him.  Helmut, with a look 
	of despair on his face, goes back to his bunk.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT AND KELTNER

				  HELMUT
		You'd think, since he was coming 
		over here anyway, the least he could 
		do was bring the papers with him.

				  KELTNER
		This moving men around has undoubtedly 
		kept him very busy... don't worry, 
		he'll bring them.

				  HELMUT
		I'm sure if I asked him again he'd 
		really become annoyed with me.  Would 
		you remind him for me, please?

				  KELTNER
			(kindly)
		Of course I will.

	Helmut climbs up to his bunk and goes back to his precious 
	paper work.

	WIDER ANGLE

	As the new prisoners make up their bunks and arrange their 
	belongings, the regulars of Barracks H, among them Adolf, 
	Ludwig, Herman and Franz, begin moving towards them to meet 
	them.  Keltner turns to the new white-haired prisoner whose 
	bunk is directly next to his.

				  KELTNER
		I've seen you around the yard, but 
		the others...

				  WHITE-HAIRED MAN
		About thirty of them got here 
		yesterday from the prison outside of 
		Frankfurt.

				  1ST NEW PRISONER
			(who occupies the 
			bunk above the white-
			haired prisoner)
		For the last three months we've been 
		shuttled from one camp to another.

				  2ND NEW PRISONER
			(his bunk is the lower 
			bunk on the direct 
			opposite side)
		Now they're shuffling us from one 
		side to another.  I think they're 
		trying to lose us.

				  HERMAN
		Do you think they're bringing in war 
		prisoners?

				  LUDWIG
		I don't know why they're sending 
		them here...  we're overcrowded as 
		it is.

				  KELTNER
		No, no... it's got to be something 
		else...  Otherwise they would have 
		left the bunks.

				  ADOLF
		It could be possible that he is fixing 
		up the barracks for some of his lady 
		friends.

				  KELTNER
		That many women?

				  HERMAN
			(standing at attention)
		Reverend, we Germans are SUPERMEN!

	All the men break out in laughter at Herman's comment and 
	his actions... but the laughter is cut short as they HEAR 
	the door open again, and they all look in that direction.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	SHOOTING OVER the men onto the door, entering is the same 
	guard that was just there... this time he enters with two 
	more prisoners carrying their bunks.  One of them is JOSEF 
	GALT, a burly bully like man, who knows all the tricks of 
	survival, and ERNST UHLMANN, a think little man with a face 
	like a weasel... they follow the Guard into the barracks 
	proper.

				  GUARD
		ATTENTION !

	The men quickly snap to attention.  The guard indicates for 
	Galt and Uhlmann to put the bunk in the space right by the 
	door.

				  GALT
		We might as well be outside.

				  UHLMANN
		If I get pneumonia, I'll hold the 
		government responsible!

				  GUARD
		With a little luck, you'll both get 
		pneumonia!

	The guard turns and moves towards the door, stops, and turns 
	to see all is well, and exits the door, closing it behind 
	him.

	Galt sits on the lower bunk as Uhlmann sprints up to the 
	upper bunk and looks towards the original men, who are just 
	standing around watching the two new "fish"... then men sense 
	trouble and slowly and quietly return to their own bunks... 
	some of the other men just stare at the two new prisoners...

				  UHLMANN
			(sitting on his bunk)
		It's sure quiet in here...

	WIDER ANGLE

	Uhlmann in his surveying the barracks spots the potato plant 
	on the window sill... next to the Stout Prisoner's bunk... 
	he jumps from his bunk and runs over towards the plant... he 
	takes it from the window sill and yells over to Galt...

				  UHLMANN
		Hey, Galt!  Come over and look at 
		this!

				  GALT
			(coming over to Uhlmann)
		What is it?

				  UHLMANN
		Ain't it cute?

				  GALT
		It's a God damn posie!

	He and Uhlmann burst into laughter...

				  UHLMANN
		Looks kinda sick, doesn't it?

				  GALT
			(examining it)
		It's one of them potato things...  
		and it sure as hell is sick!

				  UHLMANN
		Maybe we should put it out of its 
		misery.

				  GALT
		No, we don't want to do that...  we 
		might break someone's heart.

	He looks around at the other prisoners.

				  GALT
		Whose little plant is this?

	The stout prisoner gets up from his bunk and starts to move 
	forward and challenge Galt... but Keltner jumps from his 
	bunk and gets to Galt first.

				  KELTNER
			(with deep conviction)
		The plant is MINE!

				  GALT
		Is it now?  Tell me precious... do 
		you knit, too?

				  KELTNER
		If necessary, I can... and I do !

	This brings a ripple of laughter from the others... 
	particularly the new prisoners who are delighted at seeing 
	someone stand up to Galt for a change... Galt with a sneer 
	on his face steps out into the aisle to face Keltner square 
	on!

				  GALT
			(to Uhlmann)
		What do you think of that, Uhlmann... 
		he knits!

				  UHLMANN
		Now, if he could just cook...

	Galt and Uhlmann laugh, but they are the only ones that do...

				  GALT
			(coming out of the 
			laugh)
		Can you cook, sweetheart?

	Keltner knows damn well he can't fight the brute, yet he 
	realizes that if he steps down, life not only for him, but 
	for the others in the barracks will be intolerable under 
	Galt's bully rule.  (During the following dialogue, Adolf, 
	Franz, Ludwig, Herman and the Stout Prisoner... easy up a 
	little closer to Keltner and Galt.)

				  KELTNER
		If necessary, I can cook, yes!  Now, 
		if you don't mind, I'll take that 
		plant!

	He holds out his hand... Galt, wearing a deceptive smile, 
	eyes the older man...

				  GALT
		Alright, old man, you really want 
		it?

	He raises his arm over his head with the plant in that hand.

				  GALT
		Go get it!!

	CLOSE - KELTNER

	He looks past Galt at Helmut who is sitting up on his bunk...

	CLOSER - KELTNER

	He looks at Helmut.  His eyes try to encourage Helmut to do 
	something, say something, do anything to show that he is on 
	Keltner's side.

	CLOSE - HELMUT

	He sits up on his bunk, and wants nothing to do with the 
	bully and his pranks... so he goes back to studying his papers 
	and looks up again to catch Keltner's look of disappointment, 
	and as Keltner turns away from Helmut... Helmut realizes he 
	should do something to show Keltner he, indeed, cares... he 
	jumps down from his bunk and grabs Galt by the arm and turns 
	him around... they are now face to face...

				  HELMUT
		Why don't you pick on someone your 
		own size...

				  GALT
			(shocked, but pleased 
			that he finally got 
			a rise out of someone)
		What?

				  HELMUT
			(firmly)
		You heard me!  Give him his plant 
		back, and leave him alone...  He 
		didn't bother you ... and if you 
		have to show your muscle, there's 
		plenty of other guys to pick on!

				  GALT
		You're my size!

	... and with this, Galt smacks Helmut a shot across the mouth 
	that sends him spilling into the corner, half knocked 
	unconcious... he lays there with blood flowing from his 
	mouth...

	Keltner leaves Galt and runs to the corner to see if Helmut 
	is okay.  Galt follows him... Keltner is leaning down checking 
	Helmut... as Galt bends down next to the two of them... still 
	holding the plant.

				  GALT
		He's alright... that'll teach him to 
		keep his nose out of my business... 
		here's your plant!

	Galt makes like he's handing the plant to Keltner, who reaches 
	for it, and as he does Galt slowly stands up making Keltner 
	reach and reach and reach... and as Keltner gets closer and 
	closer, Galt stands to his fullest height... making it 
	literally impossible for Keltner to get it... Franz, Ludwig, 
	Adolf, Herman and the Stout Prisoner (more than likely 
	provoked by Helmut's stand, now circle Galt)...

				  GALT
			(still holding the 
			plant up high)
		Go on, little man, reach for it!

	Keltner, torn between seeing that Helmut is alright, and 
	getting his plant back, tries to get it, and still looks to 
	see that Helmut isn't hurt too bad...

				  HERMAN
			(in a low menacing 
			voice)
		Give it to him!

	Galt looks at him with a menacing stare...

				  ADOLF
		You heard him... give it to him!

				  FRANZ
		You've had your fun... give it to 
		him... NOW!

				  STOUT PRISONER
			(closing in on Galt)
		RIGHT NOW!!

	Galt realizes this is no time for a showdown... and with a 
	childlike smile... grits his teeth...

				  GALT
		Sure, here's your stupid flower or 
		whatever you call it...

	Keltner takes it from him.

				  KELTNER
		Thank you...

	Keltner leans down and picks Helmut up and walks him to his 
	bunk, helps him onto it, and puts the plant on his own bunk...

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	The four men:  Ludwig, Adolf, Franz and Herman stay with 
	Galt, as does the Stout Prisoner... They are clustered around 
	Galt.

				  GALT
		What's the matter with you guys?  
		Can't you take a joke?

				  ADOLF
		What joke?

				  GALT
		Hell, all I was doing was trying to 
		have a little fun.

				  LUDWIG
		Have it with someone else!

				  GALT
		What's so special about him?

				  ADOLF
		That's the Reverend.  Even when they 
		came and dragged him from his 
		church...  he kept right on preaching 
		against them until they knocked him 
		unconscious.

	Galt is silent for a beat.

				  GALT
		Well, how the hell was I supposed to 
		know?

				  HERMAN
		NOW you know!

	Galt shoves his way through the five men and walks beaten, 
	for the moment, to his own bunk... as the men disperse and 
	walk back to their respective bunks...

	CLOSE - GALT AND UHLMANN

	Galt walks over and sits at the edge of his bunk, while 
	Uhlmann swings his legs back and forth from his perched 
	position on the top of his bunk... Galt gives him a stare...

				  GALT
		You and your posies...

				  UHLMANN
		That was close...

				  GALT
		Where were you when I need you?

				  UHLMANN
		I make love, not war!
			(goes giggly over 
			what he just said)
		Hey, that's pretty good... I made 
		that up... Make love, not war!  I 
		bet that would make a good slogan 
		someday...

				  GALT
		Aw, shut up!

	And he smacks his legs up and onto the bunk.

	TWO SHOT - KELTNER AND HELMUT

	Keltner with a wet towel in his hand cleaning the blood-
	dripping mouth of Helmut...

				  KELTNER
		That was really very nice of you, 
		Helmut...

				  HELMUT
		Yeah, nice and STUPID!

	Helmut grabs the towel and throws it to the floor and turns 
	on his side away from Keltner.  Keltner bends down, gets the 
	towel, sits on the edge of his bunk... looks up, wonders and 
	ponders Helmut as we

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BARRACKS H - NIGHT

	The door to Barracks H slowly opens and Helmut peeks through 
	the opening to see that all is clear... he slips out and 
	walks along the dark, dreary alleyway towards the Guard's 
	shack... he moves like a prisoner trying to miss the 
	spotlights in a jail break...

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Helmut gets to the Guards hut... he looks into the window, 
	and sees the Guard he wants... sitting at his desk eating 
	off a tray that has a meal fit for a king on it... including 
	the "doilies"... wine, and a steak that would satisfy six 
	men in Barracks H... Helmut looks around to be sure no one 
	notices him and slowly slips up to the front door of the 
	shack and knocks on the door...

	INT. GUARD'S SHACK - NIGHT

				  GUARD
			(annoyed at being 
			bothered)
		Come in!

	The meek and frightened Helmut enters the shack and walks 
	over to the Guard's desk, and his eyes go immediately to the 
	tray of food.  While the Guard just stares at him... somewhat 
	shocked at his presence in the shack.

				  GUARD
			(breaking the silence)
		What the hell are you doing here?  
		Who gave you permission to leave 
		your quarters?

	Helmut tries to talk as the guard gets louder and louder.

				  GUARD
		Are you some kind of privileged 
		character?

	Helmut nods no...

				  GUARD
		Then what are you doing out of the 
		barracks?

	The frustration of not being able to answer, and the 
	frustrations of being hungry... and the child-like treatment 
	Helmut is getting from this Pig becomes emotionally too 
	much... as he screams...

				  HELMUT
			(turning red)
		If you'll shut your stupid mouth 
		maybe I can answer one of your 
		questions!

	The Guard looks at Helmut in disbelief... but at the same 
	time a little delighted at this chance to show his German 
	superiority... as he slowly gets up from behind the desk and 
	crosses to Helmut, with a sneer that would frighten Rommel...

				  GUARD
			(nose to nose with 
			Helmut)
		I have a STUPID MOUTH?

	Helmut backs away towards the door, and the Guard moves closer 
	and closer to him... backing him up against the door.

				  HELMUT
			(meekly)
		I'm sorry, I didn't mean to raise my 
		voice...

	He bows his head in fear, as well as concern for what he 
	might have done to his chances of release.

				  GUARD
		The volume of your voice isn't the 
		issue...  it's what comes out of 
		your mouth that disturbs me...  maybe 
		you need a little lesson in respect 
		and courtesy...

	And he smacks Helmut across the face with his black glove...

				  GUARD
		... and maybe I've been a little too 
		soft with you...

	He smacks him again, harder... the glove now feels like a 
	sword to Helmut... and his hands hang limp down by his sides.

				  GUARD
		You see, Doork, I knew why you came 
		in here...  I knew why you left your 
		barracks without permission... It's 
		just that I hadn't heard you mention 
		your release papers for so long I 
		had hoped I could hear you begging 
		once more...

				  HELMUT
			(in a whisper)
		I'm sorry...

				  GUARD
			(mimicking him)
		I'm sorry, I'm sorry... You're a 
		sorry specimen of a human being... 
		that's what you are...

	And he smacks him this time with all the force he can 
	muster...

				  GUARD
		Now, I will help you to your quarters, 
		Herr Doork, here you will stay, and 
		pray for release papers that may, or 
		may not, ever come...

	This wakes Helmut's soul and he becomes erect and stonefaced 
	at the words the guards just said... this look infuriates 
	the guard even more... he grabs Helmut by the scruff of the 
	neck... like grabbing a wet cat to be thrown out of the 
	house... and he opens the door and pulls Helmut by the back 
	of the office... out the door, down the three steps and onto 
	the ground... and pulls him like a sack of potatoes to the 
	barracks doorway...

	EXT. BARRACKS H - DOORWAY - NIGHT

	Helmut is just about beaten at this point as the guard opens 
	the door of the barracks and pulls Helmut into the doorway, 
	and his body stops on the threshold.

	INT. BARRACKS H - NIGHT

	SHOOTING OVER the men onto the doorway... in the deep b.g. 
	the sad body and figure of the man lays in the doorway, as 
	the Guard kicks him in the ribs, unmercifully...

				  GUARD
		Now, get inside where you belong and 
		don't ever let me catch you doing 
		anything without permission again.

	Helmut slowly gets up... in pain and practically crawls to 
	his bunk... having to pass all the men, almost as though he 
	were ashamed .. he gets to his bunk, and tries vainly to get 
	up to the top where he lives... Keltner helps him... and as 
	he settles in his place...

	CLOSE - THE GUARD

				  GUARD
			(yelling across the 
			barracks)
		Reverend!  If you don't watch that 
		idiot, we may have to get him a 
		keeper!

	The guard storms out the door... slamming it shut.

	CLOSE - KELTNER AND HELMUT

	Keltner leaning over the side of Helmut's bunk whispering... 
	as the other men go back to their respective chores and 
	whatever they were doing when the guard stormed in...

				  KELTNER
		Helmut, Helmut, how could you think 
		of doing such a thing? I begged you 
		not to irritate him...  and that I 
		would ask him about your papers...  
		that wasn't smart, Helmut... not 
		smart at all...  as a matter of 
		fact...

				  HELMUT
			(gritting his teeth)
		Leave me alone!  ... and mind your 
		own business... Just leave me be...

	Keltner knows this is nothing more than Helmut's dismay and 
	pain in his heart talking... The kindly man drops down to 
	his own bunk... just shaking his head... as if to say, how 
	can I help him?  as we:

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BARRACKS H - DAY

	The same Guard is motioning for the men to hurry and get 
	outside... he is standing at the doorway to the barracks and 
	the men are moving out into the ice cold morning as briskly 
	as they can... the Guard moves inside after the last man has 
	made his exit...

	INT. BARRACKS - DAY

	SHOOTING OVER the Guard as he looks around, we see Keltner 
	coming out of the toilet area, rushing because he's late... 
	he throws his towel on his bunk, and as he does... he sees 
	what stops him in his tracks...

	KELTNER'S POV

	It is Helmut still sound asleep in his bunk...

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Keltner moves towards Helmut to wake him...

				  GUARD
			(in a sotto voice)
		Reverend, let him sleep... you move 
		out, I'll take care of this...

	Keltner reluctantly starts to move out towards the front 
	door, as the Guard passes him on his way to Helmut's bunk... 
	Keltner goes out the door... the Guard sneaks over towards 
	the bunk where Helmut is asleep and very sneakily slips the 
	cover off Helmut's body... then proceeds to open the window 
	above his head and the window alongside... and across the 
	way and opens the back door... which is adjacent to the toilet 
	area... and walks out of the barracks leaving the front door 
	wide open...

	EXT. BARRACKS H - DAY

	All the men are lined up for inspection, they are all looking 
	straight ahead as the Guard walks down the line.

	All except Keltner who can't help but look in the direction 
	of the barracks where he knows Helmut is still sleeping.  He 
	throws a glance at the guard as if to say... why?  Why are 
	you doing this?  Why did he leave Helmut sleeping, usually 
	the one thing that would send the guard up a wall... why is 
	he allowing this to happen?

				  GUARD
			(as he finishes his 
			walk)
		You are a sick looking group of 
		things...  I can't even call you 
		human...  because you're not... you're 
		all lice...  DISMISSED!

	The men break up and go about their business, they move in 
	all directions, but Keltner starts for the doorway to the 
	barracks and is detoured by the guard who knew he would, as 
	he stands in the way of Keltner who has to turn away and go 
	about his business... the Guard peeks into the barracks.

	INT. BARRACKS - GUARD'S POV - DAY

	Helmut still sleeping...

	EXT. BARRACKS - CLOSE - GUARD - DAY

	He is delighted... he grabs the door and slams it shut with 
	a bang that would wake the dead... then opens it again and 
	walks off...

	INT. BARRACKS - CLOSE - HELMUT - DAY

	He jumps from out of his hard sleep... foggy and unsure about 
	where he is, what time it is and he looks around and sees 
	the barracks are empty... and he panics... but he is also 
	shivering... the barracks feel like the inside of a meat 
	truck refrigerated somewhat below zero...

	Helmut grabs his pants from the front of his bunk, pulls the 
	cover over him and tries to get the pants on under the 
	cover... It is cold!  (Photographically, we can show "cold"... 
	Props:  vapor/smoke.)

	He gets his pants on and jumps down onto the cold floor and 
	dances from the ice-like floor, he bends down looking for 
	his socks and shoes... he wears just a tee-shirt...

	Having trouble finding both shoes, he grabs the blanket again 
	and covers himself with it, while searching for the other 
	shoe...

	He finds the other shoe and proceeds to put them on... takes 
	a beat and sees he has no socks on... reaches under the bank 
	and pulls out the pair of socks... which stand straight up 
	(from the cold ... he holds them in the air, and drops one 
	at a time and they sound like "pans" hitting the floor... he 
	takes one and blows warm air from his mouth into the socks, 
	one at a time, which warms them... (Props:  the socks need 
	discussion!)

	He then proceeds to put his shoes on and puts one on, and 
	then the other... now wearing both shoes he starts to tie 
	the laces... he pulls them straight away to tie and they 
	stand straight up!  (Props:  this is done with leather laces, 
	pure leather... it works without any unnecessary rigging!)

	INSERT - THE STANDING STRAIGHT LACES

	BACK TO SCENE

	He finally gets them tied and starts, still sleepily, into 
	the toilet area... (We can go for a great sound joke here.)  
	He steps into the latrine, closes the door and we HEAR the 
	SOUND of crushed ice being poured into the bowl... he flushes 
	and we HEAR what might sound like an ice crusher... he steps 
	out of the latrine and walks over to the basin and turns the 
	water on.

	INSERT

	The water spigots... they both read "COLD".

	BACK TO SCENE

	And as he takes some water on his hands to his face... it is 
	"cold" and his face just freezes from the pain of the cold... 
	he looks around and sees the little metal ashtray, that looks 
	like a small bowl or a tin from a used shaving cream lather 
	soap... he fills it with water.. and to show his ingenuity, 
	he takes a lighter from his pocket, places the tin on the 
	edge of the sink and lights the fire under the tin (which 
	couldn't possibly hold more than a handful of water) and 
	proceeds to heat same...

	Once he is satisfied that it is at least warmer than the 
	spigot supplied, he grabs for the tin which is so hot from 
	the burning, he screams in another type pain... the pain of 
	"HOT" hurting... he decides to flick his fingers in the tin 
	bowl and splash some of the water on his face (which is by 
	now, just drips of water)... brushes his teeth with his finger 
	and soap... straightens his hair and exits the toilet to his 
	bunk to get his shirt... another "ICE COLD" item... he feels 
	how cold it is, and doesn't have the courage for another 
	climate blast... he rolls up his shirt and places it under 
	his armpit to warm it... as it hits under his arm... the 
	cold just about wipes him out... he decides to sit on it... 
	and he does.

	CLOSE - THE GUARD - AT THE DOOR

	He's been peeking all the while... He figures he's had his 
	laugh, and it's the first time we see he can laugh... he 
	steps into the barracks area, and yells:

				  GUARD
		Doork!  Move it out, and on the 
		double!!

	Helmut jumps with fright, unravels his shirt, runs towards 
	the open door putting on his shirt as we

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. BARRACKS H - NIGHT

	Most of the men are clustered around their bunks, and in the 
	dull light we see some of them in the aisles, talking, playing 
	cards... while most of the others are whistling, clapping, 
	and laughing as Uhlmann does his silly little clog dance... 
	it is apparent the ugly episode between Galt and Uhlmann has 
	been forgotten for the moment.

	The lights are hung from cords down off the ceiling and for 
	a complex this size it could use ten... there are but two.

	Uhlmann is having the time of his ignorant life... the more 
	the men applaud, the more he "clog dances".

	MED. CLOSE SHOT - LUDWIG AND ADOLF

	They are both seated on their top bunk, Adolf enjoying the 
	poor dance Uhlmann is giving as Ludwig looks down the aisle 
	towards Helmut's bunk.

				  LUDWIG
			(nudging Adolf)
		It looks like Helmut found some new 
		ears to listen to his Super Star 
		fantasies...

	Adolf takes a look, shrugs his shoulder, as if to say I 
	couldn't care less... and goes on watching the action of 
	Uhlmann and the other men...

				  LUDWIG
			(to himself, but for 
			Adolf to hear as 
			well; a la 
			Shakespeare, mimicking 
			Helmut)
		Ringling Brothers would have done 
		anything for me to appear with them 
		but I had to do what was best for 
		me!

	CLOSE - HELMUT AND THE FOUR NEW PRISONERS

	The four new men are surrounding Helmut on the top of his 
	bunk listening to his bragging.

				  HELMUT
		So I told Mr. Ringling if he wanted 
		"Helmut" he'd have to bring his circus 
		to Germany... I am a German, I told 
		him, and my responsibility is to my 
		own people who are my biggest fans.

				  1ST PRISONER (NEW ONE)
		Did you really say that?

				  HELMUT
			(proudly)
		Of course I did... they offered me 
		anything...  anything I wanted to go 
		with them.

				  2ND NEW PRISONER
		Hey! I saw the circus in Berlin about 
		four years ago...  Didn't  you make 
		your entrance in a long tail coat 
		with a pair of tails on the jacket 
		about fifty feet long?  Sure!  And a 
		funny Little clown at the very end 
		carrying the tails like a woman's 
		train?

	Helmut studies the prisoners glare and decides he couldn't 
	even remember the clown he saw was Gustav the Great, why 
	not?  No one would ever know... and he nods with a kind of 
	studied humility... yes.

				  2ND NEW PRISONER
		You were great!

	Helmut eats it up.

				  2ND NEW PRISONER
		You should have seen him... You'd 
		never know it was him... with the 
		long tails  and white tie... red 
		nose...  long hair...  and a battered 
		top hat... with the hair hanging way 
		down to his shoulders...  and, ah, 
		let me see... oh, yeah... your mouth 
		went from ear to ear.

				  HELMUT
			(softly)
		Right!

				  3RD NEW PRISONER
		How do "clowns" ever come up with 
		such ideas for faces and make-up?

				  HELMUT
		It doesn't happen overnight... it 
		takes years and years... You try 
		many faces, then finally you hit the 
		one that's just right for you.

				  4TH NEW PRISONER
		My kids will never believe this, I 
		can't wait to... tell...

	His voice trails off as he realizes the hopelessness of what 
	he was about to say.  This puts a damper on the discussion 
	and the men start to break up and get down off the bunk.  
	Helmut, seeing his captive audience leaving... panics.

				  HELMUT
			(emotionally)
		Wait, let me tell you some other 
		things...  I mean things that are 
		really exciting and...  please!  
		Please... let me just have a few 
		more...

				  1ST NEW PRISONER
			(ignoring Helmut 
			completely)
		What's going on with those guys?

	He's looking off down the aisle where Uhlmann has his 
	audience... The four prisoners move out into the aisle to 
	get a better look, leaving Helmut perched on his bunk with a 
	pleading and broken look of despair...

				  HELMUT
			(a last attempt)
		Did you know "clowns" literally 
		bequeath their faces to their sons, 
		or sometimes to...

	He realizes it's futile as the four new prisoners move towards 
	Uhlmann and the others down the aisle...

				  3RD PRISONER
		Come on, let's see what's such fun...

	He moves and the others move along with him.  Helmut thinks 
	about joining them, and starts to move off his bunk but his 
	body won't respond... he just hangs there limply... his head 
	lowered, a sad man.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	SHOOTING OVER the men placing Helmut in the very deep  b.g. 
	as we see the four new prisoners walk over to watch the 
	action...

	MED. CLOSE - UHLMANN, GALT, KELTNER, AND OTHERS

	Uhlmann is just finishing his dance with a spin, when he 
	finally gets dizzy and topples over on one of the bunks.  
	All the men applaud wildly.  Uhlmann laying half down and 
	half up on the lower bunk he landed on, breathing heavily... 
	yells over to Galt...

				  UHLMANN
		Hey, Galt, it's your turn, how about 
		doin' one of your belly dances for 
		us?

	All the men agree and start yelling for Galt to do it... 
	Galt moves out into the center of the aisle in the clearing 
	made by the men, and holds up his hands for silence... they 
	quiet down and Galt looks around until he spots Keltner.

				  GALT
		Reverend?

	The men become very still, they look from Galt to Keltner 
	and back to Galt, their eyes reflecting suspicion of him, 
	wondering what he's up to now.  Galt is fully aware of this.

				  GALT
		Well, Reverend, what do you think?  
		Would a little belly-dancing be too 
		much for the boys?

	Keltner studies Galt for a beat, then accepts his offer of a 
	truce.

				  KELTNER
			(moving over towards 
			Galt)
		A little fun is what we need... so...  
		if you'll all hold the noise down, 
		I'll join in.

	A hushed cheer goes up from the men as Keltner stands besides 
	Galt.  Galt holds his hands over his head and nods for Keltner 
	to do the same thing.  The Reverend does, and now Galt begins 
	undulating his hips.  Keltner studies the move for a beat 
	and then does the same thing but with comical awkwardness.  
	Franz starts playing a slow sensuous rhythm on his harmonica.  
	The men clap and whistle softly.

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	He is sitting upright on top of his bunk, watching what Galt 
	has Keltner doing, a look of disgust passes his face as he 
	turns away from what he'd been watching and gets busy with 
	his papers and figuring again.

	MED. SHOT - GALT, KELTNER

	They are just finishing their dance.  The men applaud wildly 
	but softly... Keltner, puffing, moves over to the side and 
	sits on one of the bunks to catch his breath.  Galt takes a 
	few bows, and the men react with applause and whistling that's 
	beginning to take on "noise" proportions... Keltner motions 
	for the men to hold it down... and they do.

				  4TH NEW PRISONER
		Say, why don't we get the clown to 
		do something?

				  GALT
		A clown?  Who's a clown??

				  HERMAN
		You've heard of "Helmut Doork".  
		That's him down there!

				  LUDWIG
		Don't waste your time.  You'll never 
		get the Great Doork to do anything.

	WIDER SHOT

	as he starts walking towards Helmut's bunk...

				  1ST NEW PRISONER
		Oh, I'm sure he will!

	The others follow right behind.  There is a look on Keltner's 
	face like he would like to stop them, but between his puffing 
	and his certainty that Helmut will be alright, he stays where 
	he is.

	CLOSE - ADOLF

	as he walks with the others.

				  ADOLF
		You're wasting your time.  He doesn't 
		perform for the likes of us... he'll 
		turn you down.

				  LUDWIG
		He's right, we've been asking him 
		for three years...  I have a feeling 
		he only does his little routines for 
		the crowned heads of Europe.

				  ADOLF
		And, of course, the BIG heads of 
		Berlin.

	There is general laughter... as the group arrives at Helmut's 
	bunk.

	CLOSE - HELMUT

	He sees something's going to happen, he puts his papers away 
	and sits upright... waiting... his eyes catch Galt's eyes 
	peering at him.

	Galt tells it all with his eyes... This one isn't "sacred" 
	to the men... he might just be the pigeon Galt's been hoping 
	for... the one every bully looks for, for his own brand of 
	fun.

				  1ST PRISONER
		How about it, Doork?

				  HELMUT
			(swinging his legs 
			around ready to jump 
			down)
		I'd like to, but I can't... really... 
		I can't.

				  GALT
			(strongly)
		Can't?  Did I hear you say you can't?

				  HELMUT
			(it stops him in his 
			tracks; he stays up 
			on the bunk)
		I'd like to do something... but...
			(pointing to the 2nd 
			New Prisoner)
		He can tell you... He's seen me 
		work...  I need props... make-up...  
		I work with a lot of different 
		things...

				  2ND NEW PRISONER
		That's right... I did... and he does!

				  HELMUT
			(in fast)
		Sure, tell them... I can't just do 
		anything...  I need lights, props, 
		my costume.

	Galt doesn't like no for an answer...

				  GALT
			(gritting his teeth)
		Now, me and these... gentlemen...  
		we don't expect you to do your "act", 
		just a little something that'll give 
		us a laugh, that's all.

	Keltner moves in from o.s. and stands at the back of the 
	group watching and listening.

				  LUDWIG
			(to all the men)
		Aw, forget it... and that's probably 
		his problem...  he's forgotten how!

				  GALT
			(trying to suck him 
			in)
		Wait a minute, you guys... show people 
		have to be in a mood...
			(to Franz)
		Play a little music, like in a 
		circus...

	Franz starts playing his harmonica... slowly...

				  GALT
		There!  Ain't that nice?  Don't it 
		put you in a mood?

				  HELMUT
			(getting fed up)
		I TOLD YOU!  I need things to do my 
		act.

				  2ND NEW PRISONER
		Hey, Doork, what about that drunk 
		routine... that was funny...

	Helmut looks at him puzzled... he can't think or remember 
	anything at this point... certainly not anything relating to 
	any of the previous lies he's told...

				  GALT
			(pacifying his head 
			off)
		Yeah, that drunk thing...  that does 
		sound funny...

				  HELMUT
		I still need many things... props 
		and...

				  2ND NEW PRISONER
			(puzzled)
		I don't remember you using anything 
		in that drunk routine.

				  GALT
			(starting to fume)
		Hey... are you trying to fool us?

	With this Keltner moves in and up to Galt.

				  KELTNER
		Leave him alone!

				  GALT
		Stay out of this, Reverend. We're 
		not doing anything... We just want 
		him to join in the fun.

				  UHLMANN
			(to the men)
		Right!  If a Reverend can give us a 
		laugh, why not a clown?

	All the men ad lib their agreement with what Uhlmann just 
	said; it appears that they are all on Galt's side, and Keltner 
	knows it.

				  KELTNER
			(to Helmut, softly)
		It doesn't have to be anything 
		special... a little dance, maybe?

				  HELMUT
			(taking it all out on 
			Keltner)
		Like that disgusting exhibition you 
		did?  Oh, no... not me!

				  4TH NEW PRISONER
		Go on, Doork, so I can tell my kids.

				  HELMUT
		Can't you get it through your heads, 
		I need...

				  GALT
			(firmly)
		WE need you to give us a laugh.

	Galt grabs Helmut's jacket and pulls him off the bunk, nose 
	to nose to him...

				  GALT
		So... TRY!

	Galt has Helmut by the neck portion of the jacket, practically 
	choking him to death... his vice-like hands are closing in 
	on his throat and Helmut's trying vainly just to breathe...

	One of the prisoners starts pounding his feet and making a 
	march-like noise yelling from the other end... "So try!"... 
	"So try!"... "So try!"... "So try!"... the other prisoners 
	in the barracks pick up the chant and the stomping... Keltner 
	doesn't even hear the racket they've started because of his 
	concern for Helmut being choked to death... He tries to loosen 
	Galt's hands from Helmut's throat.

				  KELTNER
		That's enough, leave him alone!

				  GALT
		Stay out of it, Reverend!

	Galt spins Helmut around so that his back is facing the aisle 
	and he walks him into the center area... the other men feeling 
	this violence happening, and watching.  Helmut being choked, 
	triggers all of their venom and their hate and they really 
	come on strong... stomping, yelling...

				  THE MEN
			(ad lib)
		Choke him harder...  see if that's 
		funny!  Make him dance! Hey, Doork!...  
		be funny now! He don't look so funny 
		to me!  He sure as hell looks funny 
		to me!  Hey, Galt, pull his string 
		and make the dummy funny!

	And they stomp and they stomp and they stomp... "So try!"... 
	"So try!"... They get louder and louder... Helmut is kicking 
	his legs, which are off the ground, and Galt won't let go.

	CLOSE - HELMUT

	His face is turning color... he hasn't a lot of air left in 
	his lungs... and Keltner is practically hanging onto Galt 
	trying to get his hands loose... and Galt could carry another 
	three men without batting an eye.  Galt puts him down slowly, 
	in the middle of the aisle, so that just his feet touch the 
	ground, but he keeps his hands around his throat.

				  GALT
		Your public is calling, clown... 
		now, clown!

	WIDER SHOT

	SHOOTING OVER Galt, Keltner and Helmut, we see the door of 
	the barracks slam open and bang against the wall making more 
	noise than anything all the men made together, and they all 
	freeze...

	MED. CLOSE - THE GUARD

	He stands in the doorway, legs spread apart, hands on his 
	waist... and he is wearing a raincoat, the barracks has become 
	totally silent... all that is heard is the rain pecking away 
	on the roof.  Galt has let go of Helmut who just lays on the 
	floor with Galt and Keltner on both sides of him...

				  GUARD
			(walking slowly into 
			the barracks)
		What is going on here?
			(to Helmut)
		On your feet!

	Helmut gets up, dizzily, just about getting oxygen back into 
	his system...

				  GALT
			(like a little boy)
		He was showing us some of his funny 
		clown falls...

	The Guard surveys the faces of the others as they stare back.

				  GUARD
		Because of all the noise coming from 
		in here -- I have been called up 
		front to explain...  I don't like to 
		be called up front...  I don't like 
		to have to explain...
			(menacingly)
		And, you might not like it, either.
			(a beat)
		Back to your bunks, all of you...  
		Turn out the lights, and keep it 
		QUIET !

	As the guard turns to the door to go, Helmut takes a step 
	forward about to stop the guard, Keltner grabs his arm and 
	turns him the other way... the Guard exits closing the door, 
	quietly behind him... The men start to disperse... Galt gives 
	Helmut a "I'll get you for this" look and returns to his own 
	bunk with Uhlmann almost up his ass following... Keltner 
	leads Helmut back to their bunk.

				  HELMUT
			(whispering)
		I was just going to ask him about 
		the forms... my release...

				  KELTNER
			(shaking his head)
		That was not the time, believe me!

	Keltner sits Helmut down next to him on his lower bunk, as 
	Helmut rubs his throat, and tries swallowing a few times...

				  KELTNER
		Hurt much?

				  HELMUT
			(beaten)
		No, I'm alright... thank you.

	They both sit in silence... Helmut breaks the silence...

				  HELMUT
		Johann, why do they pick on me?  
		I've never done anything to them.

				  KELTNER
		You've never done anything for them!

	Helmut dislikes Keltner's remark and gets up from the lower 
	bunk and starts up to his.  He gets to the top bunk and starts 
	to get onto it, stops and whispers to Keltner.

				  HELMUT
		You think I should have performed?

				  KELTNER
		The men would have appreciated it.

	Helmut rolls into his bunk, the lights go out and he lies on 
	his back staring at the ceiling.  Keltner sits on the side 
	of his bunk and takes his shoes off... periodically the rays 
	from the searchlights revolving outside cross the windows to 
	momentarily flood the barracks with light.  After a few 
	seconds, Helmut leans over to whisper to Keltner.

				  HELMUT
		Johann!

				  KELTNER
			(he stands up, eye 
			level with Helmut)
		What is it?

				  HELMUT
		They don't believe me, do they?  I 
		mean about being a clown?

				  KELTNER
		Oh, I'd say you've convinced most.  
		However --
			(a long beat)
		There is one you haven't convinced...

	Helmut stares at Keltner, knowing full well what's coming... 
	yet doesn't have the courage to take the chance that it might 
	be another thought... so he waits...

				  KELTNER
			(gently)
		You, Helmut... you!

	CLOSE - HELMUT

	The truth of Keltner's charge hits Helmut with an overpowering 
	force.  He looks at Keltner for a beat... his eyes filled 
	with pain, then slowly turns away from him, leaving him 
	standing there as we PAN with Helmut and HOLD on...

	CLOSE - THE WINDOW

	The rain is pouring down.

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	FULL SHOT - YARD - DAY

	It is the next morning, a chilly, damp day following a night 
	of rain.

				  LOUDSPEAKER (O.S.)
		Attention!  Attention!  All prisoners 
		will assemble immediately in the 
		yard.  All prisoners will assemble 
		immediately in the yard. Attention!  
		Attention!

	The loudspeakers repeat the command.  Across the muddy, puddle 
	splotched yard, a barbed wire barricade about six feet high 
	has been erected, dividing the camp in two.  A number of 
	guards patrol the fence on both sides.

	EXT. BARRACKS H - WINDOW - DAY

	Uhlmann is looking out into the yard.  He motions to someone 
	to "take a look at this".

	INT. BARRACKS H - DAY

	Galt has just arrived at the window where Uhlmann is standing.

				  UHLMANN
		They've put up barbed wire!

	MED. SHOT - FAVORING HELMUT, KELTNER

	They look at each other in wonder as they start into the 
	aisle.  The men in the barracks are frantically trying to 
	organize themselves.

	EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

	The prisoners are pouring out of the barracks doorway.  Galt 
	and Uhlmann are already standing outside as Helmut, Keltner, 
	Herman, Adolf, Franz, Ludwig, Stout Prisoner, New Prisoners, 
	join them.  All look o.s. momentarily speechless at what 
	they see.

				  GALT
		What the hell... ?

	FULL SHOT - YARD - PRISONERS' POV

	Beyond the fence we see men, women and children standing in 
	groups near the barracks on that side of the camp.  The SOUND 
	of children crying can be heard.

	VARIOUS SHOTS - MEN

	As they quickly scurry to line up in front of their own hut.

				  STOUT PRISONER
		Youngsters!  They've got youngsters 
		over there.

				  YOUNG PRISONER
		Women!

				  ADOLF
		Another fence!

	MED. SHOT - PRISONERS - FAVORING KELTNER

	Helmut stands next to him.

				  HELMUT
		What does it mean?  What do they 
		need a fence for?

				  KELTNER
			(shaking his head)
		Misery loves company.  Looks like 
		they're going to deny us even that.

	The Guard is shoving the late-comers into place.

				  GUARD
		All right.  All right, move.  Hurry 
		it up.  Move.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	SHOOTING ACROSS the prisoners in f.g. toward the new fence.  
	Guards move among the men, herding them into lines.  On the 
	other side of the fence, we can see the new arrivals lining 
	up, being prodded into place by Guards.

	LONG SHOT - PRISON YARD - DAY

	On both sides of the fence, the prison inmates have assembled 
	in the wet, forbidden yard.  On one side are the regular 
	prisoners, who watch the guards warily as they straighten 
	their lines.  On the other side are the new prisoners -- 
	about two hundred frightened Jews of all ages, including 
	thirty or forty children and a number of very old men and 
	women.  They stand in absolute silence as the loudspeakers 
	blare again, except for the crying children.

				  LOUDSPEAKER
		Attention!  The Commandant issues 
		the following special order:  the 
		north side of the camp is now 
		temporary quarters for non-Aryan

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	SHOOTING THROUGH the booted, outspread legs of a soldier 
	guard in f.g. toward the line of prisoners behind him.  One 
	woman holds a child of about three who cries inconsolably.

				  LOUDSPEAKER
		The Commandant issues the following 
		special order:

	As the announcement is read, the guard's legs turn around, 
	and he walks away from the CAMERA toward the woman.  He stands 
	before her menacingly, and she clutches the child closer to 
	her in a futile attempt to hush its crying.

				  LOUDSPEAKER

	MED. SHOT - PRISONERS

	SHOOTING along line of prisoners from barracks H to show 
	their various reactions as the announcement continues -- 
	disdain, surprise, sympathy and relief.  The guard stands 
	with his back to the line at the end farthest from the CAMERA.  
	Galt is near the CAMERA.

				  GALT
			(under his breath)
		Jews!

	Prisoners nearest to Galt eye him questioningly.

				  LOUDSPEAKER
		... strictly prohibited.  Any 
		violation of this order will be 
		severely punished.  Heil Hitler.

	The loudspeakers go dead.  The prisoners stand silently 
	studying the new arrivals across the yard.  The new prisoners 
	self-consciously file back into their huts on the other side 
	of the fence.  As the prisoners begin to break rank --

				  GUARD
		Prisoners from barracks H remain in 
		line.  Barracks H will remain in 
		line.

	The prisoners turn and look in direction of the Guard as 
	they straighten their lines.  The guard paces slowly along 
	the line inspecting it silently.  On the fringes of the scene, 
	we can see prisoners from other barracks gathering to see 
	what their fellow convicts are in for.

	MED. CLOSE SHOT - GUARD

	Finally he stops and contemplates his shabby charges with 
	disgust.

				  GUARD
		I said last night I didn't think I 
		would enjoy being called up to account 
		for the noise coming from barracks 
		H.  I can tell you this morning I 
		didn't enjoy it.

	He walks down the line, looking at each man.

				  GUARD
		I don't know what caused the trouble 
		last night, but I'm not blaming you 
		entirely.
			(fatherly)
		I failed you.  I should have seen 
		that you all have much too much energy 
		for the confined life you lead here.
			(he smiles benevolently)

				  GUARD
		We're going to correct that.  I've 
		been told that energy comes from 
		food.

	MED. SHOT - PRISONERS

	Their faces reflect that they know what is coming.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	SHOOTING PAST the line of prisoners in f.g. to the Guard, 
	who has paused to let his words sink in.

				  GUARD
		So... to help you... all rations are 
		canceled for the next... forty-eight 
		hours.

	A hushed ripple of ad lib grumbling and growling rolls along 
	the line of prisoners.

				  GUARD
		And, if that doesn't quiet you down, 
		I'll think of some other ideas you'll 
		like even less. I'm going to make 
		this barracks the quietest in the 
		camp.
			(roaring)
		Is that clear?

	The prisoners are silent but their faces register their 
	resentment.

				  GUARD
		Now, don't blame me.
			(with sly meaning)
		I didn't start the trouble last night.

	The truth of what he has said is reflected in the faces of 
	the men.

				  GUARD
		Fall out.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING HELMUT, KELTNER

	As they stand with the other prisoners, watching the guard 
	move off.  Keltner looks worried, the others are angry, Helmut 
	seems undecided as his eyes follow the guard.

				  HERMAN
		Bastard!

				  STOUT PRISONER
		I can't go without food. I'll starve.

	Suddenly Helmut makes up his mind and starts off after the 
	Guard.  Keltner, sensing the mood of the men, puts a 
	restraining hand on his arm, whispers to him hoarsely.

				  KELTNER
		Helmut, don't.

	But Helmut shakes him off and hurries away.

	The other prisoners notice where he is headed and exchange 
	looks.  Keltner shakes his head.  Galt's eyes narrow as he 
	watches Helmut run off after the guard.

				  GALT
			(loudly)
		He's the one we can thank for the 
		diet.

	MED. SHOT - GUARD - MOVING

	The CAMERA MOVES BACKWARD as the Guard strides toward it, 
	his face sour.  Behind him we can see Helmut running to catch 
	up to him.  When he is close enough...

				  HELMUT
		Sir?  Corporal...

	The guard stops and turns so abruptly that Helmut almost 
	runs into him.

				  GUARD
		What?

				  HELMUT
			(obsequiously)
		Doork.  Helmut Doork.  Remember?  
		The papers... You said... Remember 
		the special forms for the Gestapo to 
		review my case.

				  GUARD
		No papers.

	He stalks off.  Helmut starts to say something more but thinks 
	better of it.  Crushed, he starts back towards his barracks, 
	head down.  He walks sadly for several steps, then looks up 
	and stops, his expression changing to one of uneasiness.

	MED. SHOT - PRISONERS - HELMUT'S POV

	A dozen of Helmut's barracks-mates, including Galt, Uhlmann, 
	Adolf, Ludwig, Herman, the Stout Prisoner, several of the 
	New Prisoners, are drifting across the yard towards him, and 
	the looks on many faces bode no good for Helmut.

	FULL SHOT - HELMUT, PRISONERS

	The men converge and form a half circle around him.

	As the men close in on him, he moves back until we cna see 
	the barbed wire fence behind him.  Helmut senses their 
	disposition and remains warily silent.  Keltner and Franz 
	stand slightly behind the pack.

				  GALT
		What'd you say now, Mr. Doork, 
		Almighty!
			(to men)
		Last night he wouldn't give us a 
		laugh.  Today they won't give us 
		food.

				  LUDWIG
			(venomously)
		What were you doing?  Making a deal 
		with your guard pal to slip you some 
		food?

				  HELMUT
			(indignantly)
		No!  I was asking him about the forms 
		he'd promised to get me.
			(admonishing)
		Because of last night... I'm not 
		getting them.

	Keltner, seeing how disappointed Helmut is, moves up through 
	the group.

				  KELTNER
			(encouragingly)
		When this blows over, Helmut, we'll...

				  LUDWIG
			(interrupting)
		Don't feel sorry for him.  He's got 
		no one to blame but himself.  The 
		whole thing was his doing.

				  ADOLF
		He's been telling us how great he 
		is; how funny.  Why?  Why couldn't 
		he have done a trick or two for us?

				  UHLMANN
		The Reverend did a turn.  What's so 
		special about him?

	The men voice agreement... Helmut should have performed.  
	Helmut starts to go around one end of the semi-circle but 
	the men bar his way.

				  KELTNER
		Don't start anything here.  We're in 
		enough trouble.

	The other prisoners in the b.g., those who have remained in 
	the yard to see what was going to happen to the men of 
	barracks H, sense trouble, the kind they want no part of, 
	and begin scurrying back to their own barracks.

				  UHLMANN
		We're not starting anything, we're 
		finishing something.

				  GALT
		We've decided Doork here is going to 
		keep us laughing so hard we won't be 
		able to hear our stomachs growling.

				  STOUT PRISONER
		Better hurry it up, clown.  'Cause 
		my stomach's growling already. Can 
		you hear it?

				  HERMAN
		Hear it!  The whole place hears it.

	The men take a few steps toward Helmut as they call for him 
	to perform.

				  MEN
		Yeah, Doork, do a trick. How about 
		that night in Munich when they 
		wouldn't stop laughing.  How about 
		it, Doork? Come on, just a little 
		trick.  Give us one laugh.  That's 
		all we're asking for.  Come on, 
		Helmut, do something.

	Helmut, hoping to stall the inevitable, still hoping to 
	preserve for a while longer his beautiful myth of being a 
	great clown, holds up his hands for the men to be quiet.  
	Franz interpreting the gesture as giving in to the demands 
	of the men...

				  FRANZ
			(excitedly)
		He's going to do it!  He's going to 
		do it!

	The men quiet down and move back a few steps to give Helmut 
	room.

				  HELMUT
			(grandly)
		Nothing pleases an artist more than 
		to perform.  I'm going to do a real 
		show for you.  All I ask is that you 
		give me a little time...  time to 
		get things together...  things I can 
		use as props...  I'll even try to 
		make a costume, and...

				  ADOLF
		You don't need a costume.  We've got 
		imagination.

				  (TO MEN)
		Right?

	Murmurs of agreement.

				  HERMAN
		Do the drunk pretzel like the kid 
		suggested last night.

				  GALT
			(commanding)
		And do it now, clown.  No more 
		stalling.

	Helmut, still trying to hold on to his dream of greatness, 
	draws himself up proudly and begins to move forward.

				  HELMUT
		Let me through.

				  ADOLF
		Aren't we good enough for you?

				  LUDWIG
		He'd do his tricks fast enough if 
		his guard pal asked him.  Wouldn't 
		you, Doork?

	As the mention of the word "guard" the mood of the men turns 
	ugly.

	MED. SHOT - PRISONERS - HELMUT'S POV

	Their faces show their determination that Helmut will perform 
	or... else.

				  KELTNER
		Do something, Karl.  For God's sake, 
		do something.

				  GALT
		And be sure it's funny.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT, GALT

	Helmut is frightened.  He strains to look beyond the men for 
	help.  He opens his mouth to scream for the Guard, but Galt 
	puts his hand over Helmut's mouth.

				  GALT
			(his face pressed 
			close to Helmut's)
		You make us scream... scream with 
		laughter...  or I'll tear you to 
		shreds on the wire.

	Galt presses Helmut right up to the barbed wire fence so he 
	can feel the barbs in his back.

	FULL SHOT - HELMUT, MEN

	Galt takes his hand away from Helmut's mouth.  Helmut doesn't 
	utter a sound.  He knows that Galt and the men mean business 
	and he now must do something.  He nods his head.

				  HELMUT
		All right... all right.

	The men move back to give him room.  Frantically, he tries 
	to think of something to do... he knows it must be great... 
	or else his myth will explode.  He walks around in a little 
	circle, trying, trying to think of something.  Finally he 
	faces them.  He bows his legs and pretends he's a bow-legged 
	man trying to walk a high wire, but he's so frightened the 
	result is pathetic, not funny.

	PAN SHOT - PRISONERS

	The camera works across their faces, which are expressionless.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT

	Seeing that he is getting no reaction from his "audience", 
	Helmut tries something else.

	He pulls his shirt over his head and walks around like a 
	headless man.  He pretends to trip over some unseen object, 
	peers through the front of his shirt at it, and stamps on 
	the object.  Again he tries to walk over it, and again he 
	slips.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT, MEN

	as Helmut starts to repeat the same routine, many of the men 
	are openly contemptuous.  Galt wears a smirk.  Keltner, unable 
	to watch Helmut's degradation, moves away.  Others express 
	their disappointment, their disdain.

				  MEN
		If he's Germany's greatest clown, 
		God help the Fatherland.  Doork, the 
		Great!  You got paid for that?  To 
		go without food is bad enough, but 
		to have to watch that!

				  2ND NEW PRISONER
			(accusingly)
		You're not the clown I saw.  You 
		lied.  You're big all right.  A big 
		liar.

				  4TH NEW PRISONER
			(contemptuously)
		And I was going to tell my kids!

				  UHLMANN
		He's no clown.  Not even a bad one.

				  HELMUT
		I am.  I am a clown!

	They move away from him.

				  HELMUT
			(continuing)
		Give me a chance.  I just got started.

	But the men continue to walk away.  Helmut tries to do a 
	hand stand, but his hands slip in the mud, and he lands 
	ignominously on all fours.  When he looks up, only Adolf, 
	Galt and Uhlmann remain.

				  ADOLF
			(sadly)
		That's what we've been eating our 
		hearts out to see!
			(a beat)
		You stink.  You really stink.

				  HELMUT
		I... I slipped.   I can do it.

	Seeing the disbelief on their faces, Helmut becomes almost 
	hysterical.  He is still on his knees.

				  HELMUT
		I am a clown.   I am.  I am.

	He pounds on the ground in frustration.  Galt spits 
	contemptuously, and the three start to leave.  Galt turns 
	back, looks down at Helmut.  Very deliberately, he comes 
	forward to stand at a mud puddle.

				  GALT
		Doork the Great.

	With that he kicks a shower of mud directly into Helmut's 
	face.

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	The mud splatters over his face.  He cries out.  His hands 
	go to his eyes instinctively.  he kneels there, rocking back 
	and forth in misery.  Then from o.s., we HEAR a tiny, 
	tentative laugh -- the tiniest laugh ever heard.  Helmut 
	looks up quickly.  He isn't sure that he heard it.

	Then it comes again, a little stronger.  He looks around 
	quickly to see who has come back to taunt him, to ridicule 
	him.

	LONG SHOT - PRISON YARD - HELMUT'S POV

	The yard is empty except for a few prisoners from other 
	barracks way off on the other side.

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	He is puzzled.  Then again he hears the laugh o.s.  He turns 
	slowly to look behind him.

	MED. SHOT - BOY - HELMUT'S POV

	On the other side of the fence stands a wide-eyed boy of 
	about eight, who is watching Helmut timidly.  The ragged 
	youngster laughs again, hesitantly, as if unsure what Helmut 
	is doing is supposed to be funny, but finding it so 
	nevertheless.

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	He looks uncertainly at the youngster.  Is the child 
	ridiculing him, too?  He leans over the mud puddle and looks 
	at his reflection.  He likes what he sees.  The mud on his 
	face looks almost like a primitive clown mask.  Very 
	deliberately Helmut scoops up more mud and puts a blob of it 
	on the end of his nose.  He waits for the child's reaction.

	CLOSE SHOT - BOY

	His eyes are laughing, but his little lips are pressed tight 
	together.  He has been taught not to make sounds... not even 
	sounds of laughter.  But finally what he is looking at becomes 
	too much for him and the laughter spills out between his 
	lips as they form a smile.  He laughs delightedly now, 
	satisfied that Helmut is being purposely amusing.

	TWO SHOT - HELMUT, BOY

	Helmut gets to his feet, bows slightly and stiffly to the 
	child, and then attempts another hand stand.  This time he 
	holds himself up for a moment and then deliberately allows 
	himself to fall on his back in the mud.

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	As he lands, he quickly glances off towards his barracks, 
	but from the look of disappointment on his face, we know 
	that none of his barracks mates are watching.  When he hears 
	more laughter from o.s., he quickly rolls on his side to 
	look.

	MED. SHOT - CHILDREN - HELMUT'S POV

	Two more youngsters have joined the first, and all are 
	laughing excitedly.  The first child jumps up and down, 
	clapping his hands.

	WIDER ANGLE - FROM THE FENCE - FAVORING HELMUT

	Helmut gets up and bows, more deeply this time, a tribute to 
	the children's vindication for his claim that he is a clown.  
	He turns toward the direction of his barracks.

				  HELMUT
			(screaming at top of 
			voice)
		Come back, damn you, come back.  The 
		children... they're laughing.  They're 
		laughing.  I am a clown.  I am a 
		clown.

	He turns back to the children and again bows.  He quickly 
	leans down, looks at his reflection in the puddle, and scoops 
	up a handful of mud which he plasters on his nose to make a 
	bulbous, artificial proboscis.  He turns back to the children 
	and in pantomime, pretends to see a fly buzzing about and 
	tries to swat it.  The imaginary fly buzzes closer.  The 
	CAMERA MOVES UP to --

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	As the "fly" lands on his nose.  He looks cross-eyed at the 
	mud blob, then swats at it.  The blob falls off.

	MED. SHOT - CHILDREN

	There are now nine or ten youngsters at the fence, all 
	squealing with delight.

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	He bows again, and as his head comes up he looks o.s. toward 
	his barracks, still hoping that someone will be watching his 
	"great" success.  When he turns back to the children, we see 
	that he continues to smile -- while tears course down his 
	cheeks through the mud still caked on them.

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. MESS HALL - DAY

	The last barracks on the open end of the camp on the political 
	prisoners' side.  Outside the building is a low counter 
	arrangement with two prisoners behind it serving mush and 
	black bread to a long line of men, all of whom carry bowls 
	and spoons.

	This time in mid-July, three weeks after the incident at the 
	fence.  The day is bright and hot.  Our ANGLE FAVORS Helmut 
	as he nears the prisoner who is serving up the mush.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT

	As he moves up to be served and holds out his bowl.  The 
	prisoner - messman spoons a blob of mush into it.  Then he 
	looks around quickly and, before Helmut can pull back his 
	bowl, slops another half spoonful into it with a wink at 
	Helmut, who gives him a grateful smile in return.  Helmut 
	moves on to the bread server, who gives him a big grin as he 
	slips two pieces of bread into the bowl on top of the mush.  
	Helmut hurries away, the CAMERA FOLLOWING him.

	He walks strangely, as if having trouble controlling his own 
	feet.  Helmut ducks around the corner of the barracks nearest 
	the mess hall, then peers cautiously back into the main yard.  
	Satisfied that he hasn't been noticed, he quickly puts one 
	piece of bread into his pocket and takes out his spoon.  
	Holding the second piece of bread beneath the bowl, he wolfs 
	down a few mouthfuls of the mush.  Then he smooths out the 
	remainder with the spoon to make the mush appear untouched. 
	 He places the one slice of bread back on top of it, and 
	studies the end result.  Nodding approval, he licks his spoon 
	clean and puts it back in his pocket.  He goes back around 
	the corner of the barracks into the main yard and heads for 
	the next building.

	CLOSE SHOT - BARE FEET

	This pair of massive feet are the property of the Big 
	Prisoner, a massive hulk of a man.

				  OLD PRISONER'S VOICE
		Don't know how you can go without 
		shoes.  Soles of my feet are too 
		sensitive.

	The CAMERA PANS UPWARD to the Big Prisoner and an Old 
	Prisoner, sitting against the side of their hut.  The Old 
	Prisoner, a frail man, with shirt off, is finishing his mush.

				  BIG PRISONER
		It's my stomach that's sensitive.

				  OLD PRISONER
			(looking o.s., smiles)
		Here comes your second helping.

	As Helmut's feet walk into FRAME and stop next to the Big 
	Prisoner, we see the reason for his peculiar walk.  He is 
	wearing a pair of enormous shoes, many sizes too large for 
	him and cut open along the soles from the toes to the insteps 
	so that they flap as he moves along.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as Helmut joins them and holds out his bowl of bread and 
	mush to the Big Prisoner.

				  HELMUT
		Here.

	Still grinning, the Big Prisoner puts his empty bowl on the 
	ground beside him and takes Helmut's bowl.  Holding the bread 
	aside, he digs into the mush.  Helmut watches him eat, his 
	own hunger written all over his face.  After a few bites, 
	this makes the Big Prisoner a little self-concious.

				  BIG PRISONER
		How're the shoes?

				  HELMUT
		Perfect.

	The Big Prisoner nods and goes back to eating, satisfied 
	that he has made a fair bargain and shouldn't be embarrassed 
	about taking Helmut's food.

				  HELMUT
		Don't forget the bowl.

	The Big Prisoner, his mouth full of mush, only nods.  Helmut, 
	tearing his eyes from the food, moves off.  The Big Prisoner 
	watches him go.  Suddenly, he looks down at the departing 
	Helmut's feet, and his face darkens.

				  BIG PRISONER
			(irked)
		Hey, Doork!

	Helmut stops and turns as the Big Prisoner shoves himself 
	away from the hut and goes to him, staring down at the shoes.

				  BIG PRISONER
		My shoes!

	The Big Prisoner reaches out with the large toe of one bare 
	foot and lifts up the flapping toe of one of Helmut's shoes.  
	He lets it drop again.

				  BIG PRISONER
		I said you could use 'em, not ruin 
		'em.

				  HELMUT
		I had to fix them this way...  for 
		the act, you know.  Wait till you 
		see how funny it is.

				  BIG PRISONER
		Yeah.  But will I feel like laughing 
		when it gets cold!

				  HELMUT
		Don't worry.

				  BIG PRISONER
		Worry!  I'm the one who'll get frost 
		bitten toes, not you.

				  HELMUT
		When I return them, they'll be like 
		new.  I promise.

	The Old Prisoner has finished his mush and puts his bowl 
	down on the ground and moves forward to join Helmut and the 
	Big Prisoner.

				  BIG PRISONER
		For what you've done to my shoes I 
		should get more food.

				  OLD PRISONER
		He's got to have something to eat.

	The Big Prisoner looks at him questioningly.

				  OLD PRISONER
			(continuing)
		If he gives you his other meal...  
		he'll starve to death.  Then you 
		won't get anything.

	This reasoning makes sense to the Big Prisoner.

				  BIG PRISONER
			(to Helmut)
		Remember... you fix them before you 
		bring 'em back.

				  HELMUT
		Promise.

	Helmut shakes his head "yes", turns and quickly hustles off 
	in the direction of his own barracks, the CAMERA MOVING with 
	him.  After a few steps.

				  BIG PRISONER'S VOICE
		Doork!

	MED. SHOT - BIG PRISONER - HELMUT'S POV

	The Big Prisoner looks at Helmut, then at the piece of bread 
	Helmut had given him.  His manner is self-conscious.  He 
	tosses the piece of bread to Helmut.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT, BIG PRISONER, OLD PRISONER

	Helmut catches the bread, his smile expressing his thanks.  
	The Old Prisoner puts his arm around the Big Prisoner's 
	shoulder, while the Big Prisoner tries not to show that he 
	is pleased with himself for his "generous" act.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT

	Taking bites of the bread, Helmut, rather jauntily, lopes 
	off toward his own barracks.  As he moves among the other 
	prisoners, the CAMERA MOVING with him, we see many of them 
	point or nod toward Helmut and smile good-naturedly.  Helmut 
	is completely unaware of them, so lost is he in his own 
	thoughts.

	EXT. BARRACKS H - MED. SHOT - KELTNER, FRANZ, HERMAN - DAY

	They sit in the shade beside their barracks.  Herman is using 
	his empty bowl as a fan.  Keltner is just finishing his food.  
	Franz is examining his jacket, his empty bowl beside him on 
	the ground.

				  FRANZ (IRRITATED)
		I mean it this time.

				  KELTNER
		Don't tell us.  Tell him.

	Franz holds up the tattered jacket to show that a button is 
	missing.

				  FRANZ
		What am I supposed to do? Use pins?

				  HERMAN
		Who has a pin?

	Keltner chuckles.

				  FRANZ
		You can laugh.  He isn't always after 
		you for something.

				  KELTNER
		No?

	He fishes in a pocket and pulls out a large piece of chalk, 
	holds it up.

				  FRANZ
		What's that?

				  KELTNER
		Chalk.

				  FRANZ
		What for?

				  KELTNER (SHRUGS)
		Says he can mash it into a powder 
		and put it on his face.

	Herman stops fanning along enough to ask...

				  HERMAN
		Where'd you get it?

				  KELTNER
		From a guard.

	Astonished, Herman and Franz look at him questioningly.

				  KELTNER
			(lowers his voice)
		A very bad Nazi.  Still has a heart.

	Herman and Franz smile.  Then Franz holds up his tattered 
	coat.

				  FRANZ
		I wish he'd have a heart and use 
		someone else's coat. Or better yet -- 
		his own.

				  KELTNER
			(looking o.s. and 
			nodding)
		Ask him.

	WIDER ANGLE - FAVORING HELMUT

	As he comes flapping up, still munching on the piece of bread 
	given to him by the Big Prisoner.  Keltner holds out the 
	chalk to him.

				  KELTNER
		Finally got it.

	Helmut takes it and examines it in a very professional manner.  
	Herman and Franz exchange looks.  Keltner waits for Helmut 
	to speak.

				  KELTNER
			(a little annoyed)
		Isn't that what you wanted?

				  HELMUT
			(holding up the chalk)
		This will do more for the act than 
		anything.  Wait'll you see!

				  KELTNER
			(a sigh of relief)
		For a moment there you had me worried.

				  FRANZ
			(indicating bread 
			Helmut's nibbling on)
		I see you got smart.

				  HELMUT
		His conscience bothered him.

				  KELTNER
		I thought he would kill you when he 
		saw what you had done to his shoes.

				  HELMUT
			(sheepishly)
		So did I.

	The men laugh.

				  FRANZ
		I don't know what I'm laughing at...  
		look at what he's doing to my coat.
			(holds it up)
		Look at it!  Yesterday a button off.

	And you've got it ripped here under the arm.  Besides all 
	that falling down isn't doing it any good.

				  HELMUT
			(firmly)
		I've got to have it.  It is the only 
		one I can get on and still is tight 
		enough to look funny.

				  FRANZ
		At the rate you are tearing it up, 
		it's going to look a lot funnier.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	SHOOTING PAST Helmut and group and in f.g. toward the main 
	yard, where we see Galt and Uhlmann approaching.  During the 
	ensuing dialogue, Galt spots Helmut, nudges Uhlmann and 
	together they come toward him.

				  KELTNER
		Give in, Franz.  You know he's going 
		to talk you out of it again.

				  HELMUT
		I'll be careful.  I swear. Besides, 
		I've got to have it. I explained 
		before...  a clown can't change his 
		costume.  It's his trademark.

				  FRANZ
		I know... I know... but...

	Galt and Uhlmann join the group, looking to start trouble.

				  GALT
			(interrupting)
		Why should he give it to a Jew clown?  
		Right, kid?

				  FRANZ
		That's got nothing to do with it.

				  GALT
		What's the matter with you bastards 
		anyway?  All he ever did for us was 
		cause trouble, but for them...
			(nodding toward the 
			other side)
		... he can't do enough.
			(a beat)
		I say he's one of them.

				  KELTNER
			(coolly)
		If he were, he'd be over there

	Through this Helmut remains silent -- his eyes focused on 
	the coat.

				  GALT
		That's where he belongs.

	Franz and Keltner get to their feet.  Herman remains seated.

				  FRANZ
		What're you so hot about?  It's no 
		skin off your...

				  UHLMANN
			(cutting in)
		We've got a good reason for not liking 
		them.

				  GALT
		If it wasn't for them... we wouldn't 
		be in here.

	This surprises the men.  Herman gets to his feet.

				  HERMAN
		What'd you mean?

				  UHLMANN
		A bunch of them got picked up with 
		papers we'd sold them.   And what'd 
		they do?  Turn us in, they did.  The 
		ungrateful...

				  KELTNER
		So that was it!  Counterfeit papers.  
		I can imagine the prices.

				  GALT
		Supply and demand, Reverend.  Supply 
		and demand.

	Deliberately, Franz hands his coat to Helmut.

				  FRANZ
		Take it, Doork -- anytime you want 
		it.

	Helmut accepts the coat... nodding his head in the gracious 
	manner of a ruler accepting homage from a faithful subject.  
	He turns smartly and slowly struts away with as much dignity 
	as he can muster in his big shoes which flap with every step 
	he takes.  The others stand and stare at Galt and Uhlmann.

				  UHLMANN
		What's so terrible about what we 
		did?  Lot of them got out of the 
		country with our papers.  They were 
		damn good counterfeits.

	Keltner, without a word, turns and goes off after Helmut.

				  GALT
			(calling to Keltner, 
			very proudly)
		And what's more, we never charged 
		for children.  Never.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT, KELTNER

	As Keltner catches up with Helmut.  The CAMERA MOVES BACK as 
	they walk along the side of the barracks toward the door.

				  KELTNER
		I've been meaning to ask you.  Heard 
		anymore about the request for a review 
		of your case?

	Helmut doesn't hear him as he's deep in his own thoughts.

				  HELMUT
		Did you hear the laughs I got 
		yesterday?

	Keltner nods.

				  HELMUT
		Not just from the children... but 
		the adults, too.

	You know where a lot of clowns make a big mistake?  They 
	play just for the children.

	They forget... it's the parents, the adults that buy the 
	tickets.

				  KELTNER
		Never thought of that.

	Helmut stops, faces Keltner, a sly smile on his face.

				  HELMUT
		They said I couldn't come up with 
		anything new.

	Keltner looks puzzled.

				  HELMUT
		At the circus.  Schmidt and the rest.  
		Wait'll they see my act now.  It's 
		funny.  Really funny.
			(a beat)
		Isn't it?

				  KELTNER
		The children certainly enjoy it.

	Helmut begins to move along again with Keltner following.

				  HELMUT
		What I needed was time.  Time to 
		concentrate on new material.  A man's 
		got to have time alone.

				  KELTNER
			(glancing around)
		You call this being alone?

	Helmut takes a few more steps then stops short.

				  HELMUT
		Do you think... maybe... they'd let 
		me go to other camps and entertain?

	Keltner is about to say something... but shrugs his shoulders.  
	He knows there's not much point in trying to make Helmut 
	look at things the way they really are.  Helmut starts to 
	walk again.

				  HELMUT
		I'd have to get to the Commandant.  
		Would need his permission.

	They arrive at the steps to the barracks.  Helmut swings 
	Franz's coat over his shoulder as he starts up the steps.

				  HELMUT
		If you have time later, I'd like you 
		to see something I've been working 
		on.  I hunch down and do a tiny 
		soldier parading.  Think they'll 
		like it?

				  KELTNER
			(pointedly)
		Who?  The adults?

				  HELMUT
			(matter of fact)
		The children, of course.

				  KELTNER
		I thought the smart clown only played 
		to the adults.

	Helmut, caught in a contradiction of his own "theory" of 
	clowning, gives Keltner an annoyed look, then goes into the 
	barracks letting the door slam behind him.

	CLOSE SHOT - KELTNER

	As he stands at the bottom of the steps -- he shakes his 
	head and smiles as he marvels at the change taking place in 
	the pompous Helmut as the little gentle clown within him 
	struggles to emerge.

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. PRISON YARD - PAN SHOT - CHILDREN - DAY

	The CAMERA is PANNING across the faces of about forty children 
	behind the fence as they watch Helmut o.s.  Some of them are 
	laughing; some clapping; some squealing with glee, and a few 
	just watching quietly, but with laughter in their eyes.  
	Behind them, near the barracks on the non-Aryan side, a number 
	of adults also are looking on, but they hang back, fearful 
	that getting too close to the fence might provoke the always 
	anticipated wrath of the guards.

	EXT. PRISON YARD - FULL SHOT - DAY

	We see now that Helmut on his side of the fence is performing 
	for the children on the other side of the menacing barbed 
	wire fence.  Behind him, also at a safe distance because 
	they still aren't certain of the official reaction to all of 
	this, a number of his fellow political prisoners are watching 
	his antics.  But, in spite of his talk about the importance 
	of playing to the adults -- it is the children that Helmut 
	plays to -- and it is for their laughter that he listens.  
	The CAMERA MOVES IN to --

	MED. FULL SHOT - HELMUT

	And we see that he has used the chalk to whiten his face.  
	With charcoal he has blackened his eyebrows, formed a wide 
	black mouth and drawn lines down over his eyelids to his 
	cheekbones, giving him the appearance of a clown at once sad 
	and happy.  At the moment he is coatless, but Franz's coast 
	lies nearby on the ground.  For the stunt he is doing now 
	Helmut carries the remains of an old broom and a piece of 
	cardboard.  He is trying to sweep a small heap of dirt he 
	has gathered onto the cardboard, but each time he tries, the 
	dirt goes over the cardboard and he must sweep it into a 
	pile again.  After a few attempts he feigns exasperation and 
	ponders the problem.  Inspiration comes.  He sweeps the dirt 
	into a pile again, bends over and very carefully sweeps it 
	into the front of one of his shoes, holding up the split top 
	to let it in.  This accomplished, he is very proud of himself, 
	but when he tries to take a step, some of the dirt comes 
	out.  Frustrated, he ponders again, and again has an 
	inspiration.  He removes the shoe and puts it under his arm.  
	But as he walks away with it, all the dirt slides out through 
	the open toe.  The children roar with delight.

	CLOSE SHOT - LITTLE GIRL

	She is a flaxen-haired youngster of about five who holds a 
	weathered rag doll as she jumps up and down for sheer joy at 
	Helmut's performance.

	CLOSE SHOT - LITTLE BOY

	He is a completely delighted boy of perhaps seven.  Each 
	time Helmut does something he particularly enjoys he hugs 
	himself and spins around.

	CLOSE SHOT - BROTHER AND SISTER

	The girl is no more than four; the boy about eight.  He clings 
	to her hand as they watch Helmut, unsmiling, perhaps not 
	understanding.  The boy looks at his sister, and a tiny smile 
	tugs at her mouth.  The boy smiles back.  The girl giggles.  
	The boy laughs outright.  They have re-discovered happiness.

	They look back at Helmut, both laughing.

	CLOSE SHOT - SISTERS

	The older girl is ten or eleven; her sister five or six, 
	tugs at her arm, and the older girl bends down to her.  The 
	younger girl whispers to her, pointing to Helmut, and the 
	older girl picks her up.  The little one puts her arms tightly 
	around her sister's neck.  Both laugh merrily.

	MED. FULL SHOT - HELMUT

	He is putting on Franz's too-small jacket.  He tries to button 
	it, but it won't go around him.  He sucks in his belly, but 
	then his pants begin to slip, and he grabs at them with an 
	embarrassed look at the laughing children.

	Deciding that the only way to button the coat is to hunch 
	his shoulders, he tries that, but now his shoulders must 
	remain hunched.  He manages to pick up the broom and puts it 
	over his shoulder, playing soldier.  But when he tries to 
	snap to attention, the coat pops open again, bringing another 
	roar of laughter from Helmut's audience.

	Now he marches a few steps toward the CAMERA, stops, snappily 
	puts the rifle down at rest position and salutes -- knocking 
	himself flat.  Another roar of laughter.  As it swells, we --

	PAN SHOT - JEWISH PRISONERS

	The laughter o.s. continues to swell as the CAMERA PANS across 
	the faces of the adult Jewish prisoners huddled near their 
	huts.  They smile, fearfully at first, then break into 
	timorous laughter.

	ARYAN PRISONERS - PAN SHOT

	As the laughter swells even more, the CAMERA MOVES over the 
	faces of the political prisoners on Helmut's side of the 
	camp.  They, too, are laughing -- some tolerantly; some at 
	Helmut rather than with him, but they are laughing.

	As the laughter continues to SWELL, the CAMERA PANS over to 
	yard-guard.  He is trying very hard not to laugh.  The result 
	is a self-conscious giggle.

	As the laughter grows even louder, the CAMERA PANS as though 
	wafted on the waves of laughter, up to a guardtower, and we 
	see two rifle-armed soldiers in the tower watching the 
	performance below them.  They gesture in Helmut's direction 
	and laugh.

	The CAMERA continues to PAN over to the administration 
	building and UP to an open window on the second floor.

								   CUT TO:

	INT. COMMANDANT'S OFFICE - FULL SHOT - DAY

	LT. SCHARFF, handsome, mid-30's, stands with his back to 
	CAMERA at an open window in a small, but luxuriously furnished 
	office.  The window through which he is looking opens onto 
	the prison yard.  An AIDE pokes his head in the doorway.

				  AIDE
			(in a loud whisper)
		He's coming back down the hall.

	Scharff nods, quickly closes the window, gives a look around 
	the room, and follows the Aide out.

								   CUT TO:

	INT. COMMANDANT'S OUTER OFFICE - FULL SHOT

	As Scharff comes through the door from the adjoining room.  
	The Aide is standing in front of a small desk.  Scharff takes 
	his position beside the door into the outer office.  They 
	wait.  After a beat, the room's other door opens and in comes 
	COL. HEINRICH BESTLER, a slightly built, pinch-faced SS 
	officer in his 50's.  Scharff and Aide spring to attention 
	and give him the salute.

				  SCHARFF AND AIDE
		Heil Hitler.

				  BESTLER
		Heil Hitler.
			(striding into his 
			inner office as he 
			passes Scharff)

				  BESTLER
			(continuing)
		Come in.

								   CUT TO:

	INT. COMMANDANT'S OFFICE - FULL SHOT

	Bestler goes directly to the desk and sits down.  Scharff 
	stands at attention just inside the door.

				  BESTLER
		Oh, stand at ease.  And, close the 
		door.

	Scharff closes the door and moves over to stand near the 
	desk.

				  BESTLER
		I don't have to tell you why your 
		Commandant was relieved of his command 
		here. This prison is a disgrace.  
		Disgrace! The latitude allowed by 
		him will not be tolerated by me.  
		Understand?

	Scharff nods his head.  Bestler gets up from the desk and 
	walks around it.

				  BESTLER
		That includes the staff.  I'm going 
		to turn this place into a model 
		prison, a credit to the Reich.   
		Understand?

	Scharff again nods his head.

				  BESTLER
		Speak up.

				  SCHARFF
		Yes, Colonel.

	Bestler returns to his desk, sits, and opens a folder.  He 
	glances up to study Scharff.

				  BESTLER
		This isn't the first prison the SS 
		has had to take over from the 
		military. Military men are too soft 
		to deal with those...
			(he nods toward the 
			window)
		Scharff starts to speak but quickly 
		changes his mind.

				  SCHARFF
		Yes, sir.

				  BESTLER
		You were about to say something?

				  SCHARFF
		Oh... I... was just going to say 
		that I didn't hold with the soft 
		treatment of the prisoners.

				  BESTLER
		Good!
			(taking papers from 
			folder)
		Our first order of business is to 
		prepare...

	He is interrupted by the SOUND of laughter o.s.  He turns 
	slightly and looks curiously at the window, then turns back 
	to read from the papers in the folder.

				  BESTLER
		Our first order of business is to 
		prepare all non-Aryan prisoners for 
		shipment in two weeks.

				  SCHARFF
		Where are they being sent, Colonel?

				  BESTLER
		Work camps.

	Again the SOUND of laughter from o.s. and Bestler looks 
	quickly at the window, irritated.  Scharff, uncertain of his 
	superior's reaction, tries to cover up.

				  SCHARFF
			(speaking a little 
			louder)
		But we have about 40 children, some 
		only babies, with more scheduled to 
		arrive tomorrow or the next day. 
		They're not going to be much use in 
		a work camp.

				  BESTLER
			(his attention diverted 
			back to Scharff)
		I'm aware of that.  This order covers 
		only the adult prisoners over fifteen.  
		We won't have to wet nurse the 
		children for long.  Other plans are 
		being made for...

	Again he is interrupted by the laughter o.s.

				  BESTLER
		What is that?

	Before Scharff can answer, Bestler goes to the window and 
	opens it.

	PRISON YARD - LONG SHOT

	SHOOTING PAST Bestler through the window, we can see Helmut 
	performing for the children.  Bestler watches for a moment.

				  BESTLER
		What is that supposed to be?

	BESTLER, SCHARFF - MED. SHOT

	Scharff goes to the window and looks over Bestler's shoulder.

				  SCHARFF
		That!  Well, you see, sir, one of 
		the prisoners used to be a circus 
		clown.  Sometimes he gives a little... 
		well...  a sort of show -- for the 
		children.

				  BESTLER
			(turning away from 
			window)
		A show!  Is this a prison camp or a 
		traveling circus!
			(he looks out window 
			again)
		Am I correct in assuming that those 
		children are on the non-Aryan side 
		of the camp?

				  SCHARFF
			(almost in whisper)
		Yes, sir.

				  BESTLER
			(leaving window)
		And the... buffoon?  A German?

				  SCHARFF
		Yes, Colonel.

	Bestler sits on the side of the desk and looks at Scharff, 
	who tries very hard not to show how uncomfortable he is.

				  BESTLER
		Am I to believe you aren't aware of 
		the general order absolutely 
		forbidding fraternization?

				  SCHARFF
			(not worried)
		I know about it, sir.

				  BESTLER
		Close the window.

	Scharff carefully closes the window.  Bestler walks around 
	desk to stand leaning against the wall.

				  BESTLER
		Just what do you think fraternization 
		means, Lieutenant Scharff ?

				  SCHARFF
		Communication.   Social contact.  
		Giving aid, talking...
			(shrugs helplessly)

				  BESTLER
		How long has this been going on?

				  SCHARFF
		Just the last two or three weeks.

				  BESTLER
		And the Commandant approved?

				  SCHARFF
		Well, sir, children are very hard to 
		handle.

				  BESTLER
		This clown!  Who is he?

				  SCHARFF
			(trying hard to 
			remember)
		It's... I know.  It's Doork, the 
		Great.

				  BESTLER
		Not his clown name, you idiot.  His 
		number.  His identification.

				  SCHARFF
		If I have the Colonel's permission 
		to leave, I will check it at once.

				  BESTLER
		Later.  Right now I want these 
		performances halted.  Understand?

				  SCHARFF
		Yes, sir.

	Bestler begins shuffling papers from the folder.  Scharff, 
	uncertain whether he has been dismissed or not, hesitates.  
	Bestler glances up.

				  BESTLER
			(shouting)
		Immediately!

				  SCHARFF
		Yes, sir !

	He salutes and bolts from the room, almost crashing into the 
	door in his flight.

								   CUT TO:

	PRISON YARD - FULL SHOT - DAY

	Shooting past the children in f.g. to Helmut through the 
	fence, as he bows to the applauding youngsters.  Behind him 
	we can see a number of soldier-guards coming through the 
	cordon of watching prisoners, and waving them to disperse.  
	They do so reluctantly, as the guard from Helmut's barrack 
	moves forward to Helmut, who is just about to start another 
	routine.

				  GUARD
			(shouting)
		That's all.  Show's over.  Everybody 
		clear out.

	Helmut stops, startled.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT, GUARD

	ANGLED to include children across the fence.

				  HELMUT
		What's wrong?

				  GUARD
			(to Helmut)
		Get back to the barrack.
			(to children)
		You heard me.  Show's over.

	The children don't move, but stand staring at Helmut as if 
	waiting for him to tell them what to do.  This frustrates 
	the guard, who isn't accustomed to being questioned.

				  GUARD
		Go on.  Get away.

	Still the children refuse to budge.  Angry, the guard goes 
	close to the fence, waving his arms at them.

				  GUARD
		Move, damn it, before I come over 
		there and...

	The youngsters scuttle back a few feet fearfully, but there 
	they stop, their eyes still on Helmut.  The guard turns to 
	Helmut.

				  GUARD
		Get them moving before somebody gets 
		hurt.

	Helmut goes up to the fence and speaks to the children softly.

				  HELMUT
		That's all the show for today.  Go 
		back inside.

	The children back away with long faces.  Finally convinced 
	that Helmut is through, they turn and wander back toward 
	their barracks, but with many a backward look at him.  Helmut 
	continues to encourage them, as the guard looks on.

				  HELMUT
		That's right now, go along.  I'll 
		see you tomorrow.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  
		Until tomorrow.

	Many of the children wave to him.  The guard takes Helmut by 
	the arm, turns him toward the barrack and hustles him off.

	MED. TWO SHOT - HELMUT, GUARD

	The CAMERA MOVES BACK as they come toward it, the guard firmly 
	propelling Helmut along.

				  GUARD
		Get inside and take that stuff off 
		your face.

				  HELMUT
		I don't understand.  What's the 
		matter?

				  GUARD
		Orders.  No more shows.

				  HELMUT
		You mean... not ever?

				  GUARD
		That's right.

				  HELMUT
		But we weren't doing any harm.

				  GUARD
		The Commandant thinks you are.

				  HELMUT
		The Commandant?

				  GUARD
		The new Commandant.  He minds.

				  HELMUT
		Just because I make them laugh a 
		little...

				  GUARD
		You know the rule... no mixing with 
		Jews.

				  HELMUT
		I wasn't mixing!  I was only...

	The guard stops him and turns him so that they are face to 
	face.  The CAMERA MOVES UP TO --

	TIGHT TWO SHOT - HELMUT, GUARD

				  GUARD
			(quietly, threatening)
		Look, it's not my order.  It's the 
		Commandant's.
			(more kindly)
		Now do what I tell you and save 
		yourself a lot of grief.

	He pushes Helmut toward his barrack and then turns and walks 
	off, the CAMERA PULLING BACK to --

	WIDER ANGLE

	Helmut watches the guard go, then, dejectedly, shuffles toward 
	his barrack.  As he nears it, Keltner, Franz, Adolf, Herman, 
	Ludwig, and the other regulars intercept him.

	MED. SHOT - GROUP

	They crowd around Helmut, anxious to know what's happened.

				  FRANZ
		What happened?

				  HELMUT
			(still bewildered)
		He says I've got to stop -- with the 
		children.

				  KELTNER
			(nodding)
		I've been expecting it.

				  LUDWIG
		Because they're Jews?

				  KELTNER
		Because of the laughing.

				  HELMUT
		Why should that bother them?

				  KELTNER
		When you rule by fear, laughter is 
		the most frightening sound in the 
		world.

	Silently the men walk up the steps and into the barrack, the 
	CAMERA PANNING with them until we...

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. PRISON YARD - FULL SHOT - DAY

	It is a warm, sunny afternoon and most of the prisoners on 
	both sides of the fence, are out warming their weary bones.  
	On the Aryan side, a number of prisoners, including Ludwig 
	and Herman, are having a makeshift soccer game using a bound 
	bundle of rags for a ball.  They play with fierce rigor for 
	such emaciated men, yelling at each other and kicking up 
	clouds of dust as they try to work off their frustrations.  
	On the non-Aryan side of the fence, the children, now about 
	50 in number, are grouped near the wire barricades staring 
	across it, their faces dour.  It appears they are watching 
	the game.

	MED. LONG SHOT - CHILDREN

	Shooting past the soccer players in f.g. toward the fence.  
	Through the men we can see the children, but the play moves 
	away from them.  They continue to stare straight ahead, 
	obviously watching something else.  Suddenly many of them 
	press close to the fence straining to see.

								   CUT TO:

	EXT. BARRACK "H" - CHILDREN'S POV

	Helmut can be seen standing in the doorway.  After a beat, 
	he quickly retreats back into the barrack.

								   CUT TO:

	INT. BARRACK "H" - DAY

	The CAMERA MOVES BACKWARD down the aisle between the bunks 
	as Helmut walks dejectedly down the aisle, nervously fingering 
	his white ascot.  The barrack is empty except for Keltner, 
	who is arranging the sprouts of his potato plant over a little 
	trellis of sticks.  Helmut turns and walks back up the aisle 
	to stand in front of Keltner.

				  HELMUT
		I can't go out there.  I can't take 
		another day of them staring at me.

				  KELTNER
		They'll get over it.  Disappointment 
		is no stranger to those children.

				  HELMUT
		They look at me as though it was all 
		my fault.  Haven't they been told 
		why I can't...

				  KELTNER
		I'm sure they have.

				  HELMUT
		Then why do they stare?

				  KELTNER
			(holding up the plant)
		It's amazing how a thing like this 
		can feed off itself.  Think how lucky 
		we would be if we could do that.

	Helmut glances disinterestedly at the plant as he reaches up 
	to his bunk and brings down the coat belonging to Franz.  He 
	holds coat up for Keltner to see.

				  HELMUT
		I sewed a button on.  Look all right?

				  KELTNER
			(inspecting coat)
		Fine.

	Helmut gently pats the coat, then folds it and puts it back 
	on his bunk.

				  HELMUT
		I did make them laugh.  Didn't I?

	Keltner nods.

				  HELMUT
			(angrily)
		I wish they'd get them out of here.  
		Prison is no place for little 
		children.

				  KELTNER
		We've been all over that before.  
		You've got to stop thinking about 
		them.

				  HELMUT
			(trying to convince 
			himself)
		You're right!  I've got to think of 
		myself.

	Keltner puts the plant under his bunk and gets up.

				  KELTNER
		It's too hot in here.  I'm going to 
		get some air.

				  HELMUT
		Johann... do you think there's any 
		possible way I could talk to the 
		Commandant.  Maybe I could make him 
		understand...

	The sentence trails off as Helmut realizes how useless his 
	suggestion is.

				  KELTNER
		There's nothing you can do... but 
		forget.

				  HELMUT
		How can I!  They were my own very 
		special audience.  And now they stare 
		at me as if I had betrayed them.

				  KELTNER
		They're children, Helmut.  You can't 
		expect them to understand the madness 
		of adults.

				  HELMUT
			(sudden thought)
		If I could talk to them.  To the 
		children themselves -- that would 
		help, wouldn't it?

	Keltner doesn't answer but he watches Helmut with new 
	interest.

				  HELMUT
		If I explain it to them -- then 
		they'll know I am not mad at them.

				  KELTNER
			(very deliberately)
		You go near that fence once again... 
		and you're taking your life in your 
		own hands.  You know that as well as 
		I do.

				  HELMUT
			(pleading)
		I would just need a minute.  A minute 
		to talk to them.

	Helmut goes to the door and looks out.

	Helmut stands just inside the doorway... looking out.

				  HELMUT
		I wish to God I didn't care.  I wish 
		to God I could forget them.

	Helmut walks back to Keltner.

				  HELMUT
		But I can't.

	Helmut looks at Keltner, his eyes pleading for help.

				  KELTNER
		I'm going to ask you a question, 
		Helmut, and I want you to think 
		carefully before you answer.

	Helmut nods.

				  KELTNER
		The reason you can't get them out of 
		your mind -- is it because you need 
		them -- for you audience?

	Helmut drops his eyes as he attempts to find the right answer.

				  KELTNER
		I want the truth.

				  HELMUT
			(after a moment)
		I know I can't perform for them 
		anymore.  I know that.
			(a beat)
		I really don't know what the reason 
		is.  I think it's got something to 
		do with... well, I don't want those 
		little ones to think I've turned 
		against them, too.  That's why I've 
		got to do something.  Something.

	Keltner studies Helmut for a moment.

				  KELTNER
		You'll be taking a chance.  A great 
		chance.

	Helmut nods that he know this.

				  KELTNER
			(very definite)
		All right!  Come on then.

				  HELMUT
		Where are you going?

				  KELTNER
		You want to talk to the children?  
		Well, I think I can help you.

				  HELMUT
		There's no reason for you to get 
		involved in this.

				  KELTNER
		Reason?  When war is waged against 
		children!  That is reason enough for 
		the whole damn world to get involved.  
		And it will, believe me, it will.

	Keltner puts his arm around Helmut's shoulder.  Helmut grins, 
	a broad grin of thanks.

				  KELTNER
		So, come on, Doork the Great, let's 
		start getting involved.

	They both walk quickly to the door.

								   CUT TO:

	EXT. HELMUT'S BARRACK - DAY

	As Keltner and Helmut come out.  In the b.g. we can see the 
	soccer game still going on, the players shouting excitedly 
	at each other.  Keltner surveys the scene for a moment.

				  KELTNER
		Wait here.

	He moves down the line of barracks toward the mess hall.

	EXT. PRISON YARD - FULL SHOT - DAY

	As Keltner moves among the men lounging around the barracks, 
	talking and watching the soccer game.  Trying to appear as 
	nonchalant as possible, we whispers something to a group of 
	prisoners.  They glance back at Helmut and then nod.  Keltner 
	moves on to another group, taking care to avoid the two yard 
	guards, one of which is the guard in charge of Barrack "H".  
	Again Keltner murmurs something to the other prisoners, and 
	again they look at Helmut and nod assent.  Keltner goes on 
	to another group.  As he does, the men in the first group 
	casually disperse and start across the yard toward the fence, 
	moving around the soccer players.  One of them goes up to 
	Ludwig, who is playing in the match, and whispers something 
	to him.  Ludwig nods, and the other prisoners move away.  
	Ludwig runs off chasing the "ball".

	MED. SHOT - LUDWIG

	as he storms into a clutch of players, including Galt, all 
	kicking at the "ball".

				  LUDWIG
			(low to Galt)
		Kessler is going to talk to the 
		children. Cover him.

				  GALT
			(mean)
		Who says so?

				  LUDWIG
			(evenly)
		The Reverend says cover him... so we 
		cover him.

	The players around Galt give him a meaningful look and he 
	gets their message.

				  GALT
		All right!  I was just asking.

	FULL SHOT

	As Keltner's plot takes shape, we see a dozen or so prisoners 
	wander, apparently aimlessly, across the yard and form a 
	spectator's section for the soccer game with their backs to 
	the fence, thus providing a shield between the children and 
	the guards.  The game picks up tempo, but the play somehow 
	stays in the center of the yard, strengthening the shield.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT

	As he watches the plan in action.  Keltner rejoins him.

				  KELTNER
		You know what to do?

	Helmut nods.

				  KELTNER
		Stay behind the men and keep an eye 
		out for the guards on the other side.

				  HELMUT
		Right.

				  KELTNER
		Make it quick.  You won't have much 
		time.

	Helmut nods again and starts away, but Keltner stops him

				  KELTNER
		And Helmut, keep the children quiet.  
		We don't want trouble.

	Helmut nods and moves off across the yard.  The CAMERA FOLLOWS 
	him as he circles around the soccer players, trying to look 
	as if he is just wandering over to join the other spectators.  
	As he nears the other side, the children spot him and react, 
	pressing closer to the fence and pointing to him.

	MED. LONG SHOT - HELMUT

	Shooting past the children in f.g. toward Helmut as he nears 
	the line of prisoners, who continue to ad lib shouts of 
	derision and encouragement to the soccer players.  The 
	children begin ad libbing cries of greeting to Helmut.  He 
	puts his fingers to his lips to silence them and takes his 
	place in the line with his back to them.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT

	as he stands pretending to watch the soccer game with the 
	others.

				  HELMUT
			(shouting)
		Kick it, Ludwig.  Kick it!

	The prisoner next to him gives him a sidelong glance and 
	nods almost imperceptibly.  Quickly, Helmut ducks behind the 
	line.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT

	Behind the line as he scurries, bending over, to the fence.  
	The children flock to him.  The CAMERA FOLLOWS him to the 
	fence.

				  CHILDREN
		Doork, Doork, Doork is back.  It's 
		Doork.  It's Doork.

	Helmut tries to silence their squeals of delight.  Holding a 
	finger to his lips:

				  HELMUT
		Shhh.  Shhhh.  The guards...

	The children quiet down and press closer to the fence.  Helmut 
	drops to his knees, looking around.

				  CHILDREN
		Do a trick, Doork.  Please, Doork, 
		please, please.

				  HELMUT
		No, no.  I can't.  The guards won't 
		let me.  Not now.  Maybe some other 
		day.

	CLOSE SHOT - LITTLE GIRL

	This is the same flaxen-haired little five-year-old with a 
	doll we saw before.  She regards Helmut solemnly.

				  LITTLE GIRL
		They're bad.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN

	Smiling wryly at the simplicity of this appraisal, Helmut 
	reaches through the fence and pats the head of the girl's 
	doll.

	Eager to touch Helmut, another child take his hand, others 
	grab at his arm.  Still other youngsters, following this 
	lead, try to reach through the fence to touch him.  Obviously 
	enjoying this adulation, Helmut takes as many of the little 
	hands as he can, squeezing them affectionately.  Only one 
	group of eight children hangs back.  They do not seem to 
	understand what this is all about.  Their little faces are 
	fearful, yet they are fascinated by Helmut.  Suddenly one 
	little boy gives a yelp of pain and backs away from the wire, 
	clutching his forearm.

				  HELMUT
		What is it?  What happened?

				  LITTLE GIRL
		He hurt himself.

	Wide-eyed with fright, the little boy takes his hand away 
	from his arm to reveal a nasty looking scratch from one of 
	the barbs on the fence.  Seeing his own injury, the youngster 
	bursts into tears.

				  HELMUT
		Shhh.  Shhh.  Don't cry.  It's going 
		to be all right.
			(to the other children)
		Be careful when you're near this 
		fence.

	He consoles the little boy, who continues to cry and holds 
	up his wounded arm for Helmut to see.  Helmut looks around 
	frantically, as if hoping to find help somewhere.  Then he 
	quickly removes his ascot -- his precious trademark, the 
	symbol of his self-accorded status -- and hands it through 
	the fence.

				  HELMUT
		Here, wrap this around it.  I'll 
		make it all better.

	The little boy goes on crying, but some of the other children 
	take the cravat and fashion it into a crude bandage around 
	the youngster's arm.  It fails to silence the boy's crying, 
	however.

				  HELMUT
			(worried)
		Hush now.  Stop crying.  Please.  
		Look... Look at this.

	He begins shuffling around on his knees, imitating a duck in 
	an effort to appease the crying child.  As he goes, Helmut 
	quacks softly.  The boy stops crying, but his face remains 
	unhappy.  The other children laugh in spite of Helmut's 
	efforts to keep them quiet, all but the group of eight 
	youngsters who only stare at Helmut in awe.  Seeing that he 
	is making progress with the crying child, Helmut next pulls 
	his coat up over his head and, still on his knees, moves 
	around like a headless man, groping ahead with his hands.

	CLOSE SHOT - LITTLE BOY

	His frown gradually dissolves and, in spite of his sniffling, 
	he smiles, timorously at first, then broadly.  Finally, he 
	laughs.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN

	Helmut shrugs his jacket back into place and smiles at the 
	boy.

				  HELMUT
		There, that's better.  No more crying 
		now.

	For the first time he notices the other group of frowning 
	children.  Among the other smiling and laughing youngsters, 
	they seem to stand out.  When Helmut fastens a quizzical 
	look on them, they back away a little, fearfully.

				  HELMUT
		What's the matter with them?

				  LITTLE GIRL
		They're new.  We can't understand 
		them.  All they do is cry.

				  OLDER BOY
		They're all the way from 
		Czechoslovakia.

	The eight just start at him wordlessly, their fear naked in 
	their eyes.

				  HELMUT
			(to the silent ones)
		There's nothing to be afraid of.  
		Everything is all right.

	When there is no reaction from the children, who obviously 
	don't understand him, Helmut looks over his shoulder, 
	wondering if he has time.

	MED. LONG SHOT - PRISONERS - HELMUT'S POV

	The prisoners are still rooting for the soccer players, but 
	as Helmut looks, Adolf, in the middle of the cheering section, 
	turns and sees him.

				  ADOLF
			(a hushed call)
		Hurry up.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN

	Helmut nods to Adolf and then turns back to the youngsters, 
	afraid but still unable to tear himself away.

				  HELMUT
		Here.  Look.  I'll show you... No 
		noise now.

	In pantomime, he pretends to pull a hair from his head and 
	threads it through an imaginary needle.  Finally accomplishing 
	this, he pretends to be sewing a button on his jacket, holding 
	the thumb of his left hand under the button while he sews 
	with his right.  When he has finished, he pantomimes that he 
	has sews his thumb to the jacket.  He pretends to be 
	embarrassed and tries to hide his hand in his trouser pocket, 
	but in order to put his hand in his pocket the jacket goes 
	too.  The children giggle, then roar with laughter at his 
	frantic efforts to detach his thumb from his jacket.

	The silent children press closer to watch Helmut's antics.  
	Some look at each other and smile, then grin.  Suddenly the 
	entire group is laughing.  Helmut holds up his hands for 
	silence, but the grin on his face says he loves it.

				  HELMUT
		No, no, be quiet.  Be quiet.  Shhh.  
		Shhhh.

	The children go on laughing as if this is just part of the 
	game.

	MED. LONG SHOT - TOWER GUARDS

	The SOUND of the children's laughter floats up to two guards 
	in a tower on the non-Aryan side of camp.  One of them, who 
	has been watching the soccer game below, nudges his partner 
	and points down to Helmut.

	LONG SHOT - PRISON YARD - GUARDS' POV

	Between the children at the fence and the line of soccer 
	spectators we can see only the top of Helmut's head bobbing 
	up and down.  But that is enough.

	MED. LONG SHOT - TOWER GUARDS

	After a long look, one of the guards picks up a telephone 
	and starts to make a call.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN

	Helmut seems to have thrown caution away under the stimulus 
	of the children's laughter.  He is on his feet trying a hand 
	spring.  He lands flat on his back, but rolls over on his 
	side and grins broadly at his audience, which laughs 
	appreciatively.  This is the old Doork.  Their Doork.  Again 
	Helmut tries the hand spring and again he flops.

	FULL SHOT - PRISON YARD

	A HIGH ANGLE with Helmut and the children in f.g. and beyond 
	them the Aryan side of the yard.  The soccer game is still 
	in progress, with the spectators on both sides of the action 
	whooping it up.  Then in b.g. we see two soldiers, two SS 
	officers, and the guard in charge of barracks "H", come 
	bursting through the spectators near the huts and into the 
	game itself.  The players slowly subside as they realize 
	what is happening.  They watch the guard cross the yard.  
	The cheering trails off, and the yard becomes strangely quiet, 
	the prisoners' warning to Helmut.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN

	Oblivious to all this in his joy at performing for the 
	children again, Helmut is just pretending to slip on something 
	underfoot.  His arms flay the air as he tries to regain his 
	balance, but he falls.  Through this, however, the children 
	seem to be watching something behind Helmut, and when he 
	lands on the ground, they do not laugh.

	Again their faces are frightened as they look o.s.  Helmut 
	looks at them, puzzled.  Then, realizing that something is 
	wrong, he turns and looks up from the ground.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	SHOOTING PAST Helmut in f.g. toward the guard, SS men, and 
	soldiers, who have come through the line of spectators and 
	stand glowering at him.  The prisoners have moved back, warily 
	watching for the next move.

				  GUARD
		You wouldn't listen, would you?

	Almost wearily, he goes to the fence.  This isn't something 
	he likes, but his authority is at stake here, and he has no 
	choice.  As the CAMERA PANS him to the fence we see that 
	some non-Aryan adults have drifted over to see what the 
	disturbance is.

				  GUARD
			(to the children)
		Go on.  Get back.

	The children don't move.  Their eyes are on Helmut.  The 
	guard shouts over to the adults standing behind the children.

				  GUARD
		You back there, get them out of here.

	The adults begin to gather up the children.

				  HELMUT
		They had nothing to do with it.  It 
		was all my doing.

	The guard turns and comes up to face Helmut.  He studies him 
	for a moment, then hits him a vicious backhand slap across 
	the face.  Taken by surprise, Helmut staggers backward and 
	falls.  A murmur runs through the prisoners.  The children 
	still near the fence, cry out with alarm.  Seeing their 
	terror, Helmut is determined to make it look like just another 
	act.  With a painful effort he gets to his feet, smiles at 
	the children, turns and salutes the guard, knocking himself 
	down again.  A couple of children giggle.  The FIRST SS 
	OFFICER quickly steps forward to stand behind the guard.

	He holds a swagger stick in his right hand, which he 
	repeatedly whacks into the palm of his left hand.  He looks 
	down at Helmut.

				  FIRST SS OFFICER
		Get up.

	Helmut struggles to his feet.  He glances over at the 
	children.  They are all watching him.  He takes a deep breath, 
	winks at the little ones, then salaams before the SS Officer 
	and the guard.  Some of the children giggle.  This infuriates 
	the SS officer.  He raises the swagger stick and brings it 
	down hard on Helmut's head knocking him to his knees.  The 
	children scream with terror.  The SS Officer raises the stick 
	to hit Helmut again, but Keltner, in an almost instinctive 
	reaction, catches hold of his arm.

				  KELTNER
		The children! Not in front of the 
		children!

	TWO SHOT - FIRST SS OFFICER - KELTNER

	The SS Officer turns and brings the stick down on Keltner.  
	He hits him over and over, each blow more vicious.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT - FRIGHTENED CHILDREN IN B.G.

	Helmut turns away from the beating, pulls his jacket up over 
	his head and starts to walk around like a headless man 
	stumbling and falling over his own feet.  The children, many 
	still screaming, turn their eyes away from the SS Officer to 
	watch Helmut's antics.

	FULL SHOT - FRANZ, GALT, UHLMANN, LUDWIG, ADOLF, HERMAN AND 
	OTHER PRISONERS

	The horror-stricken men stand frozen as the SS Officer 
	continues to hit Keltner until he drops to the ground.  
	Suddenly Franz breaks away from the men and charges at the 
	First SS Officer.

	MED. SHOT - SS OFFICER - FRANZ

	Franz runs INTO CAMERA and attempts to stop the First SS 
	Officer.  The Second SS Officer whips his pistol out, aims 
	carefully and FIRES a shot into Franz's head.

	VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE PRISONERS

	Uhlmann stands speechless and dumbfounded.  Galt cowers.  
	Beads of perspiration pour from his brow.  Adolf weeps bitter 
	tears as Herman places his arm around his shoulder to comfort 
	him, and himself as well.  Ludwig, dead to any emotion, simply 
	turns and walks away into the crowd.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT

	Helmut is now, more than ever, the clown, as he goes into a 
	frenzied version of the "Clap Dance".  The complete 
	incongruity of his behavior leaves the spectators stunned.

	WIDER ANGLE - SHOWING THE CHILDREN IN B.G.

	The children are no longer screaming, instead they are 
	watching Helmut as though they are hypnotized.

	FULL SHOT - HELMUT, GUARD, SS MEN, OTHER GUARDS

	The guard, fully aware that the sadist SS men may take action 
	against Helmut, quickly motions for two of the other guards 
	to take Helmut away.  The First SS Officer, still panting 
	with exhaustion, shows his approval of the action taken by 
	the guard.  The two guards seize Helmut by the arms and begin 
	dragging him off toward the administration building.  The 
	prisoners move away before the guards holding Helmut, forming 
	a sort of line of march for them.  As they drag Helmut along, 
	he waves back at the children, makes a funny face and moves 
	his feet in something approaching a dance step.

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. SOLITARY CONFINEMENT CELL - NO LIGHT

	SHOOTING FROM THE BACK of the cell toward the door.  The 
	cell is about eight feet long and four feet wide with a steel 
	door at the far end.  The cell is bare.  We HEAR men 
	approaching, and a guard opens the door letting in a shaft 
	of bright light.  Two guards hoist the unconcious Helmut 
	into the cell and drop him onto the floor.

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	He lies in a heap on the floor, his face swollen from a severe 
	beating.

	MED. SHOT - CELL

	The guards walk out, slamming the door shut leaving the cell 
	pitch dark.

	CLOSE SHOT - WINDOW WITH WINDOW SHADE

	Window shade quickly rolls up letting in a steam of blinding 
	sunlight.

	INT. COLONEL BESTLER'S OFFICE - DAY

	Lt. Scharff is by the window, having just rolled up the window 
	shade.  Colonel Bestler is on the phone and obviously 
	exasperated by what he is hearing.

	MED. SHOT - BESTLER, SCHARFF

				  BESTLER
			(on phone)
		Yes.
			(pause)
		Yes.  Yes, I understand perfectly.  
		However, I don't see how we can be 
		held responsible.
			(pause)
		Our orders were very clear.  We were 
		to have the freight car ready to be 
		picked up at midnight.
			(pause)
		Of course, I'm aware the operation 
		must be kept secret.
			(pause)
		I just don't have the staff to send 
		down there now and... Yes, I'll wait.

	He puts hand over mouthpiece to talk to Scharff.

				  BESTLER
		The freight car wasn't picked up.

				  SCHARFF
		It's still down there on the siding!

				  BESTLER
		Some stupid mix up.  If they think...

	The SOUND of the voice coming over the phone causes him to 
	literally snap to attention.

				  BESTLER
		Yes, General.
			(pause)
		Yes, I'm as distressed about the 
		situation as you are.
			(long pause during 
			which he nods his 
			head)
		Yes.  Personally!  Immediately!  
		Yes, General.  You can leave it in 
		my hands.
			(pause)
		Heil Hitler!

	He puts down the instrument and turns at once to Scharff.

				  BESTLER
		Who did you leave in charge down 
		there?

				  SCHARFF
		Sergeant Hoffman.  Very reliable.

				  BESTLER
		Apparently not reliable enough.  The 
		cargo seems to be raising quite a 
		fuss.

				  SCHARFF
			(explanatory)
		Fifty children, sir!  In a boxcar!

				  BESTLER
		I know.  I know.  But the siding 
		isn't far from town.  The General 
		doesn't want unauthorized persons 
		getting curious.  Understand?

				  SCHARFF
		I'll get some men down there right 
		away.

				  BESTLER
		Men!  You'll get yourself down there.
		And take at least a dozen guards 
		with you.  Don't let anyone get close 
		to that boxcar...  under any 
		circumstances.  No one !

				  SCHARFF
		Yes, sir.

	Scharff turns to leave the office, but after a few steps he 
	stops and turns back toward Bestler, a look of concern on 
	his face.

				  SCHARFF
		Sir?

	Bestler looks up.

				  SCHARFF
		I wondered, sir, if you might have 
		any suggestions as... well...  how 
		do we quiet children?

				  BESTLER
		Use any method you can, but shut 
		them up.  That's an order.

	Scharff is disappointed at not getting some help from Bestler.  
	Suddenly his face brightens.

				  SCHARFF
		Sir, the clown!

	Bestler looks at him quizzically.

				  SCHARFF
		The one who amused the children

				  BESTLER
		Out of the question.  The man's being 
		disciplined for that very thing.  We 
		can't change our position now.

				  SCHARFF
		No one need know.

				  BESTLER
		He'd know.

	Scharff thinks this over.  Suddenly his face brightens.

				  SCHARFF
		Sir, if I could guarantee he'd never 
		say anything.

	Bestler looks interested.

				  SCHARFF
		You see, sir, he's been trying to 
		get a review of his case.  Claims 
		he's here by mistake.  I could tell 
		him you would recommend the review.

				  BESTLER
		A man who wants something.  Good.  
		Very good strategy, Lieutenant.
			(he turns to face 
			Scharff)
		However, when you bring him back 
		here, return him to solitary and 
		keep him there.
			(a beat)
		I've seen the best of men, after 
		several years in solitary, unable to 
		remember even their own names.

				  SCHARFF
		Then I have your permission to take 
		the clown.

				  BESTLER
		Permission granted.

	LONG SHOT - OPEN ROAD - DAY

	A small open truck with 12 soldiers in the back, followed by 
	a staff car, move along the road.

	INT. STAFF CAR - MOVING - DAY

	DRIVER is in the front seat, Helmut and Scharff in the back.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT - SCHARFF

	Helmut has been cleaned up, but still shows the effects of 
	the beating and his stay in solitary.  Holding a small mirror, 
	he is applying his makeup.  He occasionally closes or tries 
	to shade his eyes from the light.  They ride on in silence.  
	Scharff stares straight ahead.

				  HELMUT
		Wish you could've gotten the big 
		shoes.  The children laugh so when 
		they see them flopping up and down.

	Scharff makes no reply.  Helmut starts to put on his big 
	black mouth.

				  HELMUT
			(a touch of the old 
			arrogance)
		The Commandant, himself, asked for 
		me!
			(a beat)
		You say he's personally requesting a 
		review of my case!  Why, that means 
		I'm practically on my way back to 
		Berlin.
			(studies mouth in 
			mirror)
		Should be red.  Mouth looks better 
		in red.
			(a beat)
		Know the first thing I'm going to do 
		when I get to Berlin?  Buy an overcoat 
		with a fur collar.  Had such a coat.  
		Very elegant. Very elegant.
			(finishing the up-
			turned corners of 
			mouth)
		It's a good idea... moving the 
		children.

	Scharff reacts to this.  He looks sharply at Helmut.

				  HELMUT
		Prison's no place for children. I 
		said all along that it was some kind 
		of mistake.

				  SCHARFF
			(uncomfortable)
		Finish your makeup.  We're almost 
		there.

				  HELMUT
		Know what Johann Keltner said?

				  SCHARFF
		Who?

				  HELMUT
		Keltner.  From my barracks.  The 
		minister. He said... Let me think.
		He said... men who wage war on 
		children. That's it. Men who wage 
		war on children... commit such a 
		crime...
			(a beat as he thinks)
		... such a heinous crime.  That's 
		it.  Men who wage war on children 
		commit such a heinous crime that 
		even the devil damns their souls.

	Scharff looks as though he'd just been slapped across the 
	face.  He quickly turns toward the window.  Helmut inspects 
	his reflection in the mirror as he draws black vertical lines 
	down over each eye -- giving him a very lost, sad, dejected 
	look.

	EXT, RAILROAD SIDING - LONG SHOT - DAY

	as the truck and staff car leave the highway and jolt down a 
	short roadway to a railroad siding where a boxcar sits on 
	the tracks.  Uniformed GUARDS stand watch on both sides of 
	the car, which has the door nearest the CAMERA, partially 
	open.  The truck and staff car pull up to the nearest boxcar.  
	The soldiers jump from the rear of the truck, one of them 
	carrying a large burlap sack.

	MED. SHOT

	as Scharff gets out of the car, from the boxcar comes the 
	SOUND of children crying.

				  SCHARFF
			(to Helmut in car)
		Wait here.

	Scharff strides purposefully over to Sergeant Hoffman, the 
	guard beside the open door.  Hoffman salutes Scharff.

				  SCHARFF
		Any word about the train yet?

				  HOFFMAN
		No, sir.  The last we heard -- it 
		won't get here until evening.

				  SCHARFF
		Anyone been around?

				  HOFFMAN
		No, sir.

				  SCHARFF
		With all that wailing, it's a wonder.  
		Couldn't you keep them quiet?

				  HOFFMAN
		I didn't know what to do, Lieutenant.  
		I was afraid to close both doors.

				  SCHARFF
			(to other soldiers)
		Keep a tight guard on the whole area.  
		No one gets near here.  Understand?
			(to Hoffman)
		You post them.

				  HOFFMAN
			(saluting)
		Yes, sir.

	Hoffman moves over to soldiers and begins giving them their 
	orders.

				  SCHARFF
			(to soldier holding 
			the sack)
		Leave that here.

	The soldier puts down the sack, and hurries off after the 
	others with Hoffman leading the way.  Scharff turns toward 
	the staff car.

				  SCHARFF
			(calling to Helmut)
		Over here, Clown.

	Helmut quickly gets out of the car and moves over to Scharff.  
	He looks toward the partially open door.

				  HELMUT
		They're crying.

				  SCHARFF
			(indicating the sack)
		Take that in to them.

	Helmut picks up the sack and peers into it.

				  HELMUT
		What is it?

				  SCHARFF
		Bread.  They won't wait so loud with 
		their mouths full.

				  HELMUT
			(shocked)
		How... how long have they been here?

				  SCHARFF
		You just get in there and keep them 
		quiet.  You can do that, can't you?

	Helmut nods.  Scharff puts his hand on Helmut's shoulder.  
	Helmut stiffens under his touch.

				  SCHARFF
		Do a good job and I'll personally 
		ask that you get a favorable decision 
		on your case.  Understand?

				  HELMUT
		Yes, sir.

	Helmut moves over to the half open door of the boxcar, the 
	CAMERA MOVING with him.  Just before he looks inside, he 
	puts a wide grin on his face.  But when he does peer into 
	the car, his eyes cease to smile.

	INT. BOXCAR - HELMUT'S POV - DAY

	In one end of the car the children are huddled together in 
	one frightened, wailing mass.  They do not even notice Helmut 
	at first, so great is their sorrow.  The little ones cling 
	to the larger youngsters, who, in turn, cling together.  The 
	small ones weep hysterically , as children do when they have 
	been crying for a very long time.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK so 
	that Helmut is in f.g.   He slides the boxcar door open fully, 
	throwing more light on the children.  This brings renewed 
	walls of anguish from the youngsters, who cluster together 
	more fiercely.  But one little boy sneaks a look at the door, 
	expecting to see more guards.  When he sees Helmut, his tear-
	filled eyes widen.  He can scarcely believe what he sees, 
	much less verbalize it.  He tugs frantically at an OLDER 
	GIRL he has been clutching.  She looks first at him, then at 
	Helmut.  She, too, can hardly believe it.

				  OLDER GIRL
			(tentatively)
		Doork?
			(shrill with 
			recognition)
		It's Doork.  It is!  It is!

	The children begin untangling quickly.  Faces appear between 
	legs, around skirts and over shoulders.  For a moment they 
	can only stare at Helmut, speechless with wonder.

				  HELMUT
			(gently)
		So this is where you've been hiding?

	That breaks the silence, and the children begin squealing ad-
	libbed expressions of greeting and relief.  They repeat his 
	name time and again:  "Doork, Doork, Doork."  As one... the 
	youngsters surge toward him.  The little boy who first saw 
	him reaches him first.  He drops to his knees and puts his 
	arms around Helmut's neck, hugging him furiously.  Helmut 
	returns the embrace.

				  BOY
		I want to go home.  Take me home.

				  HELMUT
		Now, now, there's nothing to cry 
		about.  We're going to have fun.
			(disengaging himself 
			and picking up the 
			sack)
		Here.  I brought you something.
			(he tosses it into 
			the car)
		The children pounce on the sack and 
		tug at it, unsure what it is except 
		that it's a gift from Helmut.

				  HELMUT
		Wait now.  Don't open it yet.  Wait'll 
		I get in.  You help me.

	He backs up a few steps, the CAMERA PULLING BACK with him.  
	Then he runs toward the car and, with strength he really 
	doesn't have, jumps up so that he gets his arms on the floor 
	of the boxcar.  He heaves himself forward partially into it, 
	and the children grab his clothes to help him inside.  A 
	couple of the older boys seize the seat of his pants and 
	finally pull him in.

	INT. RAILROAD CAR - DAY

	FAVORING Helmut as he rolls over and jumps up, waggling his 
	head from side to side in the manner of a Jack-in-the-box.  
	The children watch him big-eyed.  A few giggle.

				  HELMUT
		Look, I'm a Jack-in-the-box.

	He gestures around to indicate that he is, indeed, in a box.

				  HELMUT
		We're all Jacks-in-the-box -- the 
		same box.

	The children laugh, and some begin imitating Helmut's head 
	movements.  Others do the same, and still others, including 
	the Czech youngsters, until all are waggling their heads at 
	each other and loving it.  Then, out of sheer adoration, the 
	youngest of the children close in on Helmut and hug him around 
	his legs.  Slowly he stops waggling his head and stretches 
	out his arms to embrace as many of them as he can -- almost 
	as if trying to protect them.  Suddenly the gaiety dissolves, 
	and the children go solemnly silent.  Helmut reacts.

				  HELMUT
		Well... who's hungry.

	Almost in unison, the children shout "I am", again forgetting 
	their unhappiness.

				  HELMUT
		All right, I want everybody to sit 
		down.  When I count three, everybody 
		sit.  Ready?   One, two...

	On the count of two, many of the youngsters sit down.  Helmut 
	feigns surprise.

				  HELMUT
		Oh, you're too fast.  Three!

	This brings a burst of giggles, and the remaining children, 
	sit down... the Czechs following the example of the others.  
	Helmut opens the burlap sack and begins handing out pieces 
	of black bread.  The children grab at the chunks and gnaw it 
	voraciously.  When all of the youngsters have been given the 
	bread, Helmut takes a piece and bites into it with great 
	relish.  After a few chews on the bread:

				  HELMUT
		Now... what'll we do?

	There is a long moment of silence, then the little blonde 
	girl with the rag doll speaks up timidly.

				  LITTLE GIRL
		I want to see my Mommy.

	Helmut is brought up short.  For a beat he searches his brain 
	frantically for an answer.  Then he goes to the child and 
	kneels beside her.

				  HELMUT
		You would?  All right.

				  LITTLE GIRL
		You know where she is?

				  HELMUT
		She's right here with you.

				  LITTLE GIRL
		I don't see her.

				  HELMUT
		That's because you don't know how to 
		look.  I'll show you.  Close your 
		eyes.
			(to the other children)
		All of you... close your eyes.

	The little girl closes her eyes and one by one the other 
	youngsters do also.  The Czech children look at each other, 
	then at the other children, then they too close their eyes.

				  HELMUT
		Everybody's eyes shut?  Now, think 
		about your mommys and Daddys... There, 
		don't you see them?  Can't you see 
		their faces?

	The children, marvelling at this feat, ad lib expressions of 
	assent.

				  HELMUT
		So you see!  They're right here with 
		you.  All you have to do is look in 
		your hearts.

				  LITTLE GIRL
			(putting her hand 
			over her heart)
		Does Mommy see me, Doork?

				  HELMUT
			(deeply touched)
		Yes, she does.  She has you safe in 
		her heart, too.

	The silence in the car tells Helmut that sadness has returned 
	to the children.  He brightens quickly and rises.

				  HELMUT
		I've got an idea.  You all know my 
		name, but I don't know yours.  So 
		let's find out everybody's name, 
		shall we?

	He points to a boy of about ten in the group.

				  HELMUT
		You... come here and I'll show you 
		what we'll do.

	The boy, honored at being singled out, rises and comes to 
	Helmut, who takes a stubby pencil from his pocket.

				  HELMUT
		What's your name?

				  BOY
			(timidly)
		Willie.

				  HELMUT
		Willie.  That's a good name.  How do 
		you spell it?

				  BOY
		W-I-L-L-I-E.

				  HELMUT
		Fine.  I'll just write that on top 
		of your head.

	Using the eraser end of the pencil, Helmut carefully traces 
	the letters on top of the boy's head.  The youngster peers 
	upward, wondering.

				  HELMUT
		There.  See, this way we'll all be 
		able to tell everybody else's name 
		just by looking at his head.

	CLOSE SHOT - BOY

	still looking up, but now doubtful.

				  BOY
		Did you really?

	MED. SHOT - THE GROUP

				  HELMUT
		Of course I did.  Here...

	He pulls an older boy to his feet, winks at him and points 
	to the first boy's head.

				  HELMUT
			(to the older boy)
		Tell him what it says.

				  OLDER BOY
			(giggling)
		It says Willie.

				  BOY
			(impressed)
		Really?  Truly?

	He puts his hand to his head.

				  HELMUT
		Be careful.  Don't smear it.
			(he glances around)
		Let's see now... Yes.  You shall be 
		next.

	He points to a Czech girl of about six.  He motions for her 
	to come over to him.  She shyly bows her head.  Her friends 
	push her forward. Helmut holds out his hand to her, she grabs 
	it.

				  HELMUT
		What is your name?

	She looks at him, then at the other Czech children.  They 
	all giggle.

				  HELMUT
			(squatting down beside 
			her)
		Forgive me.  I don't speak your 
		language.

	He gently plants a kiss on her cheek and she puts an arm 
	around his neck.

				  HELMUT
			(to others)
		See!  We understand each other.  
		Now...
			(he points to Willie)
		Willie.
			(he points to himself)
		Doork.
			(points again to Willie)
		Willie.
			(pointing to himself)
		Doork.

	The child's eyes light up and she whispers into Helmut's 
	ear.

				  HELMUT
		A beautiful name!  Now you tell all 
		the children.

				  CZECH GIRL
			(almost a whisper)
		Inga.

				  HELMUT
		It's such a pretty name... say it 
		again.

				  CZECH GIRL
			(more sure of herself)
		Inga!

	She quickly bows her head for Helmut to outline her name on 
	the top of it.

				  HELMUT
			(with a flourish of 
			his pencil)
		I-N-G-A.  There it is.

	The little girl gives a quick curtsy and hurries back to her 
	group.  Helmut glances around at the children.

				  HELMUT
		Let's see now.  Who wants to be next.

	The little girl with the doll presses forward.

				  HELMUT
		You?

	Shaking her head she holds up the doll.

				  HELMUT
		Her?

				  LITTLE GIRL
		So the little children will know her 
		name.

				  HELMUT
		Of course.  That way she can't get 
		lost, can she?  What's her name?

				  LITTLE GIRL
		Frederika.

				  HELMUT
			(mock dismay)
		Frederika?

	He studies the top of doll's tiny head.  Then he holds up 
	his hand and measures off a distance of about three inches 
	in the air with thumb and forefinger.

				  HELMUT
		Frederika!

	Next he puts the doll's head between his thumb and forefinger, 
	illustrating that the head is too small for the name.

				  HELMUT
		Couldn't we just make it Freda?

				  LITTLE GIRL
			(solemnly)
		Oh, no!  Frederika.

	Helmut shrugs, closes one eye and begins writing in tiny 
	letters on the doll's head.  The children laugh delightedly.

	EXT. RAILROAD SIDING - FULL SHOT - DAY

	Sergeant Hoffmann is walking his post beside the open door 
	of the boxcar.  Inside we can see Helmut and the children 
	and HEAR their laughter.

	The CAMERA PANS over to the staff car, where Scharff sits in 
	the front seat smoking a cigarette and waiting.

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. RAILROAD SIDING - FULL SHOT - AFTERNOON

	It is perhaps two hours later.   Sergeant Hoffman is now 
	leaning wearily against the boxcar near the door.  The CAMERA 
	PANS over to the staff car, where Scharff is dozing in the 
	back seat.

	MED. SHOT - SERGEANT HOFFMAN

	From within the boxcar we can HEAR Helmut SINGING softly to 
	the children.  Sergeant Hoffman is listening.  Finally he 
	takes something from his pocket, goes to the door of the 
	boxcar and sticks his head inside.

	INT BOXCAR

	The children are scattered about, either sleeping or near 
	sleep, many of them cuddled close to Helmut, who sits near 
	the door with his back against the side of the car, crooning.

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
			(whispering)
		Clown.  Clown, can you play one of 
		these?

	He holds out a harmonica.  Helmut leans over to get it, being 
	careful not to disturb the children.

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
		I got it to send home to my boy...  
		but if it'll help...

	TWO SHOT - HELMUT, HOFFMAN

				  HELMUT
		It will.  It will.
			(he takes it)

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
		You won't say anything to the 
		Lieutenant.

				  HELMUT
		I promise.

	He leans back and looks at the harmonica, then he has a sudden 
	thought as Hoffman's head disappears.  He leans back toward 
	the door.

				  HELMUT
		Guard... guard.

	Hoffman reappears at door.

				  HELMUT
		It's going to be dark soon.  The 
		little ones may be afraid.  Do you 
		think... well... could you get some 
		kind of a light for in here?

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
			(angry)
		Want to get me in trouble?

	Helmut nods that he understands Hoffman's situation.

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
			(trying to justify 
			himself)
		I would if I could.

				  HELMUT
		I know.  I know you would.

	Again Hoffman's face disappears.  Helmut leans back and begins 
	experimenting with the harmonica.  Actually he can play it 
	only slightly, but he manages to get some sort of soft tune 
	out of it.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY to include the 
	children, most of who are resting peacefully, secure in 
	Helmut's presence.  But suddenly a little dark haired, dark-
	eyed girl of about six, sits upright and cries out, frightened 
	by a bad dream.  Helmut reacts.  The child looks around the 
	boxcar as if she can't remember how she got there and begins 
	crying inconsolably.  Some of the other children stir.  Helmut 
	quickly but carefully disengages himself from the tots around 
	him and picks his way over to the girl.  He kneels beside 
	her, and the CAMERA MOVES UP to --

	TIGHT TWO SHOT - HELMUT, DARK-EYED GIRL

	The child continues crying, but more softly, he wide wet 
	eyes on Helmut.

				  HELMUT
			(gently)
		What's the matter?
			(she only stares at 
			him)
		It's all right -- just a bad dream.

	He tries to put a comforting arm around her, but she shrinks 
	away continuing to sob softly.  Realizing that words won't 
	help, he turns to the harmonica for communication, serenading 
	her with a soft but sprightly tune of his own improvisation.  
	It is hardly a masterpiece, but it has the desired effect.  
	The girl stops sobbing, and when Helmut finishes the tune he 
	makes a real funny face and she timorously puts a hand up to 
	touch his make-up, but pulls it back quickly.  With an 
	affectionate smile, Helmut takes her hand and runs it over 
	his face, pretending that her touch tickles him.  As he 
	laughs, the child begins to smile faintly.  He shows her the 
	traces of chalk make-up on her fingers, and she giggles.  
	His conquest is all but complete.  He picks the youngster 
	up, and holding her like a dancing partner, pretends to dance 
	with her to a little tune he hums.  She loves this and laughs 
	outright.  When Helmut finally puts her down, he kisses her 
	on the cheek and turns his cheek in an unspoken request for 
	a return kiss.  The girl shyly and quickly gives Helmut's 
	cheek a peck.  Grinning, Helmut pats the spot where she kissed 
	him to show his appreciation for her wonderful gift.

	WIDER ANGLE

	The older girl we saw earlier calls to him in a hushed voice.

				  OLDER GIRL
		Doork.

	Helmut moves over and squats down beside her and the CAMERA 
	MOVES IN to --

	CLOSE TWO SHOT - HELMUT, OLDER GIRL

				  OLDER GIRL
		Where are they sending us?

				  HELMUT
			(shaking his head)
		Don't know.

				  OLDER GIRL
		Do you have children?

	Helmut looks around at the children.  He smiles sadly.

				  HELMUT
		I do now.

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. STAFF CAR - NEAR DUSK

	Scharff, dozing in the back seat, is awakened by the SOUND 
	of an approaching train o.s.  He listens, glances at his 
	watch, shakes his head and gets out of the car.

	EXT. RAILROAD SIDING - NEAR DUSK

	As Scharff strides to the boxcar, where Sergeant Hoffman has 
	also hear the locomotive.  He salutes as Scharff comes up, 
	the CAMERA FOLLOWING him.

				  SCHARFF
		It finally got here.

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
		Yes, sir.

				  SCHARFF
		Help them get the car coupled on.

	We want to move it out of here as fast as possible.  Be sure 
	the doors are locked.  And, get the clown off.

	Hoffman salutes, and Scharff moves off toward the approaching 
	locomotive and freight cars being backed up to the boxcar.

	FULL SHOT - FREIGHT TRAIN - (STOCK)

	It is backing down the siding toward the boxcar.

	MED. SHOT - SERGEANT HOFFMAN

	With a cautious look around, he reaches under the waiting 
	boxcar and brings out a box-type, battery operated lantern.  
	He goes to the boxcar door and peers inside.

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
			(calling)
		All right, clown, time to get off.

	Helmut appears at the door and looks down.

				  HELMUT
		What is it?

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
		Train is here.  They are hooking it 
		up now.
			(he hoists the lantern 
			inside)
		Here.  Tell them not to light it up 
		until the doors are closed.

	Helmut gives him a look of deep gratitude.

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
			(curtly)
		And get off right now.

	Just then the boxcar is jolted as the locomotive makes contact 
	and Hoffman runs off toward the front of the car.

	INT. BOXCAR - EVENING

	The jolt has awakened several of the children, who gather 
	around Helmut in the dimness of the car, frightened and 
	bewildered.

				  CHILDREN
		We're moving.  What's happening?  
		What was the noise?  Doork, where 
		are we going?

				  HELMUT
			(forced gaiety)
		It's nothing.  You're going for a 
		train ride.  What do you think of 
		that?  A real train ride.

				  CHILDREN
			(pressing close -- 
			sensing his anxiety)
		Is it far?  Are you coming, too?  I 
		don't want a train ride.

				  HELMUT
		Oh, it'll be fun.  I would like to 
		come, but I don't think I can.

				  CHILDREN
			(pleading)
		Please come, Doork.  Please.  Please.  
		Please.

				  HELMUT
		I can't.  They want me to stay here.

	There are cries from the children, whose pleading eyes make 
	Helmut terribly uncomfortable.  He backs toward the door.

				  HELMUT
		But... I'll come to see you.  Soon 
		as I can. And, I want you all to 
		promise me to be very good.  No 
		crying.

	The children stare at him silently, their eyes unconsciously 
	accusing.  With him goes all their security.  Helmut knows 
	it, but he has no choice.  When he reaches the door...

				  HELMUT
		If you want me...  remember, just 
		close your eyes.

	CLOSE SHOT - LITTLE GIRL WITH THE DARK EYES

	Wordlessly, she shuts her eyes -- tight.

	PAN SHOT - CHILDREN

	Following the dark-eyed girl's example, the smaller children 
	one by one, close their eyes.

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	Near tears with emotion, he wavers.  Then with great control..

				  HELMUT
			(huskily)
		Goodbye.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT

	He turns and sits down on the floor of the car with his feet 
	hanging outside.  He is just about to jump down when he is 
	stopped by a LOUD WAIL of anguish from one of the children 
	behind him.  He turns and looks back at them.

	MED. SHOT - CHILDREN - HELMUT'S POV

	A BOY of about six, one of the Czech youngsters, is crying 
	with the dejection of a lad who has just lost everything.  
	The other little Czechs and the older girl who first 
	recognized Helmut at the boxcar door are trying unsuccessfully 
	to console him.  Between cooing and patting the boy's 
	shoulder, the girl throws accusing looks at Helmut.

	WIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE HELMUT

	Uncertain what to do, Helmut glances around outside.  
	Satisfied that the train isn't going to move at once, he 
	gets up and goes to the children.

				  HELMUT
		What's this now?  Crying?  After all 
		the fun we've had?

	The boy only looks at Helmut and goes right on crying.  Helmut 
	looks helplessly at the older girl.

				  GIRL
		It's his birthday.  He thought there 
		would be presents.

				  HELMUT
			(to girl)
		He's a Czech.   Do you speak...

				  GIRL
			(annoyed)
		Of course not!

	Helmut is angry with the girl because he really wants to get 
	off the train and yet can't because of the accusing look in 
	her eyes.

				  HELMUT
			(pointedly)
		Then how do you know it's his... 
		birthday?

				  GIRL
			(with typical child 
			logic)
		He told me.

				  HELMUT
		He speaks German?

				  GIRL
		No.

				  HELMUT
		But he told you it's his birthday?

	The girl nods firmly as do the other children.  The boy 
	watches it all, wide-eyed.  Helmut figures to put an end to 
	this.

				  HELMUT
		What date is this?

				  GIRL
			(after thinking it 
			over)
		Why, it's his birthday!

	This is too much for Helmut to fathom.  He turns his head 
	away, trying to think.

				  GIRL
		Don't you believe him?

	Helmut turns back to them, looking first at the girl, then 
	at the boy, his little upturned tear-stained face full of 
	wonder.  Helmut softens, recalling perhaps his own birthday 
	disappointment.

				  HELMUT
		Of course, I do.
			(pats boy's head)
		Tell him I wish him a happy birthday.

				  GIRL
		He knows that.  But... but what're 
		you going to do about a present?

	Helmut fans his clothes, finds the harmonica and produces it 
	with a flourish.

				  HELMUT
		Aha, the very thing.  He can be the 
		clown while I'm gone.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING THE CZECH BOY

	As Helmut bows and holds out the harmonica to him.

				  HELMUT
		Happy birthday.

	The boy looks solemnly at Helmut and the harmonica.  He 
	doesn't quite seem to understand what this is all about, but 
	the harmonica is enticing.  He looks up at his countrymen 
	for encouragement.  They smile at him, and he takes the 
	harmonica, examines it, then blows into it experimentally.  
	When he hears the SOUND that comes out, he brightens.  Then 
	the little girl with the rag doll comes forward and offers 
	it to the boy.  He looks at her strangely, one of the older 
	German boys scoffs.

				  GERMAN BOY
		He's a boy!  Dolls are for girls.

	The little girl is hurt, and looks to Helmut for support.

				  HELMUT
		When you give something you love...  
		it doesn't matter if it's the right 
		thing.

	He takes the doll and puts one of it's hands in the boy's 
	hand, the other in the little girl's.  They stand looking at 
	each other and sharing the doll.  Helmut looks towards the 
	door apprehensively, but there seems to be no action outside -- 
	and there are the eyes of the children on him.

				  HELMUT
		Maybe we have time for a birthday 
		game.  A quick one.  Let me take a 
		look.

	INT. BOXCAR - FULL SHOT

	Helmut goes back to the door.  He glances around outside.  
	There still seems to be time.  He returns to the children.

				  HELMUT
		Everybody line up behind me now, and 
		I'll show you how a train goes.  
		Wait -- the harmonica.

	Helmut looks around for the new owner of the harmonica.  He 
	goes over to him.

				  HELMUT
		May I borrow it back... for just a 
		minute or two?

	The boy studies him dubiously with that "Indian-giver" look 
	in his eyes.

				  HELMUT
		For just a minute -- then I'll give 
		it right back to you.
			(trying a sort of 
			sign language)
		Just for the game.

	Finally the boy hands over the harmonica and manages a smile 
	because he sees all the other children smiling at him.

				  HELMUT
		Good.  Now everybody...  line up 
		behind me.

	The children scramble into line behind him.  Helmut looks 
	back at them.

				  HELMUT
		Grab hold of the one in front of 
		you...  'cause we're going to be a 
		fast express train.

	The children, laughing and giggling, grab hold of one another.

				  HELMUT
			(calling out)
		All aboard.  All aboard.

	He puts the harmonica to his lips and begins huffing and 
	puffing on it, imitating a train.  He begins to shuffle his 
	feet and move slowly down the side of the car... the children 
	holding on for dear life and following him... their eyes 
	shining with expectation as Helmut begins to quicken his 
	pace.

								   CUT TO:

	INT. BOXCAR - NEARLY DARK

	Dim shafts of light from the two small square vent openings 
	near the top on each side, gives the boxcar an eerie look.  
	Helmut stops abruptly as he hears the slamming of the door.  
	The children pile up behind him.

				  HELMUT
		WAIT!

	He moves quickly to the door and tugs at it.  Finding it 
	locked, he pounds on it.

				  HELMUT
		Open the door!  Let me out...  LET 
		ME OUT!

	But the train NOISES drown his voice.  Then the boxcar 
	suddenly lurches and starts to move forward.  Helmut's 
	pounding weakens and stops.  He turns from the door, his 
	face reflecting his fright.  The children, not quite 
	understanding what has happened, gather around him, and pull 
	on him.  He manages to control his fear, and looking at the 
	children, he manages a big smile.

				  HELMUT
		Guess I'm going with you after all.

	He switches on the lantern and holds it high so its rays 
	cover all the children.

				  CHILD
		Let's play some more, Doork?

	Helmut glances down at the tot, started by the suggestion.  
	Then he nods in a stunned sort of way.  He puts the harmonica 
	to his mouth and begins puffing on it.

	EXT. RAILROAD SIDING - EVENING

	Scharff and Sergeant Hoffman stand watching the boxcar move 
	away.

	MED. TWO SHOT - SCHARFF, HOFFMAN

				  SCHARFF
		I'm glad that's over.  Call in the 
		sentries.

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
		Yes, sir.

	He starts to move away.

				  SCHARFF
		Kessler in the car?

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
		Kessler?

				  SCHARFF
		The clown?

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
			(looking around)
		I... I guess he is, sir.

				  SCHARFF
		You GUESS!

	Scharff races to the car with Sergeant Hoffman right behind 
	him. The CAMERA FOLLOWS them.

	Scharff peers inside and finds the car empty.  With an angry 
	glance at Hoffman, he hurries to the truck and looks in the 
	cab.  It too is empty.

				  SCHARFF
			(moving back toward 
			Hoffman)
		I told you to get him off the train.

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
		I told him, sir.  HE was standing 
		right by the door.  I'm sure he got 
		off.

				  SCHARFF
		Did you see him?

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
		Why, I...

				  SCHARFF
		DID you?

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
		You told me to see that the car was 
		coupled on.  When I came back...  
		Why wouldn't he get off?

				  SCHARFF
		Idiot!
			(shouting)
		Guards.  GUARDS!

	The other soldiers come running from o.s.

				  SCHARFF
		The clown prisoner is missing.  He 
		may have escaped.  Search the area.  
		If he got off the train he must be 
		around here someplace.

	The soldiers rush o.s. into the deepening darkness.

	CLOSE TWO SHOT - SCHARFF, HOFFMAN

				  SCHARFF
		You know what happens if he gets 
		away.

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
			(hopefully)
		He can't get very far.

	Scharff looks o.s. after the disappearing train.

	INT. BOXCAR - MOVING - DAY

	It is the next morning.  Light is coming from the vents and 
	the lantern which hangs from a peg in the middle of the right 
	side of the car.  Helmut is asleep on the floor with the 
	children huddled around him.  He lies on his side with one 
	arm thrown protectively over the little Czech girl, Inga, 
	and Willie.  Behind him, the Czech birthday boy and the girl 
	with the doll are cuddled close to him.  Other youngsters 
	have their heads on his legs and feet, and all are as close 
	to him as they can get.

	He is, in fact, a sort of human bed.  From the train NOISES 
	o.s. we can tell that the freight train is slowing down.  
	Then, with a jolt, it stops, and o.s. we HEAR a truck engine 
	approaching.  Helmut stirs and sits up, trying to get his 
	bearings.  This arouses some of the children and they too 
	sit up and look around.

				  CHILDREN
		What is it?  Are we there, Doork?
		Where are we?  Why are we stopping?

				  HELMUT
		I don't know.

	He untangles himself, rises and stretches his numbed arms 
	and legs.  He starts toward the door, but it slides open 
	suddenly and a BURLY GUARD vaults inside.   Behind him we 
	see a truck similar to a moving van being backed up to the 
	boxcar.  Helmut blinks uncertainly at the light pouring 
	through the door.

				  BURLY GUARD
		Everybody up.  No noise.

	The children are too startled to move.  The guard notices 
	Helmut and reacts.

				  BURLY GUARD
		Who the hell are you?

				  HELMUT
		Where are we?

				  BURLY GUARD
		How the devil did you get in here?

				  HELMUT
		I... I'm from the other prison.  Got 
		locked in -- by accident.

				  BURLY GUARD
		Ah, for...
			(shouting out the 
			door)
		Sergeant!

								   CUT TO:

	EXT BOXCAR - DAY

	We see now that the train has stopped at an isolated siding.  
	The truck has backed up almost to the door of the boxcar.  A 
	SERGEANT climbs down from the cab of the van and hurries to 
	the boxcar door, the CAMERA PANNING him there.

				  SERGEANT
		What's the matter?

				  BURLY GUARD
		Look at this.  He's from the other 
		camp.  Got in here with the shipment.

				  SERGEANT
		How did that happen?

				  HELMUT
		I... I was taking care of the children 
		back there and... accidentally got 
		locked in.

				  SERGEANT
		Of all the... What's your name?

				  HELMUT
			(realizing he's in 
			big trouble)
		Doork.  Helmut Doork.

	The Sergeant fumes for a moment, then...

				  SERGEANT
			(to the guard)
		Put him in the truck with the others.  
		And, let's get going.

								   CUT TO:

	INT. BOXCAR - DAY

	ANGLE to the door as the Sergeant disappears.  Reaching out, 
	the Burly Guard lowers the tailgate of the truck so that it 
	forms a bridge to the boxcar.

				  BURLY GUARD
			(to the children)
		All right, in the truck, quick now!

	The children, most of whom are on their feet now, hesitate, 
	looking to Helmut for guidance.  The guard seizes one 
	youngster and shoves him toward the door.  Instead, however, 
	the child flies to Helmut and grabs him around the legs.

				  BURLY GUARD
		I said move!

				  HELMUT
			(quickly)
		Wait.  Let me.
			(to the children)
		Everybody up.  Come on.  Up, up, up.

	He moves around, helping the still seated children to their 
	feet.  When they're all up...

				  SERGEANT
			(to Helmut)
		Not you.

				  HELMUT
		Don't you want me to stay with them?  
		They'll be frightened without me.

				  BURLY GUARD
		Not for long, they won't.

				  SERGEANT
			(to guard)
		That's enough.  Get them inside and 
		keep them quiet.

	Burly guard starts to prod the children but they don't move, 
	their eyes are fixed on Helmut.

				  BURLY GUARD
			(threateningly)
		MOVE!

				  HELMUT
		Do as he says.  And, don't worry, 
		I'll be with you soon.  I promise.

	Reluctantly, the children march off.  They look back 
	frequently at Helmut who waves to them.

				  SERGEANT
			(to Helmut)
		Come along, now.

	They walk over to a two-story building.  Helmut looks back 
	in the direction of the children, then looks about the camp.

				  HELMUT
		This is just another prison.

				  SERGEANT
		What'd you expect?

				  HELMUT
		I thought the children were going to 
		a better place.

	The Sergeant, with an incredulous look on his face, stares 
	at Helmut.

	INT. CELL - DAY

	The cell is a small, bare cubicle containing only a cot and 
	an open toilet.  In the wall, fronting on the prison yard, 
	there is a small barred window.  Helmut stops pacing and 
	moves over to it, and looks out.  The CAMERA SWINGS so that 
	it is SHOOTING PAST Helmut's head through the window.  At 
	the far end of the yard we can see the windowless stone 
	buildings.  As Helmut stares out at them, we HEAR approaching 
	footsteps. Helmut stiffens, turns toward the door as the 
	SOUND of the footsteps grows louder and louder.

	The CAMERA SWINGS toward the door as it opens to reveal 
	CAPTAIN CURT RUNKEL, a slender, impeccably groomed and 
	thoroughly Nazified officer of the elite S.S.  He is the 
	embodiment of all Hitlerian ideals.  Runkel strides into the 
	cell.

				  RUNKEL
			(over shoulder to 
			guard at door)
		Close the door, and wait out there.

	Guard closes the door.  Runkel studies Helmut coldly.  Without 
	taking his eyes off Helmut, he pulls out a cigarette case, 
	takes out cigarette, lights it and slowly inhales.

				  RUNKEL
		You're a remarkable man.  Very 
		remarkable.

	Helmut stirs uneasily.

				  RUNKEL
		Have you any idea where you are?

	Helmut shakes his head.

				  RUNKEL
		Auschwitz.  This is Auschwitz.
			(a beat)
		Mean anything to you?
			(before Helmut can 
			answer)
		You may have observed we're enlarging 
		our facilities.

	He moves over to the window and looks out, puffing slowly on 
	his cigarette.

				  RUNKEL
		Still a great deal of work to be 
		done.
			(proudly)
		It's going to be our most efficient, 
		most modern prison.
			(he turns and smiles)
		And, I might add, most unique.
			(walks back towards 
			Helmut, studying him 
			carefully)

				  RUNKEL
		Yes, you are a remarkable man.  I 
		always wonder about remarkable men.
			(then evenly)
		Why did you come here?

				  HELMUT
		I explained.  I got locked in the 
		boxcar and...

				  RUNKEL
			(cuts in - still bland)
		Ah, yes.  An accident.  Unavoidable 
		I suppose.

				  HELMUT
		I was taking care -- I mean, the 
		Commandant requested me to take care 
		of the children.

				  RUNKEL
			(a slight note of 
			mockery)
		The Commandant!

	Runkel tosses his cigarette on the floor and very deliberately 
	grinds it out with his boot.

				  RUNKEL
		I've spoken to YOUR Commandant.  He 
		hs you listed as an escaped prisoner.

				  HELMUT
		Escaped!  But...

				  RUNKEL
			(finishing it for him)
		... it was an accident.
			(his face close to 
			Helmut's)
		Are you one of them, clown?

				  HELMUT
			(terrorized at the 
			thought of death)
		No... no!  I'm not one of them.  I'm 
		not !

	Runkel smiles, moves away from Helmut.

				  RUNKEL
		You misunderstand completely.  The 
		Judas goat is never killed.  He isn't 
		worth killing.
			(moves to cell door)
		I'm just asking you to lead them.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING HELMUT

	His eyes plead, "No.  I can't do it.  No."

				  RUNKEL
		Not... even to save your own life?

	For a brief moment, Helmut struggles to find the courage to 
	stand up to Runkel -- but he has no courage and he sinks 
	slowly to his knees, his head bowed.

	CLOSE SHOT - RUNKEL

				  RUNKEL
			(victorious)
		I'm glad to see you're not a self-
		appointed martyr.

	TWO SHOT - HELMUT, RUNKEL

	Runkel towers above Helmut who sits back on his haunches, 
	leaning against the wall.

				  RUNKEL
		Just think!  Now you're really one 
		of us.

	The truth of Runkel's remark hits Helmut like a devastating 
	blow.   He turns his face to the wall in shame.  Runkel walks 
	to the door, raps on it, the guard outside swings it open.

				  HELMUT
			(attempting to get to 
			his feet)
		Sir... Sir... could I... could I 
		have a little time with them before 
		... before...

	His voice trails off.  Runkel looks at Helmut while he thinks 
	it over.  He moves back to the middle of the cell.

				  RUNKEL
		Yes.  Yes, of course.
			(he looks at his watch)
		I can give you about half an hour.
			(a little smile lights 
			his face)
		You see, we're not heartless men 
		here.

	EXT. CHILDRENS' HUT - DAY

	ANGLE to the door as Helmut and the Sergeant approach from 
	o.s.  Helmut has freshened his make-up.

				  SERGEANT
		Remember what I told you.

				  HELMUT
		There won't be any trouble.

	Helmut goes to the door and starts to open it.  The CAMERA 
	MOVES UP to --

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	With a great effort, he composes himself and throws open the 
	door.

								   CUT TO:

	INT. CHILDRENS' HUT - DAY

	ANGLE to the door, where Helmut stands wearing an enormous 
	grin.  The children are about the barren room in little 
	groups.  When they see Helmut, they leap up and run to him, 
	clinging to him as he closes the door behind him and moves 
	into the room.

				  CHILDREN
		Doork, Doork, you came back.  You 
		came back.  We thought you'd left 
		us.  Don't leave us, Doork.

	The children continue to ad lib expressions of mingled fear 
	and delight at his return.  Helmut goes among them, patting 
	their heads comfortingly.

				  HELMUT
		There.  There.  It's all right. It's 
		all right.   Everything is going to 
		be all right.

	When the youngsters are calmed, Helmut holds up his hands 
	for silence.

				  HELMUT
		Now I want everyone to put on a big 
		smile and sit down, because we're 
		going to have more fun than we've 
		ever had.

	Slowly, still unconvinced that they have nothing to fear, 
	the children sit on the floor.

				  HELMUT
		Good.  We'll start by seeing that we 
		all have our names on our heads.

	The children begin to lower their heads so Helmut can check 
	to see if their names are still there.

				  HELMUT
			(as he moves among 
			them)
		Yes, yes.  There's Fritz, Maria, 
		Sadie, Inga, Josef, Nathan, Helga, 
		Willie...

	The little girl with the rag doll holds up the doll for Helmut 
	to see.

				  HELMUT
		Ah, yes, Frederika!  Good.  I see 
		all of your names.

	This is almost too much for Helmut, but he manages to control 
	himself by turning away for a beat.  Then he turns back to 
	the children, his big smile back in place.

				  HELMUT
		Now... on with the show.  Just watch 
		this.

	Their little faces are troubled, worried.

	PAN SHOT - CHILDREN

	It is a half hour later, and now the children are laughing 
	at something Helmut is doing o.s.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK to --

	MED. SHOT - THE GROUP

	Helmut is walking an imaginary tightrope.  Every few steps 
	he almost loses his balance, but with comical gyrations he 
	manages to complete the walk.  He bows deeply to the children -- 
	and falls flat on his face.  The youngsters laugh, applaud 
	and squeal delightedly.

	TWO SHOT - HELMUT, WILLIE

	Helmut is lying on the floor near the boy.  He looks up at 
	the tot and grins.

				  WILLIE
		Doork!  Doork... you're great !

	Helmut grabs Willie and holds him close while he fights back 
	his tears.   Willie plants a big kiss on his cheek.  Helmut 
	scrambles to his feet, the CAMERA PULLING BACK to --

	WIDER ANGLE

	SHOOTING PAST Helmut to the door as it opens, revealing the 
	Sergeant, his face expressionless.  Helmut reacts.

				  SERGEANT
			(to Helmut)
		It's time.

				  HELMUT
		Just a few more minutes?

	The sergeant shakes his head.

				  HELMUT
		I'll bring them.

	The children are watching him, puzzled.

				  CHILDREN
		What's the matter, Doork?  Where are 
		we going?  You come with us this 
		time.  Where're they taking us.

				  HELMUT
			(trying to think what 
			to say)
		They... they want us to move to 
		another building... where we'll have 
		more room... to play.
			(a beat)
		Tell you what.  Let's make it a big 
		circus parade.  Everybody get in a 
		line behind...

	He picks up Willie and stands him near the door.

				  HELMUT
			(continuing)
		... behind Willie here.

	The children scramble up and begin forming a line behind the 
	very proud Willie.  Helmut looks around for the boy with the 
	harmonica.

				  HELMUT
		Now, where's our band?  The harmonica?

	He sees the boy and goes to him.  Helmut pantomimes playing 
	the harmonica and points to himself.  The boy smiles widely, 
	fishes the harmonica out of his pocket and holds it up.

				  HELMUT
		There we are?  Everybody ready?  
		Here we go.

	Helmut takes his place at the head of the line, like the 
	Pied Piper, leads the youngsters out the door, playing a 
	crude sort of circus parade music.  The little children giggle 
	excitedly as they troupe out.  The older ones seem less 
	certain, but as long as Helmut is with them, they feel secure.

								   CUT TO:

	EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

	As the procession of youngsters emerges from the barracks 
	with Helmut dancing along at its head.  The Sergeant and the 
	other two Guards stand watching in disbelief as the line 
	turns and moves along toward the first of the windowless 
	buildings.

	MED. SHOT - SERGEANT, GUARDS

	They look at each other incredulously.  What they are seeing 
	surpasses their imagination.

	FULL SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN

	SHOOTING from a HIGH ANGLE as the procession moves toward 
	the CAMERA.  Helmut looks back at his charges from time to 
	time, smiling and waving and always puffing away on the 
	harmonica.  The children smile back, some timidly and some a 
	bit fearfully, but all smile.

	PAN SHOT - PARADE

	CAMERA PANS in on the children as they march behind Helmut.  
	We see some of them strutting, their little arms swinging 
	freely.  Some of the little ones have to skip to keep up 
	with the others.  They are all smiling.

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	With each step, Helmut looks about, his eyes searching heaven, 
	praying for the miracle that will save the children... the 
	sudden blast of thunder, the striking down of the guards.

	CLOSE SHOT - SERGEANT, GUARDS

	As they follow the parade warily, almost as if expecting a 
	trick.  They wear scowls worn into their faces by long use.

	MED. SHOT - BUILDING - HELMUT'S POV

	Its steel door gapes open.  Through the open doorway we can 
	see a bare room in which what appears to be shower heads 
	jutting from the wall.  A single ceiling light gives the 
	room a stark appearance.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK and UP as 
	the procession comes up toward the building.

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	Despair fills his eyes as he realizes that there is to be no 
	miracle.  He looks ahead into the room, his courage fails 
	him and he stops so abruptly that the children behind him 
	run into his legs.  He turns and looks at them, then back to 
	the door.

	WIDER ANGLE

	Almost reluctantly, Helmut stands aside.  He tries to smile, 
	but the result is almost grotesque.  He tries to speak, but 
	no words come.  The Sergeant and the guard drift up toward 
	him, scowling.  Gently, Helmut tousles the hair of little 
	Willie and steers him through the door into the room.  The 
	other children follow him hesitantly.  Helmut puts the 
	harmonica to his lips and begins playing again.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - TAKING IN SERGEANT AND GUARDS

				  FIRST GUARD
		Their clothes!  They've got to 
		undress.

	The sergeant starts to move toward the line of children, the 
	Sergeant grabs his arm and stops him.

				  SERGEANT
		Leave them alone.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN

	SHOOTING over Helmut's shoulder down at the children as they 
	file past him.  Each one hesitates a beat before him and 
	looks up at him.

	Their faces are wondering, but trusting.  They smile 
	tentatively.  Only the little girl with the doll hangs back, 
	waiting for something rather than fearful of entering.  When 
	all of the other children have gone in, she goes up to Helmut 
	and wordlessly holds out her hand in a silent request to 
	enter with him.  In her eyes is the absolute certainty that 
	he will.

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT - LITTLE GIRL'S POV

	He looks down at her hand for a long beat.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT, LITTLE GIRL

	The little girl waits for Helmut, but he doesn't take her 
	hand.  Shyly, she begins to withdraw it.  Suddenly, Helmut 
	reaches out and grabs her hand, clutching it desperately as 
	he needs her innocence to control the panic that is tearing 
	at him.  Holding on to her to steady himself, they walk 
	together into the room, the CAMERA PANNING with them.

								   CUT TO:

	INT. CHAMBER - DAY

	ANGLE to the door as Helmut and little girl enter.  Suddenly, 
	the door slams shut behind them.  Helmut whirls to it 
	instinctively, as if to shove it open or cry out for help, 
	but he does neither.

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	His face is pressed against the steel door.  He fights the 
	panic within him.  Then, he quickly wipes his eyes and turns 
	back towards the children.  Slowly he takes three chunks of 
	stale bread from his coat pocket and begins juggling them, 
	at the same time waggling his head from side to side, slowly 
	at first, then more gaily.  From deep inside him comes a 
	tiny, tiny laugh.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY to reveal 
	the children in the f.g.  Suddenly, Helmut tosses the pieces 
	of bread high, high into the air and stretches out his arms 
	to encompass all the children.  As they gather around him, 
	they take up his soft laugh, timidly at first, then more 
	assuredly until the chamber resounds with gentle laughter.

	EXT. PARIS CIRCUS - NIGHT

	The normal activity and excitement of showtime around the 
	circus is in evidence where we see the half dark street and 
	alley directly adjacent to the circus tent which (in Paris 
	is an enclosure)... the animals, the midgets, the people and 
	the roustabouts moving with a fixed speed and getting faster 
	as we now know showtime is momentarily due.

	CLOWN ALLEY - NIGHT

	The heartbeat of any circus... The long row of unkempt, yet 
	beautifully neat trunks where the clowns make up, with many 
	of the clowns just coming in and setting their clothes and 
	things around their own little areas... midgets running and 
	playing, like the little children they are about to 
	entertain... MUSIC is in the deep background... as we COME 
	TO A STOP at the large trunk with the letters clearly printed 
	...'GUSTAV - EUROPE'S PREMIER CLOWN."

	We PULL BACK and AWAY from the lettering on the trunk and 
	REVEAL the face of a gentle but drawn man, a man whose body 
	and movements indicate he has been at this for a long time.  
	As he sits, the little midgets run close to see what they 
	can do to help; one pulls the chair for him to sit on; another 
	brings a hot cup of coffee; another takes his coat and hangs 
	in on the hattree, adjacent to his trunk... as we PUSH PAST 
	HIM to introduce the other clowns... some half made up, others 
	finishing their make-up... and some just sitting and rapping 
	together, smoking, drinking coffee, waiting for showtime... 
	and in the very distant b.g., almost against the wall of 
	clown alley, we see the trunk and the body of a "CLOWN" in 
	silhouette... we CRAWL TOWARDS the body and the trunk... and 
	COME TO A STOP... HOLDING FULL FRAME.  The clown, already 
	made-up and dressed in his tramp outfit, has his head in his 
	hands, leaning down on the trunk table top, a depressed and 
	sad looking hulk of a man... an o.s. voice:

				  MIDGET
		Coffee?  It's nice and hot.

	The MIDGET slides the cup in front of the clown's face... as 
	he picks up his head and smiles and nods yes... he sips the 
	coffee and we see the clown is HELMUT DORQUE (pronounced 
	Doork).

	He is a depressed and very unhappy clown... the frown on his 
	face shows years of knocking around... plus fear that those 
	years are now over.  From o.s. we HEAR the SOUND of a small 
	air horn being blown and carried by one of the midgets.  He 
	is yelling through an old megaphone.

				  MIDGET
		15 Minutes to circus... 15 minutes 
		to circus.

	Upon hearing this, "Clown Alley" really gets busy... all the 
	clowns get up and put their last minute touches together... 
	touching up their make-ups... getting their coats and props 
	together... and as they get themselves up and ready, they 
	exit the clown alley area and start for the arena.  The last 
	one to go is Helmut, lingering behind intentionally as we:

								   CUT TO:

	INT. CIRCUS ARENA - CLOSEUP RINGMASTER - NIGHT

				  RINGMASTER
		Ladies and gentlemen, we proudly 
		present... "The Clowns"!

	INT. CLOWN ALLEY - NIGHT

	Helmut hangs back until the very last clown exits Clown Alley, 
	as we:

								   CUT TO:

	INT. CIRCUS PROPER - NIGHT

	The MUSIC is really going strong... and the clowns come on 
	like all forty.  They explode in the ring... doing all their 
	bits and pieces which ultimately brings them back to the 
	entrance area they just came from and they make the "West 
	Point" arch for the TIMPANI DRUM ROLL and the grand entrance 
	of "Gustav" the Great.

	CLOSER SHOT

	"Gustav" makes his famous comedy walk into the tent with the 
	longest pair of tails ever seen (at least 75 feet long) and 
	at the end holding them from dragging on the floor is Helmut, 
	the "Tramp Clown".

	WIDER SHOT

	We see Gustav taking the applause, and it is tremendous.  He 
	stops center of the ring, but Helmut keeps walking and doesn't 
	see the post in front of him as he walks around the post, 
	still holding the tails and goes on his butt, pulling Gustav 
	down as well.  The audience screams with laughter, believing 
	this all part of the act, as we:

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. CLOWN ALLEY - NIGHT

	All the clowns are sitting around their respective trunks 
	and there is a sense of gloom permeating the air, as Gustav 
	and MR. SCHMIDT pace back and forth behind Helmut, both going 
	at him unmercifully.

				  MR SCHMIDT
			(in the middle of his 
			tirade)
		Not to mention how unprofessional 
		that was...

				  HELMUT
		But it was an accident...

				  GUSTAV
		Oh, sure it was... A very well planned 
		and calculated accident!

				  HELMUT
		I swear to you... it was an accident!

	Gustav stops and grabs Schmidt's arm, and with a threatening, 
	pointing finger...

				  GUSTAV
		I don't want to hear any more...  
		You will get me another stooge. I 
		don't want this man!!

				  SCHMIDT
		Don't get excited, Gustav, you shall 
		have it.

				  GUSTAV
		You bet I will, or you shall have no 
		show.

	Gustav walks away, sits at his trunk, starts taking his make-
	up off.

				  SCHMIDT
			(moving to Helmut's 
			trunk, leaning over 
			into Helmut's ear)
		You will run with the other clowns 
		and that's all you will do... is 
		that clear?

	Helmut, shattered, nods his head yes.

				  SCHMIDT
			(continuing)
		And if there is another one of your 
		cute tricks... I promise you will do 
		your bits for the "Cats" while 
		cleaning their cages!

	Schmidt walks away... leaving Helmut stunned and shocked.  
	Helmut lifts his trunk cover, which opens on a hinge and 
	stays upright, as we SLOWLY CRAB AROUND to REVEAL the "One 
	Sheets" glued to the inside of the trunk lid... as Helmut 
	reaches for a towel to clean his face, we read:

		   RINGLING BROS. & BARNUM AND BAILEY

				 PRESENTS

		  THE WORLD'S GREATEST CLOWN "HELMUT"

				 SCHMIDT

				    From Germany

	The one sheets are battered and torn and certainly appear to 
	be many years old.  As we PAN the "Lid" to see them all, 
	Helmut's face is reflected in the mirror as we see the tears 
	rolling down his face.  As we FREEZE FRAME, MUSIC hits for:

	MAIN TITLES:

	THE DAY THE CLOWN CRIED

	FOLLOWING CREDITS:

	EXT. DESERTED STREET AND BISTRO - NIGHT

	Helmut, dejected and as sad as any man could be, strolls 
	down the deserted street, alone.

	INT. BISTRO

	He comes to a small bistro and walks in... stands at the 
	bar.

				  HELMUT
		Clause... give me a double whiskey 
		with beer chaser.

				  CLAUSE
			(who knows him)
		You won't get "Funny" out of a bottle.

				  HELMUT
		And you won't make a dime sticking 
		your nose in other people's business.

	Clause pours the whiskey, and places the beer next to it; as 
	Helmut gulps the drink down and chases it with the beer from 
	the bottle... we:

						    STRAIGHT CUT TO:

	INT. THE APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Standing at the window looking out is a beautiful WOMAN, 
	simply dressed, no make-up and clean; she has the look of a 
	woman who has just bathed and one could almost smell the 
	fragrance of bath oil on her body.  She is tense and 
	concerned.

	She sees something and moves toward the door and opens it.  
	There is a beat and finally the o.s. SOUNDS of feet scuffling 
	get to the door.  It is Helmut, fairly crocked at this point.

				  ADA
		Helmut, darling, are you all right?

				  HELMUT
			(nastily)
		Do I look like I'm not all right?

				  ADA
		I was so worried about you...  Your 
		dinner is cold and I couldn't imagine 
		what happened to you...

				  HELMUT
		Were you really worried about me or 
		your stupid dinner was getting cold?

	Ada is hurt by this, but knows something is really chewing 
	away at him... and deals with it even more tenderly, which 
	only digs in deeper on Helmut.

				  ADA
		Sweetheart, I care about you...  I 
		love you... I worry about you...  I 
		can't help those feelings...

	During the above Helmut is at the small bar in the living 
	room pouring another "blast" and gulps it down... he hears 
	the words but tries to ignore them.

				  HELMUT
		If there is anything I don't need 
		right now... it's your super-
		sentimentality...

	He flops down in the armchair and stares straight ahead... 
	Again, Ada is hurt by his blasting her, but she's wise enough 
	to know this isn't the man she loves... she has to get what's 
	eating him out of there.

				  ADA
		Helmut... what's tormenting your 
		soul?  Please let me help you... 
		talk to me...  I don't care what it 
		is... I love you...  I'm your 
		friend... you can trust me to 
		understand...

				  HELMUT
		I can't trust anybody... I don't 
		know how to trust anybody...

				  ADA
		I'm not anybody!  I'm your wife!

	Helmut, hearing these words, looks up at her and sees the 
	beauty in her eyes, and he is affected by this.  He stands 
	up and takes her in his arms... almost breaking her in two.

				  HELMUT
		I'm sorry, my love... I'm so sorry...
		You're right!  You're not anybody.  
		You're my wife and I love you, too...
		So very much I just have no one to 
		fight back at... I'm lost and alone,  
		I can't handle the disgrace of 
		failure... the pain of being a has-
		been is more than I can bear...

	Ada knows now what's happened.

				  ADA
		Schmidt again?  Gustav again?  When 
		will you learn they fear you and 
		they know how vulnerable you are 
		now...  if they can beat you down 
		then they needn't worry about you 
		coming back to haunt them.

				  HELMUT
		They worry about me?  Don't be 
		ridiculous...  they just took the 
		last comic bit away from me... because 
		of a silly accident...  I'm now down 
		at the bottom, just a stooge assisting 
		a not-so-funny clown.

				  ADA
		But they can't take your talent 
		away...  That's your strongest force!

	Walking away from her, getting angry again...

				  HELMUT
		What the hell are you talking about?
		What talent?  And if I had any it's 
		being suffocated into nothing...  
		And that's just what I am now...  
		nothing... No one... just empty...  
		a prop to be used and mis-used...  
		how does my great talent stand up to 
		those odds?

				  ADA
		By not quitting... You must fight!  
		Creative survival is even more 
		difficult than human survival...  
		You must fight!!!

	Helmut gets quiet and listens, and it makes sense... Ada 
	knows she's got him now.

				  ADA
			(continuing)
		Go to Schmidt... Force a 
		confrontation...  Don't let Gustav 
		win...  make Schmidt see what an 
		injustice they are imposing on you...  
		Please, my love, fight!  Make your 
		world better by fighting for it...  
		You can do it... I know you can...

	Helmut hears it all and it sounds so good and right.

				  HELMUT
		I will go now and see Schmidt...
		I will tell him I won't take any 
		more degradation... I will tell him 
		I am a "clown" not a stooge...  A 
		"clown"... A special person...  A 
		special clown...

	Ada happily gets his hat.

				  ADA
			(placing the hat on 
			his head)
		Go, my love... Go and fight for what 
		you know is right... I will warm 
		your dinner and wait for you to come 
		home.

	She kisses him, opens the door for him and he goes.

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. THE EMPTY CIRCUS - NIGHT

	The low key light and the silence of the circus is almost 
	ominous and a little frightening for Helmut as he walks across 
	the empty arena... with a small light burning from up high.  
	All the equipment is tied off.  Slight ANIMAL SOUNDS in the 
	deep background... and the faintest SOUND of circus music is 
	heard.  Helmut is now center of the main ring and stops and 
	looks around.

	HIS POV - THE EMPTY STANDS

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	His face tense, then eases as he looks around.

	HIS POV

	The stands are full, the lights come up, and the audience is 
	standing, applauding thunderously!

	MED. CLOSE - HELMUT

	In his clown outfit bowing and acknowledging the ovation.

	HIS POV - THE AUDIENCE

	as they stop applauding and sit down.

	WIDE SHOT

	Helmut -- the chair and the trombone --

	THE TROMBONE PANTOMIME

	As the completion of the "Trombone Pantomime" Helmut walks 
	away from the position he was in with the trombone and bows 
	and milks the crowd for reactions and as he bows the second 
	time... WE SHIMMER:

								  BACK TO:

	CLOSE - HELMUT

	In bowing position as he looks at the crowd.

	HIS POV - THE EMPTY STANDS

	CLOSE - HELMUT

	His face shows signs of utter despair and dejection... the 
	dream is gone and the memory of what was really hurts deep 
	down.  He looks around making sure he hasn't been noticed by 
	anyone and takes that deep sigh and strolls towards the back 
	of the circus tent area on his way to find Schmidt.

	WIDE ANGLE

	TRUCK WITH HIM, HOLDING the many empty seats in the b.g. as 
	he walks... trying to muster up the courage he's going to 
	have to call... something that has now become totally foreign 
	to him.

	HIGH SHOT - THE EMPTY CIRCUS

	We see Helmut as the tiny figure he feels like, walking out 
	of the tent area and into the backstage section.

								   CUT TO:

	BACKSTAGE OFFICE AREA - NIGHT

	Helmut enters the section of the circus where Schmidt has 
	his "Temp" office quarters.  It is a tent-like arrangement 
	with the canvas flap as his door and we see light streaming 
	from the half open canvas flap.

	HIS POV - THE TENT OFFICE

	Helmut looks and sees a shadow of a body moving around in 
	the tent office area and starts for it.

	INT. TENT OFFICE - NIGHT

	Schmidt pacing up and down... thinking, as we PULL BACK to 
	see Gustav seated in one of the fold-up chairs with a "I am 
	waiting" look on his face.

				  SCHMIDT
		Naturally, I agree... Doork is a 
		nuisance, but to just let him go 
		seems a little unfair.

				  GUSTAV
		Schmidt!  Don't make me put it on a 
		"either him or me basis".

				  SCHMIDT
		All right... all right... I'll give 
		him --

								   CUT TO:

	OUTSIDE OFFICE TENT - HELMUT - NIGHT

	listening.

				  SCHMIDT (V.O.)
		-- his two weeks notice tomorrow. 
		Will that satisfy you?

				  GUSTAV (V.O.)
		Perfectly!!  Let's have a drink...

	Helmut drops his head, completely discouraged and saddened 
	by what he knows is a losing battle.  As he starts to walk 
	away we can HEAR the tinkling of glasses and the slight 
	laughter of the two men as we watch Helmut slowly scuff his 
	way towards the backstage circus exit, as we:

	DISSOLVE (12-ft) HOLDING his walk over his limp body at bar.

	INT. THE BAR - NIGHT

	Helmut has had more than a few and really looks beaten and 
	shoddy -- he waves for the bartender to bring another.

				  CLAUSE
			(pouring still another 
			blast)
		It's your funeral.

				  HELMUT
			(not too clearly)
		A funeral is usually in order when 
		someone dies.

	Up to now, we have no idea, whatever, as to the time (in 
	history) we are indeed in Germany, but as Helmut downs another 
	blast we SLOWLY CREEP our CAMERA to include more of the bar 
	than we have seen before and it includes pictures, framed, 
	of soldiers, arms interlocked (looking somewhat like summer 
	camp stills), the German flag (1933 vintage / crisscrossed 
	with the Swastika), a large banner marked "Deutchland" Ober 
	Aliss... and finally, the larger than life photograph of 
	"Hitler".  Helmut slowly CROSSES CAMERA as he takes another 
	drink and starts spouting again.

				  HELMUT
		The trouble with man today is that 
		he takes everything for granted...  
		he thinks things he's told to think...  
		and accepts it! Just because we know 
		meanings of words we use them and we 
		fool ourselves...  people should use 
		the dictionary more...  look up words 
		like good... bad... honest... loyal...
		especially loyal,  I know what loyal 
		means, and I have always been that...  
		but does anyone care?  No!  Of course 
		not...  Only when it is expedient...  
		When it isn't ---
			(he slashes his throat 
			with his finger)
		--- ZIPPPP!  You're out!

	Helmut stops with his BACK TO CAMERA looking straight at 
	"Hitler" and screams:

				  HELMUT
		And that goes for you too... Mine 
		Fuhrer...

	He shoves his right arm up and out at the photograph of 
	"Hitler".

				  HELMUT
		... you, too, are a fool.  You allow 
		yourself to think you have "loyal" 
		followers...  Ha!  Wait until they've 
		had it with you...  You'll get 
		yours... all the smiling, bowing, 
		heel clicking idiots will shaft you 
		too.  And you will deserve it because 
		if you allow people like Herr Schmidt 
		to got about his business of lying, 
		and cheating, and being disloyal, 
		one day all the Schmidts in Germany 
		will turn on you and you will finish 
		as the dumb little corporal you 
		started as, and never know what hit 
		you...

	During the above dialogue, two S.S. men along with two Gestapo 
	men walk into the bar and sit at a table unseen by Helmut, 
	and as they sit, Helmut continues:

				  HELMUT
		He really has to be stupid --
			(indicating Hitler)
		I could help him by telling him about 
		the people he thinks are good 
		Germans... Ha!

	The two S.S. men and the two Gestapo men just happened to 
	stop in the pub, they can't really believe what they are 
	hearing, and the two S.S. men make a move to get up and secure 
	Helmut.  The head Gestapo man nods to them to stay seated 
	and wait and listen.  Helmut continues his rave and gets 
	more violent as he goes on.  Clause, the bartender, would 
	love to tell him the Germans are there, but chooses to go 
	about his business.

	Helmut is really getting the effects of the booze now and is 
	bordering on flipping his lid, completely.

	(He does the stagger routine trying to get to the table on 
	the other side of the bar furthest away from where the S.S.  
	men and Gestapo men are sitting)... We play this for visual 
	humor, but at the same time showing just how swacked he is!!!  
	Helmut finally reaches the table he has been trying 
	desperately to get to and falls into it, exhausted and 
	emotionally drained.  He looks around at the few people who 
	have been watching him, most of which are frightened at what 
	he has said, trying vainly to stay out of it.  Helmut catches 
	the eyes of the four men (S.S. and Gestapo) just looking at 
	him.

				  HELMUT
			(angrily)
		What are you staring at?  Didn't you 
		ever see a man drink before?

	The four men just stare at him with no answer.

				  HELMUT
		What's the matter?  Haven't you guys 
		got a sense of humor?  You must have!  
		Look how you're dressed!  Grown men 
		in their little soldier suits... And 
		the black coats and gloves... Like 
		in a movie...

	Helmut gets up and walks over to their table... mumbling, 
	and staggering as he goes...

				  HELMUT
		Real cloak and dagger stuff...  Didn't 
		you Gestapo guys ever know that 
		everybody can spot you a mile away?
			(leaning over and 
			whispering)
		Listen, if you really wanted to be 
		unnoticed...  You should dress like 
		plain people, then nobody would  
		know you... You might even wear straw 
		hats and shorts...

	He hears this and gets hysterical laughing.

				  HELMUT
		Straw hats and shorts!!  That's funny!  
		Now that's really funny, isn't it?  
		Straw hats and shorts!

	They just stare!

				  HELMUT
		Well, isn't that funny?   Think of 
		it...  That's funny!   Why don't you 
		laugh?

	HELMUT'S POV - THE S.S. AND GESTAPO MEN

	They are really staring now, hard to believe their ears and 
	eyes.

				  HELMUT
			(gets an idea)
		I know why you're not laughing...  
		Because things you hear, you have to 
		think about... I'll show you something 
		that you'll laugh at because all 
		you'll have to do is watch...

	DIRECTOR'S MEMO!!!    (INSERT CHAPLIN FOOTAGE)

	Helmut goes over to the bar, where a little man is standing 
	drinking his beer.  Alongside of the beer is a small plate 
	with crackers and brown jam.  Helmut takes a comb out of his 
	pocket, dips it in the man's glass of beer, combs his hair 
	down over one eye, takes a finger full of the brown jam and 
	makes a shicklegruber mustache from it... and turns on the 
	four men yelling:

				  HELMUT
		Ve vill conquer the world...  Heil 
		me!  Heil me!  Heil me!

	He screams the last "Heil" and collapses on the floor.  The 
	four men get up and proceed to pick him up and carry him out 
	of the bar.  As they get to the doorway and exit we STAY 
	on... Ada who has just arrived to see them pick him up and 
	carry him away.  She is shocked.  We STAY on a CLOSEUP OF 
	HER FACE showing the strain, pain and sadness as we:

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. LT. REICHER'S OFFICE - OUTER OFFICE - BERLIN GESTAPO 
	HEADQUARTERS - DAY

	We OPEN on the shiny black boots swinging the door open in 
	front of him and as we PULL BACK we see Helmut seated in a 
	slumped position on the hard wood bench as we introduce the 
	wearer of the black boots -- LT. REICHER -- he enters his 
	office as we go with him... (Feather Edge Set)... he walks 
	briskly to the desk where there are briefs and papers stacked 
	high on his desk... he bellows, after looking at the top 
	folder.

				  REICHER
		STEINER !!!!  Get in here!

	A frightened and spineless like corporal springs into his 
	office and clicks his heels and screams.

				  CORPORAL
		Heil Hitler!
			(shooting that stiff 
			arm out like on a 
			spring!)
		Reicher flips his wrist in answer to 
		the heil, showing complete annoyance 
		at having to do it.

				  REICHER
		Do I see what I think I see here?

	The corporal leans over the desk, and in order to see puts 
	his hand on the desk to brace himself... Reicher smacks his 
	arm, knocking his face flat on the desk... he stays there 
	with his ass in the air, waiting for instructions.  Reicher 
	leans down putting his nose right to the corporal's nose.

				  REICHER
		Never put your hands on my desk...  
		is that clear?

	Still in the same position, the Corporal extends his arm for 
	a heil Hitler, which is virtually impossible in the position 
	he is in.

				  CORPORAL
			(meekly)
		Yes sir!

				  REICHER
		MOVE IT!!

	The Corporal rises and stands stiffer than ever...

				  REICHER
			(picking the folder 
			up)
		Now tell me, is this brief correct?  
		Is that prisoner, the drunk, the one 
		that impersonated the Fuehrer?

				  CORPORAL
		Yes sir!  It is!

	Reicher paces behind his desk... the Corporal still stiff at 
	attention... waits and watches in mortal fear.

				  REICHER
			(to himself)
		I get all the weirdos...  Alright, 
		Corporal, send him in!

	The corporal clicks his heels, thrilled that he can go.

				  CORPORAL
		Yes sir!!!!

	He exits, and returns with Helmut and one more guard.  Helmut 
	stands in the doorway, frightened and unsure, Reicher still 
	pacing behind his desk feels Helmut's presence...

				  REICHER
		Alright, come in, sit down!

	Helmut walks to the chair in front of Reicher's desk... The 
	spineless corporal moves towards the door... turns... and 
	takes his position on the opposite side of the door that the 
	guard is standing at...

	Reicher picks up the folder again, fingers through it.  As 
	he looks through the folder, he looks at Helmut and looks 
	and fingers pages and the silence and the anxiety is getting 
	to Helmut as he sweats and waits.

	Reicher is toying with him, and each time Reicher looks up 
	the sick, little-boy smile crosses Helmut's face, hoping to 
	endear himself to this Prussian pig!

	Reicher finally sits down beside his desk in a chair that 
	resembles a throne.  It is high and it looks down on Helmut.

	(Props:  This chair must be higher and taller than Helmut's 
	chair... for POV shots diminishing Helmut seated there.

	OVER REICHER ON HELMUT

				  REICHER
			(soft spoken)
		Are you Helmut Doork?

				  HELMUT
			(nervously)
		Doork, yes sir, Helmut Doork!  I am 
		he!  Yes sir, that is correct, Doork!

				  REICHER
		And are you a clown in the circus?

				  HELMUT
			(ego setting in and 
			forgetting for a 
			moment his trouble 
			and danger)
		Not JUST A CLOWN!  I am Helmut Doork, 
		Premier Clown!  I've clowned for the 
		royal heads of many of our finest 
		countries, why there were times when 
		I had to...

				  REICHER
			(breaking in)
		That was years ago... According to 
		these papers you are now just a helper 
		in the circus with little or no 
		importance!!

	This stuns Helmut, his facade destroyed... His face drops 
	along with his fear...

				  HELMUT
			(meekly)
		Some things are only temporary...  
		Lt. Reicher!  Only yesterday, I had 
		calls from one of the great circus 
		owners in all of Europe... he...

				  REICHER
			(breaking in, strong 
			and angry)
		You are NOTHING!!  You are a HAS 
		BEEN!!  You WERE A CLOWN...

				  REICHER
			(continuing)
		You are now a prisoner of the State 
		and that's not funny... Can you make 
		something funny out of that, Clown?

	Helmut sinks even lower in the over-stuffed chair, despair 
	in his eyes and a weight on his heart... the truth slashing 
	at his very being.

				  HELMUT
			(softly)
		No!  Lt. Reicher, I can't make 
		anything funny from that thought...

				  REICHER
		It is no thought... It is fact, Clown, 
		unquestionable fact!!  Now down to 
		the issues at hand...  Did you 
		willfully and with malice attack the 
		State and impersonate the Fuhrer?

				  HELMUT
			(softly)
		I was drunk!  It was a mistake!  I 
		meant no disrespect... Sir... 
		Honestly, I was drunk and not 
		responsible for my actions and 
		thoughts!  And my actions were 
		subconscious!

				  REICHER
			(screaming)
		Subconscious??  Meaning it was all 
		motivated by truth that came out 
		under the influence of alcohol!

				  HELMUT
			(still softly)
		I am a LOYAL German!

				  REICHER
		And what kind of commendation would 
		you expect for being a loyal German?

				  HELMUT
		I want nothing!  But I'm more loyal 
		than most Germans I know...

				  REICHER
		Like who?

	Helmut realizes this was the wrong thing to say... he 
	sweats...

				  HELMUT
		Ah, like... re...

				  REICHER
		Names!   Names!!!  Who?

				  HELMUT
		I don't know...

				  REICHER
		Sir!!!

				  HELMUT
		I don't know, sir...

				  REICHER
		But you said other Germans... What 
		OTHER Germans...  Who are they?  Why 
		aren't they loyal?  Who?

				  HELMUT
			(trying desperately 
			to cop out)
		I'm not responsible for what I say 
		now...

				  REICHER
		Why?  You're not drinking... you 
		said you weren't responsible last 
		night because you were drunk!  Are 
		you drunk now?

				  HELMUT
		No, sir!

				  REICHER
		Then why are you not responsible 
		now?

				  HELMUT
		I don't know!!

				  REICHER
		SIR!!!

				  HELMUT
		I don't know -- sir !!!

				  REICHER
		Why are you not responsible?  Why?  
		Why?  Why?  Why?

	On each attack of the word "why", Reicher creeps up closer 
	and closer to Helmut, really intimidating him... and the 
	sound of his voice echoes and becomes monotone and ominous...

	[THE NEXT TWO PAGES OF THE SCRIPT ARE MISSING AS THEY ARE IN 
	THE ORIGINAL]

	The corporal gets Reicher's point and marks his notebook, 
	flips the cover closed, snaps to attention as we:

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	INT RAILWAY STATION - DAY

	Ada walking as briskly as a woman can walk without running 
	and then her walk becomes a panic running, looking, sweating, 
	and the look on her face is evident that she is frightened 
	and close to shock... she gets to a train gate where she 
	sees the S.S. men pushing men through the gate to the train... 
	she knows she is where she has to be... she approaches one 
	of the S.S. men...

				  ADA
		Excuse me, sir, but I wonder if you 
		would help me... you see...

				  S.S. MAN
			(very briskly)
		No!  Go away!

				  ADA
		You don't understand...

				  S.S. MAN
		You don't understand...  I said go 
		away !!

	Ada backs away from the gate, and stands to one side watching 
	the prisoners being moved from the back of the huge truck 
	backed up to the railway area... she is looking through the 
	iron bars (we SHOOT the bars holding depth of field snugly 
	so that the prisoners and the bars are in sharp focus)... we 
	make QUICK CUTS between Ada and the prisoners exiting the 
	huge truck... as we see the change of expression on Ada's 
	face we know she sees what she's been looking for... Helmut... 
	he is walking in a slow rhythm following a group of men who 
	look equally as broken and sad as he looks... Ada yells 
	through the bars...

				  ADA
		HELMUT !

	Just as she yells, the voice of an S.S. Man drowns out her 
	scream as he yells...

				  S.S. MAN
		Move along... you swine... move...  
		we haven't got all day... move...  
		move... one-two-three-four --

	His voice rings loudly in echo in the vast station it's as 
	though he is timing his yells to each scream of hers... we 
	see her mouth moving with the SOUND of the S.S. Man's voice 
	coming from it... she is screaming Helmut... as the S.S. Man 
	screams...

				  S.S. MAN
		Move it... move it... move...  move... 
		hurry... faster... faster...

	Helmut and the other men push ahead faster and faster... 
	with INTERCUTS of Ada, tears streaming down her face... with 
	CUTS of Helmut walking with his head down, embarrassed and 
	shattered...

	MED. - ADA

	We MOVE the CAMERA SLOWLY towards her, peering through the 
	bars of the huge gate... and as we MOVE, we HEAR the doors 
	of the train slamming... the whistle... and the slow start 
	of the locomotive moving the train out of the station... by 
	the time we get to the (choker) of Ada... the train is almost 
	out of listening range... She drops her head, wipes her eyes 
	with her handkerchief, as we hear so.:

				  S.S. MAN
			(the same one at the 
			gate who told her to 
			go away)
		Now I would be glad to help you, 
		Fraulein... shall we start with a 
		drink?  There is a lovely little bar 
		around the corner...

	During the above dialogue we see another S.S. Man closing 
	and locking the gate to the train platform... She looks at 
	this "Pig", then down and up as though she were examining a 
	rare, never seen insect... and then right into his face... 
	and softly whispers:

				  ADA
		Go away !!

	She turns and slowly walks the long walk down the empty 
	station corridor as we

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. THEIR APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Ada is sitting at the kitchen table, the table is empty, the 
	light is low and we see the picture of a lonely heartbroken 
	woman, she has a small bowl of soup in front of her and the 
	spoon in her hand is doing nothing more than swirling the 
	soup around in the bowl... she can't eat, which is evident 
	and as she swirls the spoon around, we MOVE IN SLOWLY and 
	into the bowl of soup (choker)... and HOLD on the spoon in 
	the bowl as we

						    STRAIGHT CUT TO:

	INT. CAMP MESS HALL - INSERT - BOWL OF SLOP - DAY

	We see wooden spoon doing exactly what Ada was doing, just 
	swirling the spoon around in what looks like dirty water 
	with a carrot in it, the bowl is chopped and cracked, the 
	spoon is old and almost white from use... the handle still 
	retains its wooden look... as we PULL BACK we see Helmut is 
	swirling the spoon in the slop... behind him is a Guard just 
	watching his actions... after a beat, the Guard taps Helmut 
	on the shoulder...

				  GUARD
		Tsk!  tsk!  tsk!  shame on you, 
		Doork... shame...  don't you want to 
		grow big and strong like me?

	Helmut knows he's in trouble and just waits indifferently 
	for the fireworks to start...

				  GUARD
		We must eat our food!  Do we want 
		Uncle to feed the little man?

	The guard pulls the man next to Helmut out of his seat and 
	practically throws him to the floor to make room for himself 
	to sit down next to Helmut which he does... he half turns 
	his body towards Helmut and turns Helmut around in the same 
	fashion so they are almost facing one another.  The Guard 
	takes the wooden spoon and fills it with the soup and proceeds 
	to feed Helmut... he stuffs the spoonful of soup into his 
	mouth... and Helmut takes and swallows... then the Guard 
	takes another spoonful and makes believe he is blowing it 
	(like a mother blows the hot soup not to burn the baby's 
	mouth)... and forces the spoonful into Helmut's mouth.

				  GUARD
			(continuing to feed 
			him as he puts the 
			spoon in his mouth)
		And now one for Aunt Ada...

	As the Guard uses the name Ada, Helmut bites down on the 
	spoon and won't let it go... but if looks could kill... he 
	stares at the Guard with hate...

				  GUARD
			(pulling the spoon)
		Let go, Doork, let go... it's the 
		soup that makes us big and strong... 
		not the spoon... LET IT GO!

	Helmut still holds it clenched in his teeth, and the Guard 
	smacks his face full force.  Helmut lets it go... and holds 
	his face, embarrassed and humiliated as any many would be...

				  GUARD
			(continuing)
		Now let's try it again...

	He fills the spoon and sticks it toward Helmut's mouth, but 
	Helmut clenches his teeth keeping his mouth shut.

				  GUARD
		I said let's try it again...

	He shoves the spoon into his lips, as the soup drips all 
	over the front of Helmut's shirt.  The Guard uses the spoon 
	to clean the front of his shirt and forces the liquid he 
	took from the shirt front into Helmut's mouth... Some of the 
	men at the table and surrounding tables feel for Helmut, 
	others think it's funny... they laugh quietly.

				  GUARD
		Oh, I know why you're unhappy... 
		soup without bread is terrible...

	The Guard takes the large loaf of brown bread and rips a 
	huge piece out of the center of the loaf and proceeds to 
	stuff Helmut's mouth with bread, until he looks like his 
	cheeks are eight times their normal size.

				  GUARD
		Isn't that better?  Now take some 
		soup...

	He pushes a spoonful of soup into his mouth which is so full, 
	nothing can get in... consequently the bread spills out, the 
	soup spills out... and he is a mess... (We play this scene 
	for plot value, but it will work comically as well.)

				  HELMUT
		I've had enough, thank you... No 
		more, please...

	The Guard just stares at him...

				  HELMUT
		Please!

				  GUARD
		I'm surprised at you, Doork, you've 
		been here two years now, you should 
		have learned we, of the Third Reich, 
		never acknowledge the weak, sniveling, 
		begging of you swine...  that's all 
		you're good for... begging... 
		pleading... praying...  you're a 
		disgrace to the human race.  That's 
		why we of the superior race must do 
		away with all of you...

	The guard turns to the other men at the table, and goes into 
	one of his mentally unbalanced tirades...

				  GUARD
		And we will!  We will!  Do away with 
		all of you.  You're worthless pigs... 
		with no courage, no guts, why if 
		anyone did to me what I just did to 
		Doork I would kill him!
			(turning to Helmut)
		Why don't you kill me, Doork?  Go 
		on...  kill me... kill me... take 
		the knife from the table and kill 
		me...

	Helmut looks at the knife on the table, picks it up, holds 
	it in stabbing style, thinks about it... and we know by his 
	look, he would love to...

				  HELMUT
			(with knife in hand)
		I would kill you... but I am getting 
		my release any day now... and I won't 
		do anything that would spoil my 
		chances...

	Helmut digs the knife into the table top and buries his head 
	in his hands... totally shook from the encounter...

				  GUARD
		Your release?

	He begins to laugh, but hysterically.

				  GUARD
		Release?  They told me you were 
		funny...  but I never realized just 
		how funny you are...  RELEASE ????

	And the hysterical laughter really echoes throughout the 
	mess hall as the Guard makes his way towards the exit.  The 
	men at the table slowly get up and exit the scene, as do the 
	others at the surrounding tables... leaving Helmut just 
	sitting there... we PULL BACK to reveal the empty mess hall, 
	and the lonely sad body of Helmut, as he looks around 
	realizing he's alone, gets up and slowly creeps out of the 
	hall like a puppy with his tail between his legs... as we

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. PRISON YARD - FULL SHOT - DAY

	There are two rows of prisoners quarters, wooden buildings, 
	weather beaten each row consists of about a dozen barracks 
	each... joined at the ends, farthest from the CAMERA by the 
	administration building, a two story type making a "U" shape 
	of the compound... The entire yard is surrounded by two high 
	wire fences about ten yards apart and fifteen feet high.   
	At intervals of about twenty-five yards, in the area between 
	the fences, are the guard towers, each about eighteen feet 
	above the ground equipped with searchlights, sirens, machine 
	guns, with three Guards on duty.  Along outer fence, also 
	about twenty-five yards apart, other powerful lighting 
	equipment mounted on high poles.

	It is morning and although the sun shines brightly it doesn't 
	in any way alter the drabness of the compound... nor does it 
	help change the look of the men...

	There are about three hundred men milling about, some still 
	chewing what was their breakfast, some pulling brown bread 
	from their shirt fronts and exchanging bread for cigarettes 
	or just making deals, one with another... some sit along the 
	barracks walls trying to get some sun... others walking in 
	circles... some talking, laughing, even playing cards... 
	doing whatever they can to kill time...

	PAN the entire camp.  At completion of the long PAN 
	introducing the prison camp, we pick up the sixtyish JOHANN 
	KELTNER (formally ANDERLICH), a warm, sensitive looking 
	greying man, thin but with a dignity and a serenity about 
	him... He walks briskly (and we know he'd love to walk slowly 
	and tiredly, but we can see he knows his attitude and conduct 
	will help those that can't help themselves...)

	His face tells us he is good, kind and the reason men want 
	to live, he is special and he smiles at all those he passes, 
	greets the men and is generally what man wishes he could be 
	under the same circumstances...

	He walks into the building, which we learn is the barracks...

	INT. BARRACKS - DAY

	The barracks are empty... Keltner enters the huge room and 
	looks around and sees Helmut at the other end of the barracks 
	just walking back and forth like a caged lion... angry, hurt, 
	sad, and generally out of sorts... he can't even hear Keltner 
	approaching him... he finally stops at the back wall of the 
	barracks and lays his head against the barracks wall...

				  HELMUT
			(not aware Keltner is 
			behind him)
		Dear God, please hear me!

				  KELTNER
		He hears you, my son...

	Helmut jumps, scared... throwing his back against the wall, 
	like a man who fears being attacked at any time...

				  KELTNER
			(sympathetically)
		Here, here, easy, you can't do this 
		to yourself...

				  HELMUT
		You frightened me, Johann, I'm 
		sorry...

				  KELTNER
			(softly)
		You have nothing to be sorry for...  
		Fear isn't something controlled by 
		man...  fear can not be conferred 
		with...  there isn't anyway known to 
		mankind where man can say to 
		himself...  "I will not be afraid"... 
		Oh, certainly man can try to fight 
		it... but faith and believing are 
		man's only chance...  You must have 
		faith... you must!

				  HELMUT
		I have faith... but not always...  
		sometimes it eludes me...  I can't 
		remember to remember it.

				  KELTNER
		But that's natural... you can't expect 
		to be perfect in what you try to 
		do...

				  HELMUT
		I don't know...

	He starts pacing again.

				  KELTNER
		I heard what happened at breakfast 
		this morning with ROTHMAN, the 
		guard...

	Helmut spins around, frightened again...

				  HELMUT
		Will they do something to me? What 
		have you heard?

				  KELTNER
			(putting his arm around 
			him)
		Nothing, absolutely nothing... don't 
		worry about it... I just wanted you 
		to know that I believe you handled 
		yourself admirably...

				  HELMUT
		That was one time I didn't care for 
		the laughs I was getting from some 
		of the men...

				  KELTNER
		Of course you didn't... but I'm sure 
		you know man laughs for two reasons... 
		one because something is funny... 
		two, because they fear showing fear... 
		they laughed because "there but for 
		the grace of God go I!"

				  HELMUT
		Do you really think so?

				  KELTNER
		I'm certain of it!

	Helmut smiles and takes Johann's hand, tenderly, and warmly:

				  HELMUT
		Thank you, Johann.  I always feel so 
		much better after you talk to me...

				  KELTNER
		I'm glad, Helmut, I'm very glad...  
		you know you can always talk to me, 
		about anything...

				  HELMUT
			(remembering)
		Oh!  I almost forgot...

	Helmut puts Johann around the back of the barrack area near 
	the wall out of sight of anyone coming in...

				  HELMUT
		Before breakfast this morning,  I 
		spoke to one of the guards, a very 
		intelligent one, and he seems quite 
		nice and friendly too.  Well, he 
		said that the Gestapo has set up a 
		special review board to handle cases 
		just like mine.  And he said he would 
		get me a form, a special form.  Just 
		been printed up.  And I'm to fill it 
		out.  Isn't that good?

	Keltner looking at him, like a child that believes in the 
	boogie man:

				  KELTNER
		How many times since you've been 
		here, have you filled out forms?  
		Twenty?  Thirty times??

				  HELMUT
			(in fast)
		But this is different.  It's entirely 
		new.

	Helmut takes out a set of papers from his back pocket to 
	show Keltner.

				  HELMUT
		See?  These are made up by the Gestapo 
		itself... and the form will go 
		directly to Berlin, to Gestapo 
		headquarters.  That's the important 
		thing about this... the Gestapo's in 
		on it.  That's a very good sign.
			(a beat)
		Isn't it a good sign?

				  KELTNER
			(sympathetically)
		Yes, my son, it is a good sign.

				  HELMUT
			(in fast, excited; 
			scanning the papers)
		And I have to be very careful of 
		everything I put down on the form.  
		The tiniest detail could make the 
		difference.  Don't you agree?

	Helmut looks up and notices Johann is looking up towards the 
	ceiling of the barracks... watching something... Helmut looks 
	up, too.

	THEIR POV - THE BIRDS

	Up and under the eaves of the barrack just above their heads, 
	two small birds are perched (apparently they flew in from 
	outside and decided to nest there).

	BACK TO HELMUT AND KELTNER - TWO SHOT

				  KELTNER
		Isn't it strange?  They are free to 
		go anywhere they want, and they come 
		here to nest.

	Helmut doesn't react to Keltner's dialogue, but goes back to 
	his creased and soiled papers that he's read a thousand times 
	before, and reads them again... as he reads... Keltner takes 
	a piece of brown bread from his shirt pocket and crumbles it 
	and throws the crumbs up to the little birds...

	HIS POV - THE BIRDS

	They scramble to chew the crumbs, and they do...

	DOWN SHOT - KELTNER

	watching.  Johann just watches, smiling at the birds, turns 
	and looks to see if Helmut is watching, too...

	HELMUT - CLOSE

	Intense at scanning through the papers and totally oblivious 
	to Keltner and the birds...

	KELTNER - CLOSE

				  KELTNER
			(softly)
		Watch the birds eat, Helmut... it's 
		so cute...

				  HELMUT
		I'm sure I've got everything here...  
		The important facts from the moment 
		I was arrested, the questions the 
		Gestapo officer asked me...  now 
		what was his name again?  I can't 
		seem to remember what his name was...

				  KELTNER
		HELMUT...

				  HELMUT
		What the devil was his name?

				  KELTNER  (LOUDER)
		HELMUT !

				  HELMUT
			(coming out of it)
		Oh, yes, Johann... I'm sorry... you 
		were saying?

				  KELTNER
		You're not a religious man, are you, 
		Helmut?

				  HELMUT
			(thinking about it)
		Well, I... ah...

				  KELTNER
		Not sure I am myself anymore.

	Helmut quite surprised by this remark.

				  KELTNER
		Yet... when I see those birds, I 
		wonder...  were they sent here to 
		let us know this place really isn't 
		God forsaken?

				  HELMUT
		He should have sent them elsewhere...  
		they could be eaten here!

	Helmut goes back to studying his papers, Keltner ponders 
	Helmut's remark, looks backup at the birds... his face full 
	of compassion, as we:

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT (DUSK)

	We now see the Barracks completely (SHOOTING from flat on), 
	the wooden bunks are housed in a low wooden building with 
	eight two tier bunks on each side.  A group of men are 
	clustered around Keltner's bunk.  Here we meet:  ADOLF, a 
	large, once powerful man, in his mid thirties.  LUDWIG, once 
	a fairly prosperous businessman before his politics landed 
	him in prison, is older, and his bitterness is written all 
	over his face.  FRANZ, is the youngest.  He is a sensitive 
	looing twenty five year old, more than likely the "rebel" 
	type of the 1930s.

	Helmut is in his upper bunk over Keltner writing on an old 
	piece of paper with a scruffy pencil, which he bites to make 
	a point of, and wets with his tongue like any fat butcher 
	selling liverwurst and marking the price on a brown paper 
	bag... (i.e. Brooklyn, circa 1928).

	We TRUCK the CAMERA down the long barrack to include the 
	other men doing their things.  A couple of men are getting 
	ready for a card game... several others are comparing 
	clothing, mending and helping one another, a couple play 
	chess.  A few are sleeping, but for the most part, most of 
	the men lay in their bunks staring at the ceiling... The 
	floors are spotless... suffice to say they better be... the 
	walls have nothing hanging but a few socks drying... a torn 
	calendar, wrong year, etc.

	CLOSE - KELTNER GROUP

	Johann sits with his back to CAMERA... at the edge of his 
	bunk, leaving room on his bunk for Adolph, Ludwig, Franz.

	He is showing something to them that we cannot see.  Keltner's 
	body covers whatever it is that the three men are gawking 
	at, facing CAMERA... and they are indeed gawking with delight 
	and admiration.

				  LUDWIG
			(seriously)
		I think we should eat it!

				  KELTNER
		Not on your life...
			(catching himself)
		Er, that is... I wouldn't...

				  FRANZ
		Put it somewhere so it can brighten 
		up the place.

				  LUDWIG
			(sourly)
		It would take a hell of a lot more 
		than that to brighten up this place.

				  ADOLF
		It'll be better than looking at your 
		long face.

	Chuckling, Keltner rises.  We BOOM UP with him, and as his 
	head comes up over the top of the bottom bunk... he holds 
	out the object for Helmut to see... It is a potato, a sorry 
	looking spud... that Keltner has put in a small can of water 
	and is beginning to sprout two sick-looking shoots.

				  KELTNER
			(to Helmut)
		Do you see the way it's sprouting...  
		I told you it wasn't completely 
		rotten.

				  HELMUT
			(his mind on his thing)
		That's nice, Johann.  Do you remember 
		when I filled out those last forms?  
		The date might be important.

				  KELTNER
			(almost annoyed)
		About four weeks ago, I think.

	LOOSER SHOT

	As Keltner walks away from Helmut's bunk.

				  KELTNER
		I'll put it up here on the window 
		sill, it'll get the morning sun.

	He reaches the window and starts to reach up, to place the 
	potato on the sill... a hand shoots out holding the hand of 
	Keltner...

				  STOUT PRISONER
		Think you can trust your potato so 
		close to me, Reverend?

				  LUDWIG
		The potato he TRUSTS... it's you he 
		doesn't trust!

	All the men laugh, including the "stout prisoner" who laughs 
	the loudest... Keltner hands the stout prisoner the potato, 
	who in turn takes same and places it gently on the window 
	sill just adjacent to his bunk... after placing it on the 
	sill, he gestures ala the trapeze artist after making a super 
	truck, looking for applause... Keltner pats his leg in a 
	gesture of "thank you".  He starts back towards his bunk 
	when the front door of the barracks flings open and the Guard 
	enters.

				  GUARD
		ATTENTION !

	The men jump, but quickly, to their feet, and stand at 
	attention at the front of their bunks, ala inspection in the 
	army.  They are rigid and waiting to hear what's up.  The 
	Guard takes a few steps into the barracks... behind him we 
	see several prisoners carrying bunks waiting to enter the 
	barracks.

				  GUARD
		All the prisoners from the other 
		side of the camp are being moved 
		over to this side of the camp over 
		to this side of the camp.  Barracks 
		"H" will make room for three 
		additional bunks.

	He takes a few steps down the aisle...

				  GUARD
		I want all the bunks moved down toward 
		the far end.  Get them as close 
		together as possible. Now! GET MOVING!

	LONG SHOT

	The men scramble back to their own bunks and immediately 
	begin pulling, shoving, and grumbling comments about being 
	too overcrowded as it is...

				  THE MEN
			(ad lib)
		Gotta have more room... We need more 
		space...  Hey, watch where you're 
		going. This is stupid!

				  GUARD
			(yelling)
		YOU!  You down there at the end...  
		get those bunks right up against the 
		wall.

	CLOSE - HELMUT AND KELTNER

	As bunks are moved towards the far end of the barracks, 
	Keltner and Helmut prepare to move their bunks, the last 
	ones on their side.  Helmut and Adolf, who have already made 
	their move, come up to Keltner to help him with his bunk... 
	Helmut sees that Keltner has help so he decides to back off 
	and hide in his little corner with his pencil and scrap of 
	paper... totally involved with his own pain and his undying 
	fantasy about his ultimate release...

	WIDER SHOT - THE ENTIRE BARRACKS

	The guard looks down the barracks as the men just about finish 
	the moving job...

				  GUARD
		Hurry it up!  Come on, get moving!

	The guard turns towards the door and motions for the SIX 
	PRISONERS to enter the barracks... they enter by pairs, each 
	pair carrying a double-tier bunk.

	Their personal belongings are piled on the bunks and slung 
	over their shoulders in sacks (barracks bags)... the Guard 
	motions for the two bunks to be placed next to Helmut's and 
	one on the opposite side... next to the Stout Prisoner... 
	NOTE:  This arrangement leaves space for one additional bunk 
	right by the door.

	The guard motions for the Stout Prisoner and Herman to give 
	the new arrivals a hand with the placement of their bunks.

				  GUARD
		Get them close.
			(he looks around the 
			barracks)
		You're all going to be nice and cozy 
		in here.

				  STOUT PRISONER
			(in a loud voice)
		Yeah, like triplets before they are 
		born to a mother weighing 98 pounds...

				  HERMAN
		That's what I call cozy!

	The guard smiles, and all the men laugh...

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	The guard starts for the door, satisfied with the 
	arrangements... as he gets the door open, Helmut runs over 
	to catch him before he makes his exit...

				  HELMUT
			(anxiously)
		Excuse me, sir, the papers...  Did 
		they arrive yet?

				  GUARD
			(annoyed)
		They'll have to wait!

	He exits, closing the door behind him.  Helmut, with a look 
	of despair on his face, goes back to his bunk.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT AND KELTNER

				  HELMUT
		You'd think, since he was coming 
		over here anyway, the least he could 
		do was bring the papers with him.

				  KELTNER
		This moving men around has undoubtedly 
		kept him very busy... don't worry, 
		he'll bring them.

				  HELMUT
		I'm sure if I asked him again he'd 
		really become annoyed with me.  Would 
		you remind him for me, please?

				  KELTNER
			(kindly)
		Of course I will.

	Helmut climbs up to his bunk and goes back to his precious 
	paper work.

	WIDER ANGLE

	As the new prisoners make up their bunks and arrange their 
	belongings, the regulars of Barracks H, among them Adolf, 
	Ludwig, Herman and Franz, begin moving towards them to meet 
	them.  Keltner turns to the new white-haired prisoner whose 
	bunk is directly next to his.

				  KELTNER
		I've seen you around the yard, but 
		the others...

				  WHITE-HAIRED MAN
		About thirty of them got here 
		yesterday from the prison outside of 
		Frankfurt.

				  1ST NEW PRISONER
			(who occupies the 
			bunk above the white-
			haired prisoner)
		For the last three months we've been 
		shuttled from one camp to another.

				  2ND NEW PRISONER
			(his bunk is the lower 
			bunk on the direct 
			opposite side)
		Now they're shuffling us from one 
		side to another.  I think they're 
		trying to lose us.

				  HERMAN
		Do you think they're bringing in war 
		prisoners?

				  LUDWIG
		I don't know why they're sending 
		them here...  we're overcrowded as 
		it is.

				  KELTNER
		No, no... it's got to be something 
		else...  Otherwise they would have 
		left the bunks.

				  ADOLF
		It could be possible that he is fixing 
		up the barracks for some of his lady 
		friends.

				  KELTNER
		That many women?

				  HERMAN
			(standing at attention)
		Reverend, we Germans are SUPERMEN!

	All the men break out in laughter at Herman's comment and 
	his actions... but the laughter is cut short as they HEAR 
	the door open again, and they all look in that direction.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	SHOOTING OVER the men onto the door, entering is the same 
	guard that was just there... this time he enters with two 
	more prisoners carrying their bunks.  One of them is JOSEF 
	GALT, a burly bully like man, who knows all the tricks of 
	survival, and ERNST UHLMANN, a think little man with a face 
	like a weasel... they follow the Guard into the barracks 
	proper.

				  GUARD
		ATTENTION !

	The men quickly snap to attention.  The guard indicates for 
	Galt and Uhlmann to put the bunk in the space right by the 
	door.

				  GALT
		We might as well be outside.

				  UHLMANN
		If I get pneumonia, I'll hold the 
		government responsible!

				  GUARD
		With a little luck, you'll both get 
		pneumonia!

	The guard turns and moves towards the door, stops, and turns 
	to see all is well, and exits the door, closing it behind 
	him.

	Galt sits on the lower bunk as Uhlmann sprints up to the 
	upper bunk and looks towards the original men, who are just 
	standing around watching the two new "fish"... then men sense 
	trouble and slowly and quietly return to their own bunks... 
	some of the other men just stare at the two new prisoners...

				  UHLMANN
			(sitting on his bunk)
		It's sure quiet in here...

	WIDER ANGLE

	Uhlmann in his surveying the barracks spots the potato plant 
	on the window sill... next to the Stout Prisoner's bunk... 
	he jumps from his bunk and runs over towards the plant... he 
	takes it from the window sill and yells over to Galt...

				  UHLMANN
		Hey, Galt!  Come over and look at 
		this!

				  GALT
			(coming over to Uhlmann)
		What is it?

				  UHLMANN
		Ain't it cute?

				  GALT
		It's a God damn posie!

	He and Uhlmann burst into laughter...

				  UHLMANN
		Looks kinda sick, doesn't it?

				  GALT
			(examining it)
		It's one of them potato things...  
		and it sure as hell is sick!

				  UHLMANN
		Maybe we should put it out of its 
		misery.

				  GALT
		No, we don't want to do that...  we 
		might break someone's heart.

	He looks around at the other prisoners.

				  GALT
		Whose little plant is this?

	The stout prisoner gets up from his bunk and starts to move 
	forward and challenge Galt... but Keltner jumps from his 
	bunk and gets to Galt first.

				  KELTNER
			(with deep conviction)
		The plant is MINE!

				  GALT
		Is it now?  Tell me precious... do 
		you knit, too?

				  KELTNER
		If necessary, I can... and I do !

	This brings a ripple of laughter from the others... 
	particularly the new prisoners who are delighted at seeing 
	someone stand up to Galt for a change... Galt with a sneer 
	on his face steps out into the aisle to face Keltner square 
	on!

				  GALT
			(to Uhlmann)
		What do you think of that, Uhlmann... 
		he knits!

				  UHLMANN
		Now, if he could just cook...

	Galt and Uhlmann laugh, but they are the only ones that do...

				  GALT
			(coming out of the 
			laugh)
		Can you cook, sweetheart?

	Keltner knows damn well he can't fight the brute, yet he 
	realizes that if he steps down, life not only for him, but 
	for the others in the barracks will be intolerable under 
	Galt's bully rule.  (During the following dialogue, Adolf, 
	Franz, Ludwig, Herman and the Stout Prisoner... easy up a 
	little closer to Keltner and Galt.)

				  KELTNER
		If necessary, I can cook, yes!  Now, 
		if you don't mind, I'll take that 
		plant!

	He holds out his hand... Galt, wearing a deceptive smile, 
	eyes the older man...

				  GALT
		Alright, old man, you really want 
		it?

	He raises his arm over his head with the plant in that hand.

				  GALT
		Go get it!!

	CLOSE - KELTNER

	He looks past Galt at Helmut who is sitting up on his bunk...

	CLOSER - KELTNER

	He looks at Helmut.  His eyes try to encourage Helmut to do 
	something, say something, do anything to show that he is on 
	Keltner's side.

	CLOSE - HELMUT

	He sits up on his bunk, and wants nothing to do with the 
	bully and his pranks... so he goes back to studying his papers 
	and looks up again to catch Keltner's look of disappointment, 
	and as Keltner turns away from Helmut... Helmut realizes he 
	should do something to show Keltner he, indeed, cares... he 
	jumps down from his bunk and grabs Galt by the arm and turns 
	him around... they are now face to face...

				  HELMUT
		Why don't you pick on someone your 
		own size...

				  GALT
			(shocked, but pleased 
			that he finally got 
			a rise out of someone)
		What?

				  HELMUT
			(firmly)
		You heard me!  Give him his plant 
		back, and leave him alone...  He 
		didn't bother you ... and if you 
		have to show your muscle, there's 
		plenty of other guys to pick on!

				  GALT
		You're my size!

	... and with this, Galt smacks Helmut a shot across the mouth 
	that sends him spilling into the corner, half knocked 
	unconcious... he lays there with blood flowing from his 
	mouth...

	Keltner leaves Galt and runs to the corner to see if Helmut 
	is okay.  Galt follows him... Keltner is leaning down checking 
	Helmut... as Galt bends down next to the two of them... still 
	holding the plant.

				  GALT
		He's alright... that'll teach him to 
		keep his nose out of my business... 
		here's your plant!

	Galt makes like he's handing the plant to Keltner, who reaches 
	for it, and as he does Galt slowly stands up making Keltner 
	reach and reach and reach... and as Keltner gets closer and 
	closer, Galt stands to his fullest height... making it 
	literally impossible for Keltner to get it... Franz, Ludwig, 
	Adolf, Herman and the Stout Prisoner (more than likely 
	provoked by Helmut's stand, now circle Galt)...

				  GALT
			(still holding the 
			plant up high)
		Go on, little man, reach for it!

	Keltner, torn between seeing that Helmut is alright, and 
	getting his plant back, tries to get it, and still looks to 
	see that Helmut isn't hurt too bad...

				  HERMAN
			(in a low menacing 
			voice)
		Give it to him!

	Galt looks at him with a menacing stare...

				  ADOLF
		You heard him... give it to him!

				  FRANZ
		You've had your fun... give it to 
		him... NOW!

				  STOUT PRISONER
			(closing in on Galt)
		RIGHT NOW!!

	Galt realizes this is no time for a showdown... and with a 
	childlike smile... grits his teeth...

				  GALT
		Sure, here's your stupid flower or 
		whatever you call it...

	Keltner takes it from him.

				  KELTNER
		Thank you...

	Keltner leans down and picks Helmut up and walks him to his 
	bunk, helps him onto it, and puts the plant on his own bunk...

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	The four men:  Ludwig, Adolf, Franz and Herman stay with 
	Galt, as does the Stout Prisoner... They are clustered around 
	Galt.

				  GALT
		What's the matter with you guys?  
		Can't you take a joke?

				  ADOLF
		What joke?

				  GALT
		Hell, all I was doing was trying to 
		have a little fun.

				  LUDWIG
		Have it with someone else!

				  GALT
		What's so special about him?

				  ADOLF
		That's the Reverend.  Even when they 
		came and dragged him from his 
		church...  he kept right on preaching 
		against them until they knocked him 
		unconscious.

	Galt is silent for a beat.

				  GALT
		Well, how the hell was I supposed to 
		know?

				  HERMAN
		NOW you know!

	Galt shoves his way through the five men and walks beaten, 
	for the moment, to his own bunk... as the men disperse and 
	walk back to their respective bunks...

	CLOSE - GALT AND UHLMANN

	Galt walks over and sits at the edge of his bunk, while 
	Uhlmann swings his legs back and forth from his perched 
	position on the top of his bunk... Galt gives him a stare...

				  GALT
		You and your posies...

				  UHLMANN
		That was close...

				  GALT
		Where were you when I need you?

				  UHLMANN
		I make love, not war!
			(goes giggly over 
			what he just said)
		Hey, that's pretty good... I made 
		that up... Make love, not war!  I 
		bet that would make a good slogan 
		someday...

				  GALT
		Aw, shut up!

	And he smacks his legs up and onto the bunk.

	TWO SHOT - KELTNER AND HELMUT

	Keltner with a wet towel in his hand cleaning the blood-
	dripping mouth of Helmut...

				  KELTNER
		That was really very nice of you, 
		Helmut...

				  HELMUT
		Yeah, nice and STUPID!

	Helmut grabs the towel and throws it to the floor and turns 
	on his side away from Keltner.  Keltner bends down, gets the 
	towel, sits on the edge of his bunk... looks up, wonders and 
	ponders Helmut as we

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BARRACKS H - NIGHT

	The door to Barracks H slowly opens and Helmut peeks through 
	the opening to see that all is clear... he slips out and 
	walks along the dark, dreary alleyway towards the Guard's 
	shack... he moves like a prisoner trying to miss the 
	spotlights in a jail break...

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Helmut gets to the Guards hut... he looks into the window, 
	and sees the Guard he wants... sitting at his desk eating 
	off a tray that has a meal fit for a king on it... including 
	the "doilies"... wine, and a steak that would satisfy six 
	men in Barracks H... Helmut looks around to be sure no one 
	notices him and slowly slips up to the front door of the 
	shack and knocks on the door...

	INT. GUARD'S SHACK - NIGHT

				  GUARD
			(annoyed at being 
			bothered)
		Come in!

	The meek and frightened Helmut enters the shack and walks 
	over to the Guard's desk, and his eyes go immediately to the 
	tray of food.  While the Guard just stares at him... somewhat 
	shocked at his presence in the shack.

				  GUARD
			(breaking the silence)
		What the hell are you doing here?  
		Who gave you permission to leave 
		your quarters?

	Helmut tries to talk as the guard gets louder and louder.

				  GUARD
		Are you some kind of privileged 
		character?

	Helmut nods no...

				  GUARD
		Then what are you doing out of the 
		barracks?

	The frustration of not being able to answer, and the 
	frustrations of being hungry... and the child-like treatment 
	Helmut is getting from this Pig becomes emotionally too 
	much... as he screams...

				  HELMUT
			(turning red)
		If you'll shut your stupid mouth 
		maybe I can answer one of your 
		questions!

	The Guard looks at Helmut in disbelief... but at the same 
	time a little delighted at this chance to show his German 
	superiority... as he slowly gets up from behind the desk and 
	crosses to Helmut, with a sneer that would frighten Rommel...

				  GUARD
			(nose to nose with 
			Helmut)
		I have a STUPID MOUTH?

	Helmut backs away towards the door, and the Guard moves closer 
	and closer to him... backing him up against the door.

				  HELMUT
			(meekly)
		I'm sorry, I didn't mean to raise my 
		voice...

	He bows his head in fear, as well as concern for what he 
	might have done to his chances of release.

				  GUARD
		The volume of your voice isn't the 
		issue...  it's what comes out of 
		your mouth that disturbs me...  maybe 
		you need a little lesson in respect 
		and courtesy...

	And he smacks Helmut across the face with his black glove...

				  GUARD
		... and maybe I've been a little too 
		soft with you...

	He smacks him again, harder... the glove now feels like a 
	sword to Helmut... and his hands hang limp down by his sides.

				  GUARD
		You see, Doork, I knew why you came 
		in here...  I knew why you left your 
		barracks without permission... It's 
		just that I hadn't heard you mention 
		your release papers for so long I 
		had hoped I could hear you begging 
		once more...

				  HELMUT
			(in a whisper)
		I'm sorry...

				  GUARD
			(mimicking him)
		I'm sorry, I'm sorry... You're a 
		sorry specimen of a human being... 
		that's what you are...

	And he smacks him this time with all the force he can 
	muster...

				  GUARD
		Now, I will help you to your quarters, 
		Herr Doork, here you will stay, and 
		pray for release papers that may, or 
		may not, ever come...

	This wakes Helmut's soul and he becomes erect and stonefaced 
	at the words the guards just said... this look infuriates 
	the guard even more... he grabs Helmut by the scruff of the 
	neck... like grabbing a wet cat to be thrown out of the 
	house... and he opens the door and pulls Helmut by the back 
	of the office... out the door, down the three steps and onto 
	the ground... and pulls him like a sack of potatoes to the 
	barracks doorway...

	EXT. BARRACKS H - DOORWAY - NIGHT

	Helmut is just about beaten at this point as the guard opens 
	the door of the barracks and pulls Helmut into the doorway, 
	and his body stops on the threshold.

	INT. BARRACKS H - NIGHT

	SHOOTING OVER the men onto the doorway... in the deep b.g. 
	the sad body and figure of the man lays in the doorway, as 
	the Guard kicks him in the ribs, unmercifully...

				  GUARD
		Now, get inside where you belong and 
		don't ever let me catch you doing 
		anything without permission again.

	Helmut slowly gets up... in pain and practically crawls to 
	his bunk... having to pass all the men, almost as though he 
	were ashamed .. he gets to his bunk, and tries vainly to get 
	up to the top where he lives... Keltner helps him... and as 
	he settles in his place...

	CLOSE - THE GUARD

				  GUARD
			(yelling across the 
			barracks)
		Reverend!  If you don't watch that 
		idiot, we may have to get him a 
		keeper!

	The guard storms out the door... slamming it shut.

	CLOSE - KELTNER AND HELMUT

	Keltner leaning over the side of Helmut's bunk whispering... 
	as the other men go back to their respective chores and 
	whatever they were doing when the guard stormed in...

				  KELTNER
		Helmut, Helmut, how could you think 
		of doing such a thing? I begged you 
		not to irritate him...  and that I 
		would ask him about your papers...  
		that wasn't smart, Helmut... not 
		smart at all...  as a matter of 
		fact...

				  HELMUT
			(gritting his teeth)
		Leave me alone!  ... and mind your 
		own business... Just leave me be...

	Keltner knows this is nothing more than Helmut's dismay and 
	pain in his heart talking... The kindly man drops down to 
	his own bunk... just shaking his head... as if to say, how 
	can I help him?  as we:

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BARRACKS H - DAY

	The same Guard is motioning for the men to hurry and get 
	outside... he is standing at the doorway to the barracks and 
	the men are moving out into the ice cold morning as briskly 
	as they can... the Guard moves inside after the last man has 
	made his exit...

	INT. BARRACKS - DAY

	SHOOTING OVER the Guard as he looks around, we see Keltner 
	coming out of the toilet area, rushing because he's late... 
	he throws his towel on his bunk, and as he does... he sees 
	what stops him in his tracks...

	KELTNER'S POV

	It is Helmut still sound asleep in his bunk...

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Keltner moves towards Helmut to wake him...

				  GUARD
			(in a sotto voice)
		Reverend, let him sleep... you move 
		out, I'll take care of this...

	Keltner reluctantly starts to move out towards the front 
	door, as the Guard passes him on his way to Helmut's bunk... 
	Keltner goes out the door... the Guard sneaks over towards 
	the bunk where Helmut is asleep and very sneakily slips the 
	cover off Helmut's body... then proceeds to open the window 
	above his head and the window alongside... and across the 
	way and opens the back door... which is adjacent to the toilet 
	area... and walks out of the barracks leaving the front door 
	wide open...

	EXT. BARRACKS H - DAY

	All the men are lined up for inspection, they are all looking 
	straight ahead as the Guard walks down the line.

	All except Keltner who can't help but look in the direction 
	of the barracks where he knows Helmut is still sleeping.  He 
	throws a glance at the guard as if to say... why?  Why are 
	you doing this?  Why did he leave Helmut sleeping, usually 
	the one thing that would send the guard up a wall... why is 
	he allowing this to happen?

				  GUARD
			(as he finishes his 
			walk)
		You are a sick looking group of 
		things...  I can't even call you 
		human...  because you're not... you're 
		all lice...  DISMISSED!

	The men break up and go about their business, they move in 
	all directions, but Keltner starts for the doorway to the 
	barracks and is detoured by the guard who knew he would, as 
	he stands in the way of Keltner who has to turn away and go 
	about his business... the Guard peeks into the barracks.

	INT. BARRACKS - GUARD'S POV - DAY

	Helmut still sleeping...

	EXT. BARRACKS - CLOSE - GUARD - DAY

	He is delighted... he grabs the door and slams it shut with 
	a bang that would wake the dead... then opens it again and 
	walks off...

	INT. BARRACKS - CLOSE - HELMUT - DAY

	He jumps from out of his hard sleep... foggy and unsure about 
	where he is, what time it is and he looks around and sees 
	the barracks are empty... and he panics... but he is also 
	shivering... the barracks feel like the inside of a meat 
	truck refrigerated somewhat below zero...

	Helmut grabs his pants from the front of his bunk, pulls the 
	cover over him and tries to get the pants on under the 
	cover... It is cold!  (Photographically, we can show "cold"... 
	Props:  vapor/smoke.)

	He gets his pants on and jumps down onto the cold floor and 
	dances from the ice-like floor, he bends down looking for 
	his socks and shoes... he wears just a tee-shirt...

	Having trouble finding both shoes, he grabs the blanket again 
	and covers himself with it, while searching for the other 
	shoe...

	He finds the other shoe and proceeds to put them on... takes 
	a beat and sees he has no socks on... reaches under the bank 
	and pulls out the pair of socks... which stand straight up 
	(from the cold ... he holds them in the air, and drops one 
	at a time and they sound like "pans" hitting the floor... he 
	takes one and blows warm air from his mouth into the socks, 
	one at a time, which warms them... (Props:  the socks need 
	discussion!)

	He then proceeds to put his shoes on and puts one on, and 
	then the other... now wearing both shoes he starts to tie 
	the laces... he pulls them straight away to tie and they 
	stand straight up!  (Props:  this is done with leather laces, 
	pure leather... it works without any unnecessary rigging!)

	INSERT - THE STANDING STRAIGHT LACES

	BACK TO SCENE

	He finally gets them tied and starts, still sleepily, into 
	the toilet area... (We can go for a great sound joke here.)  
	He steps into the latrine, closes the door and we HEAR the 
	SOUND of crushed ice being poured into the bowl... he flushes 
	and we HEAR what might sound like an ice crusher... he steps 
	out of the latrine and walks over to the basin and turns the 
	water on.

	INSERT

	The water spigots... they both read "COLD".

	BACK TO SCENE

	And as he takes some water on his hands to his face... it is 
	"cold" and his face just freezes from the pain of the cold... 
	he looks around and sees the little metal ashtray, that looks 
	like a small bowl or a tin from a used shaving cream lather 
	soap... he fills it with water.. and to show his ingenuity, 
	he takes a lighter from his pocket, places the tin on the 
	edge of the sink and lights the fire under the tin (which 
	couldn't possibly hold more than a handful of water) and 
	proceeds to heat same...

	Once he is satisfied that it is at least warmer than the 
	spigot supplied, he grabs for the tin which is so hot from 
	the burning, he screams in another type pain... the pain of 
	"HOT" hurting... he decides to flick his fingers in the tin 
	bowl and splash some of the water on his face (which is by 
	now, just drips of water)... brushes his teeth with his finger 
	and soap... straightens his hair and exits the toilet to his 
	bunk to get his shirt... another "ICE COLD" item... he feels 
	how cold it is, and doesn't have the courage for another 
	climate blast... he rolls up his shirt and places it under 
	his armpit to warm it... as it hits under his arm... the 
	cold just about wipes him out... he decides to sit on it... 
	and he does.

	CLOSE - THE GUARD - AT THE DOOR

	He's been peeking all the while... He figures he's had his 
	laugh, and it's the first time we see he can laugh... he 
	steps into the barracks area, and yells:

				  GUARD
		Doork!  Move it out, and on the 
		double!!

	Helmut jumps with fright, unravels his shirt, runs towards 
	the open door putting on his shirt as we

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. BARRACKS H - NIGHT

	Most of the men are clustered around their bunks, and in the 
	dull light we see some of them in the aisles, talking, playing 
	cards... while most of the others are whistling, clapping, 
	and laughing as Uhlmann does his silly little clog dance... 
	it is apparent the ugly episode between Galt and Uhlmann has 
	been forgotten for the moment.

	The lights are hung from cords down off the ceiling and for 
	a complex this size it could use ten... there are but two.

	Uhlmann is having the time of his ignorant life... the more 
	the men applaud, the more he "clog dances".

	MED. CLOSE SHOT - LUDWIG AND ADOLF

	They are both seated on their top bunk, Adolf enjoying the 
	poor dance Uhlmann is giving as Ludwig looks down the aisle 
	towards Helmut's bunk.

				  LUDWIG
			(nudging Adolf)
		It looks like Helmut found some new 
		ears to listen to his Super Star 
		fantasies...

	Adolf takes a look, shrugs his shoulder, as if to say I 
	couldn't care less... and goes on watching the action of 
	Uhlmann and the other men...

				  LUDWIG
			(to himself, but for 
			Adolf to hear as 
			well; a la 
			Shakespeare, mimicking 
			Helmut)
		Ringling Brothers would have done 
		anything for me to appear with them 
		but I had to do what was best for 
		me!

	CLOSE - HELMUT AND THE FOUR NEW PRISONERS

	The four new men are surrounding Helmut on the top of his 
	bunk listening to his bragging.

				  HELMUT
		So I told Mr. Ringling if he wanted 
		"Helmut" he'd have to bring his circus 
		to Germany... I am a German, I told 
		him, and my responsibility is to my 
		own people who are my biggest fans.

				  1ST PRISONER (NEW ONE)
		Did you really say that?

				  HELMUT
			(proudly)
		Of course I did... they offered me 
		anything...  anything I wanted to go 
		with them.

				  2ND NEW PRISONER
		Hey! I saw the circus in Berlin about 
		four years ago...  Didn't  you make 
		your entrance in a long tail coat 
		with a pair of tails on the jacket 
		about fifty feet long?  Sure!  And a 
		funny Little clown at the very end 
		carrying the tails like a woman's 
		train?

	Helmut studies the prisoners glare and decides he couldn't 
	even remember the clown he saw was Gustav the Great, why 
	not?  No one would ever know... and he nods with a kind of 
	studied humility... yes.

				  2ND NEW PRISONER
		You were great!

	Helmut eats it up.

				  2ND NEW PRISONER
		You should have seen him... You'd 
		never know it was him... with the 
		long tails  and white tie... red 
		nose...  long hair...  and a battered 
		top hat... with the hair hanging way 
		down to his shoulders...  and, ah, 
		let me see... oh, yeah... your mouth 
		went from ear to ear.

				  HELMUT
			(softly)
		Right!

				  3RD NEW PRISONER
		How do "clowns" ever come up with 
		such ideas for faces and make-up?

				  HELMUT
		It doesn't happen overnight... it 
		takes years and years... You try 
		many faces, then finally you hit the 
		one that's just right for you.

				  4TH NEW PRISONER
		My kids will never believe this, I 
		can't wait to... tell...

	His voice trails off as he realizes the hopelessness of what 
	he was about to say.  This puts a damper on the discussion 
	and the men start to break up and get down off the bunk.  
	Helmut, seeing his captive audience leaving... panics.

				  HELMUT
			(emotionally)
		Wait, let me tell you some other 
		things...  I mean things that are 
		really exciting and...  please!  
		Please... let me just have a few 
		more...

				  1ST NEW PRISONER
			(ignoring Helmut 
			completely)
		What's going on with those guys?

	He's looking off down the aisle where Uhlmann has his 
	audience... The four prisoners move out into the aisle to 
	get a better look, leaving Helmut perched on his bunk with a 
	pleading and broken look of despair...

				  HELMUT
			(a last attempt)
		Did you know "clowns" literally 
		bequeath their faces to their sons, 
		or sometimes to...

	He realizes it's futile as the four new prisoners move towards 
	Uhlmann and the others down the aisle...

				  3RD PRISONER
		Come on, let's see what's such fun...

	He moves and the others move along with him.  Helmut thinks 
	about joining them, and starts to move off his bunk but his 
	body won't respond... he just hangs there limply... his head 
	lowered, a sad man.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	SHOOTING OVER the men placing Helmut in the very deep  b.g. 
	as we see the four new prisoners walk over to watch the 
	action...

	MED. CLOSE - UHLMANN, GALT, KELTNER, AND OTHERS

	Uhlmann is just finishing his dance with a spin, when he 
	finally gets dizzy and topples over on one of the bunks.  
	All the men applaud wildly.  Uhlmann laying half down and 
	half up on the lower bunk he landed on, breathing heavily... 
	yells over to Galt...

				  UHLMANN
		Hey, Galt, it's your turn, how about 
		doin' one of your belly dances for 
		us?

	All the men agree and start yelling for Galt to do it... 
	Galt moves out into the center of the aisle in the clearing 
	made by the men, and holds up his hands for silence... they 
	quiet down and Galt looks around until he spots Keltner.

				  GALT
		Reverend?

	The men become very still, they look from Galt to Keltner 
	and back to Galt, their eyes reflecting suspicion of him, 
	wondering what he's up to now.  Galt is fully aware of this.

				  GALT
		Well, Reverend, what do you think?  
		Would a little belly-dancing be too 
		much for the boys?

	Keltner studies Galt for a beat, then accepts his offer of a 
	truce.

				  KELTNER
			(moving over towards 
			Galt)
		A little fun is what we need... so...  
		if you'll all hold the noise down, 
		I'll join in.

	A hushed cheer goes up from the men as Keltner stands besides 
	Galt.  Galt holds his hands over his head and nods for Keltner 
	to do the same thing.  The Reverend does, and now Galt begins 
	undulating his hips.  Keltner studies the move for a beat 
	and then does the same thing but with comical awkwardness.  
	Franz starts playing a slow sensuous rhythm on his harmonica.  
	The men clap and whistle softly.

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	He is sitting upright on top of his bunk, watching what Galt 
	has Keltner doing, a look of disgust passes his face as he 
	turns away from what he'd been watching and gets busy with 
	his papers and figuring again.

	MED. SHOT - GALT, KELTNER

	They are just finishing their dance.  The men applaud wildly 
	but softly... Keltner, puffing, moves over to the side and 
	sits on one of the bunks to catch his breath.  Galt takes a 
	few bows, and the men react with applause and whistling that's 
	beginning to take on "noise" proportions... Keltner motions 
	for the men to hold it down... and they do.

				  4TH NEW PRISONER
		Say, why don't we get the clown to 
		do something?

				  GALT
		A clown?  Who's a clown??

				  HERMAN
		You've heard of "Helmut Doork".  
		That's him down there!

				  LUDWIG
		Don't waste your time.  You'll never 
		get the Great Doork to do anything.

	WIDER SHOT

	as he starts walking towards Helmut's bunk...

				  1ST NEW PRISONER
		Oh, I'm sure he will!

	The others follow right behind.  There is a look on Keltner's 
	face like he would like to stop them, but between his puffing 
	and his certainty that Helmut will be alright, he stays where 
	he is.

	CLOSE - ADOLF

	as he walks with the others.

				  ADOLF
		You're wasting your time.  He doesn't 
		perform for the likes of us... he'll 
		turn you down.

				  LUDWIG
		He's right, we've been asking him 
		for three years...  I have a feeling 
		he only does his little routines for 
		the crowned heads of Europe.

				  ADOLF
		And, of course, the BIG heads of 
		Berlin.

	There is general laughter... as the group arrives at Helmut's 
	bunk.

	CLOSE - HELMUT

	He sees something's going to happen, he puts his papers away 
	and sits upright... waiting... his eyes catch Galt's eyes 
	peering at him.

	Galt tells it all with his eyes... This one isn't "sacred" 
	to the men... he might just be the pigeon Galt's been hoping 
	for... the one every bully looks for, for his own brand of 
	fun.

				  1ST PRISONER
		How about it, Doork?

				  HELMUT
			(swinging his legs 
			around ready to jump 
			down)
		I'd like to, but I can't... really... 
		I can't.

				  GALT
			(strongly)
		Can't?  Did I hear you say you can't?

				  HELMUT
			(it stops him in his 
			tracks; he stays up 
			on the bunk)
		I'd like to do something... but...
			(pointing to the 2nd 
			New Prisoner)
		He can tell you... He's seen me 
		work...  I need props... make-up...  
		I work with a lot of different 
		things...

				  2ND NEW PRISONER
		That's right... I did... and he does!

				  HELMUT
			(in fast)
		Sure, tell them... I can't just do 
		anything...  I need lights, props, 
		my costume.

	Galt doesn't like no for an answer...

				  GALT
			(gritting his teeth)
		Now, me and these... gentlemen...  
		we don't expect you to do your "act", 
		just a little something that'll give 
		us a laugh, that's all.

	Keltner moves in from o.s. and stands at the back of the 
	group watching and listening.

				  LUDWIG
			(to all the men)
		Aw, forget it... and that's probably 
		his problem...  he's forgotten how!

				  GALT
			(trying to suck him 
			in)
		Wait a minute, you guys... show people 
		have to be in a mood...
			(to Franz)
		Play a little music, like in a 
		circus...

	Franz starts playing his harmonica... slowly...

				  GALT
		There!  Ain't that nice?  Don't it 
		put you in a mood?

				  HELMUT
			(getting fed up)
		I TOLD YOU!  I need things to do my 
		act.

				  2ND NEW PRISONER
		Hey, Doork, what about that drunk 
		routine... that was funny...

	Helmut looks at him puzzled... he can't think or remember 
	anything at this point... certainly not anything relating to 
	any of the previous lies he's told...

				  GALT
			(pacifying his head 
			off)
		Yeah, that drunk thing...  that does 
		sound funny...

				  HELMUT
		I still need many things... props 
		and...

				  2ND NEW PRISONER
			(puzzled)
		I don't remember you using anything 
		in that drunk routine.

				  GALT
			(starting to fume)
		Hey... are you trying to fool us?

	With this Keltner moves in and up to Galt.

				  KELTNER
		Leave him alone!

				  GALT
		Stay out of this, Reverend. We're 
		not doing anything... We just want 
		him to join in the fun.

				  UHLMANN
			(to the men)
		Right!  If a Reverend can give us a 
		laugh, why not a clown?

	All the men ad lib their agreement with what Uhlmann just 
	said; it appears that they are all on Galt's side, and Keltner 
	knows it.

				  KELTNER
			(to Helmut, softly)
		It doesn't have to be anything 
		special... a little dance, maybe?

				  HELMUT
			(taking it all out on 
			Keltner)
		Like that disgusting exhibition you 
		did?  Oh, no... not me!

				  4TH NEW PRISONER
		Go on, Doork, so I can tell my kids.

				  HELMUT
		Can't you get it through your heads, 
		I need...

				  GALT
			(firmly)
		WE need you to give us a laugh.

	Galt grabs Helmut's jacket and pulls him off the bunk, nose 
	to nose to him...

				  GALT
		So... TRY!

	Galt has Helmut by the neck portion of the jacket, practically 
	choking him to death... his vice-like hands are closing in 
	on his throat and Helmut's trying vainly just to breathe...

	One of the prisoners starts pounding his feet and making a 
	march-like noise yelling from the other end... "So try!"... 
	"So try!"... "So try!"... "So try!"... the other prisoners 
	in the barracks pick up the chant and the stomping... Keltner 
	doesn't even hear the racket they've started because of his 
	concern for Helmut being choked to death... He tries to loosen 
	Galt's hands from Helmut's throat.

				  KELTNER
		That's enough, leave him alone!

				  GALT
		Stay out of it, Reverend!

	Galt spins Helmut around so that his back is facing the aisle 
	and he walks him into the center area... the other men feeling 
	this violence happening, and watching.  Helmut being choked, 
	triggers all of their venom and their hate and they really 
	come on strong... stomping, yelling...

				  THE MEN
			(ad lib)
		Choke him harder...  see if that's 
		funny!  Make him dance! Hey, Doork!...  
		be funny now! He don't look so funny 
		to me!  He sure as hell looks funny 
		to me!  Hey, Galt, pull his string 
		and make the dummy funny!

	And they stomp and they stomp and they stomp... "So try!"... 
	"So try!"... They get louder and louder... Helmut is kicking 
	his legs, which are off the ground, and Galt won't let go.

	CLOSE - HELMUT

	His face is turning color... he hasn't a lot of air left in 
	his lungs... and Keltner is practically hanging onto Galt 
	trying to get his hands loose... and Galt could carry another 
	three men without batting an eye.  Galt puts him down slowly, 
	in the middle of the aisle, so that just his feet touch the 
	ground, but he keeps his hands around his throat.

				  GALT
		Your public is calling, clown... 
		now, clown!

	WIDER SHOT

	SHOOTING OVER Galt, Keltner and Helmut, we see the door of 
	the barracks slam open and bang against the wall making more 
	noise than anything all the men made together, and they all 
	freeze...

	MED. CLOSE - THE GUARD

	He stands in the doorway, legs spread apart, hands on his 
	waist... and he is wearing a raincoat, the barracks has become 
	totally silent... all that is heard is the rain pecking away 
	on the roof.  Galt has let go of Helmut who just lays on the 
	floor with Galt and Keltner on both sides of him...

				  GUARD
			(walking slowly into 
			the barracks)
		What is going on here?
			(to Helmut)
		On your feet!

	Helmut gets up, dizzily, just about getting oxygen back into 
	his system...

				  GALT
			(like a little boy)
		He was showing us some of his funny 
		clown falls...

	The Guard surveys the faces of the others as they stare back.

				  GUARD
		Because of all the noise coming from 
		in here -- I have been called up 
		front to explain...  I don't like to 
		be called up front...  I don't like 
		to have to explain...
			(menacingly)
		And, you might not like it, either.
			(a beat)
		Back to your bunks, all of you...  
		Turn out the lights, and keep it 
		QUIET !

	As the guard turns to the door to go, Helmut takes a step 
	forward about to stop the guard, Keltner grabs his arm and 
	turns him the other way... the Guard exits closing the door, 
	quietly behind him... The men start to disperse... Galt gives 
	Helmut a "I'll get you for this" look and returns to his own 
	bunk with Uhlmann almost up his ass following... Keltner 
	leads Helmut back to their bunk.

				  HELMUT
			(whispering)
		I was just going to ask him about 
		the forms... my release...

				  KELTNER
			(shaking his head)
		That was not the time, believe me!

	Keltner sits Helmut down next to him on his lower bunk, as 
	Helmut rubs his throat, and tries swallowing a few times...

				  KELTNER
		Hurt much?

				  HELMUT
			(beaten)
		No, I'm alright... thank you.

	They both sit in silence... Helmut breaks the silence...

				  HELMUT
		Johann, why do they pick on me?  
		I've never done anything to them.

				  KELTNER
		You've never done anything for them!

	Helmut dislikes Keltner's remark and gets up from the lower 
	bunk and starts up to his.  He gets to the top bunk and starts 
	to get onto it, stops and whispers to Keltner.

				  HELMUT
		You think I should have performed?

				  KELTNER
		The men would have appreciated it.

	Helmut rolls into his bunk, the lights go out and he lies on 
	his back staring at the ceiling.  Keltner sits on the side 
	of his bunk and takes his shoes off... periodically the rays 
	from the searchlights revolving outside cross the windows to 
	momentarily flood the barracks with light.  After a few 
	seconds, Helmut leans over to whisper to Keltner.

				  HELMUT
		Johann!

				  KELTNER
			(he stands up, eye 
			level with Helmut)
		What is it?

				  HELMUT
		They don't believe me, do they?  I 
		mean about being a clown?

				  KELTNER
		Oh, I'd say you've convinced most.  
		However --
			(a long beat)
		There is one you haven't convinced...

	Helmut stares at Keltner, knowing full well what's coming... 
	yet doesn't have the courage to take the chance that it might 
	be another thought... so he waits...

				  KELTNER
			(gently)
		You, Helmut... you!

	CLOSE - HELMUT

	The truth of Keltner's charge hits Helmut with an overpowering 
	force.  He looks at Keltner for a beat... his eyes filled 
	with pain, then slowly turns away from him, leaving him 
	standing there as we PAN with Helmut and HOLD on...

	CLOSE - THE WINDOW

	The rain is pouring down.

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	FULL SHOT - YARD - DAY

	It is the next morning, a chilly, damp day following a night 
	of rain.

				  LOUDSPEAKER (O.S.)
		Attention!  Attention!  All prisoners 
		will assemble immediately in the 
		yard.  All prisoners will assemble 
		immediately in the yard. Attention!  
		Attention!

	The loudspeakers repeat the command.  Across the muddy, puddle 
	splotched yard, a barbed wire barricade about six feet high 
	has been erected, dividing the camp in two.  A number of 
	guards patrol the fence on both sides.

	EXT. BARRACKS H - WINDOW - DAY

	Uhlmann is looking out into the yard.  He motions to someone 
	to "take a look at this".

	INT. BARRACKS H - DAY

	Galt has just arrived at the window where Uhlmann is standing.

				  UHLMANN
		They've put up barbed wire!

	MED. SHOT - FAVORING HELMUT, KELTNER

	They look at each other in wonder as they start into the 
	aisle.  The men in the barracks are frantically trying to 
	organize themselves.

	EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

	The prisoners are pouring out of the barracks doorway.  Galt 
	and Uhlmann are already standing outside as Helmut, Keltner, 
	Herman, Adolf, Franz, Ludwig, Stout Prisoner, New Prisoners, 
	join them.  All look o.s. momentarily speechless at what 
	they see.

				  GALT
		What the hell... ?

	FULL SHOT - YARD - PRISONERS' POV

	Beyond the fence we see men, women and children standing in 
	groups near the barracks on that side of the camp.  The SOUND 
	of children crying can be heard.

	VARIOUS SHOTS - MEN

	As they quickly scurry to line up in front of their own hut.

				  STOUT PRISONER
		Youngsters!  They've got youngsters 
		over there.

				  YOUNG PRISONER
		Women!

				  ADOLF
		Another fence!

	MED. SHOT - PRISONERS - FAVORING KELTNER

	Helmut stands next to him.

				  HELMUT
		What does it mean?  What do they 
		need a fence for?

				  KELTNER
			(shaking his head)
		Misery loves company.  Looks like 
		they're going to deny us even that.

	The Guard is shoving the late-comers into place.

				  GUARD
		All right.  All right, move.  Hurry 
		it up.  Move.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	SHOOTING ACROSS the prisoners in f.g. toward the new fence.  
	Guards move among the men, herding them into lines.  On the 
	other side of the fence, we can see the new arrivals lining 
	up, being prodded into place by Guards.

	LONG SHOT - PRISON YARD - DAY

	On both sides of the fence, the prison inmates have assembled 
	in the wet, forbidden yard.  On one side are the regular 
	prisoners, who watch the guards warily as they straighten 
	their lines.  On the other side are the new prisoners -- 
	about two hundred frightened Jews of all ages, including 
	thirty or forty children and a number of very old men and 
	women.  They stand in absolute silence as the loudspeakers 
	blare again, except for the crying children.

				  LOUDSPEAKER
		Attention!  The Commandant issues 
		the following special order:  the 
		north side of the camp is now 
		temporary quarters for non-Aryan 
		prisoners.  Fraternizing between 
		Aryan and non-Aryan prisoners is 
		strictly prohibited.  Any violation 
		of this order will be severely 
		punished.  Heil Hitler... Repeating...

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	SHOOTING THROUGH the booted, outspread legs of a soldier 
	guard in f.g. toward the line of prisoners behind him.  One 
	woman holds a child of about three who cries inconsolably.

				  LOUDSPEAKER
		The Commandant issues the following 
		special order:

	As the announcement is read, the guard's legs turn around, 
	and he walks away from the CAMERA toward the woman.  He stands 
	before her menacingly, and she clutches the child closer to 
	her in a futile attempt to hush its crying.

				  LOUDSPEAKER
		The north side of the camp is now 
		temporary quarters for non-Aryan 
		prisoners.  Fraternizing between 
		Aryan and non-Aryan prisoners is...

	MED. SHOT - PRISONERS

	SHOOTING along line of prisoners from barracks H to show 
	their various reactions as the announcement continues -- 
	disdain, surprise, sympathy and relief.  The guard stands 
	with his back to the line at the end farthest from the CAMERA.  
	Galt is near the CAMERA.

				  GALT
			(under his breath)
		Jews!

	Prisoners nearest to Galt eye him questioningly.

				  LOUDSPEAKER
		... strictly prohibited.  Any 
		violation of this order will be 
		severely punished.  Heil Hitler.

	The loudspeakers go dead.  The prisoners stand silently 
	studying the new arrivals across the yard.  The new prisoners 
	self-consciously file back into their huts on the other side 
	of the fence.  As the prisoners begin to break rank --

				  GUARD
		Prisoners from barracks H remain in 
		line.  Barracks H will remain in 
		line.

	The prisoners turn and look in direction of the Guard as 
	they straighten their lines.  The guard paces slowly along 
	the line inspecting it silently.  On the fringes of the scene, 
	we can see prisoners from other barracks gathering to see 
	what their fellow convicts are in for.

	MED. CLOSE SHOT - GUARD

	Finally he stops and contemplates his shabby charges with 
	disgust.

				  GUARD
		I said last night I didn't think I 
		would enjoy being called up to account 
		for the noise coming from barracks 
		H.  I can tell you this morning I 
		didn't enjoy it.

	He walks down the line, looking at each man.

				  GUARD
		I don't know what caused the trouble 
		last night, but I'm not blaming you 
		entirely.
			(fatherly)
		I failed you.  I should have seen 
		that you all have much too much energy 
		for the confined life you lead here.
			(he smiles benevolently)

				  GUARD
		We're going to correct that.  I've 
		been told that energy comes from 
		food.

	MED. SHOT - PRISONERS

	Their faces reflect that they know what is coming.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	SHOOTING PAST the line of prisoners in f.g. to the Guard, 
	who has paused to let his words sink in.

				  GUARD
		So... to help you... all rations are 
		canceled for the next... forty-eight 
		hours.

	A hushed ripple of ad lib grumbling and growling rolls along 
	the line of prisoners.

				  GUARD
		And, if that doesn't quiet you down, 
		I'll think of some other ideas you'll 
		like even less. I'm going to make 
		this barracks the quietest in the 
		camp.
			(roaring)
		Is that clear?

	The prisoners are silent but their faces register their 
	resentment.

				  GUARD
		Now, don't blame me.
			(with sly meaning)
		I didn't start the trouble last night.

	The truth of what he has said is reflected in the faces of 
	the men.

				  GUARD
		Fall out.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING HELMUT, KELTNER

	As they stand with the other prisoners, watching the guard 
	move off.  Keltner looks worried, the others are angry, Helmut 
	seems undecided as his eyes follow the guard.

				  HERMAN
		Bastard!

				  STOUT PRISONER
		I can't go without food. I'll starve.

	Suddenly Helmut makes up his mind and starts off after the 
	Guard.  Keltner, sensing the mood of the men, puts a 
	restraining hand on his arm, whispers to him hoarsely.

				  KELTNER
		Helmut, don't.

	But Helmut shakes him off and hurries away.

	The other prisoners notice where he is headed and exchange 
	looks.  Keltner shakes his head.  Galt's eyes narrow as he 
	watches Helmut run off after the guard.

				  GALT
			(loudly)
		He's the one we can thank for the 
		diet.

	MED. SHOT - GUARD - MOVING

	The CAMERA MOVES BACKWARD as the Guard strides toward it, 
	his face sour.  Behind him we can see Helmut running to catch 
	up to him.  When he is close enough...

				  HELMUT
		Sir?  Corporal...

	The guard stops and turns so abruptly that Helmut almost 
	runs into him.

				  GUARD
		What?

				  HELMUT
			(obsequiously)
		Doork.  Helmut Doork.  Remember?  
		The papers... You said... Remember 
		the special forms for the Gestapo to 
		review my case.

				  GUARD
		No papers.

	He stalks off.  Helmut starts to say something more but thinks 
	better of it.  Crushed, he starts back towards his barracks, 
	head down.  He walks sadly for several steps, then looks up 
	and stops, his expression changing to one of uneasiness.

	MED. SHOT - PRISONERS - HELMUT'S POV

	A dozen of Helmut's barracks-mates, including Galt, Uhlmann, 
	Adolf, Ludwig, Herman, the Stout Prisoner, several of the 
	New Prisoners, are drifting across the yard towards him, and 
	the looks on many faces bode no good for Helmut.

	FULL SHOT - HELMUT, PRISONERS

	The men converge and form a half circle around him.

	As the men close in on him, he moves back until we cna see 
	the barbed wire fence behind him.  Helmut senses their 
	disposition and remains warily silent.  Keltner and Franz 
	stand slightly behind the pack.

				  GALT
		What'd you say now, Mr. Doork, 
		Almighty!
			(to men)
		Last night he wouldn't give us a 
		laugh.  Today they won't give us 
		food.

				  LUDWIG
			(venomously)
		What were you doing?  Making a deal 
		with your guard pal to slip you some 
		food?

				  HELMUT
			(indignantly)
		No!  I was asking him about the forms 
		he'd promised to get me.
			(admonishing)
		Because of last night... I'm not 
		getting them.

	Keltner, seeing how disappointed Helmut is, moves up through 
	the group.

				  KELTNER
			(encouragingly)
		When this blows over, Helmut, we'll...

				  LUDWIG
			(interrupting)
		Don't feel sorry for him.  He's got 
		no one to blame but himself.  The 
		whole thing was his doing.

				  ADOLF
		He's been telling us how great he 
		is; how funny.  Why?  Why couldn't 
		he have done a trick or two for us?

				  UHLMANN
		The Reverend did a turn.  What's so 
		special about him?

	The men voice agreement... Helmut should have performed.  
	Helmut starts to go around one end of the semi-circle but 
	the men bar his way.

				  KELTNER
		Don't start anything here.  We're in 
		enough trouble.

	The other prisoners in the b.g., those who have remained in 
	the yard to see what was going to happen to the men of 
	barracks H, sense trouble, the kind they want no part of, 
	and begin scurrying back to their own barracks.

				  UHLMANN
		We're not starting anything, we're 
		finishing something.

				  GALT
		We've decided Doork here is going to 
		keep us laughing so hard we won't be 
		able to hear our stomachs growling.

				  STOUT PRISONER
		Better hurry it up, clown.  'Cause 
		my stomach's growling already. Can 
		you hear it?

				  HERMAN
		Hear it!  The whole place hears it.

	The men take a few steps toward Helmut as they call for him 
	to perform.

				  MEN
		Yeah, Doork, do a trick. How about 
		that night in Munich when they 
		wouldn't stop laughing.  How about 
		it, Doork? Come on, just a little 
		trick.  Give us one laugh.  That's 
		all we're asking for.  Come on, 
		Helmut, do something.

	Helmut, hoping to stall the inevitable, still hoping to 
	preserve for a while longer his beautiful myth of being a 
	great clown, holds up his hands for the men to be quiet.  
	Franz interpreting the gesture as giving in to the demands 
	of the men...

				  FRANZ
			(excitedly)
		He's going to do it!  He's going to 
		do it!

	The men quiet down and move back a few steps to give Helmut 
	room.

				  HELMUT
			(grandly)
		Nothing pleases an artist more than 
		to perform.  I'm going to do a real 
		show for you.  All I ask is that you 
		give me a little time...  time to 
		get things together...  things I can 
		use as props...  I'll even try to 
		make a costume, and...

				  ADOLF
		You don't need a costume.  We've got 
		imagination.

				  (TO MEN)
		Right?

	Murmurs of agreement.

				  HERMAN
		Do the drunk pretzel like the kid 
		suggested last night.

				  GALT
			(commanding)
		And do it now, clown.  No more 
		stalling.

	Helmut, still trying to hold on to his dream of greatness, 
	draws himself up proudly and begins to move forward.

				  HELMUT
		Let me through.

				  ADOLF
		Aren't we good enough for you?

				  LUDWIG
		He'd do his tricks fast enough if 
		his guard pal asked him.  Wouldn't 
		you, Doork?

	As the mention of the word "guard" the mood of the men turns 
	ugly.

	MED. SHOT - PRISONERS - HELMUT'S POV

	Their faces show their determination that Helmut will perform 
	or... else.

				  KELTNER
		Do something, Karl.  For God's sake, 
		do something.

				  GALT
		And be sure it's funny.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT, GALT

	Helmut is frightened.  He strains to look beyond the men for 
	help.  He opens his mouth to scream for the Guard, but Galt 
	puts his hand over Helmut's mouth.

				  GALT
			(his face pressed 
			close to Helmut's)
		You make us scream... scream with 
		laughter...  or I'll tear you to 
		shreds on the wire.

	Galt presses Helmut right up to the barbed wire fence so he 
	can feel the barbs in his back.

	FULL SHOT - HELMUT, MEN

	Galt takes his hand away from Helmut's mouth.  Helmut doesn't 
	utter a sound.  He knows that Galt and the men mean business 
	and he now must do something.  He nods his head.

				  HELMUT
		All right... all right.

	The men move back to give him room.  Frantically, he tries 
	to think of something to do... he knows it must be great... 
	or else his myth will explode.  He walks around in a little 
	circle, trying, trying to think of something.  Finally he 
	faces them.  He bows his legs and pretends he's a bow-legged 
	man trying to walk a high wire, but he's so frightened the 
	result is pathetic, not funny.

	PAN SHOT - PRISONERS

	The camera works across their faces, which are expressionless.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT

	Seeing that he is getting no reaction from his "audience", 
	Helmut tries something else.

	He pulls his shirt over his head and walks around like a 
	headless man.  He pretends to trip over some unseen object, 
	peers through the front of his shirt at it, and stamps on 
	the object.  Again he tries to walk over it, and again he 
	slips.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT, MEN

	as Helmut starts to repeat the same routine, many of the men 
	are openly contemptuous.  Galt wears a smirk.  Keltner, unable 
	to watch Helmut's degradation, moves away.  Others express 
	their disappointment, their disdain.

				  MEN
		If he's Germany's greatest clown, 
		God help the Fatherland.  Doork, the 
		Great!  You got paid for that?  To 
		go without food is bad enough, but 
		to have to watch that!

				  2ND NEW PRISONER
			(accusingly)
		You're not the clown I saw.  You 
		lied.  You're big all right.  A big 
		liar.

				  4TH NEW PRISONER
			(contemptuously)
		And I was going to tell my kids!

				  UHLMANN
		He's no clown.  Not even a bad one.

				  HELMUT
		I am.  I am a clown!

	They move away from him.

				  HELMUT
			(continuing)
		Give me a chance.  I just got started.

	But the men continue to walk away.  Helmut tries to do a 
	hand stand, but his hands slip in the mud, and he lands 
	ignominously on all fours.  When he looks up, only Adolf, 
	Galt and Uhlmann remain.

				  ADOLF
			(sadly)
		That's what we've been eating our 
		hearts out to see!
			(a beat)
		You stink.  You really stink.

				  HELMUT
		I... I slipped.   I can do it.

	Seeing the disbelief on their faces, Helmut becomes almost 
	hysterical.  He is still on his knees.

				  HELMUT
		I am a clown.   I am.  I am.

	He pounds on the ground in frustration.  Galt spits 
	contemptuously, and the three start to leave.  Galt turns 
	back, looks down at Helmut.  Very deliberately, he comes 
	forward to stand at a mud puddle.

				  GALT
		Doork the Great.

	With that he kicks a shower of mud directly into Helmut's 
	face.

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	The mud splatters over his face.  He cries out.  His hands 
	go to his eyes instinctively.  he kneels there, rocking back 
	and forth in misery.  Then from o.s., we HEAR a tiny, 
	tentative laugh -- the tiniest laugh ever heard.  Helmut 
	looks up quickly.  He isn't sure that he heard it.

	Then it comes again, a little stronger.  He looks around 
	quickly to see who has come back to taunt him, to ridicule 
	him.

	LONG SHOT - PRISON YARD - HELMUT'S POV

	The yard is empty except for a few prisoners from other 
	barracks way off on the other side.

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	He is puzzled.  Then again he hears the laugh o.s.  He turns 
	slowly to look behind him.

	MED. SHOT - BOY - HELMUT'S POV

	On the other side of the fence stands a wide-eyed boy of 
	about eight, who is watching Helmut timidly.  The ragged 
	youngster laughs again, hesitantly, as if unsure what Helmut 
	is doing is supposed to be funny, but finding it so 
	nevertheless.

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	He looks uncertainly at the youngster.  Is the child 
	ridiculing him, too?  He leans over the mud puddle and looks 
	at his reflection.  He likes what he sees.  The mud on his 
	face looks almost like a primitive clown mask.  Very 
	deliberately Helmut scoops up more mud and puts a blob of it 
	on the end of his nose.  He waits for the child's reaction.

	CLOSE SHOT - BOY

	His eyes are laughing, but his little lips are pressed tight 
	together.  He has been taught not to make sounds... not even 
	sounds of laughter.  But finally what he is looking at becomes 
	too much for him and the laughter spills out between his 
	lips as they form a smile.  He laughs delightedly now, 
	satisfied that Helmut is being purposely amusing.

	TWO SHOT - HELMUT, BOY

	Helmut gets to his feet, bows slightly and stiffly to the 
	child, and then attempts another hand stand.  This time he 
	holds himself up for a moment and then deliberately allows 
	himself to fall on his back in the mud.

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	As he lands, he quickly glances off towards his barracks, 
	but from the look of disappointment on his face, we know 
	that none of his barracks mates are watching.  When he hears 
	more laughter from o.s., he quickly rolls on his side to 
	look.

	MED. SHOT - CHILDREN - HELMUT'S POV

	Two more youngsters have joined the first, and all are 
	laughing excitedly.  The first child jumps up and down, 
	clapping his hands.

	WIDER ANGLE - FROM THE FENCE - FAVORING HELMUT

	Helmut gets up and bows, more deeply this time, a tribute to 
	the children's vindication for his claim that he is a clown.  
	He turns toward the direction of his barracks.

				  HELMUT
			(screaming at top of 
			voice)
		Come back, damn you, come back.  The 
		children... they're laughing.  They're 
		laughing.  I am a clown.  I am a 
		clown.

	He turns back to the children and again bows.  He quickly 
	leans down, looks at his reflection in the puddle, and scoops 
	up a handful of mud which he plasters on his nose to make a 
	bulbous, artificial proboscis.  He turns back to the children 
	and in pantomime, pretends to see a fly buzzing about and 
	tries to swat it.  The imaginary fly buzzes closer.  The 
	CAMERA MOVES UP to --

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	As the "fly" lands on his nose.  He looks cross-eyed at the 
	mud blob, then swats at it.  The blob falls off.

	MED. SHOT - CHILDREN

	There are now nine or ten youngsters at the fence, all 
	squealing with delight.

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	He bows again, and as his head comes up he looks o.s. toward 
	his barracks, still hoping that someone will be watching his 
	"great" success.  When he turns back to the children, we see 
	that he continues to smile -- while tears course down his 
	cheeks through the mud still caked on them.

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. MESS HALL - DAY

	The last barracks on the open end of the camp on the political 
	prisoners' side.  Outside the building is a low counter 
	arrangement with two prisoners behind it serving mush and 
	black bread to a long line of men, all of whom carry bowls 
	and spoons.

	This time in mid-July, three weeks after the incident at the 
	fence.  The day is bright and hot.  Our ANGLE FAVORS Helmut 
	as he nears the prisoner who is serving up the mush.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT

	As he moves up to be served and holds out his bowl.  The 
	prisoner - messman spoons a blob of mush into it.  Then he 
	looks around quickly and, before Helmut can pull back his 
	bowl, slops another half spoonful into it with a wink at 
	Helmut, who gives him a grateful smile in return.  Helmut 
	moves on to the bread server, who gives him a big grin as he 
	slips two pieces of bread into the bowl on top of the mush.  
	Helmut hurries away, the CAMERA FOLLOWING him.

	He walks strangely, as if having trouble controlling his own 
	feet.  Helmut ducks around the corner of the barracks nearest 
	the mess hall, then peers cautiously back into the main yard.  
	Satisfied that he hasn't been noticed, he quickly puts one 
	piece of bread into his pocket and takes out his spoon.  
	Holding the second piece of bread beneath the bowl, he wolfs 
	down a few mouthfuls of the mush.  Then he smooths out the 
	remainder with the spoon to make the mush appear untouched. 
	 He places the one slice of bread back on top of it, and 
	studies the end result.  Nodding approval, he licks his spoon 
	clean and puts it back in his pocket.  He goes back around 
	the corner of the barracks into the main yard and heads for 
	the next building.

	CLOSE SHOT - BARE FEET

	This pair of massive feet are the property of the Big 
	Prisoner, a massive hulk of a man.

				  OLD PRISONER'S VOICE
		Don't know how you can go without 
		shoes.  Soles of my feet are too 
		sensitive.

	The CAMERA PANS UPWARD to the Big Prisoner and an Old 
	Prisoner, sitting against the side of their hut.  The Old 
	Prisoner, a frail man, with shirt off, is finishing his mush.

				  BIG PRISONER
		It's my stomach that's sensitive.

				  OLD PRISONER
			(looking o.s., smiles)
		Here comes your second helping.

	As Helmut's feet walk into FRAME and stop next to the Big 
	Prisoner, we see the reason for his peculiar walk.  He is 
	wearing a pair of enormous shoes, many sizes too large for 
	him and cut open along the soles from the toes to the insteps 
	so that they flap as he moves along.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as Helmut joins them and holds out his bowl of bread and 
	mush to the Big Prisoner.

				  HELMUT
		Here.

	Still grinning, the Big Prisoner puts his empty bowl on the 
	ground beside him and takes Helmut's bowl.  Holding the bread 
	aside, he digs into the mush.  Helmut watches him eat, his 
	own hunger written all over his face.  After a few bites, 
	this makes the Big Prisoner a little self-concious.

				  BIG PRISONER
		How're the shoes?

				  HELMUT
		Perfect.

	The Big Prisoner nods and goes back to eating, satisfied 
	that he has made a fair bargain and shouldn't be embarrassed 
	about taking Helmut's food.

				  HELMUT
		Don't forget the bowl.

	The Big Prisoner, his mouth full of mush, only nods.  Helmut, 
	tearing his eyes from the food, moves off.  The Big Prisoner 
	watches him go.  Suddenly, he looks down at the departing 
	Helmut's feet, and his face darkens.

				  BIG PRISONER
			(irked)
		Hey, Doork!

	Helmut stops and turns as the Big Prisoner shoves himself 
	away from the hut and goes to him, staring down at the shoes.

				  BIG PRISONER
		My shoes!

	The Big Prisoner reaches out with the large toe of one bare 
	foot and lifts up the flapping toe of one of Helmut's shoes.  
	He lets it drop again.

				  BIG PRISONER
		I said you could use 'em, not ruin 
		'em.

				  HELMUT
		I had to fix them this way...  for 
		the act, you know.  Wait till you 
		see how funny it is.

				  BIG PRISONER
		Yeah.  But will I feel like laughing 
		when it gets cold!

				  HELMUT
		Don't worry.

				  BIG PRISONER
		Worry!  I'm the one who'll get frost 
		bitten toes, not you.

				  HELMUT
		When I return them, they'll be like 
		new.  I promise.

	The Old Prisoner has finished his mush and puts his bowl 
	down on the ground and moves forward to join Helmut and the 
	Big Prisoner.

				  BIG PRISONER
		For what you've done to my shoes I 
		should get more food.

				  OLD PRISONER
		He's got to have something to eat.

	The Big Prisoner looks at him questioningly.

				  OLD PRISONER
			(continuing)
		If he gives you his other meal...  
		he'll starve to death.  Then you 
		won't get anything.

	This reasoning makes sense to the Big Prisoner.

				  BIG PRISONER
			(to Helmut)
		Remember... you fix them before you 
		bring 'em back.

				  HELMUT
		Promise.

	Helmut shakes his head "yes", turns and quickly hustles off 
	in the direction of his own barracks, the CAMERA MOVING with 
	him.  After a few steps.

				  BIG PRISONER'S VOICE
		Doork!

	MED. SHOT - BIG PRISONER - HELMUT'S POV

	The Big Prisoner looks at Helmut, then at the piece of bread 
	Helmut had given him.  His manner is self-conscious.  He 
	tosses the piece of bread to Helmut.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT, BIG PRISONER, OLD PRISONER

	Helmut catches the bread, his smile expressing his thanks.  
	The Old Prisoner puts his arm around the Big Prisoner's 
	shoulder, while the Big Prisoner tries not to show that he 
	is pleased with himself for his "generous" act.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT

	Taking bites of the bread, Helmut, rather jauntily, lopes 
	off toward his own barracks.  As he moves among the other 
	prisoners, the CAMERA MOVING with him, we see many of them 
	point or nod toward Helmut and smile good-naturedly.  Helmut 
	is completely unaware of them, so lost is he in his own 
	thoughts.

	EXT. BARRACKS H - MED. SHOT - KELTNER, FRANZ, HERMAN - DAY

	They sit in the shade beside their barracks.  Herman is using 
	his empty bowl as a fan.  Keltner is just finishing his food.  
	Franz is examining his jacket, his empty bowl beside him on 
	the ground.

				  FRANZ (IRRITATED)
		I mean it this time.

				  KELTNER
		Don't tell us.  Tell him.

	Franz holds up the tattered jacket to show that a button is 
	missing.

				  FRANZ
		What am I supposed to do? Use pins?

				  HERMAN
		Who has a pin?

	Keltner chuckles.

				  FRANZ
		You can laugh.  He isn't always after 
		you for something.

				  KELTNER
		No?

	He fishes in a pocket and pulls out a large piece of chalk, 
	holds it up.

				  FRANZ
		What's that?

				  KELTNER
		Chalk.

				  FRANZ
		What for?

				  KELTNER (SHRUGS)
		Says he can mash it into a powder 
		and put it on his face.

	Herman stops fanning along enough to ask...

				  HERMAN
		Where'd you get it?

				  KELTNER
		From a guard.

	Astonished, Herman and Franz look at him questioningly.

				  KELTNER
			(lowers his voice)
		A very bad Nazi.  Still has a heart.

	Herman and Franz smile.  Then Franz holds up his tattered 
	coat.

				  FRANZ
		I wish he'd have a heart and use 
		someone else's coat. Or better yet -- 
		his own.

				  KELTNER
			(looking o.s. and 
			nodding)
		Ask him.

	WIDER ANGLE - FAVORING HELMUT

	As he comes flapping up, still munching on the piece of bread 
	given to him by the Big Prisoner.  Keltner holds out the 
	chalk to him.

				  KELTNER
		Finally got it.

	Helmut takes it and examines it in a very professional manner.  
	Herman and Franz exchange looks.  Keltner waits for Helmut 
	to speak.

				  KELTNER
			(a little annoyed)
		Isn't that what you wanted?

				  HELMUT
			(holding up the chalk)
		This will do more for the act than 
		anything.  Wait'll you see!

				  KELTNER
			(a sigh of relief)
		For a moment there you had me worried.

				  FRANZ
			(indicating bread 
			Helmut's nibbling on)
		I see you got smart.

				  HELMUT
		His conscience bothered him.

				  KELTNER
		I thought he would kill you when he 
		saw what you had done to his shoes.

				  HELMUT
			(sheepishly)
		So did I.

	The men laugh.

				  FRANZ
		I don't know what I'm laughing at...  
		look at what he's doing to my coat.
			(holds it up)
		Look at it!  Yesterday a button off.

	And you've got it ripped here under the arm.  Besides all 
	that falling down isn't doing it any good.

				  HELMUT
			(firmly)
		I've got to have it.  It is the only 
		one I can get on and still is tight 
		enough to look funny.

				  FRANZ
		At the rate you are tearing it up, 
		it's going to look a lot funnier.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	SHOOTING PAST Helmut and group and in f.g. toward the main 
	yard, where we see Galt and Uhlmann approaching.  During the 
	ensuing dialogue, Galt spots Helmut, nudges Uhlmann and 
	together they come toward him.

				  KELTNER
		Give in, Franz.  You know he's going 
		to talk you out of it again.

				  HELMUT
		I'll be careful.  I swear. Besides, 
		I've got to have it. I explained 
		before...  a clown can't change his 
		costume.  It's his trademark.

				  FRANZ
		I know... I know... but...

	Galt and Uhlmann join the group, looking to start trouble.

				  GALT
			(interrupting)
		Why should he give it to a Jew clown?  
		Right, kid?

				  FRANZ
		That's got nothing to do with it.

				  GALT
		What's the matter with you bastards 
		anyway?  All he ever did for us was 
		cause trouble, but for them...
			(nodding toward the 
			other side)
		... he can't do enough.
			(a beat)
		I say he's one of them.

				  KELTNER
			(coolly)
		If he were, he'd be over there

	Through this Helmut remains silent -- his eyes focused on 
	the coat.

				  GALT
		That's where he belongs.

	Franz and Keltner get to their feet.  Herman remains seated.

				  FRANZ
		What're you so hot about?  It's no 
		skin off your...

				  UHLMANN
			(cutting in)
		We've got a good reason for not liking 
		them.

				  GALT
		If it wasn't for them... we wouldn't 
		be in here.

	This surprises the men.  Herman gets to his feet.

				  HERMAN
		What'd you mean?

				  UHLMANN
		A bunch of them got picked up with 
		papers we'd sold them.   And what'd 
		they do?  Turn us in, they did.  The 
		ungrateful...

				  KELTNER
		So that was it!  Counterfeit papers.  
		I can imagine the prices.

				  GALT
		Supply and demand, Reverend.  Supply 
		and demand.

	Deliberately, Franz hands his coat to Helmut.

				  FRANZ
		Take it, Doork -- anytime you want 
		it.

	Helmut accepts the coat... nodding his head in the gracious 
	manner of a ruler accepting homage from a faithful subject.  
	He turns smartly and slowly struts away with as much dignity 
	as he can muster in his big shoes which flap with every step 
	he takes.  The others stand and stare at Galt and Uhlmann.

				  UHLMANN
		What's so terrible about what we 
		did?  Lot of them got out of the 
		country with our papers.  They were 
		damn good counterfeits.

	Keltner, without a word, turns and goes off after Helmut.

				  GALT
			(calling to Keltner, 
			very proudly)
		And what's more, we never charged 
		for children.  Never.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT, KELTNER

	As Keltner catches up with Helmut.  The CAMERA MOVES BACK as 
	they walk along the side of the barracks toward the door.

				  KELTNER
		I've been meaning to ask you.  Heard 
		anymore about the request for a review 
		of your case?

	Helmut doesn't hear him as he's deep in his own thoughts.

				  HELMUT
		Did you hear the laughs I got 
		yesterday?

	Keltner nods.

				  HELMUT
		Not just from the children... but 
		the adults, too.

	You know where a lot of clowns make a big mistake?  They 
	play just for the children.

	They forget... it's the parents, the adults that buy the 
	tickets.

				  KELTNER
		Never thought of that.

	Helmut stops, faces Keltner, a sly smile on his face.

				  HELMUT
		They said I couldn't come up with 
		anything new.

	Keltner looks puzzled.

				  HELMUT
		At the circus.  Schmidt and the rest.  
		Wait'll they see my act now.  It's 
		funny.  Really funny.
			(a beat)
		Isn't it?

				  KELTNER
		The children certainly enjoy it.

	Helmut begins to move along again with Keltner following.

				  HELMUT
		What I needed was time.  Time to 
		concentrate on new material.  A man's 
		got to have time alone.

				  KELTNER
			(glancing around)
		You call this being alone?

	Helmut takes a few more steps then stops short.

				  HELMUT
		Do you think... maybe... they'd let 
		me go to other camps and entertain?

	Keltner is about to say something... but shrugs his shoulders.  
	He knows there's not much point in trying to make Helmut 
	look at things the way they really are.  Helmut starts to 
	walk again.

				  HELMUT
		I'd have to get to the Commandant.  
		Would need his permission.

	They arrive at the steps to the barracks.  Helmut swings 
	Franz's coat over his shoulder as he starts up the steps.

				  HELMUT
		If you have time later, I'd like you 
		to see something I've been working 
		on.  I hunch down and do a tiny 
		soldier parading.  Think they'll 
		like it?

				  KELTNER
			(pointedly)
		Who?  The adults?

				  HELMUT
			(matter of fact)
		The children, of course.

				  KELTNER
		I thought the smart clown only played 
		to the adults.

	Helmut, caught in a contradiction of his own "theory" of 
	clowning, gives Keltner an annoyed look, then goes into the 
	barracks letting the door slam behind him.

	CLOSE SHOT - KELTNER

	As he stands at the bottom of the steps -- he shakes his 
	head and smiles as he marvels at the change taking place in 
	the pompous Helmut as the little gentle clown within him 
	struggles to emerge.

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. PRISON YARD - PAN SHOT - CHILDREN - DAY

	The CAMERA is PANNING across the faces of about forty children 
	behind the fence as they watch Helmut o.s.  Some of them are 
	laughing; some clapping; some squealing with glee, and a few 
	just watching quietly, but with laughter in their eyes.  
	Behind them, near the barracks on the non-Aryan side, a number 
	of adults also are looking on, but they hang back, fearful 
	that getting too close to the fence might provoke the always 
	anticipated wrath of the guards.

	EXT. PRISON YARD - FULL SHOT - DAY

	We see now that Helmut on his side of the fence is performing 
	for the children on the other side of the menacing barbed 
	wire fence.  Behind him, also at a safe distance because 
	they still aren't certain of the official reaction to all of 
	this, a number of his fellow political prisoners are watching 
	his antics.  But, in spite of his talk about the importance 
	of playing to the adults -- it is the children that Helmut 
	plays to -- and it is for their laughter that he listens.  
	The CAMERA MOVES IN to --

	MED. FULL SHOT - HELMUT

	And we see that he has used the chalk to whiten his face.  
	With charcoal he has blackened his eyebrows, formed a wide 
	black mouth and drawn lines down over his eyelids to his 
	cheekbones, giving him the appearance of a clown at once sad 
	and happy.  At the moment he is coatless, but Franz's coast 
	lies nearby on the ground.  For the stunt he is doing now 
	Helmut carries the remains of an old broom and a piece of 
	cardboard.  He is trying to sweep a small heap of dirt he 
	has gathered onto the cardboard, but each time he tries, the 
	dirt goes over the cardboard and he must sweep it into a 
	pile again.  After a few attempts he feigns exasperation and 
	ponders the problem.  Inspiration comes.  He sweeps the dirt 
	into a pile again, bends over and very carefully sweeps it 
	into the front of one of his shoes, holding up the split top 
	to let it in.  This accomplished, he is very proud of himself, 
	but when he tries to take a step, some of the dirt comes 
	out.  Frustrated, he ponders again, and again has an 
	inspiration.  He removes the shoe and puts it under his arm.  
	But as he walks away with it, all the dirt slides out through 
	the open toe.  The children roar with delight.

	CLOSE SHOT - LITTLE GIRL

	She is a flaxen-haired youngster of about five who holds a 
	weathered rag doll as she jumps up and down for sheer joy at 
	Helmut's performance.

	CLOSE SHOT - LITTLE BOY

	He is a completely delighted boy of perhaps seven.  Each 
	time Helmut does something he particularly enjoys he hugs 
	himself and spins around.

	CLOSE SHOT - BROTHER AND SISTER

	The girl is no more than four; the boy about eight.  He clings 
	to her hand as they watch Helmut, unsmiling, perhaps not 
	understanding.  The boy looks at his sister, and a tiny smile 
	tugs at her mouth.  The boy smiles back.  The girl giggles.  
	The boy laughs outright.  They have re-discovered happiness.

	They look back at Helmut, both laughing.

	CLOSE SHOT - SISTERS

	The older girl is ten or eleven; her sister five or six, 
	tugs at her arm, and the older girl bends down to her.  The 
	younger girl whispers to her, pointing to Helmut, and the 
	older girl picks her up.  The little one puts her arms tightly 
	around her sister's neck.  Both laugh merrily.

	MED. FULL SHOT - HELMUT

	He is putting on Franz's too-small jacket.  He tries to button 
	it, but it won't go around him.  He sucks in his belly, but 
	then his pants begin to slip, and he grabs at them with an 
	embarrassed look at the laughing children.

	Deciding that the only way to button the coat is to hunch 
	his shoulders, he tries that, but now his shoulders must 
	remain hunched.  He manages to pick up the broom and puts it 
	over his shoulder, playing soldier.  But when he tries to 
	snap to attention, the coat pops open again, bringing another 
	roar of laughter from Helmut's audience.

	Now he marches a few steps toward the CAMERA, stops, snappily 
	puts the rifle down at rest position and salutes -- knocking 
	himself flat.  Another roar of laughter.  As it swells, we --

	PAN SHOT - JEWISH PRISONERS

	The laughter o.s. continues to swell as the CAMERA PANS across 
	the faces of the adult Jewish prisoners huddled near their 
	huts.  They smile, fearfully at first, then break into 
	timorous laughter.

	ARYAN PRISONERS - PAN SHOT

	As the laughter swells even more, the CAMERA MOVES over the 
	faces of the political prisoners on Helmut's side of the 
	camp.  They, too, are laughing -- some tolerantly; some at 
	Helmut rather than with him, but they are laughing.

	As the laughter continues to SWELL, the CAMERA PANS over to 
	yard-guard.  He is trying very hard not to laugh.  The result 
	is a self-conscious giggle.

	As the laughter grows even louder, the CAMERA PANS as though 
	wafted on the waves of laughter, up to a guardtower, and we 
	see two rifle-armed soldiers in the tower watching the 
	performance below them.  They gesture in Helmut's direction 
	and laugh.

	The CAMERA continues to PAN over to the administration 
	building and UP to an open window on the second floor.

								   CUT TO:

	INT. COMMANDANT'S OFFICE - FULL SHOT - DAY

	LT. SCHARFF, handsome, mid-30's, stands with his back to 
	CAMERA at an open window in a small, but luxuriously furnished 
	office.  The window through which he is looking opens onto 
	the prison yard.  An AIDE pokes his head in the doorway.

				  AIDE
			(in a loud whisper)
		He's coming back down the hall.

	Scharff nods, quickly closes the window, gives a look around 
	the room, and follows the Aide out.

								   CUT TO:

	INT. COMMANDANT'S OUTER OFFICE - FULL SHOT

	As Scharff comes through the door from the adjoining room.  
	The Aide is standing in front of a small desk.  Scharff takes 
	his position beside the door into the outer office.  They 
	wait.  After a beat, the room's other door opens and in comes 
	COL. HEINRICH BESTLER, a slightly built, pinch-faced SS 
	officer in his 50's.  Scharff and Aide spring to attention 
	and give him the salute.

				  SCHARFF AND AIDE
		Heil Hitler.

				  BESTLER
		Heil Hitler.
			(striding into his 
			inner office as he 
			passes Scharff)

				  BESTLER
			(continuing)
		Come in.

								   CUT TO:

	INT. COMMANDANT'S OFFICE - FULL SHOT

	Bestler goes directly to the desk and sits down.  Scharff 
	stands at attention just inside the door.

				  BESTLER
		Oh, stand at ease.  And, close the 
		door.

	Scharff closes the door and moves over to stand near the 
	desk.

				  BESTLER
		I don't have to tell you why your 
		Commandant was relieved of his command 
		here. This prison is a disgrace.  
		Disgrace! The latitude allowed by 
		him will not be tolerated by me.  
		Understand?

	Scharff nods his head.  Bestler gets up from the desk and 
	walks around it.

				  BESTLER
		That includes the staff.  I'm going 
		to turn this place into a model 
		prison, a credit to the Reich.   
		Understand?

	Scharff again nods his head.

				  BESTLER
		Speak up.

				  SCHARFF
		Yes, Colonel.

	Bestler returns to his desk, sits, and opens a folder.  He 
	glances up to study Scharff.

				  BESTLER
		This isn't the first prison the SS 
		has had to take over from the 
		military. Military men are too soft 
		to deal with those...
			(he nods toward the 
			window)
		Scharff starts to speak but quickly 
		changes his mind.

				  SCHARFF
		Yes, sir.

				  BESTLER
		You were about to say something?

				  SCHARFF
		Oh... I... was just going to say 
		that I didn't hold with the soft 
		treatment of the prisoners.

				  BESTLER
		Good!
			(taking papers from 
			folder)
		Our first order of business is to 
		prepare...

	He is interrupted by the SOUND of laughter o.s.  He turns 
	slightly and looks curiously at the window, then turns back 
	to read from the papers in the folder.

				  BESTLER
		Our first order of business is to 
		prepare all non-Aryan prisoners for 
		shipment in two weeks.

				  SCHARFF
		Where are they being sent, Colonel?

				  BESTLER
		Work camps.

	Again the SOUND of laughter from o.s. and Bestler looks 
	quickly at the window, irritated.  Scharff, uncertain of his 
	superior's reaction, tries to cover up.

				  SCHARFF
			(speaking a little 
			louder)
		But we have about 40 children, some 
		only babies, with more scheduled to 
		arrive tomorrow or the next day. 
		They're not going to be much use in 
		a work camp.

				  BESTLER
			(his attention diverted 
			back to Scharff)
		I'm aware of that.  This order covers 
		only the adult prisoners over fifteen.  
		We won't have to wet nurse the 
		children for long.  Other plans are 
		being made for...

	Again he is interrupted by the laughter o.s.

				  BESTLER
		What is that?

	Before Scharff can answer, Bestler goes to the window and 
	opens it.

	PRISON YARD - LONG SHOT

	SHOOTING PAST Bestler through the window, we can see Helmut 
	performing for the children.  Bestler watches for a moment.

				  BESTLER
		What is that supposed to be?

	BESTLER, SCHARFF - MED. SHOT

	Scharff goes to the window and looks over Bestler's shoulder.

				  SCHARFF
		That!  Well, you see, sir, one of 
		the prisoners used to be a circus 
		clown.  Sometimes he gives a little... 
		well...  a sort of show -- for the 
		children.

				  BESTLER
			(turning away from 
			window)
		A show!  Is this a prison camp or a 
		traveling circus!
			(he looks out window 
			again)
		Am I correct in assuming that those 
		children are on the non-Aryan side 
		of the camp?

				  SCHARFF
			(almost in whisper)
		Yes, sir.

				  BESTLER
			(leaving window)
		And the... buffoon?  A German?

				  SCHARFF
		Yes, Colonel.

	Bestler sits on the side of the desk and looks at Scharff, 
	who tries very hard not to show how uncomfortable he is.

				  BESTLER
		Am I to believe you aren't aware of 
		the general order absolutely 
		forbidding fraternization?

				  SCHARFF
			(not worried)
		I know about it, sir.

				  BESTLER
		Close the window.

	Scharff carefully closes the window.  Bestler walks around 
	desk to stand leaning against the wall.

				  BESTLER
		Just what do you think fraternization 
		means, Lieutenant Scharff ?

				  SCHARFF
		Communication.   Social contact.  
		Giving aid, talking...
			(shrugs helplessly)

				  BESTLER
		How long has this been going on?

				  SCHARFF
		Just the last two or three weeks.

				  BESTLER
		And the Commandant approved?

				  SCHARFF
		Well, sir, children are very hard to 
		handle.

				  BESTLER
		This clown!  Who is he?

				  SCHARFF
			(trying hard to 
			remember)
		It's... I know.  It's Doork, the 
		Great.

				  BESTLER
		Not his clown name, you idiot.  His 
		number.  His identification.

				  SCHARFF
		If I have the Colonel's permission 
		to leave, I will check it at once.

				  BESTLER
		Later.  Right now I want these 
		performances halted.  Understand?

				  SCHARFF
		Yes, sir.

	Bestler begins shuffling papers from the folder.  Scharff, 
	uncertain whether he has been dismissed or not, hesitates.  
	Bestler glances up.

				  BESTLER
			(shouting)
		Immediately!

				  SCHARFF
		Yes, sir !

	He salutes and bolts from the room, almost crashing into the 
	door in his flight.

								   CUT TO:

	PRISON YARD - FULL SHOT - DAY

	Shooting past the children in f.g. to Helmut through the 
	fence, as he bows to the applauding youngsters.  Behind him 
	we can see a number of soldier-guards coming through the 
	cordon of watching prisoners, and waving them to disperse.  
	They do so reluctantly, as the guard from Helmut's barrack 
	moves forward to Helmut, who is just about to start another 
	routine.

				  GUARD
			(shouting)
		That's all.  Show's over.  Everybody 
		clear out.

	Helmut stops, startled.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT, GUARD

	ANGLED to include children across the fence.

				  HELMUT
		What's wrong?

				  GUARD
			(to Helmut)
		Get back to the barrack.
			(to children)
		You heard me.  Show's over.

	The children don't move, but stand staring at Helmut as if 
	waiting for him to tell them what to do.  This frustrates 
	the guard, who isn't accustomed to being questioned.

				  GUARD
		Go on.  Get away.

	Still the children refuse to budge.  Angry, the guard goes 
	close to the fence, waving his arms at them.

				  GUARD
		Move, damn it, before I come over 
		there and...

	The youngsters scuttle back a few feet fearfully, but there 
	they stop, their eyes still on Helmut.  The guard turns to 
	Helmut.

				  GUARD
		Get them moving before somebody gets 
		hurt.

	Helmut goes up to the fence and speaks to the children softly.

				  HELMUT
		That's all the show for today.  Go 
		back inside.

	The children back away with long faces.  Finally convinced 
	that Helmut is through, they turn and wander back toward 
	their barracks, but with many a backward look at him.  Helmut 
	continues to encourage them, as the guard looks on.

				  HELMUT
		That's right now, go along.  I'll 
		see you tomorrow.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  
		Until tomorrow.

	Many of the children wave to him.  The guard takes Helmut by 
	the arm, turns him toward the barrack and hustles him off.

	MED. TWO SHOT - HELMUT, GUARD

	The CAMERA MOVES BACK as they come toward it, the guard firmly 
	propelling Helmut along.

				  GUARD
		Get inside and take that stuff off 
		your face.

				  HELMUT
		I don't understand.  What's the 
		matter?

				  GUARD
		Orders.  No more shows.

				  HELMUT
		You mean... not ever?

				  GUARD
		That's right.

				  HELMUT
		But we weren't doing any harm.

				  GUARD
		The Commandant thinks you are.

				  HELMUT
		The Commandant?

				  GUARD
		The new Commandant.  He minds.

				  HELMUT
		Just because I make them laugh a 
		little...

				  GUARD
		You know the rule... no mixing with 
		Jews.

				  HELMUT
		I wasn't mixing!  I was only...

	The guard stops him and turns him so that they are face to 
	face.  The CAMERA MOVES UP TO --

	TIGHT TWO SHOT - HELMUT, GUARD

				  GUARD
			(quietly, threatening)
		Look, it's not my order.  It's the 
		Commandant's.
			(more kindly)
		Now do what I tell you and save 
		yourself a lot of grief.

	He pushes Helmut toward his barrack and then turns and walks 
	off, the CAMERA PULLING BACK to --

	WIDER ANGLE

	Helmut watches the guard go, then, dejectedly, shuffles toward 
	his barrack.  As he nears it, Keltner, Franz, Adolf, Herman, 
	Ludwig, and the other regulars intercept him.

	MED. SHOT - GROUP

	They crowd around Helmut, anxious to know what's happened.

				  FRANZ
		What happened?

				  HELMUT
			(still bewildered)
		He says I've got to stop -- with the 
		children.

				  KELTNER
			(nodding)
		I've been expecting it.

				  LUDWIG
		Because they're Jews?

				  KELTNER
		Because of the laughing.

				  HELMUT
		Why should that bother them?

				  KELTNER
		When you rule by fear, laughter is 
		the most frightening sound in the 
		world.

	Silently the men walk up the steps and into the barrack, the 
	CAMERA PANNING with them until we...

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. PRISON YARD - FULL SHOT - DAY

	It is a warm, sunny afternoon and most of the prisoners on 
	both sides of the fence, are out warming their weary bones.  
	On the Aryan side, a number of prisoners, including Ludwig 
	and Herman, are having a makeshift soccer game using a bound 
	bundle of rags for a ball.  They play with fierce rigor for 
	such emaciated men, yelling at each other and kicking up 
	clouds of dust as they try to work off their frustrations.  
	On the non-Aryan side of the fence, the children, now about 
	50 in number, are grouped near the wire barricades staring 
	across it, their faces dour.  It appears they are watching 
	the game.

	MED. LONG SHOT - CHILDREN

	Shooting past the soccer players in f.g. toward the fence.  
	Through the men we can see the children, but the play moves 
	away from them.  They continue to stare straight ahead, 
	obviously watching something else.  Suddenly many of them 
	press close to the fence straining to see.

								   CUT TO:

	EXT. BARRACK "H" - CHILDREN'S POV

	Helmut can be seen standing in the doorway.  After a beat, 
	he quickly retreats back into the barrack.

								   CUT TO:

	INT. BARRACK "H" - DAY

	The CAMERA MOVES BACKWARD down the aisle between the bunks 
	as Helmut walks dejectedly down the aisle, nervously fingering 
	his white ascot.  The barrack is empty except for Keltner, 
	who is arranging the sprouts of his potato plant over a little 
	trellis of sticks.  Helmut turns and walks back up the aisle 
	to stand in front of Keltner.

				  HELMUT
		I can't go out there.  I can't take 
		another day of them staring at me.

				  KELTNER
		They'll get over it.  Disappointment 
		is no stranger to those children.

				  HELMUT
		They look at me as though it was all 
		my fault.  Haven't they been told 
		why I can't...

				  KELTNER
		I'm sure they have.

				  HELMUT
		Then why do they stare?

				  KELTNER
			(holding up the plant)
		It's amazing how a thing like this 
		can feed off itself.  Think how lucky 
		we would be if we could do that.

	Helmut glances disinterestedly at the plant as he reaches up 
	to his bunk and brings down the coat belonging to Franz.  He 
	holds coat up for Keltner to see.

				  HELMUT
		I sewed a button on.  Look all right?

				  KELTNER
			(inspecting coat)
		Fine.

	Helmut gently pats the coat, then folds it and puts it back 
	on his bunk.

				  HELMUT
		I did make them laugh.  Didn't I?

	Keltner nods.

				  HELMUT
			(angrily)
		I wish they'd get them out of here.  
		Prison is no place for little 
		children.

				  KELTNER
		We've been all over that before.  
		You've got to stop thinking about 
		them.

				  HELMUT
			(trying to convince 
			himself)
		You're right!  I've got to think of 
		myself.

	Keltner puts the plant under his bunk and gets up.

				  KELTNER
		It's too hot in here.  I'm going to 
		get some air.

				  HELMUT
		Johann... do you think there's any 
		possible way I could talk to the 
		Commandant.  Maybe I could make him 
		understand...

	The sentence trails off as Helmut realizes how useless his 
	suggestion is.

				  KELTNER
		There's nothing you can do... but 
		forget.

				  HELMUT
		How can I!  They were my own very 
		special audience.  And now they stare 
		at me as if I had betrayed them.

				  KELTNER
		They're children, Helmut.  You can't 
		expect them to understand the madness 
		of adults.

				  HELMUT
			(sudden thought)
		If I could talk to them.  To the 
		children themselves -- that would 
		help, wouldn't it?

	Keltner doesn't answer but he watches Helmut with new 
	interest.

				  HELMUT
		If I explain it to them -- then 
		they'll know I am not mad at them.

				  KELTNER
			(very deliberately)
		You go near that fence once again... 
		and you're taking your life in your 
		own hands.  You know that as well as 
		I do.

				  HELMUT
			(pleading)
		I would just need a minute.  A minute 
		to talk to them.

	Helmut goes to the door and looks out.

								   CUT TO:

	LONG SHOT - CHILDREN AT THE FENCE - HELMUT'S POV

	The children are still pressed against the fence, still trying 
	to get a glimpse of Helmut

								   CUT TO:

	MED. SHOT - BARRACK "H"

	Helmut stands just inside the doorway... looking out.

				  HELMUT
		I wish to God I didn't care.  I wish 
		to God I could forget them.

	Helmut walks back to Keltner.

				  HELMUT
		But I can't.

	Helmut looks at Keltner, his eyes pleading for help.

				  KELTNER
		I'm going to ask you a question, 
		Helmut, and I want you to think 
		carefully before you answer.

	Helmut nods.

				  KELTNER
		The reason you can't get them out of 
		your mind -- is it because you need 
		them -- for you audience?

	Helmut drops his eyes as he attempts to find the right answer.

				  KELTNER
		I want the truth.

				  HELMUT
			(after a moment)
		I know I can't perform for them 
		anymore.  I know that.
			(a beat)
		I really don't know what the reason 
		is.  I think it's got something to 
		do with... well, I don't want those 
		little ones to think I've turned 
		against them, too.  That's why I've 
		got to do something.  Something.

	Keltner studies Helmut for a moment.

				  KELTNER
		You'll be taking a chance.  A great 
		chance.

	Helmut nods that he know this.

				  KELTNER
			(very definite)
		All right!  Come on then.

				  HELMUT
		Where are you going?

				  KELTNER
		You want to talk to the children?  
		Well, I think I can help you.

				  HELMUT
		There's no reason for you to get 
		involved in this.

				  KELTNER
		Reason?  When war is waged against 
		children!  That is reason enough for 
		the whole damn world to get involved.  
		And it will, believe me, it will.

	Keltner puts his arm around Helmut's shoulder.  Helmut grins, 
	a broad grin of thanks.

				  KELTNER
		So, come on, Doork the Great, let's 
		start getting involved.

	They both walk quickly to the door.

								   CUT TO:

	EXT. HELMUT'S BARRACK - DAY

	As Keltner and Helmut come out.  In the b.g. we can see the 
	soccer game still going on, the players shouting excitedly 
	at each other.  Keltner surveys the scene for a moment.

				  KELTNER
		Wait here.

	He moves down the line of barracks toward the mess hall.

	EXT. PRISON YARD - FULL SHOT - DAY

	As Keltner moves among the men lounging around the barracks, 
	talking and watching the soccer game.  Trying to appear as 
	nonchalant as possible, we whispers something to a group of 
	prisoners.  They glance back at Helmut and then nod.  Keltner 
	moves on to another group, taking care to avoid the two yard 
	guards, one of which is the guard in charge of Barrack "H".  
	Again Keltner murmurs something to the other prisoners, and 
	again they look at Helmut and nod assent.  Keltner goes on 
	to another group.  As he does, the men in the first group 
	casually disperse and start across the yard toward the fence, 
	moving around the soccer players.  One of them goes up to 
	Ludwig, who is playing in the match, and whispers something 
	to him.  Ludwig nods, and the other prisoners move away.  
	Ludwig runs off chasing the "ball".

	MED. SHOT - LUDWIG

	as he storms into a clutch of players, including Galt, all 
	kicking at the "ball".

				  LUDWIG
			(low to Galt)
		Kessler is going to talk to the 
		children. Cover him.

				  GALT
			(mean)
		Who says so?

				  LUDWIG
			(evenly)
		The Reverend says cover him... so we 
		cover him.

	The players around Galt give him a meaningful look and he 
	gets their message.

				  GALT
		All right!  I was just asking.

	FULL SHOT

	As Keltner's plot takes shape, we see a dozen or so prisoners 
	wander, apparently aimlessly, across the yard and form a 
	spectator's section for the soccer game with their backs to 
	the fence, thus providing a shield between the children and 
	the guards.  The game picks up tempo, but the play somehow 
	stays in the center of the yard, strengthening the shield.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT

	As he watches the plan in action.  Keltner rejoins him.

				  KELTNER
		You know what to do?

	Helmut nods.

				  KELTNER
		Stay behind the men and keep an eye 
		out for the guards on the other side.

				  HELMUT
		Right.

				  KELTNER
		Make it quick.  You won't have much 
		time.

	Helmut nods again and starts away, but Keltner stops him

				  KELTNER
		And Helmut, keep the children quiet.  
		We don't want trouble.

	Helmut nods and moves off across the yard.  The CAMERA FOLLOWS 
	him as he circles around the soccer players, trying to look 
	as if he is just wandering over to join the other spectators.  
	As he nears the other side, the children spot him and react, 
	pressing closer to the fence and pointing to him.

	MED. LONG SHOT - HELMUT

	Shooting past the children in f.g. toward Helmut as he nears 
	the line of prisoners, who continue to ad lib shouts of 
	derision and encouragement to the soccer players.  The 
	children begin ad libbing cries of greeting to Helmut.  He 
	puts his fingers to his lips to silence them and takes his 
	place in the line with his back to them.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT

	as he stands pretending to watch the soccer game with the 
	others.

				  HELMUT
			(shouting)
		Kick it, Ludwig.  Kick it!

	The prisoner next to him gives him a sidelong glance and 
	nods almost imperceptibly.  Quickly, Helmut ducks behind the 
	line.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT

	Behind the line as he scurries, bending over, to the fence.  
	The children flock to him.  The CAMERA FOLLOWS him to the 
	fence.

				  CHILDREN
		Doork, Doork, Doork is back.  It's 
		Doork.  It's Doork.

	Helmut tries to silence their squeals of delight.  Holding a 
	finger to his lips:

				  HELMUT
		Shhh.  Shhhh.  The guards...

	The children quiet down and press closer to the fence.  Helmut 
	drops to his knees, looking around.

				  CHILDREN
		Do a trick, Doork.  Please, Doork, 
		please, please.

				  HELMUT
		No, no.  I can't.  The guards won't 
		let me.  Not now.  Maybe some other 
		day.

	CLOSE SHOT - LITTLE GIRL

	This is the same flaxen-haired little five-year-old with a 
	doll we saw before.  She regards Helmut solemnly.

				  LITTLE GIRL
		They're bad.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN

	Smiling wryly at the simplicity of this appraisal, Helmut 
	reaches through the fence and pats the head of the girl's 
	doll.

	Eager to touch Helmut, another child take his hand, others 
	grab at his arm.  Still other youngsters, following this 
	lead, try to reach through the fence to touch him.  Obviously 
	enjoying this adulation, Helmut takes as many of the little 
	hands as he can, squeezing them affectionately.  Only one 
	group of eight children hangs back.  They do not seem to 
	understand what this is all about.  Their little faces are 
	fearful, yet they are fascinated by Helmut.  Suddenly one 
	little boy gives a yelp of pain and backs away from the wire, 
	clutching his forearm.

				  HELMUT
		What is it?  What happened?

				  LITTLE GIRL
		He hurt himself.

	Wide-eyed with fright, the little boy takes his hand away 
	from his arm to reveal a nasty looking scratch from one of 
	the barbs on the fence.  Seeing his own injury, the youngster 
	bursts into tears.

				  HELMUT
		Shhh.  Shhh.  Don't cry.  It's going 
		to be all right.
			(to the other children)
		Be careful when you're near this 
		fence.

	He consoles the little boy, who continues to cry and holds 
	up his wounded arm for Helmut to see.  Helmut looks around 
	frantically, as if hoping to find help somewhere.  Then he 
	quickly removes his ascot -- his precious trademark, the 
	symbol of his self-accorded status -- and hands it through 
	the fence.

				  HELMUT
		Here, wrap this around it.  I'll 
		make it all better.

	The little boy goes on crying, but some of the other children 
	take the cravat and fashion it into a crude bandage around 
	the youngster's arm.  It fails to silence the boy's crying, 
	however.

				  HELMUT
			(worried)
		Hush now.  Stop crying.  Please.  
		Look... Look at this.

	He begins shuffling around on his knees, imitating a duck in 
	an effort to appease the crying child.  As he goes, Helmut 
	quacks softly.  The boy stops crying, but his face remains 
	unhappy.  The other children laugh in spite of Helmut's 
	efforts to keep them quiet, all but the group of eight 
	youngsters who only stare at Helmut in awe.  Seeing that he 
	is making progress with the crying child, Helmut next pulls 
	his coat up over his head and, still on his knees, moves 
	around like a headless man, groping ahead with his hands.

	CLOSE SHOT - LITTLE BOY

	His frown gradually dissolves and, in spite of his sniffling, 
	he smiles, timorously at first, then broadly.  Finally, he 
	laughs.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN

	Helmut shrugs his jacket back into place and smiles at the 
	boy.

				  HELMUT
		There, that's better.  No more crying 
		now.

	For the first time he notices the other group of frowning 
	children.  Among the other smiling and laughing youngsters, 
	they seem to stand out.  When Helmut fastens a quizzical 
	look on them, they back away a little, fearfully.

				  HELMUT
		What's the matter with them?

				  LITTLE GIRL
		They're new.  We can't understand 
		them.  All they do is cry.

				  OLDER BOY
		They're all the way from 
		Czechoslovakia.

	The eight just start at him wordlessly, their fear naked in 
	their eyes.

				  HELMUT
			(to the silent ones)
		There's nothing to be afraid of.  
		Everything is all right.

	When there is no reaction from the children, who obviously 
	don't understand him, Helmut looks over his shoulder, 
	wondering if he has time.

	MED. LONG SHOT - PRISONERS - HELMUT'S POV

	The prisoners are still rooting for the soccer players, but 
	as Helmut looks, Adolf, in the middle of the cheering section, 
	turns and sees him.

				  ADOLF
			(a hushed call)
		Hurry up.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN

	Helmut nods to Adolf and then turns back to the youngsters, 
	afraid but still unable to tear himself away.

				  HELMUT
		Here.  Look.  I'll show you... No 
		noise now.

	In pantomime, he pretends to pull a hair from his head and 
	threads it through an imaginary needle.  Finally accomplishing 
	this, he pretends to be sewing a button on his jacket, holding 
	the thumb of his left hand under the button while he sews 
	with his right.  When he has finished, he pantomimes that he 
	has sews his thumb to the jacket.  He pretends to be 
	embarrassed and tries to hide his hand in his trouser pocket, 
	but in order to put his hand in his pocket the jacket goes 
	too.  The children giggle, then roar with laughter at his 
	frantic efforts to detach his thumb from his jacket.

	The silent children press closer to watch Helmut's antics.  
	Some look at each other and smile, then grin.  Suddenly the 
	entire group is laughing.  Helmut holds up his hands for 
	silence, but the grin on his face says he loves it.

				  HELMUT
		No, no, be quiet.  Be quiet.  Shhh.  
		Shhhh.

	The children go on laughing as if this is just part of the 
	game.

	MED. LONG SHOT - TOWER GUARDS

	The SOUND of the children's laughter floats up to two guards 
	in a tower on the non-Aryan side of camp.  One of them, who 
	has been watching the soccer game below, nudges his partner 
	and points down to Helmut.

	LONG SHOT - PRISON YARD - GUARDS' POV

	Between the children at the fence and the line of soccer 
	spectators we can see only the top of Helmut's head bobbing 
	up and down.  But that is enough.

	MED. LONG SHOT - TOWER GUARDS

	After a long look, one of the guards picks up a telephone 
	and starts to make a call.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN

	Helmut seems to have thrown caution away under the stimulus 
	of the children's laughter.  He is on his feet trying a hand 
	spring.  He lands flat on his back, but rolls over on his 
	side and grins broadly at his audience, which laughs 
	appreciatively.  This is the old Doork.  Their Doork.  Again 
	Helmut tries the hand spring and again he flops.

	FULL SHOT - PRISON YARD

	A HIGH ANGLE with Helmut and the children in f.g. and beyond 
	them the Aryan side of the yard.  The soccer game is still 
	in progress, with the spectators on both sides of the action 
	whooping it up.  Then in b.g. we see two soldiers, two SS 
	officers, and the guard in charge of barracks "H", come 
	bursting through the spectators near the huts and into the 
	game itself.  The players slowly subside as they realize 
	what is happening.  They watch the guard cross the yard.  
	The cheering trails off, and the yard becomes strangely quiet, 
	the prisoners' warning to Helmut.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN

	Oblivious to all this in his joy at performing for the 
	children again, Helmut is just pretending to slip on something 
	underfoot.  His arms flay the air as he tries to regain his 
	balance, but he falls.  Through this, however, the children 
	seem to be watching something behind Helmut, and when he 
	lands on the ground, they do not laugh.

	Again their faces are frightened as they look o.s.  Helmut 
	looks at them, puzzled.  Then, realizing that something is 
	wrong, he turns and looks up from the ground.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	SHOOTING PAST Helmut in f.g. toward the guard, SS men, and 
	soldiers, who have come through the line of spectators and 
	stand glowering at him.  The prisoners have moved back, warily 
	watching for the next move.

				  GUARD
		You wouldn't listen, would you?

	Almost wearily, he goes to the fence.  This isn't something 
	he likes, but his authority is at stake here, and he has no 
	choice.  As the CAMERA PANS him to the fence we see that 
	some non-Aryan adults have drifted over to see what the 
	disturbance is.

				  GUARD
			(to the children)
		Go on.  Get back.

	The children don't move.  Their eyes are on Helmut.  The 
	guard shouts over to the adults standing behind the children.

				  GUARD
		You back there, get them out of here.

	The adults begin to gather up the children.

				  HELMUT
		They had nothing to do with it.  It 
		was all my doing.

	The guard turns and comes up to face Helmut.  He studies him 
	for a moment, then hits him a vicious backhand slap across 
	the face.  Taken by surprise, Helmut staggers backward and 
	falls.  A murmur runs through the prisoners.  The children 
	still near the fence, cry out with alarm.  Seeing their 
	terror, Helmut is determined to make it look like just another 
	act.  With a painful effort he gets to his feet, smiles at 
	the children, turns and salutes the guard, knocking himself 
	down again.  A couple of children giggle.  The FIRST SS 
	OFFICER quickly steps forward to stand behind the guard.

	He holds a swagger stick in his right hand, which he 
	repeatedly whacks into the palm of his left hand.  He looks 
	down at Helmut.

				  FIRST SS OFFICER
		Get up.

	Helmut struggles to his feet.  He glances over at the 
	children.  They are all watching him.  He takes a deep breath, 
	winks at the little ones, then salaams before the SS Officer 
	and the guard.  Some of the children giggle.  This infuriates 
	the SS officer.  He raises the swagger stick and brings it 
	down hard on Helmut's head knocking him to his knees.  The 
	children scream with terror.  The SS Officer raises the stick 
	to hit Helmut again, but Keltner, in an almost instinctive 
	reaction, catches hold of his arm.

				  KELTNER
		The children! Not in front of the 
		children!

	TWO SHOT - FIRST SS OFFICER - KELTNER

	The SS Officer turns and brings the stick down on Keltner.  
	He hits him over and over, each blow more vicious.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT - FRIGHTENED CHILDREN IN B.G.

	Helmut turns away from the beating, pulls his jacket up over 
	his head and starts to walk around like a headless man 
	stumbling and falling over his own feet.  The children, many 
	still screaming, turn their eyes away from the SS Officer to 
	watch Helmut's antics.

	FULL SHOT - FRANZ, GALT, UHLMANN, LUDWIG, ADOLF, HERMAN AND 
	OTHER PRISONERS

	The horror-stricken men stand frozen as the SS Officer 
	continues to hit Keltner until he drops to the ground.  
	Suddenly Franz breaks away from the men and charges at the 
	First SS Officer.

	MED. SHOT - SS OFFICER - FRANZ

	Franz runs INTO CAMERA and attempts to stop the First SS 
	Officer.  The Second SS Officer whips his pistol out, aims 
	carefully and FIRES a shot into Franz's head.

	VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE PRISONERS

	Uhlmann stands speechless and dumbfounded.  Galt cowers.  
	Beads of perspiration pour from his brow.  Adolf weeps bitter 
	tears as Herman places his arm around his shoulder to comfort 
	him, and himself as well.  Ludwig, dead to any emotion, simply 
	turns and walks away into the crowd.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT

	Helmut is now, more than ever, the clown, as he goes into a 
	frenzied version of the "Clap Dance".  The complete 
	incongruity of his behavior leaves the spectators stunned.

	WIDER ANGLE - SHOWING THE CHILDREN IN B.G.

	The children are no longer screaming, instead they are 
	watching Helmut as though they are hypnotized.

	FULL SHOT - HELMUT, GUARD, SS MEN, OTHER GUARDS

	The guard, fully aware that the sadist SS men may take action 
	against Helmut, quickly motions for two of the other guards 
	to take Helmut away.  The First SS Officer, still panting 
	with exhaustion, shows his approval of the action taken by 
	the guard.  The two guards seize Helmut by the arms and begin 
	dragging him off toward the administration building.  The 
	prisoners move away before the guards holding Helmut, forming 
	a sort of line of march for them.  As they drag Helmut along, 
	he waves back at the children, makes a funny face and moves 
	his feet in something approaching a dance step.

	INT. SOLITARY CONFINEMENT CELL - NO LIGHT

	SHOOTING FROM THE BACK of the cell toward the door.  The 
	cell is about eight feet long and four feet wide with a steel 
	door at the far end.  The cell is bare.  We HEAR men 
	approaching, and a guard opens the door letting in a shaft 
	of bright light.  Two guards hoist the unconcious Helmut 
	into the cell and drop him onto the floor.

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	He lies in a heap on the floor, his face swollen from a severe 
	beating.

	MED. SHOT - CELL

	The guards walk out, slamming the door shut leaving the cell

	INT. COLONEL BESTLER'S OFFICE - DAY

	Lt. Scharff is by the window, having just rolled up the window 
	shade.  Colonel Bestler is on the phone and obviously 
	exasperated by what he is hearing.

	MED. SHOT - BESTLER, SCHARFF

				  BESTLER
			(on phone)
		Yes.
			(pause)
		Yes.  Yes, I understand perfectly.  
		However, I don't see how we can be 
		held responsible.
			(pause)
		Our orders were very clear.  We were 
		to have the freight car ready to be 
		picked up at midnight.
			(pause)
		Of course, I'm aware the operation 
		must be kept secret.
			(pause)
		I just don't have the staff to send 
		down there now and... Yes, I'll wait.

	He puts hand over mouthpiece to talk to Scharff.

				  BESTLER
		The freight car wasn't picked up.

				  SCHARFF
		It's still down there on the siding!

				  BESTLER
		Some stupid mix up.  If they think...

	The SOUND of the voice coming over the phone causes him to 
	literally snap to attention.

				  BESTLER
		Yes, General.
			(pause)
		Yes, I'm as distressed about the 
		situation as you are.
			(long pause during 
			which he nods his 
			head)
		Yes.  Personally!  Immediately!  
		Yes, General.  You can leave it in 
		my hands.
			(pause)
		Heil Hitler!

	He puts down the instrument and turns at once to Scharff.

				  BESTLER
		Who did you leave in charge down 
		there?

				  SCHARFF
		Sergeant Hoffman.  Very reliable.

				  BESTLER
		Apparently not reliable enough.  The 
		cargo seems to be raising quite a 
		fuss.

				  SCHARFF
			(explanatory)
		Fifty children, sir!  In a boxcar!

				  BESTLER
		I know.  I know.  But the siding 
		isn't far from town.  The General 
		doesn't want unauthorized persons 
		getting curious.  Understand?

				  SCHARFF
		I'll get some men down there right 
		away.

				  BESTLER
		Men!  You'll get yourself down there.
		And take at least a dozen guards 
		with you.  Don't let anyone get close 
		to that boxcar...  under any 
		circumstances.  No one !

				  SCHARFF
		Yes, sir.

	Scharff turns to leave the office, but after a few steps he 
	stops and turns back toward Bestler, a look of concern on 
	his face.

				  SCHARFF
		Sir?

	Bestler looks up.

				  SCHARFF
		I wondered, sir, if you might have 
		any suggestions as... well...  how 
		do we quiet children?

				  BESTLER
		Use any method you can, but shut 
		them up.  That's an order.

	Scharff is disappointed at not getting some help from Bestler.  
	Suddenly his face brightens.

				  SCHARFF
		Sir, the clown!

	Bestler looks at him quizzically.

				  SCHARFF
		The one who amused the children

				  BESTLER
		Out of the question.  The man's being 
		disciplined for that very thing.  We 
		can't change our position now.

				  SCHARFF
		No one need know.

				  BESTLER
		He'd know.

	Scharff thinks this over.  Suddenly his face brightens.

				  SCHARFF
		Sir, if I could guarantee he'd never 
		say anything.

	Bestler looks interested.

				  SCHARFF
		You see, sir, he's been trying to 
		get a review of his case.  Claims 
		he's here by mistake.  I could tell 
		him you would recommend the review.

				  BESTLER
		A man who wants something.  Good.  
		Very good strategy, Lieutenant.
			(he turns to face 
			Scharff)
		However, when you bring him back 
		here, return him to solitary and 
		keep him there.
			(a beat)
		I've seen the best of men, after 
		several years in solitary, unable to 
		remember even their own names.

				  SCHARFF
		Then I have your permission to take 
		the clown.

				  BESTLER
		Permission granted.

	A small open truck with 12 soldiers in the back, followed by 
	a staff car, move along the road.

	INT. STAFF CAR - MOVING - DAY

	DRIVER is in the front seat, Helmut and Scharff in the back.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT - SCHARFF

	Helmut has been cleaned up, but still shows the effects of 
	the beating and his stay in solitary.  Holding a small mirror, 
	he is applying his makeup.  He occasionally closes or tries 
	to shade his eyes from the light.  They ride on in silence.  
	Scharff stares straight ahead.

				  HELMUT
		Wish you could've gotten the big 
		shoes.  The children laugh so when 
		they see them flopping up and down.

	Scharff makes no reply.  Helmut starts to put on his big 
	black mouth.

				  HELMUT
			(a touch of the old 
			arrogance)
		The Commandant, himself, asked for 
		me!
			(a beat)
		You say he's personally requesting a 
		review of my case!  Why, that means 
		I'm practically on my way back to 
		Berlin.
			(studies mouth in 
			mirror)
		Should be red.  Mouth looks better 
		in red.
			(a beat)
		Know the first thing I'm going to do 
		when I get to Berlin?  Buy an overcoat 
		with a fur collar.  Had such a coat.  
		Very elegant. Very elegant.
			(finishing the up-
			turned corners of 
			mouth)
		It's a good idea... moving the 
		children.

	Scharff reacts to this.  He looks sharply at Helmut.

				  HELMUT
		Prison's no place for children. I 
		said all along that it was some kind 
		of mistake.

				  SCHARFF
			(uncomfortable)
		Finish your makeup.  We're almost 
		there.

				  HELMUT
		Know what Johann Keltner said?

				  SCHARFF
		Who?

				  HELMUT
		Keltner.  From my barracks.  The 
		minister. He said... Let me think.
		He said... men who wage war on 
		children. That's it. Men who wage 
		war on children... commit such a 
		crime...
			(a beat as he thinks)
		... such a heinous crime.  That's 
		it.  Men who wage war on children 
		commit such a heinous crime that 
		even the devil damns their souls.

	Scharff looks as though he'd just been slapped across the 
	face.  He quickly turns toward the window.  Helmut inspects 
	his reflection in the mirror as he draws black vertical lines 
	down over each eye -- giving him a very lost, sad, dejected 
	look.

	EXT, RAILROAD SIDING - LONG SHOT - DAY

	as the truck and staff car leave the highway and jolt down a 
	short roadway to a railroad siding where a boxcar sits on 
	the tracks.  Uniformed GUARDS stand watch on both sides of 
	the car, which has the door nearest the CAMERA, partially 
	open.  The truck and staff car pull up to the nearest boxcar.  
	The soldiers jump from the rear of the truck, one of them 
	carrying a large burlap sack.

	MED. SHOT

	as Scharff gets out of the car, from the boxcar comes the 
	SOUND of children crying.

				  SCHARFF
			(to Helmut in car)
		Wait here.

	Scharff strides purposefully over to Sergeant Hoffman, the 
	guard beside the open door.  Hoffman salutes Scharff.

				  SCHARFF
		Any word about the train yet?

				  HOFFMAN
		No, sir.  The last we heard -- it 
		won't get here until evening.

				  SCHARFF
		Anyone been around?

				  HOFFMAN
		No, sir.

				  SCHARFF
		With all that wailing, it's a wonder.  
		Couldn't you keep them quiet?

				  HOFFMAN
		I didn't know what to do, Lieutenant.  
		I was afraid to close both doors.

				  SCHARFF
			(to other soldiers)
		Keep a tight guard on the whole area.  
		No one gets near here.  Understand?
			(to Hoffman)
		You post them.

				  HOFFMAN
			(saluting)
		Yes, sir.

	Hoffman moves over to soldiers and begins giving them their 
	orders.

				  SCHARFF
			(to soldier holding 
			the sack)
		Leave that here.

	The soldier puts down the sack, and hurries off after the 
	others with Hoffman leading the way.  Scharff turns toward 
	the staff car.

				  SCHARFF
			(calling to Helmut)
		Over here, Clown.

	Helmut quickly gets out of the car and moves over to Scharff.  
	He looks toward the partially open door.

				  HELMUT
		They're crying.

				  SCHARFF
			(indicating the sack)
		Take that in to them.

	Helmut picks up the sack and peers into it.

				  HELMUT
		What is it?

				  SCHARFF
		Bread.  They won't wait so loud with 
		their mouths full.

				  HELMUT
			(shocked)
		How... how long have they been here?

				  SCHARFF
		You just get in there and keep them 
		quiet.  You can do that, can't you?

	Helmut nods.  Scharff puts his hand on Helmut's shoulder.  
	Helmut stiffens under his touch.

				  SCHARFF
		Do a good job and I'll personally 
		ask that you get a favorable decision 
		on your case.  Understand?

				  HELMUT
		Yes, sir.

	Helmut moves over to the half open door of the boxcar, the 
	CAMERA MOVING with him.  Just before he looks inside, he 
	puts a wide grin on his face.  But when he does peer into 
	the car, his eyes cease to smile.

	INT. BOXCAR - HELMUT'S POV - DAY

	In one end of the car the children are huddled together in 
	one frightened, wailing mass.  They do not even notice Helmut 
	at first, so great is their sorrow.  The little ones cling 
	to the larger youngsters, who, in turn, cling together.  The 
	small ones weep hysterically , as children do when they have 
	been crying for a very long time.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK so 
	that Helmut is in f.g.   He slides the boxcar door open fully, 
	throwing more light on the children.  This brings renewed 
	walls of anguish from the youngsters, who cluster together 
	more fiercely.  But one little boy sneaks a look at the door, 
	expecting to see more guards.  When he sees Helmut, his tear-
	filled eyes widen.  He can scarcely believe what he sees, 
	much less verbalize it.  He tugs frantically at an OLDER 
	GIRL he has been clutching.  She looks first at him, then at 
	Helmut.  She, too, can hardly believe it.

				  OLDER GIRL
			(tentatively)
		Doork?
			(shrill with 
			recognition)
		It's Doork.  It is!  It is!

	The children begin untangling quickly.  Faces appear between 
	legs, around skirts and over shoulders.  For a moment they 
	can only stare at Helmut, speechless with wonder.

				  HELMUT
			(gently)
		So this is where you've been hiding?

	That breaks the silence, and the children begin squealing ad-
	libbed expressions of greeting and relief.  They repeat his 
	name time and again:  "Doork, Doork, Doork."  As one... the 
	youngsters surge toward him.  The little boy who first saw 
	him reaches him first.  He drops to his knees and puts his 
	arms around Helmut's neck, hugging him furiously.  Helmut 
	returns the embrace.

				  BOY
		I want to go home.  Take me home.

				  HELMUT
		Now, now, there's nothing to cry 
		about.  We're going to have fun.
			(disengaging himself 
			and picking up the 
			sack)
		Here.  I brought you something.
			(he tosses it into 
			the car)
		The children pounce on the sack and 
		tug at it, unsure what it is except 
		that it's a gift from Helmut.

				  HELMUT
		Wait now.  Don't open it yet.  Wait'll 
		I get in.  You help me.

	He backs up a few steps, the CAMERA PULLING BACK with him.  
	Then he runs toward the car and, with strength he really 
	doesn't have, jumps up so that he gets his arms on the floor 
	of the boxcar.  He heaves himself forward partially into it, 
	and the children grab his clothes to help him inside.  A 
	couple of the older boys seize the seat of his pants and 
	finally pull him in.

	INT. RAILROAD CAR - DAY

	FAVORING Helmut as he rolls over and jumps up, waggling his 
	head from side to side in the manner of a Jack-in-the-box.  
	The children watch him big-eyed.  A few giggle.

				  HELMUT
		Look, I'm a Jack-in-the-box.

	He gestures around to indicate that he is, indeed, in a box.

				  HELMUT
		We're all Jacks-in-the-box -- the 
		same box.

	The children laugh, and some begin imitating Helmut's head 
	movements.  Others do the same, and still others, including 
	the Czech youngsters, until all are waggling their heads at 
	each other and loving it.  Then, out of sheer adoration, the 
	youngest of the children close in on Helmut and hug him around 
	his legs.  Slowly he stops waggling his head and stretches 
	out his arms to embrace as many of them as he can -- almost 
	as if trying to protect them.  Suddenly the gaiety dissolves, 
	and the children go solemnly silent.  Helmut reacts.

				  HELMUT
		Well... who's hungry.

	Almost in unison, the children shout "I am", again forgetting 
	their unhappiness.

				  HELMUT
		All right, I want everybody to sit 
		down.  When I count three, everybody 
		sit.  Ready?   One, two...

	On the count of two, many of the youngsters sit down.  Helmut 
	feigns surprise.

				  HELMUT
		Oh, you're too fast.  Three!

	This brings a burst of giggles, and the remaining children, 
	sit down... the Czechs following the example of the others.  
	Helmut opens the burlap sack and begins handing out pieces 
	of black bread.  The children grab at the chunks and gnaw it 
	voraciously.  When all of the youngsters have been given the 
	bread, Helmut takes a piece and bites into it with great 
	relish.  After a few chews on the bread:

				  HELMUT
		Now... what'll we do?

	There is a long moment of silence, then the little blonde 
	girl with the rag doll speaks up timidly.

				  LITTLE GIRL
		I want to see my Mommy.

	Helmut is brought up short.  For a beat he searches his brain 
	frantically for an answer.  Then he goes to the child and 
	kneels beside her.

				  HELMUT
		You would?  All right.

				  LITTLE GIRL
		You know where she is?

				  HELMUT
		She's right here with you.

				  LITTLE GIRL
		I don't see her.

				  HELMUT
		That's because you don't know how to 
		look.  I'll show you.  Close your 
		eyes.
			(to the other children)
		All of you... close your eyes.

	The little girl closes her eyes and one by one the other 
	youngsters do also.  The Czech children look at each other, 
	then at the other children, then they too close their eyes.

				  HELMUT
		Everybody's eyes shut?  Now, think 
		about your mommys and Daddys... There, 
		don't you see them?  Can't you see 
		their faces?

	The children, marvelling at this feat, ad lib expressions of 
	assent.

				  HELMUT
		So you see!  They're right here with 
		you.  All you have to do is look in 
		your hearts.

				  LITTLE GIRL
			(putting her hand 
			over her heart)
		Does Mommy see me, Doork?

				  HELMUT
			(deeply touched)
		Yes, she does.  She has you safe in 
		her heart, too.

	The silence in the car tells Helmut that sadness has returned 
	to the children.  He brightens quickly and rises.

				  HELMUT
		I've got an idea.  You all know my 
		name, but I don't know yours.  So 
		let's find out everybody's name, 
		shall we?

	He points to a boy of about ten in the group.

				  HELMUT
		You... come here and I'll show you 
		what we'll do.

	The boy, honored at being singled out, rises and comes to 
	Helmut, who takes a stubby pencil from his pocket.

				  HELMUT
		What's your name?

				  BOY
			(timidly)
		Willie.

				  HELMUT
		Willie.  That's a good name.  How do 
		you spell it?

				  BOY
		W-I-L-L-I-E.

				  HELMUT
		Fine.  I'll just write that on top 
		of your head.

	Using the eraser end of the pencil, Helmut carefully traces 
	the letters on top of the boy's head.  The youngster peers 
	upward, wondering.

				  HELMUT
		There.  See, this way we'll all be 
		able to tell everybody else's name 
		just by looking at his head.

	CLOSE SHOT - BOY

	still looking up, but now doubtful.

				  BOY
		Did you really?

	MED. SHOT - THE GROUP

				  HELMUT
		Of course I did.  Here...

	He pulls an older boy to his feet, winks at him and points 
	to the first boy's head.

				  HELMUT
			(to the older boy)
		Tell him what it says.

				  OLDER BOY
			(giggling)
		It says Willie.

				  BOY
			(impressed)
		Really?  Truly?

	He puts his hand to his head.

				  HELMUT
		Be careful.  Don't smear it.
			(he glances around)
		Let's see now... Yes.  You shall be 
		next.

	He points to a Czech girl of about six.  He motions for her 
	to come over to him.  She shyly bows her head.  Her friends 
	push her forward. Helmut holds out his hand to her, she grabs 
	it.

				  HELMUT
		What is your name?

	She looks at him, then at the other Czech children.  They 
	all giggle.

				  HELMUT
			(squatting down beside 
			her)
		Forgive me.  I don't speak your 
		language.

	He gently plants a kiss on her cheek and she puts an arm 
	around his neck.

				  HELMUT
			(to others)
		See!  We understand each other.  
		Now...
			(he points to Willie)
		Willie.
			(he points to himself)
		Doork.
			(points again to Willie)
		Willie.
			(pointing to himself)
		Doork.

	The child's eyes light up and she whispers into Helmut's 
	ear.

				  HELMUT
		A beautiful name!  Now you tell all 
		the children.

				  CZECH GIRL
			(almost a whisper)
		Inga.

				  HELMUT
		It's such a pretty name... say it 
		again.

				  CZECH GIRL
			(more sure of herself)
		Inga!

	She quickly bows her head for Helmut to outline her name on 
	the top of it.

				  HELMUT
			(with a flourish of 
			his pencil)
		I-N-G-A.  There it is.

	The little girl gives a quick curtsy and hurries back to her 
	group.  Helmut glances around at the children.

				  HELMUT
		Let's see now.  Who wants to be next.

	The little girl with the doll presses forward.

				  HELMUT
		You?

	Shaking her head she holds up the doll.

				  HELMUT
		Her?

				  LITTLE GIRL
		So the little children will know her 
		name.

				  HELMUT
		Of course.  That way she can't get 
		lost, can she?  What's her name?

				  LITTLE GIRL
		Frederika.

				  HELMUT
			(mock dismay)
		Frederika?

	He studies the top of doll's tiny head.  Then he holds up 
	his hand and measures off a distance of about three inches 
	in the air with thumb and forefinger.

				  HELMUT
		Frederika!

	Next he puts the doll's head between his thumb and forefinger, 
	illustrating that the head is too small for the name.

				  HELMUT
		Couldn't we just make it Freda?

				  LITTLE GIRL
			(solemnly)
		Oh, no!  Frederika.

	Helmut shrugs, closes one eye and begins writing in tiny 
	letters on the doll's head.  The children laugh delightedly.

	EXT. RAILROAD SIDING - FULL SHOT - DAY

	Sergeant Hoffmann is walking his post beside the open door 
	of the boxcar.  Inside we can see Helmut and the children 
	and HEAR their laughter.

	The CAMERA PANS over to the staff car, where Scharff sits in 
	the front seat smoking a cigarette and waiting.

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. RAILROAD SIDING - FULL SHOT - AFTERNOON

	It is perhaps two hours later.   Sergeant Hoffman is now 
	leaning wearily against the boxcar near the door.  The CAMERA 
	PANS over to the staff car, where Scharff is dozing in the 
	back seat.

	MED. SHOT - SERGEANT HOFFMAN

	From within the boxcar we can HEAR Helmut SINGING softly to 
	the children.  Sergeant Hoffman is listening.  Finally he 
	takes something from his pocket, goes to the door of the 
	boxcar and sticks his head inside.

	INT BOXCAR

	The children are scattered about, either sleeping or near 
	sleep, many of them cuddled close to Helmut, who sits near 
	the door with his back against the side of the car, crooning.

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
			(whispering)
		Clown.  Clown, can you play one of 
		these?

	He holds out a harmonica.  Helmut leans over to get it, being 
	careful not to disturb the children.

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
		I got it to send home to my boy...  
		but if it'll help...

	TWO SHOT - HELMUT, HOFFMAN

				  HELMUT
		It will.  It will.
			(he takes it)

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
		You won't say anything to the 
		Lieutenant.

				  HELMUT
		I promise.

	He leans back and looks at the harmonica, then he has a sudden 
	thought as Hoffman's head disappears.  He leans back toward 
	the door.

				  HELMUT
		Guard... guard.

	Hoffman reappears at door.

				  HELMUT
		It's going to be dark soon.  The 
		little ones may be afraid.  Do you 
		think... well... could you get some 
		kind of a light for in here?

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
			(angry)
		Want to get me in trouble?

	Helmut nods that he understands Hoffman's situation.

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
			(trying to justify 
			himself)
		I would if I could.

				  HELMUT
		I know.  I know you would.

	Again Hoffman's face disappears.  Helmut leans back and begins 
	experimenting with the harmonica.  Actually he can play it 
	only slightly, but he manages to get some sort of soft tune 
	out of it.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY to include the 
	children, most of who are resting peacefully, secure in 
	Helmut's presence.  But suddenly a little dark haired, dark-
	eyed girl of about six, sits upright and cries out, frightened 
	by a bad dream.  Helmut reacts.  The child looks around the 
	boxcar as if she can't remember how she got there and begins 
	crying inconsolably.  Some of the other children stir.  Helmut 
	quickly but carefully disengages himself from the tots around 
	him and picks his way over to the girl.  He kneels beside 
	her, and the CAMERA MOVES UP to --

	TIGHT TWO SHOT - HELMUT, DARK-EYED GIRL

	The child continues crying, but more softly, he wide wet 
	eyes on Helmut.

				  HELMUT
			(gently)
		What's the matter?
			(she only stares at 
			him)
		It's all right -- just a bad dream.

	He tries to put a comforting arm around her, but she shrinks 
	away continuing to sob softly.  Realizing that words won't 
	help, he turns to the harmonica for communication, serenading 
	her with a soft but sprightly tune of his own improvisation.  
	It is hardly a masterpiece, but it has the desired effect.  
	The girl stops sobbing, and when Helmut finishes the tune he 
	makes a real funny face and she timorously puts a hand up to 
	touch his make-up, but pulls it back quickly.  With an 
	affectionate smile, Helmut takes her hand and runs it over 
	his face, pretending that her touch tickles him.  As he 
	laughs, the child begins to smile faintly.  He shows her the 
	traces of chalk make-up on her fingers, and she giggles.  
	His conquest is all but complete.  He picks the youngster 
	up, and holding her like a dancing partner, pretends to dance 
	with her to a little tune he hums.  She loves this and laughs 
	outright.  When Helmut finally puts her down, he kisses her 
	on the cheek and turns his cheek in an unspoken request for 
	a return kiss.  The girl shyly and quickly gives Helmut's 
	cheek a peck.  Grinning, Helmut pats the spot where she kissed 
	him to show his appreciation for her wonderful gift.

	WIDER ANGLE

	The older girl we saw earlier calls to him in a hushed voice.

				  OLDER GIRL
		Doork.

	Helmut moves over and squats down beside her and the CAMERA 
	MOVES IN to --

	CLOSE TWO SHOT - HELMUT, OLDER GIRL

				  OLDER GIRL
		Where are they sending us?

				  HELMUT
			(shaking his head)
		Don't know.

				  OLDER GIRL
		Do you have children?

	Helmut looks around at the children.  He smiles sadly.

				  HELMUT
		I do now.

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. STAFF CAR - NEAR DUSK

	Scharff, dozing in the back seat, is awakened by the SOUND 
	of an approaching train o.s.  He listens, glances at his 
	watch, shakes his head and gets out of the car.

	EXT. RAILROAD SIDING - NEAR DUSK

	As Scharff strides to the boxcar, where Sergeant Hoffman has 
	also hear the locomotive.  He salutes as Scharff comes up, 
	the CAMERA FOLLOWING him.

				  SCHARFF
		It finally got here.

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
		Yes, sir.

				  SCHARFF
		Help them get the car coupled on.

	We want to move it out of here as fast as possible.  Be sure 
	the doors are locked.  And, get the clown off.

	Hoffman salutes, and Scharff moves off toward the approaching 
	locomotive and freight cars being backed up to the boxcar.

	FULL SHOT - FREIGHT TRAIN - (STOCK)

	It is backing down the siding toward the boxcar.

	MED. SHOT - SERGEANT HOFFMAN

	With a cautious look around, he reaches under the waiting 
	boxcar and brings out a box-type, battery operated lantern.  
	He goes to the boxcar door and peers inside.

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
			(calling)
		All right, clown, time to get off.

	Helmut appears at the door and looks down.

				  HELMUT
		What is it?

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
		Train is here.  They are hooking it 
		up now.
			(he hoists the lantern 
			inside)
		Here.  Tell them not to light it up 
		until the doors are closed.

	Helmut gives him a look of deep gratitude.

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
			(curtly)
		And get off right now.

	Just then the boxcar is jolted as the locomotive makes contact 
	and Hoffman runs off toward the front of the car.

	INT. BOXCAR - EVENING

	The jolt has awakened several of the children, who gather 
	around Helmut in the dimness of the car, frightened and 
	bewildered.

				  CHILDREN
		We're moving.  What's happening?  
		What was the noise?  Doork, where 
		are we going?

				  HELMUT
			(forced gaiety)
		It's nothing.  You're going for a 
		train ride.  What do you think of 
		that?  A real train ride.

				  CHILDREN
			(pressing close -- 
			sensing his anxiety)
		Is it far?  Are you coming, too?  I 
		don't want a train ride.

				  HELMUT
		Oh, it'll be fun.  I would like to 
		come, but I don't think I can.

				  CHILDREN
			(pleading)
		Please come, Doork.  Please.  Please.  
		Please.

				  HELMUT
		I can't.  They want me to stay here.

	There are cries from the children, whose pleading eyes make 
	Helmut terribly uncomfortable.  He backs toward the door.

				  HELMUT
		But... I'll come to see you.  Soon 
		as I can. And, I want you all to 
		promise me to be very good.  No 
		crying.

	The children stare at him silently, their eyes unconsciously 
	accusing.  With him goes all their security.  Helmut knows 
	it, but he has no choice.  When he reaches the door...

				  HELMUT
		If you want me...  remember, just 
		close your eyes.

	CLOSE SHOT - LITTLE GIRL WITH THE DARK EYES

	Wordlessly, she shuts her eyes -- tight.

	PAN SHOT - CHILDREN

	Following the dark-eyed girl's example, the smaller children 
	one by one, close their eyes.

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	Near tears with emotion, he wavers.  Then with great control..

				  HELMUT
			(huskily)
		Goodbye.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT

	He turns and sits down on the floor of the car with his feet 
	hanging outside.  He is just about to jump down when he is 
	stopped by a LOUD WAIL of anguish from one of the children 
	behind him.  He turns and looks back at them.

	MED. SHOT - CHILDREN - HELMUT'S POV

	A BOY of about six, one of the Czech youngsters, is crying 
	with the dejection of a lad who has just lost everything.  
	The other little Czechs and the older girl who first 
	recognized Helmut at the boxcar door are trying unsuccessfully 
	to console him.  Between cooing and patting the boy's 
	shoulder, the girl throws accusing looks at Helmut.

	WIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE HELMUT

	Uncertain what to do, Helmut glances around outside.  
	Satisfied that the train isn't going to move at once, he 
	gets up and goes to the children.

				  HELMUT
		What's this now?  Crying?  After all 
		the fun we've had?

	The boy only looks at Helmut and goes right on crying.  Helmut 
	looks helplessly at the older girl.

				  GIRL
		It's his birthday.  He thought there 
		would be presents.

				  HELMUT
			(to girl)
		He's a Czech.   Do you speak...

				  GIRL
			(annoyed)
		Of course not!

	Helmut is angry with the girl because he really wants to get 
	off the train and yet can't because of the accusing look in 
	her eyes.

				  HELMUT
			(pointedly)
		Then how do you know it's his... 
		birthday?

				  GIRL
			(with typical child 
			logic)
		He told me.

				  HELMUT
		He speaks German?

				  GIRL
		No.

				  HELMUT
		But he told you it's his birthday?

	The girl nods firmly as do the other children.  The boy 
	watches it all, wide-eyed.  Helmut figures to put an end to 
	this.

				  HELMUT
		What date is this?

				  GIRL
			(after thinking it 
			over)
		Why, it's his birthday!

	This is too much for Helmut to fathom.  He turns his head 
	away, trying to think.

				  GIRL
		Don't you believe him?

	Helmut turns back to them, looking first at the girl, then 
	at the boy, his little upturned tear-stained face full of 
	wonder.  Helmut softens, recalling perhaps his own birthday 
	disappointment.

				  HELMUT
		Of course, I do.
			(pats boy's head)
		Tell him I wish him a happy birthday.

				  GIRL
		He knows that.  But... but what're 
		you going to do about a present?

	Helmut fans his clothes, finds the harmonica and produces it 
	with a flourish.

				  HELMUT
		Aha, the very thing.  He can be the 
		clown while I'm gone.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING THE CZECH BOY

	As Helmut bows and holds out the harmonica to him.

				  HELMUT
		Happy birthday.

	The boy looks solemnly at Helmut and the harmonica.  He 
	doesn't quite seem to understand what this is all about, but 
	the harmonica is enticing.  He looks up at his countrymen 
	for encouragement.  They smile at him, and he takes the 
	harmonica, examines it, then blows into it experimentally.  
	When he hears the SOUND that comes out, he brightens.  Then 
	the little girl with the rag doll comes forward and offers 
	it to the boy.  He looks at her strangely, one of the older 
	German boys scoffs.

				  GERMAN BOY
		He's a boy!  Dolls are for girls.

	The little girl is hurt, and looks to Helmut for support.

				  HELMUT
		When you give something you love...  
		it doesn't matter if it's the right 
		thing.

	He takes the doll and puts one of it's hands in the boy's 
	hand, the other in the little girl's.  They stand looking at 
	each other and sharing the doll.  Helmut looks towards the 
	door apprehensively, but there seems to be no action outside -- 
	and there are the eyes of the children on him.

				  HELMUT
		Maybe we have time for a birthday 
		game.  A quick one.  Let me take a 
		look.

	INT. BOXCAR - FULL SHOT

	Helmut goes back to the door.  He glances around outside.  
	There still seems to be time.  He returns to the children.

				  HELMUT
		Everybody line up behind me now, and 
		I'll show you how a train goes.  
		Wait -- the harmonica.

	Helmut looks around for the new owner of the harmonica.  He 
	goes over to him.

				  HELMUT
		May I borrow it back... for just a 
		minute or two?

	The boy studies him dubiously with that "Indian-giver" look 
	in his eyes.

				  HELMUT
		For just a minute -- then I'll give 
		it right back to you.
			(trying a sort of 
			sign language)
		Just for the game.

	Finally the boy hands over the harmonica and manages a smile 
	because he sees all the other children smiling at him.

				  HELMUT
		Good.  Now everybody...  line up 
		behind me.

	The children scramble into line behind him.  Helmut looks 
	back at them.

				  HELMUT
		Grab hold of the one in front of 
		you...  'cause we're going to be a 
		fast express train.

	The children, laughing and giggling, grab hold of one another.

				  HELMUT
			(calling out)
		All aboard.  All aboard.

	He puts the harmonica to his lips and begins huffing and 
	puffing on it, imitating a train.  He begins to shuffle his 
	feet and move slowly down the side of the car... the children 
	holding on for dear life and following him... their eyes 
	shining with expectation as Helmut begins to quicken his 
	pace.

								   CUT TO:

	INT. BOXCAR - NEARLY DARK

	Dim shafts of light from the two small square vent openings 
	near the top on each side, gives the boxcar an eerie look.  
	Helmut stops abruptly as he hears the slamming of the door.  
	The children pile up behind him.

				  HELMUT
		WAIT!

	He moves quickly to the door and tugs at it.  Finding it 
	locked, he pounds on it.

				  HELMUT
		Open the door!  Let me out...  LET 
		ME OUT!

	But the train NOISES drown his voice.  Then the boxcar 
	suddenly lurches and starts to move forward.  Helmut's 
	pounding weakens and stops.  He turns from the door, his 
	face reflecting his fright.  The children, not quite 
	understanding what has happened, gather around him, and pull 
	on him.  He manages to control his fear, and looking at the 
	children, he manages a big smile.

				  HELMUT
		Guess I'm going with you after all.

	He switches on the lantern and holds it high so its rays 
	cover all the children.

				  CHILD
		Let's play some more, Doork?

	Helmut glances down at the tot, started by the suggestion.  
	Then he nods in a stunned sort of way.  He puts the harmonica 
	to his mouth and begins puffing on it.

								   CUT TO:

	EXT. RAILROAD SIDING - EVENING

	Scharff and Sergeant Hoffman stand watching the boxcar move 
	away.

	MED. TWO SHOT - SCHARFF, HOFFMAN

				  SCHARFF
		I'm glad that's over.  Call in the 
		sentries.

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
		Yes, sir.

	He starts to move away.

				  SCHARFF
		Kessler in the car?

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
		Kessler?

				  SCHARFF
		The clown?

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
			(looking around)
		I... I guess he is, sir.

				  SCHARFF
		You GUESS!

	Scharff races to the car with Sergeant Hoffman right behind 
	him. The CAMERA FOLLOWS them.

	Scharff peers inside and finds the car empty.  With an angry 
	glance at Hoffman, he hurries to the truck and looks in the 
	cab.  It too is empty.

				  SCHARFF
			(moving back toward 
			Hoffman)
		I told you to get him off the train.

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
		I told him, sir.  HE was standing 
		right by the door.  I'm sure he got 
		off.

				  SCHARFF
		Did you see him?

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
		Why, I...

				  SCHARFF
		DID you?

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
		You told me to see that the car was 
		coupled on.  When I came back...  
		Why wouldn't he get off?

				  SCHARFF
		Idiot!
			(shouting)
		Guards.  GUARDS!

	The other soldiers come running from o.s.

				  SCHARFF
		The clown prisoner is missing.  He 
		may have escaped.  Search the area.  
		If he got off the train he must be 
		around here someplace.

	The soldiers rush o.s. into the deepening darkness.

	CLOSE TWO SHOT - SCHARFF, HOFFMAN

				  SCHARFF
		You know what happens if he gets 
		away.

				  SERGEANT HOFFMAN
			(hopefully)
		He can't get very far.

	Scharff looks o.s. after the disappearing train.

				  SCHARFF
		If he's on that train -- he's going 
		farther than you know ---

	INT. BOXCAR - MOVING - DAY

	It is the next morning.  Light is coming from the vents and 
	the lantern which hangs from a peg in the middle of the right 
	side of the car.  Helmut is asleep on the floor with the 
	children huddled around him.  He lies on his side with one 
	arm thrown protectively over the little Czech girl, Inga, 
	and Willie.  Behind him, the Czech birthday boy and the girl 
	with the doll are cuddled close to him.  Other youngsters 
	have their heads on his legs and feet, and all are as close 
	to him as they can get.

	He is, in fact, a sort of human bed.  From the train NOISES 
	o.s. we can tell that the freight train is slowing down.  
	Then, with a jolt, it stops, and o.s. we HEAR a truck engine 
	approaching.  Helmut stirs and sits up, trying to get his 
	bearings.  This arouses some of the children and they too 
	sit up and look around.

				  CHILDREN
		What is it?  Are we there, Doork?
		Where are we?  Why are we stopping?

				  HELMUT
		I don't know.

	He untangles himself, rises and stretches his numbed arms 
	and legs.  He starts toward the door, but it slides open 
	suddenly and a BURLY GUARD vaults inside.   Behind him we 
	see a truck similar to a moving van being backed up to the 
	boxcar.  Helmut blinks uncertainly at the light pouring 
	through the door.

				  BURLY GUARD
		Everybody up.  No noise.

	The children are too startled to move.  The guard notices 
	Helmut and reacts.

				  BURLY GUARD
		Who the hell are you?

				  HELMUT
		Where are we?

				  BURLY GUARD
		How the devil did you get in here?

				  HELMUT
		I... I'm from the other prison.  Got 
		locked in -- by accident.

				  BURLY GUARD
		Ah, for...
			(shouting out the 
			door)
		Sergeant!

								   CUT TO:

	EXT BOXCAR - DAY

	We see now that the train has stopped at an isolated siding.  
	The truck has backed up almost to the door of the boxcar.  A 
	SERGEANT climbs down from the cab of the van and hurries to 
	the boxcar door, the CAMERA PANNING him there.

				  SERGEANT
		What's the matter?

				  BURLY GUARD
		Look at this.  He's from the other 
		camp.  Got in here with the shipment.

				  SERGEANT
		How did that happen?

				  HELMUT
		I... I was taking care of the children 
		back there and... accidentally got 
		locked in.

				  SERGEANT
		Of all the... What's your name?

				  HELMUT
			(realizing he's in 
			big trouble)
		Doork.  Helmut Doork.

	The Sergeant fumes for a moment, then...

				  SERGEANT
			(to the guard)
		Put him in the truck with the others.  
		And, let's get going.

								   CUT TO:

	INT. BOXCAR - DAY

	ANGLE to the door as the Sergeant disappears.  Reaching out, 
	the Burly Guard lowers the tailgate of the truck so that it 
	forms a bridge to the boxcar.

				  BURLY GUARD
			(to the children)
		All right, in the truck, quick now!

	The children, most of whom are on their feet now, hesitate, 
	looking to Helmut for guidance.  The guard seizes one 
	youngster and shoves him toward the door.  Instead, however, 
	the child flies to Helmut and grabs him around the legs.

				  BURLY GUARD
		I said move!

				  HELMUT
			(quickly)
		Wait.  Let me.
			(to the children)
		Everybody up.  Come on.  Up, up, up.

	He moves around, helping the still seated children to their 
	feet.  When they're all up...

				  SERGEANT
			(to Helmut)
		Not you.

				  HELMUT
		Don't you want me to stay with them?  
		They'll be frightened without me.

				  BURLY GUARD
		Not for long, they won't.

				  SERGEANT
			(to guard)
		That's enough.  Get them inside and 
		keep them quiet.

	Burly guard starts to prod the children but they don't move, 
	their eyes are fixed on Helmut.

				  BURLY GUARD
			(threateningly)
		MOVE!

				  HELMUT
		Do as he says.  And, don't worry, 
		I'll be with you soon.  I promise.

	Reluctantly, the children march off.  They look back 
	frequently at Helmut who waves to them.

				  SERGEANT
			(to Helmut)
		Come along, now.

	They walk over to a two-story building.  Helmut looks back 
	in the direction of the children, then looks about the camp.

				  HELMUT
		This is just another prison.

				  SERGEANT
		What'd you expect?

				  HELMUT
		I thought the children were going to 
		a better place.

	The Sergeant, with an incredulous look on his face, stares 
	at Helmut.

	INT. CELL - DAY

	The cell is a small, bare cubicle containing only a cot and 
	an open toilet.  In the wall, fronting on the prison yard, 
	there is a small barred window.  Helmut stops pacing and 
	moves over to it, and looks out.  The CAMERA SWINGS so that 
	it is SHOOTING PAST Helmut's head through the window.  At 
	the far end of the yard we can see the windowless stone 
	buildings.  As Helmut stares out at them, we HEAR approaching 
	footsteps. Helmut stiffens, turns toward the door as the 
	SOUND of the footsteps grows louder and louder.

	The CAMERA SWINGS toward the door as it opens to reveal 
	CAPTAIN CURT RUNKEL, a slender, impeccably groomed and 
	thoroughly Nazified officer of the elite S.S.  He is the 
	embodiment of all Hitlerian ideals.  Runkel strides into the 
	cell.

				  RUNKEL
			(over shoulder to 
			guard at door)
		Close the door, and wait out there.

	Guard closes the door.  Runkel studies Helmut coldly.  Without 
	taking his eyes off Helmut, he pulls out a cigarette case, 
	takes out cigarette, lights it and slowly inhales.

				  RUNKEL
		You're a remarkable man.  Very 
		remarkable.

	Helmut stirs uneasily.

				  RUNKEL
		Have you any idea where you are?

	Helmut shakes his head.

				  RUNKEL
		Auschwitz.  This is Auschwitz.
			(a beat)
		Mean anything to you?
			(before Helmut can 
			answer)
		You may have observed we're enlarging 
		our facilities.

	He moves over to the window and looks out, puffing slowly on 
	his cigarette.

				  RUNKEL
		Still a great deal of work to be 
		done.
			(proudly)
		It's going to be our most efficient, 
		most modern prison.
			(he turns and smiles)
		And, I might add, most unique.
			(walks back towards 
			Helmut, studying him 
			carefully)

				  RUNKEL
		Yes, you are a remarkable man.  I 
		always wonder about remarkable men.
			(then evenly)
		Why did you come here?

				  HELMUT
		I explained.  I got locked in the 
		boxcar and...

				  RUNKEL
			(cuts in - still bland)
		Ah, yes.  An accident.  Unavoidable 
		I suppose.

				  HELMUT
		I was taking care -- I mean, the 
		Commandant requested me to take care 
		of the children.

				  RUNKEL
			(a slight note of 
			mockery)
		The Commandant!

	Runkel tosses his cigarette on the floor and very deliberately 
	grinds it out with his boot.

				  RUNKEL
		I've spoken to YOUR Commandant.  He 
		hs you listed as an escaped prisoner.

				  HELMUT
		Escaped!  But...

				  RUNKEL
			(finishing it for him)
		... it was an accident.
			(his face close to 
			Helmut's)
		Are you one of them, clown?

				  HELMUT
			(terrorized at the 
			thought of death)
		No... no!  I'm not one of them.  I'm 
		not !

	Runkel smiles, moves away from Helmut.

				  RUNKEL
		You misunderstand completely.  The 
		Judas goat is never killed.  He isn't 
		worth killing.
			(moves to cell door)
		I'm just asking you to lead them.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING HELMUT

	His eyes plead, "No.  I can't do it.  No."

				  RUNKEL
		Not... even to save your own life?

	For a brief moment, Helmut struggles to find the courage to 
	stand up to Runkel -- but he has no courage and he sinks 
	slowly to his knees, his head bowed.

	CLOSE SHOT - RUNKEL

				  RUNKEL
			(victorious)
		I'm glad to see you're not a self-
		appointed martyr.

	TWO SHOT - HELMUT, RUNKEL

	Runkel towers above Helmut who sits back on his haunches, 
	leaning against the wall.

				  RUNKEL
		Just think!  Now you're really one 
		of us.

	The truth of Runkel's remark hits Helmut like a devastating 
	blow.   He turns his face to the wall in shame.  Runkel walks 
	to the door, raps on it, the guard outside swings it open.

				  HELMUT
			(attempting to get to 
			his feet)
		Sir... Sir... could I... could I 
		have a little time with them before 
		... before...

	His voice trails off.  Runkel looks at Helmut while he thinks 
	it over.  He moves back to the middle of the cell.

				  RUNKEL
		Yes.  Yes, of course.
			(he looks at his watch)
		I can give you about half an hour.
			(a little smile lights 
			his face)
		You see, we're not heartless men 
		here.

	EXT. CHILDRENS' HUT - DAY

	ANGLE to the door as Helmut and the Sergeant approach from 
	o.s.  Helmut has freshened his make-up.

				  SERGEANT
		Remember what I told you.

				  HELMUT
		There won't be any trouble.

	Helmut goes to the door and starts to open it.  The CAMERA 
	MOVES UP to --

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	With a great effort, he composes himself and throws open the 
	door.

								   CUT TO:

	INT. CHILDRENS' HUT - DAY

	ANGLE to the door, where Helmut stands wearing an enormous 
	grin.  The children are about the barren room in little 
	groups.  When they see Helmut, they leap up and run to him, 
	clinging to him as he closes the door behind him and moves 
	into the room.

				  CHILDREN
		Doork, Doork, you came back.  You 
		came back.  We thought you'd left 
		us.  Don't leave us, Doork.

	The children continue to ad lib expressions of mingled fear 
	and delight at his return.  Helmut goes among them, patting 
	their heads comfortingly.

				  HELMUT
		There.  There.  It's all right. It's 
		all right.   Everything is going to 
		be all right.

	When the youngsters are calmed, Helmut holds up his hands 
	for silence.

				  HELMUT
		Now I want everyone to put on a big 
		smile and sit down, because we're 
		going to have more fun than we've 
		ever had.

	Slowly, still unconvinced that they have nothing to fear, 
	the children sit on the floor.

				  HELMUT
		Good.  We'll start by seeing that we 
		all have our names on our heads.

	The children begin to lower their heads so Helmut can check 
	to see if their names are still there.

				  HELMUT
			(as he moves among 
			them)
		Yes, yes.  There's Fritz, Maria, 
		Sadie, Inga, Josef, Nathan, Helga, 
		Willie...

	The little girl with the rag doll holds up the doll for Helmut 
	to see.

				  HELMUT
		Ah, yes, Frederika!  Good.  I see 
		all of your names.

	This is almost too much for Helmut, but he manages to control 
	himself by turning away for a beat.  Then he turns back to 
	the children, his big smile back in place.

				  HELMUT
		Now... on with the show.  Just watch 
		this.

	PAN SHOT - CHILDREN

	Their little faces are troubled, worried.

							   DISSOLVE TO:

	PAN SHOT - CHILDREN

	It is a half hour later, and now the children are laughing 
	at something Helmut is doing o.s.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK to --

	MED. SHOT - THE GROUP

	Helmut is walking an imaginary tightrope.  Every few steps 
	he almost loses his balance, but with comical gyrations he 
	manages to complete the walk.  He bows deeply to the children -- 
	and falls flat on his face.  The youngsters laugh, applaud 
	and squeal delightedly.

	TWO SHOT - HELMUT, WILLIE

	Helmut is lying on the floor near the boy.  He looks up at 
	the tot and grins.

				  WILLIE
		Doork!  Doork... you're great !

	Helmut grabs Willie and holds him close while he fights back 
	his tears.   Willie plants a big kiss on his cheek.  Helmut 
	scrambles to his feet, the CAMERA PULLING BACK to --

	WIDER ANGLE

	SHOOTING PAST Helmut to the door as it opens, revealing the 
	Sergeant, his face expressionless.  Helmut reacts.

				  SERGEANT
			(to Helmut)
		It's time.

				  HELMUT
		Just a few more minutes?

	The sergeant shakes his head.

				  HELMUT
		I'll bring them.

	The children are watching him, puzzled.

				  CHILDREN
		What's the matter, Doork?  Where are 
		we going?  You come with us this 
		time.  Where're they taking us.

				  HELMUT
			(trying to think what 
			to say)
		They... they want us to move to 
		another building... where we'll have 
		more room... to play.
			(a beat)
		Tell you what.  Let's make it a big 
		circus parade.  Everybody get in a 
		line behind...

	He picks up Willie and stands him near the door.

				  HELMUT
			(continuing)
		... behind Willie here.

	The children scramble up and begin forming a line behind the 
	very proud Willie.  Helmut looks around for the boy with the 
	harmonica.

				  HELMUT
		Now, where's our band?  The harmonica?

	He sees the boy and goes to him.  Helmut pantomimes playing 
	the harmonica and points to himself.  The boy smiles widely, 
	fishes the harmonica out of his pocket and holds it up.

				  HELMUT
		There we are?  Everybody ready?  
		Here we go.

	Helmut takes his place at the head of the line, like the 
	Pied Piper, leads the youngsters out the door, playing a 
	crude sort of circus parade music.  The little children giggle 
	excitedly as they troupe out.  The older ones seem less 
	certain, but as long as Helmut is with them, they feel secure.

								   CUT TO:

	EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

	As the procession of youngsters emerges from the barracks 
	with Helmut dancing along at its head.  The Sergeant and the 
	other two Guards stand watching in disbelief as the line 
	turns and moves along toward the first of the windowless 
	buildings.

	MED. SHOT - SERGEANT, GUARDS

	They look at each other incredulously.  What they are seeing 
	surpasses their imagination.

	FULL SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN

	SHOOTING from a HIGH ANGLE as the procession moves toward 
	the CAMERA.  Helmut looks back at his charges from time to 
	time, smiling and waving and always puffing away on the 
	harmonica.  The children smile back, some timidly and some a 
	bit fearfully, but all smile.

	PAN SHOT - PARADE

	CAMERA PANS in on the children as they march behind Helmut.  
	We see some of them strutting, their little arms swinging 
	freely.  Some of the little ones have to skip to keep up 
	with the others.  They are all smiling.

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	With each step, Helmut looks about, his eyes searching heaven, 
	praying for the miracle that will save the children... the 
	sudden blast of thunder, the striking down of the guards.

	CLOSE SHOT - SERGEANT, GUARDS

	As they follow the parade warily, almost as if expecting a 
	trick.  They wear scowls worn into their faces by long use.

	MED. SHOT - BUILDING - HELMUT'S POV

	Its steel door gapes open.  Through the open doorway we can 
	see a bare room in which what appears to be shower heads 
	jutting from the wall.  A single ceiling light gives the 
	room a stark appearance.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK and UP as 
	the procession comes up toward the building.

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	Despair fills his eyes as he realizes that there is to be no 
	miracle.  He looks ahead into the room, his courage fails 
	him and he stops so abruptly that the children behind him 
	run into his legs.  He turns and looks at them, then back to 
	the door.

	WIDER ANGLE

	Almost reluctantly, Helmut stands aside.  He tries to smile, 
	but the result is almost grotesque.  He tries to speak, but 
	no words come.  The Sergeant and the guard drift up toward 
	him, scowling.  Gently, Helmut tousles the hair of little 
	Willie and steers him through the door into the room.  The 
	other children follow him hesitantly.  Helmut puts the 
	harmonica to his lips and begins playing again.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - TAKING IN SERGEANT AND GUARDS

				  FIRST GUARD
		Their clothes!  They've got to 
		undress.

	The sergeant starts to move toward the line of children, the 
	Sergeant grabs his arm and stops him.

				  SERGEANT
		Leave them alone.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN

	SHOOTING over Helmut's shoulder down at the children as they 
	file past him.  Each one hesitates a beat before him and 
	looks up at him.

	Their faces are wondering, but trusting.  They smile 
	tentatively.  Only the little girl with the doll hangs back, 
	waiting for something rather than fearful of entering.  When 
	all of the other children have gone in, she goes up to Helmut 
	and wordlessly holds out her hand in a silent request to 
	enter with him.  In her eyes is the absolute certainty that 
	he will.

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT - LITTLE GIRL'S POV

	He looks down at her hand for a long beat.

	MED. SHOT - HELMUT, LITTLE GIRL

	The little girl waits for Helmut, but he doesn't take her 
	hand.  Shyly, she begins to withdraw it.  Suddenly, Helmut 
	reaches out and grabs her hand, clutching it desperately as 
	he needs her innocence to control the panic that is tearing 
	at him.  Holding on to her to steady himself, they walk 
	together into the room, the CAMERA PANNING with them.

								   CUT TO:

	INT. CHAMBER - DAY

	ANGLE to the door as Helmut and little girl enter.  Suddenly, 
	the door slams shut behind them.  Helmut whirls to it 
	instinctively, as if to shove it open or cry out for help, 
	but he does neither.

	CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT

	His face is pressed against the steel door.  He fights the 
	panic within him.  Then, he quickly wipes his eyes and turns 
	back towards the children.  Slowly he takes three chunks of 
	stale bread from his coat pocket and begins juggling them, 
	at the same time waggling his head from side to side, slowly 
	at first, then more gaily.  From deep inside him comes a 
	tiny, tiny laugh.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY to reveal 
	the children in the f.g.  Suddenly, Helmut tosses the pieces 
	of bread high, high into the air and stretches out his arms 
	to encompass all the children.  As they gather around him, 
	they take up his soft laugh, timidly at first, then more 
	assuredly until the chamber resounds with gentle laughter.

               EXT. BEACH - PACIFIC ISLAND - MED. SHOT - DAY

               Backgrounded by palm trees and rolling surf, an American 
               army radar operator sits at his huge instrument, intently 
               tracking a target. Without interrupting this, he speaks with 
               tense excitement into a telephone transmitter strapped to 
               his chest. (It is 8:00 a.m.)

               (In this and the subsequent scenes, music and cutting build 
               to an exciting crescendo).

               EXT. FIELD - HONG KONG - MED. SHOT - DAY

               A group of British soldiers, in shorts and tropical gear, 
               are gathered tensely around a piece of radar equipment, which 
               is tracking a target. The radar operator says something to 
               another soldier, who turns and speaks excitedly into a field 
               telephone. (It is 5:00 a.m.)

               INT. INDIAN RADIO STATION - NIGHT

               The microphone bears the word CALCUTTA. An Indian announcer, 
               his expression one of excitement and terror, jabbers into 
               the mike in a native tongue. A clock on the wall indicates 
               that it is 2:26

               EXT. RUSSIAN BOMBER IN FLIGHT - (STOCK) - NIGHT

               The plane is identified by a red star on the fuselage.

               INT. RUSSIAN BOMBER - NIGHT

               The radioman is tracking an object on his radar scope. He 
               points it out excitedly to the pilot. The pilot adjusts his 
               microphone and starts making a report back to his base in 
               Russian.

               EXT. FRENCH VILLAGE - STREET CORNER - MED. CLOSE SHOT - 
               NIGHT

               A group of French farmers is collected around a radio, 
               listening wide-eyed to the keyed-up voice which is telling 
               them, in French, of a strange object that has been seen in 
               the sky. They exchange uneasy glances. One old man crosses 
               himself.

               SPLIT SCREEN SHOT

               RIGHT SECTION OF SCREEN SHOWS INT. AMERICAN RADIO STATION - 
               DAY

               A breathless American radio reporter is speaking into his 
               mike, but we can't hear what he's saying. On the wall behind 
               him is a clock which reads 3:32.

               LEFT SECTION OF SCREEN SHOWS INT. BRITISH RADIO STATION - 
               NIGHT

               A clock shows the time to be 8:32. The British announcer 
               tries to maintain his traditional BBC calm, but finds it 
               almost impossible to control his excitement.

                                     BRITISH ANNOUNCER
                         Reports are coming in from all over 
                         the Empire -- from all over the world. 
                         The Government have not yet issued a 
                         statement, but there seems to be no 
                         question that there actually is a 
                         large, unidentified object circling 
                         the earth at incredible speed.

               This announcer keeps talking, but his voice fades out, and 
               now we hear the words the American announcer is saying...

                         We still don't know what it is or 
                         where it's from - but we do know 
                         there's something there. It's been 
                         tracked around the world by radar 
                         traveling at a rate of four thousand 
                         miles an hour.

               INT. NEW YORK TAXI - DRIVER AND FARE  DAY

               The driver and his fare are listening intently to the radio, 
               as we hear the voice of another radio reporter.

                              (voice off scene)
                         This is not another "flying saucer" 
                         scare. Scientists and military men 
                         have already agreed on that. Whatever 
                         this is -- it's something real.

               EXT. SUBURBAN GAS STATION

               The attendant, who is filling a car with gas, leans around 
               to hear the car's radio, oblivious to the fact that the car's 
               tank is overflowing.

                              (voice off scene)
                         We interrupt this program to give 
                         you a bulletin just received from 
                         one of our naval units at sea. "A 
                         large object, traveling at supersonic 
                         speed, is headed over the North 
                         Atlantic toward the east coast of 
                         the United States."

               Music builds to a climax and ends.

                              controlled calm)
                         Here in the nation's capital, there 
                         is anxiety and concern, but no outward 
                         sign of panic. As a matter of fact, 
                         there are signs of normalcy that 
                         seem strangely out of place; the 
                         beautiful spring weather, the tourist 
                         crowds at the various monuments and 
                         public buildings...

               EXT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - LONG SHOT (STOCK)

               A small crowd of tourists is climbing the steps to the 
               columned entrance.

               EXT. WASHINGTON MONUMENT - LONG SHOT (STOCK)

               Under this shot a barely audible, distant hum is heard. It 
               grows in volume so imperceptibly in this and the next two 
               shots that we are unconscious of it.

               EXT. JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - LONG SHOT (STOCK)

               EXT. THE MALL - LONG SHOT

               Crowds are strolling on the Mall and across the well-kept 
               lawns in front of the Smithsonian Institution with the 
               leisurely, meandering quality that distinguishes sight-seers.

               MED. SHOT

               Including several small groups of people moving toward the 
               Smithsonian. Their attention is attracted as the hum off 
               scene becomes a roar. The sound is unearthly in its intensity 
               and almost unbearable in its swiftly increasing volume. The 
               people stop in their tracks and look up in the sky in terror.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               Several people on the steps of the Smithsonian have turned 
               to look. There is cold, frozen fear in their eyes. The awful 
               sound keeps increasing in volume.

               CLOSE SHOT

               A man, following the progress of a huge object in the sky 
               with his eyes. He is held terror-stricken.

               LONG SHOT INTO SKY (SERSEN SHOT)

               A giant shape, still at some distance, is approaching the 
               earth at incredible speed.

               LONG SHOT ON GROUND

               A group of people run wildly across a large expanse of lawn. 
               A huge shadow cast from above onto the grass seems to be 
               pursing them.

               LONG SHOT INTO SKY (SERSEN SHOT)

               The great shape is considerably nearer now.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Of a woman, thoroughly shaken, held immobile by what she 
               sees and hears.

               LONG SHOT

               People scatter madly in all directions as the huge spaceship 
               comes in for a landing on a smooth, grassy area. The 
               tremendous roar of its motors is suddenly cut off and the 
               great ship settles gently to a perfect landing.

               MED. SHOT - THE SHIP

               The gleaming surface of the ship shows no break of any kind -- 
               no windows, no ports, not even the outline of a hatch. It is 
               a fearsome, terrifying object, giving no evidence of its 
               source or its intention.

               LONG SHOT - (FROM PARALLEL)

               Shooting down on a section of lawn, showing the varying 
               reactions of people to the landing. Some are still running 
               madly away; others, singly and in little groups, stand as 
               though rooted, staring at the ship from a respectful distance.

               CLOSE SHOT - MAN

               As he stares at the ship with fascination and horror. He'd 
               like to run but he can't. His mouth twitches and he emits a 
               nervous little laugh.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               A woman is holding a two-year-old child by the hand as she 
               watches the ship, awe-struck. Several people run past them. 
               Suddenly the woman grabs up the child with a little sob, 
               turns and runs away.

               MED. SHOT

               A middle-aged man runs up to a group of several people, 
               pointing wildly toward the ship and yelling irrationally:

                                     MAN
                         They're here! They're here!

               He runs off toward another group as we--

               shouting wildly and gesticulating in the direction from which 
               he came.

               2. Policemen piling into squad cars, which roar out of their 
               garage.

               3. Soldiers rushing out of a barracks at Fort Myer, with 
               rifles and side arms, to form up on their company street.

               4. Newspaper presses rolling at high speed.

               5. Newscasters chattering excitedly into their microphones.

               6. A large telephone switchboard with the girls in a frenzy 
               of activity as they try to handle the calls pouring in.

               The players are standing on the field in the crowded stadium, 
               but the game has been interrupted and everyone is listening 
               to the voice on the loudspeaker system. (Actual stock shot 
               would be coverage of some dedication or ceremonial.)

               A distinguished-looking government official speaks into the

               A nationally known news commentator -- for purposes of this 
               script let's say Drew Pearson -- is seated before a radio 
               mike. He is also being photographed by TV cameras. In a wall 
               near him is a TV screen which shows what is going out on the 
               air. During the ensuing speech, a man comes in a hands him a 
               sheaf of news bulletins.

                                     PEARSON
                         Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, 
                         this is Drew Pearson. We bring you 
                         this special radio-television 
                         broadcast to give you the latest 
                         information on the landing of the 
                         "space ship" in Washington.

               CLOSE SHOT - PEARSON

                                     PEARSON
                         Government and Defense Department 
                         officials are concerned by reports 
                         of panic in several large Eastern 
                         cities. I am authorized to assure 
                         you that so far there is no reasonable 
                         cause for alarm. The rumors of 
                         invading armies and mass destruction 
                         are based on hysteria and are 
                         absolutely false. I repeat -- these 
                         rumors are absolutely false!

                         The ship, designed for travel outside 
                         the earth's atmosphere, landed in 
                         Washington today at 3:47 p.m., Eastern 
                         Standard Time. We still don't know 
                         where it came from, but I can reveal 
                         that military leaders are considering 
                         two possibilities; that it came from 
                         some unfriendly power here on earth -- 
                         or that it actually arrived from 
                         another planet.

               CAMERA PANS to and DOLLIES IN on the TV screen in the wall. 
               On the screen is a shot of the space ship.

                         The ship is resting exactly where it 
                         landed two hours ago, and there has 
                         been no sign of life from inside it.

               EXT. THE MALL - MED. SHOT

               Two platoons of infantry soldiers surround the ship, their 
               rifles at the ready.

                         Troops have been rushed from Fort 
                         Myer and they have formed a cordon 
                         around the ship.

               MED. SHOT

               showing two machine guns, two Sherman tanks and two 75MM 
               guns. The gun crews are posted for action and all weapons 
               are trained on the space ship.

                              (over scene)
                         They are supported by machine guns, 
                         tanks and artillery.

               MED. SHOT - POLICE CORDON

               Cops are holding back a section of a large crowd, some 
               distance away from the ship. The people are wide-eyed and 
               tense with excitement.

                                     PEARSON'S VOICE
                              (over scene)
                         Behind police lines, there is a large 
                         crowd of curiosity seekers.

               SERIES OF INDIVIDUAL CUTS

               1. Civilians in the crowd, their eyes and nerves taut with 
               suspense.

               2. A young soldier, who grips his rifle and moistens his 
               lips nervously, his eyes never leaving the ship.

               3. A tank commander blinks from the tension of staring at an 
               unmoving object.

               4. The last cut is of the ship itself.

                         meet whatever the situation may 
                         require. Every eye -- every weapon -- 
                         is trained on the ship. It's been

               CLOSE SHOT - PEARSON

               as he interrupts himself excitedly, his attention riveted on 
               the TV screen.

                                     PEARSON
                         Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen! 
                         I think I see something moving!

               EXT. THE MALL - MED. LONG SHOT - DAY

               We are at the actual location now, not looking at TV. We see 
               the ship surrounded by soldiers, two medium tanks, two 
               artillery pieces, and a couple of machine guns. Some distance 
               away is a suggestion of the crowd of civilians, held back by 
               police. Prominent in the scene are newsreel and television 
               cameras. OUR CAMERA MOVES IN to MED. SHOT. As it does so, we 
               see a couple of metal objects rising slowly from the top of 
               the ship. One, which is an oddly-designed coil of wire, slides 
               up and revolves slowly. The other is a section of vented 
               pipe with a convex cap on it.

               REVERSE ANGLE

               on the soldiers, their eyes glued to this first sign of 
               activity from the ship. They shift uneasily, gripping their 
               rifles more firmly.

               MED. SHOT - THE SHIP

               After a long, tense moment, a ramp appears silently out of 
               the side of the ship and slides down to the ground. There is 
               an audible gasp as a man appears at the top of the ramp. He 
               looks around at the crowd with cool and imperturbable dignity. 
               This is KLAATU. He is completely human in appearance. The 
               only unearthly thing about him is his clothing. He wears a 
               tunic that is very good looking, but at the same time 
               thoroughly comfortable and practical. On his head is a metal 
               helmet that obscures most of his face. (It would be impossible 
               to identify him later.) The design of this helmet gives the 
               impression that it is more a formal headdress than for 
               protection. Klaatu is above all an impressive man -- a man 
               of tremendous dignity and presence. He has the tolerant 
               superiority that comes with absolute knowledge.

               INDIVIDUAL REACTION CUTS

               of soldiers, people in the crowd, and policemen. The newsreel 
               and TV men are busy at their cameras.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               After an impressive moment, he raises his arms in the 
               universal gesture of neutrality. Then he speaks, in perfect 
               English, his voice amplified as though through an enunciator.

                                     KLAATU
                         We have come to visit you in peace -- 
                         and with good will.

               Klaatu walks slowly down the ramp toward the soldiers. As he 
               does so, he draws from inside his tunic a strange looking 
               object, longish and tubular. It might be a a telescope -- or 
               it might be some strange kind of weapon.

               MED. SHOT

               shooting from the side, showing Klaatu advancing slowly toward 
               the line of soldiers. He holds out the mysterious object in 
               front of him in a gesture that is actually one of offering 
               but could be misinterpreted as menacing. There is a growing, 
               uneasy rumble of muttering among the soldiers as Klaatu 
               advances. They are clearly frightened of what he may do.

               CLOSE SHOT - PLATOON LEADER

               A young second lieutenant, standing in front of his platoon. 
               As Klaatu advances, the lieutenant unslings his carbine.

               MED. SHOT

               Klaatu starts toward the platoon leader, raising the object 
               he holds toward the man, trying to make clear his intentions. 
               Misinterpreting this as a menacing gesture, the platoon leader 
               raises his carbine to his shoulder.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               of one of the tank commanders in the turret of his tank. He 
               is watching Klaatu advancing toward the platoon leader and 
               he has drawn his pistol. Convinced that the lieutenant is in 
               jeopardy, the tank commander aims at Klaatu and fires.

               MED. SHOT

               as Klaatu falls to the ground wounded. The object he was 
               holding has dropped from his hand and smashed. The soldiers 
               start to gather around Klaatu excitedly when suddenly there 
               appears in the entrance to the space ship a huge robot. There 
               is a gasp of amazement from the crowd and the solders draw 
               back at sight of him. The robot is ten feet tall, is made in 
               the almost-perfect image of a man. He is to be played by an 
               actor and his flesh appears to be made of a greenish metal. 
               His eyes flash as though lighted internally. His perfectly-
               fashioned, muscular body is covered only with a loincloth. 
               This is GORT.

               There are cries of amazement as Gort walks slowly ponderously, 
               down the ramp to the ground. As he does so, the ramp closes 
               behind him. Gort's face is, and always remains, utterly 
               expressionless. He stops to look at Klaatu, lying on the 
               ground. Then he looks around at the soldiers, the tanks and 
               guns. All the guns have been traversing to follow him.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               From inside him there comes an ominous crackling sound, as 
               though power were being generated within him. His eyes flash 
               toward the tank from which Klaatu was shot.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - TANK

               There is a great metallic clatter and the Sherman tank is 
               suddenly reduced to a pile of junk metal, its parts completely 
               disintegrated. Only a piece of tank track and twisted gun 
               barrel emerge from the heap on the ground to identify what 
               had been there. The tank's crew has remained unharmed.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               The crackling sound continues as his eyes start to sweep in 
               a semicircle taking in all the troops.

               MED. SHOT - THE TROOPS

               SHOOTING FROM BEHIND Gort, with the back of his head in f.g., 
               CAMERA PANS to follow Gort's sweeping gaze. In a growing 
               crash and clatter of metal, every weapon in sight is 
               destroyed. The two machine guns are little heaps of junk. 
               The 75's are larger heaps. The second tank, like the first, 
               is a three-foot pile of scrap. Rifles have dropped from the 
               soldier's hands and lie on the ground as little mounds of 
               wood and metal. None of the men has been harmed, but their 
               faces show the utter terror of what they have experienced.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - THE TROOPS

               as they react to the full shock of what has happened. Most 
               of them stand rooted to the ground. Several laugh 
               hysterically. A few break and run wildly.

               MED. SHOT - CROWD OF CIVILIANS

               Sudden pandemonium breaks out. Utterly terrified by what 
               they have witnessed, the crowd becomes a wild, milling, 
               screaming mob, concerned only with escape.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               He is walking slowly, deliberately, menacingly toward the 
               tank commander who fired on Klaatu. Standing by the debris 
               of his tank, the man is immobilized with terror. The robot 
               starts to reach out to grab him.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               lying on the ground. He speaks to Gort sharply, in a strange 
               language.

                                     KLAATU
                         Gort! Deglet ovrosco!

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               He pauses obediently in the act of reaching out for the tank 
               commander. Dropping his arms, he stands motionless and remains 
               that way.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He has raised himself to a sitting position on the ground, 
               his wounded shoulder giving him considerable pain. The two 
               platoon leaders come into scene hesitantly, badly shaken by 
               the awesome demonstration of power they have seen. They are 
               uncertain as to what they should do. The platoon leader eyes 
               the smashed object on the ground curiously and turns 
               questioningly to Klaatu. With great dignity, Klaatu picks up 
               the broken object, which we see well for the first time. It 
               is a delicately-made tubular telescope, badly smashed. On it 
               are indications of small electronic gadgets.

                                     KLAATU
                         It was a gift. For your President.
                              (glances at the broken 
                              object ruefully)
                         With this he could have studied life 
                         on other planets.

               Klaatu lets the object drop with a shrug of mild exasperation. 
               The two lieutenants exchange a helpless look of bewilderment. 
               Then Klaatu raises himself to his feet painfully, holding 
               his wounded shoulder. As he does so, a colonel and a captain 
               come into scene.

                                     COLONEL
                              (to the lieutenants)
                         Is he all right?

                                     FIRST PLATOON LEADER
                         Got hit in the shoulder, sir.

               The three junior officers exchange ineffectual glances and 
               look to the colonel, who thinks for a moment before making 
               his decision.

                                     COLONEL
                         Send for an ambulance. Get him to 
                         Walter Reed Hospital right away.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Yes, sir.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. SITTING ROOM - WALTER REED HOSPITAL - NIGHT

               There is a door to the corridor and a door to Klaatu's room. 
               In the small sitting room, talking in tones of hushed concern, 
               is a group of men. There's a Major General, a likable man 
               with a chest full of ribbons. There are also a Colonel in 
               command of the hospital, a high-ranking police officer, a 
               couple of medical officers and two civilians. The conversation 
               is interrupted by the entrance from Klaatu's room of a Medical 
               Corps Major, followed by an Army Nurse.

                                     GENERAL
                              (to Major)
                         How is he?

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                         He's all right, General... Blood 
                         pressure's a little high, but it 
                         could be aggravation.

                                     GENERAL
                              (wryly)
                         Can't blame him. I always get mad 
                         when somebody shoots me.

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                         He still wants to see the President.

                                     COLONEL
                              (to General)
                         We informed the White House over an 
                         hour ago.

                                     GENERAL
                              (to Major)
                         Didn't drop any hints about where 
                         he's from, did he?

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                         No, sir, he didn't.

               The door to the corridor opens and a worried young Captain 
               enters.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Excuse me.
                              (to the Colonel)
                         What about the reporters, Colonel? 
                         They're swarming all over the lobby.

               The Colonel turns, in deference, to the General.

                                     GENERAL
                              (quietly)
                         Tell them there won't be any statement 
                         tonight.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Yes, sir.
                              (glancing down the 
                              corridor)
                         Mr. Harley's here from the White 
                         House.

               Harley appears in the doorway, a brief case under his arm. 
               He's a dignified, intelligent member of the White House 
               secretariat. He proceeds uninterruptedly into the room, 
               nodding cordially to the General.

                                     HARLEY
                         General --

                                     GENERAL
                              (indicating Klaatu's 
                              room)
                         Right in there, Mr. Harley.

               Harley proceeds in businesslike fashion to the door. He knocks 
               and then enters.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - FULL SHOT

               as Harley enters, closing the door behind him. Klaatu no 
               longer wears his helmet and we see his face clearly for the 
               first time. Even sitting up in bed, with his shoulder strapped 
               in bandages, he is a figure of great authority. His face 
               reflects inner dignity and assurance. Harley, who is a 
               hardened diplomatist, can't help being impressed by his 
               present assignment and a little awed by Klaatu. Harley 
               obviously has been sent by the President to find out what he 
               can. Klaatu's eyes study him, cool, penetrating, reserved.

                                     HARLEY
                         My name is Harley -- Secretary to 
                         the President
                              (Klaatu continues to 
                              study him silently)
                         I've been told that you speak our 
                         language -- that your name is Mr. 
                         Klaatu.

                                     KLAATU
                              (coolly)
                         Just Klaatu.

                                     HARLEY
                         The President asked me to convey his 
                         deepest apologies for what has 
                         happened. We all feel--

                                     KLAATU
                              (evenly)
                         Sit down, Mr. Harley.

               Somewhat relieved, Harley seats himself. He speaks with a 
               half smile, hoping to ease the tension.

                                     HARLEY
                         I'm sure I don't have to point out 
                         that your arrival was something of a 
                         surprise.
                              (getting a little 
                              smile from Klaatu, 
                              he is encouraged to 
                              do some fishing)
                         Had you been traveling long?

                                     KLAATU
                         About five months -- your months.

                                     HARLEY
                         You must have come a long way.

                                     KLAATU
                         About 250 million of your miles.

               Harley glances at him quickly to be sure he's not joking. 
               He's not.

                                     HARLEY
                         Naturally we're very curious to know 
                         where it is you come from.

                                     KLAATU
                              (easily; he's a 
                              diplomat, too)
                         From another planet. Let's just say 
                         that we're neighbors.

               Harley reacts, as his wildest assumptions are so blandly 
               corroborated.

                                     HARLEY
                         It's rather difficult for us to think 
                         of another planet as a neighbor.

                                     KLAATU
                         I'm afraid, in the present situation 
                         you'll have to learn to think that 
                         way.

                                     HARLEY
                              (eyebrows raised)
                         The present situation?

                                     KLAATU
                         I mean the reasons for my coming 
                         here.

                                     HARLEY
                              (his eagerness apparent)
                         We're very curious about that, too. 
                         Would you care to talk about it?

                                     KLAATU
                         I'd be glad to.
                              (noticing that Harley 
                              is settling himself 
                              expectantly)
                         Not now, of course -- with you alone.

                                     HARLEY
                         Perhaps you'd rather discuss it 
                         personally with the President--

                                     KLAATU
                              (somewhat sharply)
                         This is not a personal matter, Mr. 
                         Harley. It concerns all the people 
                         on your planet.

                                     HARLEY
                              (Startled by the scope 
                              of this statement)
                         I -- I'm not sure I understand--

                                     KLAATU
                         I want to meet with representatives 
                         from all the nations of the Earth.

                                     HARLEY
                              (shocked and perturbed 
                              by this notion)
                         I'm afraid that would be a little 
                         awkward. It's -- it's completely 
                         without precedent. And there are 
                         practical considerations -- the time 
                         involved -- the enormous distances.

                                     KLAATU
                              (coolly)
                         I traveled 250 million miles. What 
                         about your United Nations?

                                     HARLEY
                              (Surprised and a little 
                              puzzled)
                         You know about the United Nations?

                                     KLAATU
                         We've been monitoring your radio 
                         broadcasts for a good many years. 
                         That's how we learned your languages. 
                         Lately, we've been getting your 
                         television also.

                                     HARLEY
                              (wryly)
                         You must have a rather strange 
                         impression of us.

                                     KLAATU
                              (smiling)
                         The first two years of television we 
                         were convinced that all you did was 
                         wrestle.

               Harley smiles. Then his mind reverts to the seriousness of 
               the situation and he speaks gravely.

                                     HARLEY
                         I'm sure you recognize from our broad-
                         casts the evil forces that have 
                         produced the tension in our world. 
                         Surely you would agree--

                                     KLAATU
                              (evenly)
                         I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with 
                         the internal affairs of your planet. 
                         I consider that to be your business -- 
                         not mine.

                                     HARLEY
                         I was only hoping to make you 
                         understand.

                                     KLAATU
                              (sternly, impressively)
                         My mission here is not to solve your 
                         petty squabbles. It concerns the 
                         existence of every last creature who 
                         lives on Earth.

                                     HARLEY
                              (uncomfortably)
                         Perhaps if you could explain a little--

                                     KLAATU
                         I intend to explain. To all the 
                         nations -- simultaneously.
                              (his manner precludes 
                              opposition)
                         How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?

               Harley is thoroughly shaken. The tremendous force and power 
               implicit in Klaatus's manner preclude the possibility of 
               argument.

                                     HARLEY
                              (after a long 
                              thoughtful moment)
                         We could call a special meeting of 
                         the General Assembly... But of course 
                         the UN doesn't represent all of the 
                         nations.

                                     KLAATU
                         Then why not a meeting of all the 
                         Chiefs of State?

                                     HARLEY
                              (helplessly, but 
                              patiently)
                         Believe me, you don't understand. 
                         They wouldn't sit down at the same 
                         table.

               Growing a little impatient with such nonsense, Klaatu eyes 
               him evenly, speaks with Jovian authority.

                                     KLAATU
                         I don't want to resort to threats, 
                         Mr. Harley. I simply tell you bluntly 
                         that the future of your planet is at 
                         stake... I suggest you transmit that 
                         message to the nations of the Earth.

               The eyes of the two men meet for a long, silent moment. Then 
               Harley rises quietly.

                                     HARLEY
                         I will make that recommendation to 
                         the President.
                              (he picks up his brief 
                              case and hat)
                         I must tell you in all honesty that 
                         I'm extremely dubious about the 
                         results.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a half-smile)
                         Apparently I'm not as cynical about 
                         Earth's people as you are.

                                     HARLEY
                         I've been dealing in Earth's politics 
                         a good deal longer than you have.
                              (he bows)
                         Goodnight, sir.

               He turns and goes out.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He stares after Harley for a moment, puzzled by this strange 
               and apparently unreasoning world he has come to. He shakes 
               his head in thoughtful, tolerant bewilderment.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. SPACE SHIP - LONG SHOT - NIGHT

               Searchlights have lighted up up the eerie shapes of the space 
               ship and Gort. A circle of soldiers guard the area, while a 
               crew of men can be seen working around the ship.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT SHIP

               A Master Sergeant of Engineers, dressed in fatigues, is 
               inspecting the side of the ship carefully. He has an acetylene 
               torch in his had and a welding helmet over his face. The 
               Major General, previously seen in the hospital sitting room, 
               enters and speaks to the Sergeant.

                                     GENERAL
                         Getting any place, Sergeant?

                                     SERGEANT
                              (raising his helmet)
                         No, sir.
                              (shaking his head in 
                              annoyance)
                         Beats me, General. I saw that ramp 
                         come out of the side of the ship -- 
                         right here. Now I can't even find a 
                         crack!

               A man named Carlson, a civilian metallurgical expert, comes 
               into scene. The General nods to him.

                                     GENERAL
                         What's the report, Carlson?

                                     CARLSON
                              (discouraged)
                         We've tried everything from a 
                         blowtorch to a diamond drill.

                                     GENERAL
                              (nodding toward Gort)
                         What about him?

                                     CARLSON
                         He's made out of the same stuff.

               THREE SHOT  GENERAL, CARLSON AND SERGEANT

                                     GENERAL
                         Has he moved?

                                     SERGEANT
                         No sir. Not an inch

                                     CARLSON
                         This is the toughest material I ever 
                         saw, General. For hardness and 
                         strength, it's out of this world.

                                     GENERAL
                              (with a wry half-smile)
                         I can tell you officially - that's 
                         where it came from.

               The two men exchange an uneasy glance, then turn to look at 
               the ship.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. SITTING ROOM  WALTER REED HOSPITAL

               Two Medical Corps officers, a Captain and a Major are 
               interestedly studying a series of X-ray films.

                                     MAJOR
                         The skeletal structure is completely 
                         normal.
                              (pointing)
                         Same for the major organs - heart, 
                         liver, spleen, kidneys.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         And the lungs are the same as ours. 
                         Must mean a similar atmosphere -- 
                         similar pressure.
                              (nodding, toward 
                              Klaatu's room)
                         How old do you think he is?

                                     MAJOR
                         Oh, I'd say forty-five.

                                     CAPTAIN
                              (smiling)
                         He told me this morning when I 
                         examined him. He's seventy-eight.

                                     MAJOR
                         I don't believe it.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Their life expectancy is a hundred 
                         and thirty.

                                     MAJOR
                         How does he explain that?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         He says their medicine is that much 
                         more advanced.
                              (the major stares at 
                              him blankly)
                         He was very nice about it. But he 
                         made me feel like a third-class witch 
                         doctor.

               The door to Klaatu's rooms opens and Major White appears. 
               He's the man who attended Klaatu the day before. He closes 
               the door behind him and stands motionless facing the other 
               two, his face wearing a blank expression.

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                         I took a bullet out of that man's 
                         arm yesterday.

                                     FIRST MAJOR
                         What about it?

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                              (utterly bewildered)
                         I just examined the wound and it's 
                         all healed.

                                     FIRST MAJOR
                         What does he say about it?

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                         Said he put some salve on it -- some 
                         stuff he had with him.
                              (shows them a small, 
                              odd-looking tube in 
                              his hand)

                                     CAPTAIN
                         What are you going to do with it?

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                         Take it downstairs and have it 
                         analyzed.
                              (on his way to the 
                              door, shaking his 
                              head)
                         Then I don't know whether I'll just 
                         get drunk or give up the practice of 
                         medicine.

               As he starts out the door to the corridor, he passes Mr. 
               Harley, who is on his way in, carrying his ever-present brief 
               case. Harley is accompanied by an enlisted M.P.

                                     FIRST MAJOR
                         Afternoon, Mr. Harley.

                                     HARLEY
                         Afternoon, gentlemen.

               Harley goes to the door of Klaatu's room, a businesslike 
               expression on his face. He knocks on the door, then enters. 
               The M.P. remains in the sitting room.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - FULL SHOT - DAY

               as Harley enters. Klaatu is up out of bed, walking around in 
               a Medical Corps robe and pajamas. He appears to be completely 
               recovered.

                                     HARLEY
                         Good afternoon.
                              (surprised not to 
                              find him in bed)
                         I'm glad to see you up and around.

                                     KLAATU
                         Thank you... Have you any news?

                                     HARLEY
                         Not very good news, I'm afraid.
                              (digs into his 
                              briefcase for some 
                              papers)
                         The President accepted your suggestion 
                         and cabled the invitations for a 
                         meeting last night.
                              (grimly)
                         Let me read you some of the replies.
                              (he selects a cable 
                              and reads)
                         "The Premier wishes to inform the 
                         Government of the United States that 
                         it will be impossible for him to 
                         attend the meeting suggested by the 
                         President unless the meeting is held 
                         in Moscow."
                              (with a grimly-pointed 
                              glance at Klaatu, 
                              Harley reads another 
                              cable)
                         "The suggestion of the President 
                         regarding the possibility of a meeting 
                         in Moscow would be unacceptable to 
                         Her Majesty's Government at the 
                         present time. Representation could 
                         be sent only if the meeting were 
                         held in Washington."
                              (he looks up at Klaatu 
                              and shrugs)
                         Well -- there you have it.

               Harley extends a sheaf of cables for Klaatu's inspection, 
               but he ignores them. Klaatu has listened to this recital, 
               first incredulously, then with mounting indignation. Conscious 
               of his quiet, Olympian wrath, Harley continues uncomfortably.

                                     HARLEY
                         I tried to make you understand. The 
                         suspicions -- the jealousies -- the 
                         mistrust--
                              (uneasily, under 
                              Klaatu's level gaze)
                         Surely you realize that my government 
                         has done everything in its power--

                                     KLAATU
                         It's not your government I'm thinking 
                         about. It's your world.

                                     HARLEY
                         Now that you understand the situation 
                         more clearly, perhaps you'd like to 
                         discuss the matter with the President

                                     KLAATU
                              (sternly)
                         I will not speak to any one nation 
                         or group of nations.
                              (sharply, bitterly)
                         I don't intend to add my contribution 
                         to your childish jealousies and 
                         suspicions.

                                     HARLEY
                         Our problems are very complex, Mr. 
                         Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too 
                         harshly.

                                     KLAATU
                         I can judge only by what I see.

                                     HARLEY
                         Your impatience is quite 
                         understandable.

                                     KLAATU
                              (sharply)
                         I am impatient with stupidity. My 
                         people have learned to live without 
                         it.

                                     HARLEY
                              (ruefully)
                         I'm afraid my people haven't.
                              (with real sincerity)
                         I'm very sorry -- I wish it were 
                         otherwise.

               Reluctantly Harley has picked up his hat and brief case. He 
               finds Klaatu staring out the window.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               As he looks out the window thoughtfully. What he sees has 
               given him an idea.

               MED. SHOT - HOSPITAL GROUNDS

               shooting down, from Klaatu's viewpoint, at people strolling 
               about the hospital grounds. Most of them are civilian 
               visitors, but there is a sprinkling of nurses and ambulatory 
               patients.

               FULL SHOT - HOSPITAL ROOM

               As Klaatu turns back to Harley, he speaks thoughtfully, 
               incisively.

                                     KLAATU
                         Before making any decisions, I think 
                         I should get out among your people -- 
                         become familiar with the basis for 
                         these strange, unreasoning attitudes.

                                     HARLEY
                         Under the circumstances I'm afraid 
                         that will be impossible.

               Harley has paused near the door, a little embarrassed by 
               Klaatu's level gaze.

                                     HARLEY
                         I must ask that you don't attempt to 
                         leave the hospital. Our military 
                         people have insisted on this. I'm 
                         sure you'll understand.

               With a polite nod, he goes out. Klaatu stares after him as 
               he realizes that he is in effect a prisoner. He shakes his 
               head slowly, thoughtfully. The ways of this planet are strange 
               indeed.

               INT. SITTING ROOM - MED CLOSE SHOT - AT DOOR

               Harley has paused to watch as the M.P. takes out a key and 
               inserts it in the lock of Klaatu's door.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               As he hears the click of the lock, he turns toward the door. 
               Realizing they've locked him in, he smiles with tolerant 
               amusement.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL SITTING ROOM - MED CLOSE SHOT - NIGHT

               In the dim light of one lamp, the door to the corridor opens 
               and a nurse enters carrying a tray of medication. She is 
               accompanied by the same M.P. as previously seen. The nurse 
               pauses as the M.P. takes out a key and inserts it in the 
               lock of Klaatu's door. To his surprise he finds that the 
               door is not locked. He exchanges a glance with the nurse, 
               then pulls the door open and hurries inside.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

               as the M.P. crosses the unlighted room toward the bed. The 
               only light cones from the open door to the sitting room. The 
               M.P.'s eyes go wide as he looks at the bed. It is unmade and 
               unoccupied. Terrified, the M.P. turns to the nurse, who is 
               standing in the doorway.

               M.P.  He's gone!

               The M.P. dashes out of the room, through the doorway past 
               the nurse. She turns to follow him as we--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MONTAGE - NIGHT

               A series of short DISSOLVES, showing:

               1. The M.P. excitedly reporting Klaatu's disappearance to 
               the Officer of the Day.

               2. The hospital guard detail hurrying out of the guardhouse 
               to form up in front of the Sergeant of the guard.

               3. A high-level military conference gathered at a table, 
               discussing the matter with great concern.

               4. A street corner newsstand, with people eagerly grabbing 
               papers. The headline reads: "MAN FROM MARS" ESCAPES FROM 
               ARMY HOSPITAL!

               5. Radio announcers chattering excitedly into their 
               microphones

               6. A series of close-ups of people listening to the radio. 
               Their faces reveal their awestruck terror.

               7. A terrified mother drags her two children in from the 
               street through the front door, slams the door and bolts it.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - MED. CLOSE SHOT - NIGHT

               CAMERA is on the back of a man dressed in a business suit, 
               who is walking along the sidewalk of a dimly lighted, almost 
               deserted, middle-class street. He carries a suitcase and he 
               glances idly at the drab-looking stone facades of the old 
               two-story houses. As he passes, from the open windows of the 
               houses come the voices of radio announcers. We get a sentence 
               or two from one house and then, as the man and our CAMERA 
               pass on, this voice fades and another is picked up. We get 
               the impression that everyone is glued to his radio.

                                     RADIO VOICES
                              (over scene)
                         --authorities at Walter Reed Hospital 
                         refused to comment on how he managed 
                         to escape, or what measures might be 
                         taken to apprehend him.

               --these fantastic descriptions of the creature are denounced 
               as rumor by police Chief Walter Baxter. He is not eight feet 
               tall, as reported -- nor does he have tentacles in place of 
               arms--

               --there's no denying that there is a monster at large -- 
               that we are dealing with forces beyond our knowledge and 
               power. The public is urged to take ordinary precautions and 
               to remain calm, as we await further developments--

               --three separate reports of people who claim to have seen 
               the "space man" in the past hour. One from Des Moines, Iowa; 
               one from a village in northern Florida; and one from Chicago.

               CAMERA OVERTAKES the man as he pauses under the light of a 
               street lamp, and reveals that it is Klaatu. He has stopped 
               to look at something out of scene.

               CLOSE SHOT

               from Klaatu's viewpoint, of a sign on one of the houses, 
               reading: ROOM FOR RENT

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He seems to hesitate, debating a plan he has in mind. He 
               raises his right arm to scratch his head thoughtfully, and 
               notices for the first time a small tag, or ticket, attached 
               to the inside of the right forearm of the coat he is wearing. 
               Puzzled, he pulls off the ticket and looks at it.

               INSERT - TICKET

               It is the sort of tag a cleaning establishment attaches to 
               clothing. Printed on it is the legend: CAPITOL DRY CLEANING

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He smiles wryly at this reminder of where he got the suit, 
               and he destroys the ticket. He glances down at the suitcase 
               beside him.

               CLOSE SHOT - SUITCASE

               It bears the initials L.M.C. Klaatu's hand comes into scene 
               and lifts up the suitcase. CAMERA HOLDS as Klaatu carries 
               the bag toward the house and mounts the stone steps to the 
               entrance.

               INT. BOARDINGHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               There 's no light in the room except what splashes in from 
               the hall. Gathered around a television set are five adults 
               and a little boy, their faces eerie in the reflected light 
               from the screen. The room is done in average boardinghouse 
               style -- antimacassars and all. The attention of the people 
               is riveted on the television screen, where a newscaster is 
               reading a bulletin.

                                     TELEVISION COMMENTATOR
                         --while the President made no effort 
                         to minimize the crisis, he urged 
                         people all over the country to remain 
                         calm. He said the entire facilities 
                         of FBI and other federal agencies 
                         are being bought to bear. He pointed 
                         out, however, that this is no ordinary 
                         man hunt. He warned we may be up 
                         against powers that are beyond our 
                         control.

               FULL SHOT

               The landlady, a stern-faced woman of middle age, named MRS. 
               CROCKETT, rises nervously and crosses to the television set.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (tensely)
                         I can't stand any more of this. It's 
                         enough to drive a person crazy.

               She snaps off the set sharply.

               TWO SHOT

               BOBBY BENSON, a bright-eyed, eleven-year-old, is seated beside 
               his mother, HELEN BENSON, an attractive girl of thirty. 
               Disappointed that the set has been turned off, Bobby's roving 
               eye has fallen on something in the doorway to the hall... 
               Wide-eyed, he nudges his mother and points.

                                     BOBBY
                         Hey, Mom -- who's that?

               FULL SHOT

               including the doorway to the hall. Silhouetted motionless 
               against the light from the hall is the figure of a man. All 
               eyes follow Hobby's pointed finger, and there is a stifled 
               gasp as they are startled out of their preoccupation. One of 
               the men turns on the lights and Klaatu is revealed standing 
               calmly in the doorway. There is a shocked silence for a 
               moment, then Mrs. Crockett speaks.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (apologizing nervously 
                              for the tension in 
                              the room)
                         I -- I'm sorry. What is it you want?

                                     KLAATU
                         My name is Carpenter. I'm looking 
                         for a room.

               There is a noticeable letdown in the general tension, during 
               which Booby has been studying Klaatu, his imagination working 
               overtime.

                                     BOBBY
                         Are you an FBI man?

                                     KLAATU
                         No -- I'm afraid not.

               Helen has stepped forward to make Bobby desist.

                                     BOBBY
                         Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking 
                         for that space man.

                                     HELEN
                              (with an apologetic 
                              smile at Klaatu)
                         I think we've all been hearing too 
                         much about "space men."

               Mrs. Crockett reverts to her role as landlady. She likes to 
               think of her house as a home.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (starting the 
                              introductions with 
                              Helen)
                         This is Mrs. Benson, Mr. Carpenter.
                              (with a smile that 
                              would split a brick)
                         And little Bobby.
                              (indicating a middle-
                              aged couple and a 
                              younger but more 
                              wizened man)
                         Mr. and Mrs. Barley -- and Mr. 
                         Krull... I'm Mrs. Crockett.

               There are polite noddings and how-do-you-do's. Mrs. Crockett 
               is satisfied that she's established a cozy atmosphere.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (pleased to the point 
                              of challenge)
                         Well -- this is our little family.
                              (then, getting down 
                              to business)
                         I have a very nice room on the second 
                         floor.

               She leads the way toward the hall and Klaatu starts to follow, 
               picking up his suitcase, when he is intercepted by Bobby.

                                     BOBBY
                         Can I help you look for the space 
                         man? Can I?
                              (excitedly)
                         I know what he looks like! He's got 
                         a square head -- and, three great 
                         big eyes!

                                     HELEN
                              (good-naturedly, 
                              calming him down)
                         That's enough, Bobby. I think it's 
                         time you went to bed.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (to Bobby, with a 
                              prop smile)
                         We mustn't annoy Mr. Carpenter -- or 
                         he won't want to stay here. She goes 
                         on into the hall, followed by Klaatu, 
                         who has exchanged a polite smile 
                         with Helen.

               INT. HALLWAY

               as Mrs. Crockett leads the way up the stairs.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                         He's really a dear little boy -- and 
                         quiet as a mouse.
                              (with a shrewd, chatty 
                              smile)
                         You're a long way from home, aren't 
                         you, Mr. Carpenter?

                                     KLAATU
                         How did you know?

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (pleased with her 
                              cleverness)
                         Oh, I can tell a New England accent 
                         a mile away.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BOARDINGHOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

               Five of the boarders -- Mr. and Mrs. Barley, Mr. Krull, Helen 
               Benson and Klaatu - are finishing their Sunday morning 
               breakfast. Mrs. Barley is a middle-class Helen Hokinson lady, 
               form and unrelenting. Her husband is a born complainer. Mr. 
               Krull is a shriveled little accountant, precise and finicky. 
               As they finish their coffee, all except Helen are immersed 
               in the Sunday papers. Helen seems preoccupied with her own 
               thoughts. From a portable radio on the table comes Gabriel 
               Heater's voice.

                                     GABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE
                         --and so, this Sunday morning, we 
                         ask the question that's been plaguing; 
                         the entire nation for two days now: 
                         "Where is this creature and what is 
                         he up to?" If he can build a space 
                         ship that can fly to Earth -- and a 
                         robot that can destroy our tanks and 
                         guns -- what other terrors can he 
                         unleash at will? ...Obviously we 
                         must find this monster. We must track 
                         him down like a wild animal and 
                         destroy him.

               INSERT - NEWSPAPER PAGE IN MRS. BARLEY'S HANDS

               It is a full page layout, in the style of the American Weekly, 
               showing a demented artist's conception of a mass invasion of 
               space ships. Weird-looking creatures are slaughtering Earth 
               people with ray guns. The caption at the top of the image 
               reads: "Are We Long For This World?" (Gabriel Heater's voice 
               continues uninterruptedly over this and the next two scenes.)

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He is reading his paper with considerable interest.

               INSERT - NEWSPAPER STORY

               The third-page story reads: SAVANT CALLS MEETING TO STUDY 
               SPACE SHIP. Professor Jacob Barnhardt, world-famous scientist 
               and Nobel Prize winner, has invited fellow scientists from 
               all over the world to meet with him in Washington and study 
               the recently landed "Space Ship."

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               His face is thoughtful as he finishes reading. This story 
               seems to impress and interest him. Then suddenly he finds 
               his attention caught at what the Radio Voice is saying.

                                     GABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE
                         But where would such a creature hide 
                         himself? Would he disappear into the 
                         north woods? Or would he slither off 
                         into the sewers of some great city?

               Klaatu has a reaction of affronted dignity at this monstrously 
               distasteful idea.

               GROUP SHOT

               AS THE RADIO VOICE CONTINUES:

                                     GABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE
                         There is grave danger -- everyone 
                         agrees to that. The question is what 
                         can we do to protect ourselves? What 
                         measures can we take that will--

               During the above, Mrs. Barley has turned to her husband in 
               sharp annoyance.

                                     MRS. BARLEY
                         George, I wish you'd turn that radio 
                         off. I'm trying to concentrate.

               Mr. Barley reaches out and snaps off the radio.

                                     MR. BARLEY
                              (snorting, he tosses 
                              his paper down)
                         Why doesn't the Government do 
                         something -- that's what I want to 
                         know.

                                     MR. KRULL
                              (mildly)
                         What can they do? They're only people -- 
                         Just like us.

                                     MR. BARLEY
                         People my foot! They're Democrats!

                                     MR. KRULL
                         It's enough to give you the shakes. 
                         He's got that robot standing there -- 
                         ten-foot tall -- just waiting for 
                         orders to destroy us.

                                     HELEN
                              (thoughtfully)
                         This space man -- or whatever he is. 
                         We automatically assume he's a 
                         menace... Maybe he isn't at all.

                                     MR. BARLEY
                              (glaring at her for 
                              this silly notion)
                         Then what's he hiding for? Why doesn't 
                         he come out in the open?

                                     MR. KRULL
                         Yeah.
                              (indicating the radio)
                         Like the fella says: "What's he up 
                         to?"

                                     HELEN
                         Maybe he's afraid.

                                     MRS. BARLEY
                              (with a derisive snort)
                         He's afraid!

                                     HELEN
                         After all, he was shot the moment he 
                         landed here.
                              (she pauses for a 
                              moment thoughtfully)
                         I was just wondering what I would 
                         do.

                                     KLAATU
                              (to Helen, helpfully)
                         Perhaps before deciding on a course 
                         of action, you'd want to know more 
                         about the people here -- to orient 
                         yourself in a strange environment.

                                     MRS. BARLEY
                              (sharply)
                         There's nothing strange about 
                         Washington, Mr. Carpenter.

                                     KLAATU
                              (quietly, tongue in 
                              cheek)
                         A person from another planet might 
                         disagree with you.

                                     MRS. BARLEY
                         If you want my opinion, he came from 
                         right here on Earth.
                              (with significant 
                              emphasis)
                         And you know where I mean.

                                     MR. KRULL
                         They wouldn't come in a space ship. 
                         They'd come in airplanes.

                                     MRS. BARLEY
                              (as though with 
                              superior knowledge)
                         I wouldn't be so sure about that.

                                     MR. BARLEY
                              (delivering the final 
                              word)
                         Stands to reason that fella wants 
                         some thing or he wouldn't be here.
                              (facing Klaatu)
                         That make sense, Carpenter?

               Klaatu pauses for a moment, then recites pleasantly.

                                     KLAATU
                         I must admit I'm a little confused.

               Mrs. Crockett enters and speaks to Helen.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                         Mrs. Benson -- Mr. Stevens is here 
                         to see you.

                                     HELEN
                         Oh -- thank you.

               She rises and goes out.

                                     MRS. BARLEY
                         Finish your coffee, George. I told 
                         the Carsons we'd be there at eleven.

               INT. BOARDINGHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MED. CLOSE SHOT

               as Helen crosses the room to greet TOM STEVENS. He's a 
               personable young man with a breezy manner and considerable 
               charm. There is between them an easy air of Intimacy.

                                     HELEN
                              (smiling warmly)
                         Good morning.

               Tom kisses her.

                                     TOM
                         We're all set. I picked up some 
                         sandwiches and put gas in the car. 
                         And the radio's still busted, so me 
                         can forget about the space man for 
                         today.

                                     HELEN
                              (a little disturbed)
                         There's only one thing -- I haven't 
                         been able to arrange for anyone to 
                         stay with Bobby.
                              (tentatively)
                         I don't suppose we could take him 
                         with us?

                                     TOM
                              (understandably 
                              unenthusiastically)
                         Well, we could--

                                     HELEN
                         There's always somebody here, but 
                         today of course they've all got plans.

                                     KLAATU'S VOICE
                         I haven't any plans.

               Helen and Tom turn in surprise.

               THREE SHOT

               including Klaatu, who has wandered in from the dining room, 
               unnoticed by Tom and Helen. Klaatu continues, with an air of 
               wanting to be helpful without wanting to interfere.

                                     KLAATU
                         I'd be glad to spend the day with 
                         him -- if you'd let me.

                                     TOM
                              (impulsively)
                         Say, that'll be great! Wouldn't it, 
                         Helen.

                                     HELEN
                              (hesitating, a little 
                              confused, by the 
                              offer)
                         It's awfully nice of you to suggest 
                         it.
                              (remembering the two 
                              men haven't met)
                         I'm sorry Mr. Carpenter -- this is 
                         Tom Stevens.

               The two men shake hand's and exchange how-do-you-do's. Then 
               Klaatu turns back to Helen.

                                     KLAATU
                         Bobby and I had a fine time yesterday 
                         afternoon. We talked -- and listened 
                         to the radio.
                              (smiling at Helen)
                         I thought today he might show me 
                         around the city.

               Helen is debating the matter in her mind, concerned about 
               leaving Bobby with a comparative stranger, but tempted because 
               of her favorable impression of Klaatu.

                                     KLAATU
                              (easily)
                         Suppose I ask Bobby how he feels 
                         about it.

               He turns, with a little smile, and starts out of the room. 
               Helen, still not quite decided, turns to Tom with a 
               questioning look. Tom nods.

               DISSOLVE T0:

               INT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - FULL SHOT - DAY (STOCK)

               The great seated, brooding figure of Lincoln is at the far 
               end of the impressive main hall. A few tourists are moving 
               about the place.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

               They are in the south hall, on the wall of which is inscribed 
               the Gettysburg Address. They stand silently, side by side, 
               reading the inscription.

               INSERT - GETTYSBURG ADDRESS (STOCK)

               Featuring the last part of the Address. It reads: "--and 
               that government of the people, by the people, for the people, 
               shall not perish from the earth."

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

                                     KLAATU
                              (visibly impressed)
                         Those are great words.
                              (with an air of 
                              discovery)
                         He must have been a great man.

               Bobby is impressed by the depth and sincerity of Klaatu's 
               tribute, but a little confused by his air of having discovered 
               Lincoln. Hobby watches Klaatu with a puzzled expression, 
               then follows as Klaatu moves off slowly.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - MED. CLOSE SHOT - DAY

               shooting against one of the huge fluted columns as Klaatu 
               and Bobby come out of the building. Deeply preoccupied, Klaatu 
               speaks with impatient urgency.

                                     KLAATU
                         That's the kind of man I'd like to 
                         talk to.

               Bobby looks up at him in bewilderment. After a moment Klaatu 
               speaks slowly, thoughtfully.

                                     KLAATU
                         Bobby -- who's the greatest man in 
                         America today?

                                     BOBBY
                              (puzzling it over)
                         Gee -- I don't know... The space 
                         man, I guess.

                                     KLAATU
                              (secretly amused)
                         I was speaking of earth men. I meant 
                         the greatest philosopher -- the 
                         greatest thinker.

                                     B0BBY
                         You mean the smartest man in the 
                         whole world?

                                     KLAATU
                         Yes -- that would do nicely.

                                     BOBBY
                              (after a moments 
                              thought)
                         Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. 
                         He's the greatest scientist in the 
                         world.

                                     KLAATU
                              (he pauses 
                              thoughtfully, speaks 
                              slowly, as he recalls 
                              the newspaper story 
                              he read)
                         He lives here in Washington, doesn't 
                         he?

                                     BOBBY
                         Sure. Right near where my mother 
                         works.

                                     KLAATU
                         Where is that?

                                     BOBBY
                         Department of Commerce. She's a 
                         secretary.
                              (Klaatu nods)
                         They have a man they call the 
                         Secretary, but he isn't at all. My 
                         mother's a real secretary.
                              (after a moment; 
                              eagerly)
                         Mr. Carpenter -- now can we go see 
                         the space ship?

               EXT. THE MALL - LONG SHOT - SPACE SHIP AND GORT - DAY

               A crew of Army engineers is in process of erecting a temporary 
               structure such as a large Quonset hut or B29 hanger to enclose 
               the space ship and Gort. The walls are partially up and 
               already have concealed part of the ship. The area is roped 
               off and there are Army guards to keep the sightseers back. 
               There is a crowd of people behind the ropes, watching. CAMERA 
               MOVES IN to reveal the backs of Bobby and Klaatu.

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

               Bobby is studying the ship and Gort eagerly, his imagination 
               thoroughly aroused. Klaatu is watching the men at work with 
               mild, quiet amusement.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               from Bobby's viewpoint.

               TWO SHOT - BOBBY AND KLAATU

               Bobby's eyes are wide with awe as he watches the giant robot.

                                     BOBBY
                         Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he 
                         could knock down a whole building.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a quizzical 
                              smile)
                         I shouldn't be at all surprised.

               Bobby's attention shifts to the ship.

               MED. SHOT - SPACE SHIP

               From Bobby's viewpoint.

               TWO SHOT - B0BBY AND KLAATU

                                     BOBBY
                              (excitedly, indicating 
                              the ship)
                         Gee, I'd like to get inside and see 
                         how it works. What do you think makes 
                         it go?

                                     KLAATU
                              (quietly, after a 
                              glance around)
                         Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.

                                     BOBBY
                              (looking at Klaatu 
                              incredulously)
                         I thought that was only for bombs.

                                     KLAATU
                         No. It's for a lot of other things, 
                         too.

                                     BOBBY
                         You think it can go faster than an F-
                         36?

                                     KLAATU
                         Yes -- I think so.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT KLAATU AND BOBBY

               shooting from a side angle to include a couple of men who 
               are listening to Klaatu's conversation. They are nudging 
               each other, amused at the way this man is pretending to 
               explain things to the little boy.

                                     BOBBY
                         About a thousand miles an hour?

               Klaatu has noticed the two men, who have edged a little closer 
               to listen. He is not perturbed by them, but he lowers his 
               voice a bit.

                                     KLAATU
                         Maybe four thousand miles an hour. 
                         And outside the Earth's atmosphere a 
                         good deal faster.

                                     BOBBY
                              (excitedly)
                         Gee! How could they make a landing?

                                     KLAATU
                         Well -- there are several ways to 
                         reduce landing speed. You see, the 
                         velocity--

               Klaatu interrupts himself as he realizes that he may be going 
               too far. The two men have moved closer, listening and 
               grinning. One of them whispers to the other behind the back 
               of his hand. Then the man realizes that Klaatu has stopped 
               speaking and is looking at him.

                                     MAN
                              (grinning)
                         Keep goin', Mister. He was fallin' 
                         for it.

               The two men burst out laughing and move off together. Bobby, 
               who has missed the point of this by-play, looks at Klaatu, 
               then after the men. As they move out of scene they laugh 
               loudly at the little boy's confusion. Klaatu takes Bobby's 
               hand to lead him away from the roped-off area.

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

               CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they move away through the crowd.

               As they do so, several newsboys are working their way through 
               the crowd with newly arrived extras. The boys are calling 
               out the extras: "Police under fire!" "Army put in charge!" 
               "Space man still at large!" etc. People are eagerly buying 
               the papers. Klaatu and Booby watch this as they pass through 
               the crowd.

               CLOSE SHOT - EXTRA

               In newsboy's hand. The headline reads: SPACE MAN ELUDES POLICE 
               ARMY PUT IN CHARGE.

               CLOSE SHOT - ANOTHER EXTRA

               In another newsboy's hand. This headline reads: DISTRICT 
               UNDER MARTIAL LAW. CONGRESS ACTS AS POLICE CHIEF REIGNS.

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

               as they move on away from the excited crowd of people. 
               Klaatu's reaction has been one of mild curiosity. Bobby looks 
               up at him.

                                     BOBBY
                         You think they'll ever find him?

                                     KLAATU
                              (alter a moment's 
                              pause)
                         I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to 
                         doubt it.

                                     BOBBY
                              (as they continue 
                              walking)
                         Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity 
                         mean?

                                     KLAATU
                              (preoccupied)
                         Velocity is the time rate of change 
                         of position.

               This explanation misses Bobby by several light years. He 
               glances up at Klaatu blankly.

                                     BOBBY
                         I'll bet that's the way Professor 
                         Barnhardt talks.

               Pulled out of his reverie, Klaatu glances down at Bobby and 
               smiles apologetically. Bobby grins back at him. Then, as 
               they walk on a few more steps, Klaatu stops and speaks 
               thoughtfully.

                                     KLAATU
                         Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go 
                         see Professor Barnhardt and find out 
                         how he talks.

                                     BOBBY
                              (with a half-smile of 
                              accusation)
                         You're just kidding, aren't you?

                                     KLAATU
                         Wouldn't you like to meet him?

                                     BOBBY
                         Well, sure I would, but --
                              (he's to be not going 
                              taken in)
                         Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a private smile)
                         We can scare him more than he can 
                         scare us.

               Bobby stares up at him and his face breaks into a broad 
               admiring grin.

                                     BOBBY
                         I like you, Mr. Carpenter. You're a 
                         real screwball.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. BARNHARDT'S HOUSE - MED. SHOT - DAY

               The house is an unimposing old-fashioned structure, shouldered 
               on either side by similar one-family dwellings. There is a 
               flight of stone steps leading up to the entrance and a large 
               porch across the front of the house. Klaatu and Bobby walk 
               into scene and pause, Klaatu glances at Bobby and Bobby nods 
               toward the house. They move on up the steps to the entrance.

               MED. CHOOSE SHOT - AT FRONT DOOR

               Bobby, all eagerness and excitement, presses the bell. They 
               wait a moment and there is no answer.

                                     BOBBY
                              (disappointed at the 
                              thought)
                         Gee -- maybe he isn't home.

               Bobby wanders down the porch and looks into a window. 
               Fascinated by what he sees, he gestures to Klaatu.

                                     BOBBY
                         Betcha this is where he works--

               After a glance at the front door, Klaatu joins Bobby at the 
               window and looks in.

               FULL SHOT - BARNHARDT'S STUDY

               SHOOTING through the window, over the heads of Klaatu and 
               Bobby. The room is more of a workroom than a study. It is in 
               comfortably shabby disarray, with papers and books everywhere. 
               There's a battered old desk and a day bed. One wall is solid 
               bookshelves and on the other two are blackboards covered 
               with a fantastic array of complex equations, graphs and 
               diagrams.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               His attention has been caught by one of the blackboards and 
               he studies it with great interest and curiosity.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - SECTION OF BLACKBOARD

               It is covered with a particularly complicated series of 
               equations in a chalky scrawl, involving angles of vector, 
               Keplerian ellipses, etc. The final equations are unsolved; 
               they have no answers after the "equals" sign. Across are 
               little printed signs tacked to the blackboard reading: "Don't 
               erase!" and "Don't touch!"

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

               Bewildered, Bobby looks from the blackboard up at Klaatu. 
               Still studying the blackboard, Klaatu is shaking his head 
               and clucking his tonsure as one might at the attempts of a 
               child to solve a problem in arithmetic.

                                     BOBBY
                              (indicating the 
                              equations)
                         What does that mean?

                                     KLAATU
                         It's a problem in celestial mechanics.

                                     BOBBY
                         Bet he's the only one in the world 
                         knows the answer.

                                     KLAATU
                              (he shakes his head, 
                              smiling)
                         He doesn't know the answer. And he'll 
                         never get it that way.

               Bobby moves over to a pair of French doors beyond the window 
               and tries to peer in through the curtained doors. He absently 
               tries the doors and finds them locked. Then he turns away 
               with a disappointed but philosophical shrug.

                                     BOBBY
                         We probably couldn't get to see him 
                         even if he was home.

               As Bobby moves away from the doors dejectedly, Klaatu puts 
               his hand on the knob.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               He's watching Klaatu and his eyes widen at what he sees.

                                     BOBBY
                              (in complete surprise)
                         Hey -- where you going?

               CHOOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He has opened the door and is standing in the doorway, his 
               hand, still on the knob. He is smiling at Bobby with secret 
               amusement. He's got an idea.

                                     KLAATU
                         If he's that difficult to see, perhaps 
                         we ought to leave a calling card.

               Klaatu disappears into the study. Amazed, Bobby follows.

               INT. BARNHARDT'S STUDY

               Bobby watches as Klaatu walks to the blackboard and picks up 
               a piece of chalk. As though correcting a schoolboy's work, 
               he makes large check marks at several points in each equation.

               EXT. PORCH - BARNHARDT'S HOUSE

               An efficient-looking middle-aged woman is mounting the steps 
               to the entrance, getting her front door key out of her purse, 
               when her eye falls on the French doors, which are standing 
               ajar. Puzzled, she starts down the porch toward the doors. 
               This woman is Barnhardt's secretary and her name is HILDA.

               Bobby is watching as Klaatu writes across the blackboard in 
               a bold hand: Differentiate the equation ( ).

               Klaatu underlines this comment with a sharp stroke, when a 
               stern voice is heard off screen.

                                     HILDA'S VOICE
                         What are you doing in here?

               FULL SHOT

               as Klaatu and Bobby turn in surprise. Standing in the open 
               French doors is Hilda, eyeing them with stern suspicion.

                                     HILDA
                              (outraged by Klaatu's 
                              desecration of the 
                              sacred blackboard)
                         How dare you write on that blackboard!
                              (Klaatu eyes her mildly)
                         Do you realize the Professor has 
                         been working on that problem for 
                         weeks?

                                     KLAATU
                              (pleasantly)
                         He'll catch on to it in no time now.

                                     HILDA
                              (controlling herself 
                              with an effort)
                         How did you get in here? And what do 
                         you want?

                                     KLAATU
                         We came to see Professor Barnhardt.

                                     HILDA
                         Well, he's not here. And he won't be 
                         back till this evening.
                              (sternly)
                         I think you'd better leave now. 
                         Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk 
                         and scribbles something on a scratch 
                         pad. He tears off the piece of paper 
                         and hands it to Hilda.

                                     KLAATU
                         You might keep this.
                              (with easy assurance)
                         I think the professor will want to 
                         get in touch with me.

               With a polite nod he goes out the French doors, followed by 
               Bobby. Hilda eyes the door for a moment, then glances down 
               at the paper in her hand, disturbed and puzzled by this 
               stranger. Her glance wanders to the blackboard and she picks 
               up an eraser, debating whether to erase Klaatu's corrections. 
               At that moment the French door opens and Klaatu sticks his 
               head in. Startled, Hilda drops the eraser.

                                     KLAATU
                              (pointing to the 
                              blackboard)
                         I wouldn't erase that. The Professor 
                         needs it very badly.

               And he disappears, leaving Hilda to glare after him in 
               impotent rage. Deciding that this man is either a crackpot 
               or a menace, she goes to the telephone on the desk and starts 
               dialing a number.

               EXT. BARNHARDT'S HOUSE - MED. SHOT

               as Klaatu and Bobby come down the steps and turn into the 
               sidewalk. They are talking and laughing together, but we 
               can't hear their conversation. CAMERA PANS with them as they 
               move on up the sidewalk, revealing two kids playing hopscotch. 
               Klaatu watches, fascinated, as he walks by. Then, having 
               passed the kids, he tries the one-footed, then two-footed 
               hop that characterizes the game.

               INT. BARNHARDT'S STUDY

               Hilda is talking on the phone.

                                     HILDA
                         --no, Sergeant, there was no 
                         classified material around, but I 
                         have instructions to report anything 
                         unusual to the police... Yes -- I'm 
                         Professor Barnhardt's secretary.
                              (consulting the paper 
                              in her hand)
                         The man's name is Carpenter -- and 
                         he lives at 1615 St. Street, N.W... 
                         Yes, that's right--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - LONG SHOT - DAY

               Bobby and Klaatu come out of a wooded path into a section of 
               the cemetery where the myriad crosses seem to reach into 
               infinity. They pause for a moment, then Bobby leads the way 
               through one of the rows.

               EXT. ARLINGTON CEMETERY - CLOSE SHOT

               in one of the many rows are crosses that extend beyond CAMERA 
               RANGE. CAMERA MOVES IN on one of the crosses. It bears the 
               name LT. ROBERT BENSON.

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND B0BBY

               as they come into scene and look down at the grave.

                                     BOBBY
                         That's my father.
                              (Klaatu glances at 
                              the boy, then nods 
                              understandingly)
                         He was killed at a place called Anzio.

               Klaatu's glance roves out thoughtfully to the infinite rows 
               of crosses, and his eyes are sad as they return to Bobby.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. ARLINGTON CEMETERY - MED. SHOT - DAY

               Klaatu and Bobby are approaching a bench beside a pathway 
               overhung with trees. Bobby leads the way to the bench and 
               they sit down. Klaatu's eyes stray out to the myriad crosses.

                                     KLAATU
                              (Reflectively)
                         Did all these people die in wars?

                                     BOBBY
                              (somewhat surprised)
                         Sure. Didn't you ever hear of 
                         Arlington Cemetery?

                                     KLAATU
                         No -- I'm afraid not.

                                     BOBBY
                              (very serious)
                         Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to 
                         know about anything.

                                     KLAATU
                              (Amused)
                         I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been 
                         away for a long time. Very far away.

                                     BOBBY
                         Is it different where you've been?
                              (indicating the 
                              cemetery)
                         Don't they have places like this?

                                     KLAATU
                              (slowly)
                         They have cemeteries. But not like 
                         this one... You see, they don't have 
                         any wars.

               Bobby looks at him, puzzled and impressed by this 
               incomprehensible notion.

                                     BOBBY
                         Gee -- that's a good idea.

               His eyes are drawn subconsciously out to the rows of crosses. 
               Then he turns back to Klaatu with a slow-dawning look of 
               curiosity, and Klaatu deliberately changes the subject.

                                     KLAATU
                         What would you like to do this 
                         afternoon?

               After a moment Bobby's expression changes and he breaks into 
               a broad grin.

                                     BOBBY
                         Go to the movies.

                                     KLAATU
                         All right.

                                     BOBBY
                              (he didn't dare hope 
                              for this)
                         No foolin'? Will you?

                                     KLAATU
                         Certainly.
                              (then he hesitates)
                         Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to 
                         have money to go there?

               Bobby gives him a look of amazement, then grins, assuming 
               Klaatu was kidding and simply hasn't any money.

                                     BOBBY
                              (eagerly)
                         I've got some money. My mother gave 
                         me two dollars.

                                     KLAATU
                         No -- I want to take you to the 
                         movies.
                              (he takes some objects 
                              out of his pocket)
                         Do you think they'd accept these?

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU'S HAND

               Sparkling in his palm are eight or ten cut diamonds of various 
               sizes.

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

               The boy is staring at the stones in wide-eyed amazement.

                                     BOBBY
                         Gee -- those look like diamonds!

                                     KLAATU
                         Some places that's what people use 
                         for money. They're easy to carry -- 
                         and they don't wear out.

                                     BOBBY
                              (staring at them 
                              fascinated)
                         Bet they're worth about a million 
                         dollars.

                                     KLAATU
                         Would you give me your two dollars 
                         for a couple of them?

                                     BOBBY
                              (with a nervous, unsure 
                              smile)
                         Well, sure, but--

               The boy studies Klaatu's face to see if he's kidding. 
               Realizing that he's not, Bobby's face takes on a childishly 
               shrewd expression -- as though he were about to trade a 
               jackknife for an ocean liner.

                                     BOBBY
                              (slowly)
                         Okay.

               The boy takes out two dollar bills and offers them almost 
               challengingly. Klaatu takes the bills and hands Bobby two 
               good-sized Diamonds. They study their new acquisitions with 
               interest. Bobby looks up from his diamonds to steal a guilty 
               glance at Klaatu.

                                     BOBBY
                         Let's not say anything to my mother 
                         about this, Mr. Carpenter.

                                     KLAATU
                              (mildly curious)
                         Why not, Bobby?

                                     BOBBY
                              (gravely)
                         She doesn't like me to steal from 
                         people.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE STREET - MED. SHOT - NIGHT

               Shooting toward the curb as a police prowl car drives up and 
               stops in front of the boardinghouse. A Detective in 
               plainclothes gets out and gestures to the uniformed Driver 
               to pull up the street a way and wait. The Driver nods and 
               the car moves off as the Detective crosses the sidewalk to 
               the boardinghouse.

               EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE - MED. CLOSE SHOT

               As the Detective mounts the steps he glances through a window 
               into the living room. Klaatu can be seen reading to Bobby, 
               who is perched happily on the arm of Klaatu's chair. The 
               Detective moves to the front door ant rings the bell. There 
               is the sound of running feet and in a moment the door is 
               opened and Bobby appears.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Mr. Carpenter come home yet?

                                     BOBBY
                              (studying the man 
                              curiously)
                         Yeah -- he's right inside.

               INT. DOWNSTAIRS - BOARDINGHOUSE

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Tell him I'd like to see him.

                                     BOBBY
                              (calling out)
                         Mr. Carpenter--!
                              (to the Detective)
                         Come on in.

               The Detective steps inside and Bobby closes the door, as 
               Klaatu appears from the living room.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Your name Carpenter?

                                     KLAATU
                              (puzzled that anyone 
                              should know him)
                         Yes.
                              (then recalling, with 
                              a smile of 
                              satisfaction)
                         Oh -- I suppose Professor Barnhardt's 
                         looking far me.

                                     DETECTIVE
                              (dryly, with grim 
                              emphasis)
                         I been looking for you all afternoon.

               EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE STREET - MED. SHOT - NIGHT

               An inexpensive convertible -- a 1948 Ford, or Chevrolet -- 
               drives up and stops in front of the house. Helen and Tom are 
               in it.

               INT. CONVERTABLE - TW0 SHOT - HELEN AND TOM

               You get the feeling that Helen and Ton have spent a very 
               enjoyable day together and are reluctant to say goodnight. 
               Tom puts his arm around her and kisses her.

                                     HELEN
                              (fondly)
                         It was a wonderful day.

                                     TOM
                         You still haven't answered my 
                         question.

                                     HELEN
                              (warmly sincere)
                         You know how I feel, Tom. I just 
                         want to think it over.

                                     TOM
                         The boss is leaving for Chicago 
                         tomorrow. If I could tell him I was 
                         getting married -- with two dependents--

                                     HELEN
                              (smiling)
                         You're a good salesman -- but I've 
                         got to think about it.

                                     TOM
                         A good insurance salesman wouldn't 
                         give you time to think.

               With a smile and, a quick kiss, Helen gets out of the car.

                                     HELEN
                         'Night.

               MED. SHOT

               as Helen turns and hurries across the sidewalk to the house. 
               In the entrance she turns and waves to Tom. He waves back 
               and drives off slowly. Helen lets herself in with her key.

               INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL - BOARDINGHOUSE

               The Detective is putting on his hat and preparing to leave 
               with Klaatu as Helen enters. There is a moment of awkwardness 
               and confusion as she glances, puzzled, at the Detective. 
               Bobby runs to her and greets her excitedly.

                                     BOBBY
                         Hi Mom!

                                     HELEN
                         Hello, darling.
                              (she kisses Bobby, 
                              then turns 
                              questioningly to 
                              Klaatu and the 
                              Detective)
                         Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.

               Klaatu is uneasy but tries not to show it as he smiles in 
               greeting and introduces the Detective.

                                     KLAATU
                         Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.

                                     BOBBY
                              (Impressively)
                         Mr. Brady's a cop.

               Helen glances quickly at the Detective, then at Klaatu, 
               surprised and troubled. She turns to Bobby to cover her 
               confusion.

                                     HELEN
                              (to Bobby)
                         Did you have a nice day, dear?

                                     BOBBY
                              (enthusiastically)
                         Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, 
                         Mr. Carpenter?

                                     KLAATU
                         We certainly did.

                                     BOBBY
                         We went to the movies -- and we had 
                         ice cream cones -- and we went to 
                         see Daddy--

                                     HELEN
                              (moved and grateful, 
                              she's uneasy and 
                              concerned as she 
                              turns to Klaatu)
                         I don't know how to thank you.

                                     KLAATU
                         I enjoyed every minute of it.

                                     DETECTIVE
                              (with quiet insistence)
                         We better get goin', Mr. Carpenter.

               As Klaatu nods and prepares to follow him, Bobby speaks to 
               Klaatu.

                                     BOBBY
                         Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.

                                     KLAATU
                         We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, 
                         Bobby.

                                     BOBBY
                              (reluctantly)
                         Goodnight.

               Klaatu and the Detective nod to Helen and they go out. Helen 
               watches the door close with real concern, wondering why the 
               police want Klaatu and hoping he hasn't done anything wrong. 
               Still disturbed, she turns to lead Bobby upstairs.

                                     HELEN
                         Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.

                                     BOBBY
                              (he followers her, 
                              then hesitates)
                         Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have 
                         to go down to the police station?

                                     HELEN
                         I -- I don't know, dear... Perhaps 
                         there's some mistake.

               This satisfies him for the moment -- even though it doesn't 
               satisfy Helen. He is climbing the stairs beside her.

                                     BOBBY
                         We sure had fun today. We saw the 
                         space ship and we went to see 
                         Professor Barnhardt -- and--

                                     HELEN
                              (flashing him a 
                              puzzled, incredulous 
                              look)
                         Professor Barnhardt.

                                     BOBBY
                              (almost ignoring the 
                              interruption)
                         Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to 
                         school tomorrow?

                                     HELEN
                         Of course, dear.

                                     BOBBY
                         Aw, gee, Mom -- I had plans to play 
                         with Mr. Carpenter.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - FULL SHOT - NIGHT

               The place is crowded and there is a feeling of feverish but 
               well-ordered activity. Unidentified people who have been 
               picked up in the search for the space man are being screened 
               by the police. They are all men -- all between forty and 
               sixty years old -- and they are from all walks of life. A 
               series of desks have been arranged in a row, with signs over 
               them reading IDENTIFICATION. At each desk is a team of cops 
               and before each desk is a line of men waiting to be screened. 
               At the far end of the room Klaatu can be seen at the desk of 
               a Police Lieutenant, with the detective who picked him up.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               Shooting over the shoulders of two cops at one of the desks, 
               toward the line of people they are screening. A nondescript, 
               middle-aged vagrant stands before the desk as one of the 
               cops flips through a card file.

                                     FIRST COP
                              (to the cop beside 
                              him)
                         B.M. Alberts -- no prior arrests.

                                     SECOND COP
                              (to the vagrant)
                         No identification?
                              (the man shakes his 
                              head dully)
                         Send him over to G-2.

               The man is taken out of the line as CAMERA MOVES ON to the 
               next desk, with another pair of cops and another line. A 
               rather distinguished-looking business man is placing a sheaf 
               of identification cards and papers on the desk.

                                     BUSINESSMAN
                         My wife just arrived with my 
                         identification.

               One of the cops at the desk glances over the papers and nods 
               to the man.

                                     THIRD COP
                         That'll be all, Mr. Baxter. Sorry to 
                         bother you... Next.

               CAMERA MOVES ON to a third desk where a small, rat-faced man 
               is standing uneasily before the two cops, one of whom is 
               flipping through a card file.

                                     FOURTH COP
                         Cappo, John C?
                              (the man nods)
                         Two priors -- one for petty theft -- 
                         one for shoplifting.

                                     FIFTH COP
                              (waving the man away)
                         Okay, Jonny -- you can go.

                                     MAN
                              (with a nervous grin)
                         Sometimes a record comes in handy.
                              (and he moves off)

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT LIEUTENANT'S DESK

               A Detective Lieutenant in plain clothes is questioning Klaatu, 
               who stands beside the Detective who brought him in. The 
               Lieutenant is a rugged but dignified man about fifty, 
               intelligent and businesslike.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         The Professor's secretary says she 
                         found you in Barnhardt's room, making 
                         marks on his blackboard.

                                     KLAATU
                         I was only trying to be helpful. He 
                         was having difficulty with a problem.

               The Lieutenant exchanges a look with the Detective.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                              (sardonically)
                         Oh, I see. He was having trouble and 
                         you were helping him out.

                                     KLAATU
                              (pleasantly)
                         That's right.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                              (quietly sharp and 
                              accusing)
                         I suppose you know that Barnhardt 
                         does a lot of secret work for the 
                         Army.

                                     KLAATU
                         In this case the secret wouldn't be 
                         worth much. He doesn't know the answer 
                         himself.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                              (growing impatient)
                         But I suppose you know the answer.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a deprecating 
                              shrug)
                         It's really quite simple... The three-
                         body problem, you know.

               The lieutenant shifts in his chair, annoyed that he has to 
               deal with this madman. He glances at a report on his desk, 
               trying to control his impatience.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         Your name's Carpenter -- that right?
                              (Klaatu nods)
                         Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? 
                         Driver's license -- social security 
                         number?

                                     KLAATU
                         No -- I'm afraid not.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         Well, how do I know who you are?

                                     KLAATU
                              (secretly amused)
                         You don't.

               The Lieutenant is turning away in exasperation as a uniformed 
               cop comes into the scene.

                                     COP
                         Excuse me, Lieutenant --
                              (pointing offscene)
                         The Doc says this man needs treatment 
                         right away.

               MED. SHOT

               A man about forty-five, bloodied and badly beaten, is being 
               supported and half-carried by two policemen. A police doctor 
               is guiding them to a doorway, near which is a sign INFIRMARY. 
               The man is almost unconscious, incapable even of holding up 
               his head.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT LIEUTENANT'S DESK

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         What's the story?

                                     COP
                         Some fella caught him lookin' in a 
                         window and figured he was the space 
                         man. The whole neighborhood went 
                         crazy and they ganged up on him. 
                         Would have killed him if we hadn't 
                         come along... Turns out he was just 
                         a prowler.

               The Lieutenant grimaces his disgust and impatience with mob 
               violence.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         Okay -- book him and get him fixed 
                         up.
                              (the cops nods and 
                              goes, and the 
                              Lieutenant growls as 
                              he turns back to 
                              Klaatu and the 
                              Detective)
                         Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.

                                     KLAATU
                              (appalled by what he 
                              has seen and heard)
                         They would have killed this man?

                                     LIEUTENANT
                              (gruffly)
                         People get hysterical enough, they 
                         do anything.
                              (impatiently)
                         Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't 
                         identify yourself, I got to send you 
                         over to the Army.

                                     KLAATU
                              (pretending impatience, 
                              but actually growing 
                              concerned)
                         How long will that take?

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         They can tell right away. They've 
                         got a couple of doctors who saw this 
                         man in the hospital.
                              (to the Detective)
                         Take him over to G2.

               Really concerned now, Klaatu tries to find a way out. He 
               attempts an authoritative air.

                                     KLAATU
                         It's very important, Lieutenant, 
                         that I see Professor Barnhardt.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Come on, Mr. Carpenter--

               Shaking off the Detective's hand, Klaatu speaks to the 
               Lieutenant.

                                     KLAATU
                         May I suggest that you call the 
                         Professor?

                                     LIEUTENANT
                              (all patience gone)
                         Get going, will you, Brady -- before 
                         I get mad!

               The Detective takes Klaatu's arm and leads him toward the 
               door. As they go they pass a Military Police Captain, who 
               makes his way straight to the Lieutenant's desk.

               EXT. POLICE STATION - TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND DETECTIVE

               as they come out of the station. Klaatu hesitates a moment, 
               looks around. His face reveals nothing, but he seems to be 
               momentarily considering the idea of making a break. The 
               Detective, sensitive to such a possibility, hooks his arm 
               under Klaatu's and nods his head toward the sidewalk in silent 
               command. Klaatu allows himself to be led off.

               MED. SHOT

               as the Detective leads Klaatu across the sidewalk to the 
               curb, where a police car is standing. Parked just behind it 
               is an Army staff car.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - ENTRANCE TO POLICE STATION

               as the M.P. Captain appears in the entrance, accompanied by 
               the Police Lieutenant. They see Klaatu and the Detective 
               approaching the police car and hurry out of scene after them.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT POLICE CAR

                                     LIEUTENANT
                              (to the Detective)
                         Wait a minute, Brady--
                              (indicating orders in 
                              his hand)
                         The Captain here's got orders from 
                         General Cutler to take this man over 
                         to Professor Barnhardt.

                                     M.P. CAPTAIN
                              (to Klaatu firmly but 
                              respectfully)
                         Will you come with me, Sir?

               MED. SHOT

               as Klaatu gets out of the police car and the Captain escorts 
               him toward the staff car. Passing the Lieutenant, Klaatu 
               speaks with a polite smile, a smile that might be one of 
               mild triumph.

                                     KLAATU
                         Sorry to trouble you, Lieutenant.

               The Lieutenant reacts with impatient exasperation as the 
               Captain holds the staff car door open for Klaatu, who steps 
               into the Army vehicle, as we--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. HALLWAY - BARNHARDT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               as the M.P. Captain and Klaatu enter the front door, which 
               is held open for then by Hilda. She gestures them toward the 
               half-open door of Barnhardt's study, where Barnhardt can be 
               seen puzzling over the problem on the blackboard. The Captain 
               knocks on the open door to attract his attention and enters 
               with Klaatu.

               INT. BARNHARDT'S STUDY

               Barnhardt turns from his deep preoccupation at the blackboard, 
               chalk in hand.

                                     M.P. CAPTAIN
                         This is the man you wanted to see, 
                         Professor.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (studying Klaatu 
                              curiously)
                         Thank you, Captain.

                                     M.P. CAPTAIN
                         I'll wait outside.

               He steps out into the hall, closing the door. Barnhardt 
               continues to study Klaatu for a moment, then points to the 
               notations he made on the blackboard. There is a controlled 
               but anxious excitement in Barnhardt's attitude.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         You wrote this?

                                     KLAATU
                              (nodding easily)
                         It was a clumsy way to introduce 
                         myself -- but I understand you're a 
                         difficult man to see.
                              (glancing at the 
                              blackboard 
                              reproachfully)
                         I thought you'd have the solution by 
                         this time.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Not yet. That's why I wanted to see 
                         you.

               Klaatu glances at the work Barnhardt has been doing on the 
               board. Then he points to one of the expressions in an 
               equation.

                                     KLAATU
                         All you have to do now is substitute 
                         this expression--
                              (pointing to a specific 
                              place)
                         --at this point.

               Impressed and interested, Barnhardt tugs at his chin as he 
               studies and weighs the results.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (slowly, thoughtfully)
                         Yes -- that will reproduce the first-
                         order terms. But what about the effect 
                         of the other terms?

                                     KLAATU
                         Almost negligible... With variation 
                         of parameters, this is the answer.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         How can you be so sure? Have you 
                         tested this theory?

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a slight smile)
                         I find it works well enough to get 
                         me from one planet to another.
                              (Barnhardt stares at 
                              him blankly)
                         I understand you've called a meeting 
                         to study our space ship.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         As though unsure of what he's heard) 
                         Yes -- yes, I have.

                                     KLAATU
                         My name is Klaatu.
                              (noting that 
                              Barnhardt's expression 
                              is changing from 
                              amazement to 
                              incredulity)
                         I spent two days at your Walter Reed 
                         Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name 
                         was Major White -- and I had a very 
                         attractive nurse called Ruth, who's 
                         getting married next Wednesday.
                              (Klaatu waits for 
                              this to sink in, 
                              then speaks with 
                              quiet authority)
                         If you are not interested -- or if 
                         you intend to turn me over to your 
                         Army -- we needn't waste any more 
                         time.

               Barnhardt hesitates for a long, thoughtful moment. Then he 
               goes to the door, opens it and speaks to the Captain outside.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (to the Captain, his 
                              voice a little 
                              unsteady)
                         You can go now, Captain. Please thank 
                         General Cutler and tell him -- tell 
                         him that I know this gentleman.

               Barnhardt closes the door and turns to find Klaatu watching 
               him with a faint smile. Barnhardt sinks into a chair, trying 
               to adjust his mind.

                                     KLAATU
                              (dryly)
                         You have faith, Professor Barnhardt

                                     BARNHARDT
                         It isn't faith that makes good 
                         science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.
                              (unable to conceal 
                              his interest)
                         Sit down, please. I have several 
                         thousand questions to ask you.

                                     KLAATU
                              (ignoring the 
                              invitation)
                         I would like to explain something of 
                         my mission here.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         That was my first question.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with some bitterness)
                         It was my intention to discuss this 
                         officially -- with all the nations 
                         of the Earth -- but I was not allowed 
                         the Opportunity. I have come to 
                         realize since that your mutual fears 
                         and suspicions are merely the normal 
                         reactions of a primitive society.
                              (gathering his thoughts)
                         We know from scientific observation 
                         that you have discovered a rudimentary 
                         kind of atomic energy. We also know 
                         that you are experimenting with 
                         rockets.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Yes -- that is true.

                                     KLAATU
                         In the hands of a mature civilization, 
                         these would not be considered weapons 
                         of aggression. But in the hands of 
                         your people--
                              (he shrugs and shakes 
                              his head)
                         We've observed your aggressive 
                         tendencies, and we don't trust you 
                         with such power.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (puzzled)
                         If you mean that you are afraid of 
                         us--

                                     KLAATU
                              (with cool impressive 
                              emphasis)
                         We want to be sure you don't make -- 
                         let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. 
                         We know the potentiality of these 
                         developments and we are disturbed to 
                         find them in the hands of children... 
                         You see, we've had atomic energy for 
                         five thousand of your years.
                              (indicating the 
                              telephone)
                         We discarded instruments like this 
                         many centuries ago.
                              (he paces thoughtfully)
                         So long as you were limited to 
                         fighting among yourselves -- with 
                         your primitive tanks and planes -- 
                         we were unconcerned. But soon you 
                         will apply atomic energy to space 
                         ships -- and then you become a threat 
                         to the peace and security of other 
                         planets. That, of course, we cannot 
                         tolerate.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (thoughtful and 
                              impressed)
                         These other planets -- do they have 
                         peace and security?

                                     KLAATU
                         We had our atomic wars -- thousands 
                         of years ago.
                              (he smiles wryly)
                         After that we fought with bows and 
                         arrows. Then, slowly, we learned 
                         that fighting is no solution -- that 
                         aggression leads to chaos.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (with deep conviction)
                         We scientists understand this. Even 
                         we primitive scientists.
                              (Straightforwardly)
                         What exactly is the nature of your 
                         mission, Mr. Klaatu?

                                     KLAATU
                         I came here to warn you that, by 
                         threatening danger, your planet faces 
                         danger -- very grave danger. I am 
                         prepared, however, to offer a 
                         solution.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Would you care to be more specific?

                                     KLAATU
                              (evenly)
                         What I have to say must be said to 
                         all concerned.
                              (with a suggestion of 
                              deference to Barnhardt)
                         It is too important to be entrusted 
                         to any individual.

               Barnhardt is forced reluctantly to accept Klaatu's refusal 
               to go any further. After a moment's thought, he speaks 
               seriously, but with a twinkle in his eye.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         I gather that your efforts on the 
                         official level were not entirely 
                         successful.

                                     KLAATU
                              (sternly, as this 
                              unpleasant episode 
                              is recalled)
                         I come to you as a last resort -- 
                         and I confess that my patience is 
                         wearing thin.
                              (with Jovian annoyance)
                         Must I take drastic action in order 
                         to get a hearing?

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (uneasily)
                         What -- what sort of action do you 
                         mean?

                                     KLAATU
                         Violent action -- since that seems 
                         to be the only thing you people 
                         understand.
                              (quietly)
                         Leveling the island of Manhattan, 
                         perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of 
                         Gibraltar into the sea.

               Barnhardt stands staring at him for a moment, passes his 
               hand across his brow. Then, as Klaatu watches, Barnhardt 
               paces the floor, trying to digest what he has heard. After a 
               moment, he turns to Klaatu.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Would you be willing to meet with 
                         the group of scientists I am calling 
                         together?. Perhaps you could explain 
                         your mission to them, and they in 
                         turn could present it to their various 
                         peoples.

                                     KLAATU
                              (quietly, evenly)
                         That's what I came to see you about.

               Barnhardt flings him a glance, then looks momentarily 
               sheepish. But his own eagerness carries him on. He paces the 
               floor thoughtfully.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         It is not enough to have men of 
                         science. We scientists are too easily 
                         ignored -- or misunderstood. We must 
                         get important men from every field. 
                         Educators -- philosophers -- church 
                         leaders -- men of vision and 
                         imagination -- the finest minds in 
                         the world.

                                     KLAATU
                         I leave that in your hands.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         You'd have no objection to revealing 
                         yourself at this meeting?

                                     KLAATU
                         No -- not at all.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         What about your personal safety in 
                         the meantime? What about the Army -- 
                         and the police?

                                     KLAATU
                         My name is Carpenter and I'm a very 
                         earthy character living in a 
                         respectable boarding house.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (smiling, but a little 
                              concerned)
                         I'm afraid I can't offer you any 
                         real protection. I have no influence 
                         in cases of inter-planetary 
                         conspiracy.

                                     KLAATU
                         I'm sure I'll be quite safe until 
                         the meeting.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (he suddenly pauses, 
                              thoughtfully)
                         One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this 
                         group should reject your proposals. 
                         What is the alternative?

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a sense of quiet, 
                              inescapable power)
                         I'm afraid you have no alternative. 
                         In such, a case the planet Earth 
                         would have to be--
                              (he looks for the 
                              right word)
                         --eliminated.

               The implications of this statement leave Barnhardt speechless, 
               his keen mind reeling.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Such power exists?

                                     KLAATU
                         I assure you such power exists.

               Barnhardt stands silent for a moment, trying to collect his 
               shattered thoughts. Klaatu watches him as he starts pacing 
               again.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         The people who came to the meeting 
                         must be made to realize this. They 
                         must understand what is at stake.
                              (after a thoughtful 
                              moment, he looks up)
                         You mentioned a demonstration of 
                         force--

                                     KLAATU
                         Yes.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Would such, a demonstration be 
                         possible before the meeting?

                                     KLAATU
                         Yes -- of course.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Something that would dramatize for 
                         them and for their people the 
                         seriousness of the situation. 
                         Something that would affect the entire 
                         planet.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a nod)
                         That can easily be arranged.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (frightened by his 
                              easy assumption of 
                              infinite power)
                         I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- 
                         or destroy anything.

                                     KLAATU
                              (easily)
                         Why don't you leave it to me? I'll 
                         think of something.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (with a nervous half-
                              smile)
                         Maybe a little demonstration.

                                     KLAATU
                              (thinking about it)
                         Something dramatic -- but not 
                         destructive.
                              (intellectually amused)
                         It's quite an interesting problem.
                              (Barnhardt nods vaguely)
                         Would day after tomorrow be all right? 
                         Say about noon?

               Klaatu's bland manner leaves Barnhardt shaken, almost wishing 
               he'd never started this business.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               INT. LIVING ROOM - BOARDINGHOUSE - NIGHT

               It is about 3:30 the following evening. Helen is sitting in 
               a chair leafing through a magazine. She is dressed to go 
               out. A corner of the dining room can be seen, where Mr. and 
               Mrs. Barley are playing cards with Mr. Krull. Mrs. Crockett, 
               the landlady, enters from the hall on her way to the dining 
               room and notices Helen.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                         Going out, dear?

                                     HELEN
                         Yes, I'm waiting for Tom to pick me 
                         up.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (with a shudder)
                         Personally, I won't go out after 
                         dark these days.
                              (with an attempt at 
                              slyness)
                         But then -- I'm not courting, am I?

               She turns to go on into the dining room and as she does so 
               almost bumps into Klaatu who is coming out, having been 
               kibitzing the card game.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (thoroughly startled)
                         Oh -- Mr. Carpenter--!

               Klaatu steps aside as she hurries nervously into the dining 
               room. He turns, puzzled, to find Helen watching with a slight 
               smile.

                                     KLAATU
                         Everyone seems so--
                              (he shakes his hands 
                              to indicate 
                              nervousness)

                                     HELEN
                         Jittery is the word.

               Helen watches him, a little uneasy in his presence. She is 
               fond of him, and she can't help being curious and concerned 
               about his brush with the police.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a contemplative 
                              smile)
                         Bobby's the only person I know who 
                         isn't -- Jittery.

                                     HELEN
                         He has his homework to keep him 
                         occupied.

                                     KLAATU
                              (fondly, sincerely)
                         He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.

                                     HELEN
                         Naturally I think so.

                                     KLAATU
                         Warm and friendly and intelligent--
                              (thoughtfully)
                         You know -- he's the only real friend 
                         I've made since I've been here.

               Helen is deeply moved by Klaatu's affection for the boy, She 
               tried to dismiss her curiosity about him, but she can't. She 
               decides to face it.

                                     HELEN
                              (hesitantly and with 
                              some difficulty)
                         Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my 
                         business, but -- why did that 
                         detective come here last night?

                                     KLAATU
                              (with easy frankness)
                         Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a 
                         few questions. Bobby and I tried to 
                         see Professor Barnhardt in the 
                         afternoon, but he wasn't in. 
                         Apparently they thought I was looking 
                         for secrets of some kind.

               Helen has reacted in puzzlement at this second mention of 
               Barnhardt. They are interrupted by the ringing of the 
               doorbell. Helen goes to answer it.

               INT. HALLWAY

               as Helen opens the front door to admit Tom. He appears 
               impatient, anxious to get going.

                                     HELEN
                         Hello--

                                     TOM
                         You ready?

                                     HELEN
                         I will be in just a minute.

                                     TOM
                              (a little annoyed 
                              that she hasn't her 
                              coat on, he consults 
                              his watch)
                         The picture starts at eight-fifty.

                                     HELEN
                              (in explanation)
                         I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.

                                     TOM
                              (lightly, but with 
                              real sarcasm 
                              underneath)
                         I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm 
                         intruding.

               Helen tries to shush him, to indicate Klaatu is in the next 
               room, when Klaatu appears in the doorway. He must have heard 
               Tom's remark, and there is an awkward moment. Klaatu is 
               completely unperturbed, but Helen is embarrassed.

                                     KLAATU
                         Excuse me. I was just going up to my 
                         room.

                                     HELEN
                              (guiltily)
                         Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.

               Klaatu stops and turns to face them pleasantly.

                                     KLAATU
                         Have a good time -- both of you.

               He goes on up the stairs. Helen steers Tom toward the living 
               room.

                                     HELEN
                         Why don't you wait in here while I 
                         get my things?

               INT. LIVING ROOM

               As they enter from the hall, Helen turns to Tom reproachfully.

                                     HELEN
                              (quietly)
                         Oh, Tom, that was awful.

                                     TOM
                              (momentary apologetic)
                         I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of 
                         hearing about Mr. Carpenter.
                              (Helen shushes him)
                         I don't like the way he's attached 
                         himself to you and Bobby. After all, 
                         what do you know about him?

               This touches on Helen's own private doubts, and she cannot 
               answer.

                                     HELEN
                         I'll go get my things.

               She turns quickly and goes into the hall and hurries up the 
               stairs. Tom looks after her, dismissing the matter with a 
               shake of the head and a philosophical sigh. Of such stuff 
               are women made.

               INT - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

               Helen reaches the top of the stairs, crosses to her room and 
               grabs a coat off the bed. She's putting it on as she moves 
               down the hall to Bobby's room, the door of which is open.

               INT. BOBBY'S ROOM

               Bobby is at a table doing his homework and Klaatu has just 
               finished explaining an arithmetic problem to him, as Helen 
               enters, still putting on her coat.

                                     KLAATU
                              (about to leave)
                         All you have to remember is, first 
                         find the common denominator -- then 
                         subtract.

                                     BOBBY
                         Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.

                                     KLAATU
                              (to Helen, pleasantly)
                         I'll say goodnight again.

               Helen is embarrassed. She would like to apologize for the 
               awkwardness downstairs but she doesn't quite know how to go 
               about it.

                                     HELEN
                         Mr. Carpenter, I--
                              (it's too complicated; 
                              she can't do it)
                         Goodnight.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a warm smile of 
                              complete understanding 
                              and appreciation)
                         Goodnight, my dear.

               He turns and goes out, closing the door. A little distracted, 
               Helen turns to Bobby.

                                     HELEN
                         Go to bed, darling. You can finish 
                         that in the morning.

                                     BOBBY
                         Okay.

               Helen watches as he starts to put away his work. She wants 
               to tell him something, but finds it difficult to say.

                                     HELEN
                              (hesitantly, almost 
                              guiltily)
                         Bobby -- I think it would be better 
                         if we didn't see quite so much of 
                         Mr. Carpenter

                                     BOBBY
                              (shocked, and 
                              bewildered)
                         Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... 
                         And he's awful good in arithmetic. 
                         He even helps Professor Barnhardt.

                                     HELEN
                         Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go 
                         to see Professor Barnhardt?

                                     BOBBY
                         Sure we did! He wasn't there but we 
                         went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter 
                         showed him how to do his arithmetic.

               Helen is surprised to get this corroboration for Klaatu's 
               story. Sensing his mother's uneasiness, the boy looks for 
               something intriguing -- some deep, dark secret.

                                     BOBBY
                              (shrewdly)
                         Mom -- is there something wrong with 
                         Mr. Carpenter?

                                     HELEN
                         What do you mean, dear?

                                     BOBBY
                         I mean -- on account of that policeman 
                         last night.
                              (his eyes light up 
                              hopefully)
                         You think he's a bank robber, maybe? 
                         Or a gangster?

                                     HELEN
                         No, dear, of course not. He's a very 
                         nice man. I Just think he might prefer 
                         to be left alone. Now you get to bed 
                         and forget about it.
                              (she kisses him)
                         'Night, darling.

               With a reassuring smile, she starts for the door.

                                     BOBBY
                         Goodnight.
                              (stopping her in the 
                              doorway, his 
                              imaginative suspicions 
                              mounting)
                         Hey Mom -- why would he want to be 
                         alone?

               Not wanting to go into this any further, Helen blows him a 
               kiss and backs out, closing the door. Bobby stands thinking 
               for a moment, his mind still speculating on all sorts of 
               wonderful possibilities. Still preoccupied, he drifts over 
               to his bed and sits down to take of his shoes. He drops the 
               first one to the floor and is starting on the other, when 
               there is a light rap on his door. The door opens and Klaatu 
               appears.

                                     KLAATU
                         Bobby -- have you a flashlight?

                                     BOBBY
                              (surprised by his 
                              appearance and his 
                              request)
                         Yeah -- sure.
                              (he goes to a drawer 
                              and gets a large 
                              hand flashlight)
                         It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.

               Bobby hands him the light, studying his face with eager 
               curiosity.

                                     BOBBY
                         What do you want it for, Mr. 
                         Carpenter?

                                     KLAATU
                              (evasively)
                         Why -- the light in my room went 
                         out.
                              (cutting off further 
                              questions)
                         Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.

               Klaatu goes out, closing the door behind him. Bobby hesitates 
               a moment, puzzled and curious. Then he goes over to the door, 
               flips off the lights, and slowly, noiselessly opens the door 
               a crack so he can peer out into the hall.

               MED. SHOT

               shooting down the hall through the crack in Bobby's door.

               Klaatu's door is ajar and through it the lights in his room 
               can be seen burning brightly. Klaatu goes to his door, reaches 
               in and flips off the lights and closes the door. He then 
               scans the hall in both directions. Satisfied he isn't seen, 
               he moves surreptitiously down the hall toward the stairs, 
               still carrying the flashlight.

               MED CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               as he closes his door carefully, an expression of intense 
               excitement on his face. What he has seem is certainly, 
               unmistakably suspicious. Why did Mr. Carpenter lie to him? 
               What does he want the flashlight for and where is he going? 
               Bobby decides he's got to find out. Hurriedly he laces on 
               the shoe he had taken off, and peers out the door to find 
               the hall clear. He slips out the door, closing it behind 
               him.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. STREET - MED. CLOSE SHOT - NIGHT

               Klaatu is walking down the dark, semi-deserted street with 
               the determined stride of a man with a definite objective.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               Half a block behind, he's following Klaatu, eagerly, flushed 
               with a sense of excitement and adventure.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER - NIGHT

               Walking along the sidewalk, Klaatu turns into a side street, 
               disappearing from view around the corner. In a moment, Bobby 
               hurries into scene breathlessly. He pulls up for a moment to 
               rest. Then, getting his breath, he dashes on around the corner 
               after Klaatu.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. LARGE TEMPORARY BUILDING - LONG SHOT - NIGHT

               This is a temporary structure that has been erected to enclose 
               the space ship and Gort. In front of the one small door are 
               two soldiers, standing guard. Concealed in some foreground 
               foliage, studying the layout, is Klaatu. Nearby 's a sign 
               reading: KEEP OUT! This area OFF LIMITS to the public. U.S. 
               ARMY.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               He is a short distance away, watching Klaatu eagerly.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               as he studies the situation.

               MED. SHOT

               shooting over Klaatu's shoulder. As he watches, a Jeep filled 
               with armed soldiers -- apparently regular patrol -- drives 
               up to the entrance of the building. They stop for a moment 
               while their Sergeant checks with the guards. Assured that 
               everything is under control, the Sergeant signals his driver 
               and the Jeep moves off.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               Scanning the side of the building, he sees what he's looking 
               for. Waiting until the Jeep disappears, he starts toward one 
               side of the building, keeping himself concealed in the 
               foliage.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               puzzled and interested, as he watches Klaatu.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               The two sentries standing in front of the building.

               MED. SHOT

               as Klaatu maneuvers around the side of the building, where 
               there is a window. It has no glass in it but is heavily 
               barred.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               as he leaves the concealing foliage and crosses the clear, 
               grassy area surrounding the building. He stops and tries to 
               see through the window.

               MED. SHOT - GORT

               shooting through the barred window into the building. The 
               huge robot looms large and eerie in the shadows cast by a 
               couple of naked work-lights. His head is angled, away from 
               the window.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               as Klaatu approaches the window. Aiming his flashlight at 
               Gort, he flashes the light intermittently, as though 
               signaling. (This should not approximate any known code.)

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               As we watch, the intermittent flashes of Klaatu's light appear 
               on the wall ahead of Gort. Slowly, evenly, the robot's head 
               turns to face the window.

               MED. SHOT

               from Gort's viewpoint, of the window, with Klaatu's light 
               flashing its signals.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               shooting on his back, as he finishes signaling and cuts off 
               the flashlight. He turns ant starts back for the concealment 
               of the foliage.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               craning his neck to look for Klaatu, who has eluded his view. 
               Suddenly he sees Klaatu again.

               MED. SHOT - KLAATU

               making his way behind the foliage toward the front of the 
               building. Arriving at a point opposite the entrance, Klaatu 
               waits and watches.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - ENTRANCE TO BUILDING

               The two guards are standing in the doorway in positions of 
               relaxed alertness. Suddenly, inside the building behind them, 
               the giant figure of Gort looms silently in the doorway. His 
               two great arms reach out, grab the two guards and drag then 
               back inside the building.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               He lets out an inaudible gasp as he sees this. Bug-eyed, he 
               glances quickly to the point where he last saw Klaatu. He is 
               amazed at what he sees.

               MED. SHOT

               from Bobby's viewpoint. Klaatu has emerged from the 
               concealment of the tree-lined path and is making his way 
               calmly toward the entrance of the building.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               As he watches Klaatu enter the building, his curiosity 
               conquers his fear and he starts tremblingly toward the 
               structure.

               INT. BUILDING - FULL SHOT

               as Klaatu enters. The huge shapes of the space ship and Gort 
               loom large and eerie. Klaatu starts across the barren 
               enclosure toward the ship.

               EXT. ENTRANCE TO BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT

               as Bobby approaches the door, fearful but fascinated. He 
               peers cautiously inside and his eyes grow wide as saucers.

               EXT. BUILDING - MED. SHOT

               In *f.g., near the door, the two guards lie unconscious. As 
               Klaatu walks toward the ship Gort slowly turns his head to 
               follow him with him with eyes. Klaatu touches a point on the 
               unbroken surface of the ship and the ramp silently swings 
               out and down to the ground. Klaatu mounts the ramp and 
               disappears inside the ship, whereupon the ramp silently 
               closes.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               as he watches this; his eyes bulging. He can scarcely believe 
               what he has seen. Suddenly a wave of sheer terror sweeps 
               over him. Scrambling to his feet, he turns and runs wildly 
               away.

               INT. SMALL CORRIDOR - SPACE SHIP

               CAMERA FOLLOWS Klaatu as he moves down the tiny, dimly lighted 
               entrance corridor. He steps into the main cabin of the ship 
               and flips a switch which bathes the cabin in a diffused, 
               shadowless light. The walls are lined with a complex of 
               mysterious gadgetry -- knobs, dials, indicators, etc. All of 
               this should be as imaginative and unorthodox as possible, 
               while still retaining a feeling of sound but highly advanced 
               engineering.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               as Klaatu moves to the communications panel, flipping switches 
               and turning dials. Indicators light up. There are crackling, 
               whirring and buzzing sounds. Klaatu starts speaking into a 
               built-in microphone in his own strange language. He speaks 
               in rapid-fire explanation, continuing to talk, as we--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BUILDING - MED. SHOT - NIGHT

               as Klaatu walks calmly away from the ship, past the two 
               unconscious guards and disappears out of the door.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT THE TWO GUARDS

               as one of them slowly regains consciousness. Looking around, 
               he sees the great figure of Gort and is terror-stricken. He 
               shakes his companion frantically in an effort to bring him 
               to.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. LIVING ROOM BOARDINGHOUSE NIGHT

               Bobby is curled up in a chair waiting for his mother to come 
               home. He's sleepy, but the excitement of what he has seen 
               precluded any such possibility. From the hall we hear the 
               front door opening as Helen and Tom come in.

                                     HELEN'S VOICE
                              (off scene)
                         Why don't you come on in for a minute?

               Helen and Tom appear in the doorway, Helen is startled to 
               see Bobby, who has Jumped up and run toward her.

                                     HELEN
                         Bobby--! What are you doing up at 
                         this hour?

                                     BOBBY
                              (excitedly)
                         I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had 
                         to tell you!

                                     HELEN
                         Tell me what?

                                     BOBBY
                              (the words tadpole 
                              out breathlessly)
                         I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right 
                         after you left -- and, gee, Mom, 
                         where do you think he went? Right 
                         into the space ship!

                                     HELEN
                              (patiently disbelieving)
                         Now, Bobby, just a minute--

                                     BOBBY
                         Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened 
                         up and he walked right in. And that 
                         great big iron man was moving around!

                                     HELEN
                         Bobby, you've been dreaming again.

                                     BOBBY
                              (desperately)
                         No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... 
                         I saw it!

               Helen and Tom exchange a glance of tolerant amusement.

                                     TOM
                         Where did you see all this, Bobby?

                                     BOBBY
                         On the lawn down at the mall -- in 
                         that place with the soldiers out 
                         front.

                                     TOM
                              (trying to trap him)
                         Where were the soldiers all this 
                         time?

                                     BOBBY
                         That robot fella grabbed 'em and 
                         dragged 'em inside!
                              (his lips trembling)
                         I like Mr. Carpenter -- but I'm 
                         scared, Mom.

               He rushes into Helen's arms, clutching her desperately, trying 
               to hold back his tears.

                                     HELEN
                              (holding him close to 
                              her sympathetically)
                         Mustn't be frightened, darling -- It 
                         was just a bad dream. Here -- we'll 
                         prove it to you.
                              (with a look and a 
                              nod to Tom)
                         Tom, will you ask Mr. Carpenter if 
                         he'll come down for a minute.
                              (Tom turns to go)
                         The room right opposite mine.

               Nodding, Tom disappears into the hall and up the stairs. 
               Still holding Bobby, Helen tries to dispel his fears by an 
               appeal to logic.

                                     HELEN
                         Now think back hard. You didn't follow 
                         Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You 
                         haven't even been out of the house.

                                     BOBBY
                         Yes, I have!

                                     HELEN
                              (determinedly)
                         You didn't really see the space ship. 
                         You just thought you did.

               Bitterly hurt, Bobby faces his mother gravely, accusingly.

                                     BOBBY
                         I'd never call you a liar.

               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MED. CLOSE SHOT

               Tom is knocking softly at Klaatu's door. Getting no answer, 
               he tries the door, pushes it open and peers in. Then he steps 
               into the darkened room.

               INT. KLAATU'S ROOM - FULL SHOT

               Tom snaps on the light and looks around the empty room. The 
               bed is still made. Glancing around, Tom's eye is caught by a 
               flash of something bright on the floor below the dresser. He 
               stoops down and picks up a fair-sized diamond. Tom studies 
               the stone curiously, holding it up to the light. Thoroughly 
               puzzled, he keeps the stone in his hand, switches off the 
               light and goes out.

               UPSTAIRS HALL - MED. SHOT

               Closing the door, Tom hurries along the hall and down the 
               stairs

               INT. LIVING ROOM - FULL SHOT

               Through the hall door Tom can be seen coming down the stairs. 
               Helen and Bobby watch expectantly as he enters.

                                     TOM
                         He's not there.
                              (crossing to Helen)
                         But look what I found in his room

                                     HELEN
                              (takes the stone and 
                              studies it, amazed 
                              by its size)
                         Is it real?

                                     TOM
                              (with the shrug of an 
                              amateur)
                         Looks real to me.

                                     BOBBY
                         Mr. Carpenter's got a lot of diamonds.
                              (he digs into his 
                              pocket)
                         He gave me a couple of them.

               Helen takes the two diamonds Bobby holds out in his hand, 
               looking at them in amazement.

                                     HELEN
                         He gave these to you?

                                     BOBBY
                              (guilty for his own 
                              sharp dealing)
                         Well, not exactly. I gave him two 
                         dollars.

                                     TOM
                         This doesn't make sense... I think 
                         the guy's a crook. I never did trust 
                         him.

               Helen tries to shush Tom, not wanting to re-stimulate Bobby's 
               imagination, but it's too late.

                                     BOBBY
                         Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a 
                         diamond smuggler?

                                     HELEN
                              (firmly)
                         Come on, darling -- we're going up 
                         to bed.

                                     TOM
                         I wonder if we ought to--

                                     HELEN
                              (cutting him off with 
                              a look)
                         Bobby and I have had enough excitement 
                         for tonight.

                                     TOM
                              (seriously concerned)
                         You think it's all right for you to 
                         stay here?

                                     HELEN
                              (nods reassuringly)
                         I've got a good lock on my door.
                              (smiling at Bobby)
                         And Bobby's going to sleep in my 
                         room tonight.

                                     BOBBY
                         Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?

                                     HELEN
                         Yes, dear. Come on now.
                              (she happens to look 
                              down at his feet. 
                              Puzzled, and 
                              concerned, she feels 
                              his shoes)
                         Bobby, your shoes are soaking!

                                     BOBBY
                              (reluctantly, with 
                              childish guilt)
                         Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.

               As the impact of this sinks in, Helen and Tom turn to stare 
               at each other in questioning consternation.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               INT. OFFICE - DEPT. OF COMMERCE BLDG. - MED. CLOSE SHOT DAY

               It is a typical government office, with lots of desks in it. 
               Helen is at her desk, straightening it up to go to lunch. 
               This done, she moves briskly to get her coat. CAMERA PANS to 
               follow her and suddenly, startlingly reveals Klaatu standing 
               near the clothes rack, as though he had materialized out of 
               thin air. Helen is thoroughly startled.

                                     HELEN
                              (unnerved)
                         Oh -- hello--

                                     KLAATU
                         May I see you for a minute?

                                     HELEN
                         I -- I was Just going to lunch.

                                     KLAATU
                              (quietly insistent)
                         May I walk out with you?

               She is nervous and uneasy but obviously can't refuse. The 
               telephone on her desk rings and Helen turns to answer it.

                                     HELEN
                              (into phone)
                         Mrs. Benson speaking.
                              (recognizing the voice, 
                              she glances nervously 
                              at Klaatu)
                         Oh, hello...

               INT. JEWELRY SHOP - MED. CLOSE SHOT

               It's a rather swank shop. Tom is standing at the counter 
               phoning. The Jeweler is behind the counter examining a stone 
               through his eyepiece.

                                     TOM
                              (into phone, cheerily)
                         I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal 
                         on that diamond. I thought we might 
                         have lunch together.

               INT. OFFICE - DEPT. OF COMMERCE - MED. CLOSE SHOT

                                     HELEN
                              (with a nervous glance 
                              at Klaatu)
                         I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right 
                         now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, 
                         that'll be fine. 'Bye.

               She hangs up and smiles uneasily as she rejoins Klaatu and 
               leads the way out into the corridor.

               INT. CORRIDOR - TWO SHOT

               CAMERA MOVES with Helen and Klaatu as they go down the 
               corridor. Klaatu's mood is one of quiet tension.

                                     KLAATU
                              (watching Helen's 
                              reaction)
                         I saw Bobby this morning before he 
                         went to school--

                                     HELEN
                              (glancing at him 
                              apprehensively)
                         Yes--?

                                     KLAATU
                         I want to know what he told you last 
                         night.

                                     HELEN
                              (nervous and evasive)
                         I -- I didn't really pay much 
                         attention--
                              (with a nervous little 
                              laugh)
                         Bobby has such an active imagination.

                                     KLAATU
                              (refusing to be put 
                              off)
                         Did you believe what he told you?
                              (Helen hesitates, 
                              trapped by uncertainty)
                         I have a reason for asking this -- a 
                         very important reason.

               MED. SHOT

               They are approaching the elevator at the end of the corridor. 
               There is a large crowd of lunch-goers milling around the 
               elevator, which is quickly filled. Half the crowd is left as 
               the elevator doors close and it descends.

               TWO SHOT - HELEN AND KLAATU

               Nervous and distracted, Helen doesn't want to get caught up 
               in this jam.

                                     HELEN
                         There's another elevator we can use--

               She nods toward a side corridor and starts for it, Klaatu 
               following.

               MED. SHOT

               CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they turn into the side corridor. 
               Helen leads the way to a small, automatic elevator. She 
               presses the button and the doors open. Klaatu follows her 
               in.

               INT. ELEVATOR

               As Helen presses the first floor button, the doors close and 
               the elevator starts down. She turns to face Klaatu.

                                     HELEN
                              (her nerves raw and 
                              edgy)
                         What is it you want?

                                     KLAATU
                         Before I ask you to be honest with 
                         me, perhaps I should be completely 
                         honest with you--

               Without warning the elevator comes to a jolting, jarring 
               stop as the power is cut off and the lights go out. The car 
               is illuminated faintly and eerily by light that seeps through 
               the ventilating grills from a skylight in the shaft. Helen 
               is terrified.

                                     HELEN
                              (gasping with fright)
                         What happened?

                                     KLAATU
                              (a moment's hesitation; 
                              then he remembers)
                         What time is it?

               Helen fumbles to get her wrist watch into a faint beam of 
               light.

                                     HELEN
                         Just twelve.

                                     KLAATU
                         We'll be stuck here for a little 
                         while -- about thirty minutes.

                                     HELEN
                              (preoccupied with her 
                              own thinking)
                         We could try pushing the other 
                         buttons.
                              (digging in her purse)
                         I have a flashlight in my purse.

                                     KLAATU
                         It won't work.

               Helen has the flashlight out and is snapping it on, but it 
               doesn't work. She looks up at him blankly.

                                     HELEN
                         Why not?

                                     KLAATU
                              (after a moment, 
                              quietly)
                         You see -- the electricity's been 
                         neutralized -- all over the world.

               The impact of this calm, quiet statement is shattering. Helen 
               stares at him awe-struck. Then she speaks numbly, almost 
               inaudibly.

                                     HELEN
                         Bobby was telling the truth -- wasn't 
                         he?

               Klaatu stares at her evenly, as we--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MED. SHOT - STREET

               All vehicular traffic in the street is at a dead stop. 
               Automobiles, busses, trolley cars -- all are stalled. Drivers 
               and passengers are climbing out of the vehicles in utter 
               bewilderment. Except for the people, it is as though the 
               street had been frozen in motion.

               INT. CITY POWER PLANT

               The great generators and dynamos are silent and motionless 
               in the dim, unlighted plant.

               INT. FACTORY

               A huge automobile or airplane assembly line, with nothing 
               moving, no machinery going.

               INT. PRESSROOM - METROPOLITAN NEWSPAPER

               The giant presses are threaded with newsprint, but they are 
               silent and motionless.

               INT. CONTROL ROOM - RADIO STATION

               A couple of engineers are working feverishly over a huge and 
               complicated control panel. They are working by the light of 
               two incongruous and ineffectual candles.

               INT. NEW YORK SUBWAY KIOSK

               People carne pouring up the stairs wildly, feverishly anxious 
               to escape the darkness below. Their eyes blink weakly in the 
               unaccustomed sunlight.

               EXT. SHOT - NEW YORK STREET

               Cars, taxis and busses are stalled, their frenzied drivers 
               unable to figure out what's happened. A junk peddler with a 
               broken-down horse and wagon moves grandly and leisurely 
               through the stalled vehicles. The peddler bears a happy grin 
               of superiority. This is his moment of triumph over modern 
               civilization.

               LONG SHOT - TIMES SQUARE

               with all traffic stalled.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - TIMES SQUARE

               of two cab drivers whose taxis have stalled beside each other 
               in traffic. One has gotten out of his cab. The other is seated 
               at his wheel, looking around in awe and terror, his tough 
               Manhattan heart shaken.

                                     CAB DRIVER
                         My ol' lady was right. We shoulda 
                         got a place in the country.

               LONG SHOT - PICCADILLY CIRCUS - DAY

               with all traffic stalled. (It is about 5:00 P.M.)

               TWO SHOT - TWO COCKNEYS

               standing on the sidewalk, awe-struck at the weird sight before 
               them. One of them speaks in terror, hardly daring to

               She is middle-aged and there are tears of fright in her eyes. 
               She is mumbling a prayer in French.

               INT. BARNHARDT'S STUDY - DAY

               Barnhardt is seated comfortably at his desk with a book on 
               his lap. He has been interrupted by the entrance of Hilda, 
               his secretary. At the moment she`s beside herself with 
               excitement. Barnhardt watches her with a half-smile of secret 
               amusement. He has already deduced the cause of what's 
               happening.

                                     HILDA
                         You should see it, Professor 
                         Barnhardt! You should go out and see 
                         it for yourself!

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.

                                     HILDA
                         The whole city has stopped. People 
                         are running around like ants!

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (musing admiringly on 
                              Klaatu's cleverness)
                         What a brilliant idea. I never would 
                         have thought of it.

               Hilda flings him a questioning look, annoyed that he won't 
               share her excitement.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         What about the people who are coming 
                         to the meeting tonight? Have they 
                         all arrived?

                                     HILDA
                              (nodding)
                         I talked to most of them this 
                         morning... They were all very curious 
                         about the meeting.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Good. Did you speak to our friend 
                         Mr. Carpenter?

                                     HILDA
                              (nodding)
                         He'll be there at 8:30.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (studying her for a 
                              moment)
                         Tell me, Hilda -- does all this 
                         frighten you -- does it make you 
                         feel insecure?

                                     HILDA
                         Yes, sir -- it certainly does!

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (nodding with a bland 
                              little smile)
                         That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.

               The poor woman flings him a look of shocked amazement as we--

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - PENTAGON BLDG. - DAY

               Seated at a conference table are high-ranking officers of 
               the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps. There is the 
               uneasy tension of people dealing with unknown forces. An 
               Army Major General, who's Chairman of the meeting, is 
               speaking.

                                     GENERAL
                         --as far as we can tell, all power's 
                         been cut off everywhere -- with a 
                         few exceptions: hospitals, planes in 
                         flight -- that sort of thing. I wish 
                         I could be more specific but, as you 
                         now, all communications are out 
                         telephone, radio, cable -- everything.
                              (gravely)
                         I can tell you that the President is 
                         prepared to declare a state of 
                         national emergency.
                              (pausing to let this 
                              sink in)
                         Before we start discussing plans, I 
                         want a report from Colonel Ryder. 
                         What about the robot, Colonel?

               Ryder is a Colonel of engineers, a man about forty-five.

                                     COLONEL RYDER
                         When it was discovered last night 
                         that the robot had moved, I was 
                         directed by the Joint Chiefs to find 
                         a means of immobilizing him. We 
                         accomplished that this morning by 
                         encasing him in a block of KL 93.
                              (he hands a small 
                              block of plastic to 
                              the General)
                         It's a new plastic material -- 
                         stronger than steel.

                                     GENERAL
                         Is it possible that he's broken out 
                         of this stuff?

                                     COLONEL
                         No, sir. I've Just checked on that. 
                         He's locked up tight as a drum.

                                     GENERAL
                         All right -- that means we concentrate 
                         on the man.
                              (to the group with 
                              force and authority)
                         Up till now we've agreed on the 
                         desirability of capturing this man 
                         alive. We can no longer afford to be 
                         so particular. We'll get him alive, 
                         if possible -- but we must get him!
                              (eyes the group sternly)
                         Is that clear?

               INT. JEWELRY SHOP - MED. CLOSE SHOT - TOM AND JEWELER

               The shop and its glittering display cases, which were 
               brilliantly lighted in the previous scene, are now gloomy 
               and dim. All artificial light is off. The Jeweler is a bright-
               eyed old man of seventy with a middle European accent. He is 
               completely fascinated as he examines the diamond Tom has 
               given him, and is annoyed by the lack of light. He speaks 
               impatiently to one of the girls in the shop who happens to 
               pass by.

                                     JEWELER
                         Eleanor, did you call the electrician?

                                     GIRL
                              (she's not too bright)
                         I tried, Mr. Bleeker. But the phone 
                         doesn't work, either.

                                     JEWELER
                              (absently, as he 
                              studies the stone)
                         Well, call the phone company.

                                     GIRL
                              (plaintively)
                         But the phone doesn't work.

               The Jeweler gives her a preoccupied glance of annoyance and 
               turns back to the stone.

                                     TOM
                         Is it worth anything?

                                     JEWELER
                         I have never seen such a stone. Will 
                         you please tell me where it came 
                         from?

                                     TOM
                         That's what I wanted you to tell me.

                                     JEWELER
                              (overwhelmed and 
                              absorbed by the stone, 
                              he shakes his head, 
                              bewildered)
                         There are no diamonds like this -- 
                         any place in the world.

               Impressed by the import of what the man is saying, Tom's 
               mind is racing wildly.

                                     TOM
                         You sure about that?

                                     JEWELER
                              (eagerly, shrewdly)
                         Would you like to sell it?

                                     TOM
                              (picking up the stone)
                         No -- no, thanks.

                                     JEWELER
                         I'd give you a very good price.

               Preoccupied with his own excited thoughts, Tom has already 
               started for the door.

               INT. ELEVATOR - TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND HELEN

               In the dim light of the stalled elevator, Klaatu is finishing 
               explaining to Helen the story of his mission. Overwhelmed by 
               the staggering import of what he has told her, Helen is 
               listening with great interest and concern.

                                     KLAATU
                              (speaking gravely)
                         --I've already told you more than I 
                         told Professor Barnhardt, because my 
                         life, in a sense, is in your hands. 
                         I thought if you knew the facts you'd 
                         appreciate the importance of my not 
                         being -- apprehended, -- before the 
                         meeting tonight.

               Helen is staring at him in awe, but also in complete 
               admiration and sympathy.

                                     HELEN
                         Yes, of course. Of course I do.

               Klaatu smiles at her warmly and she manages to return the 
               smile. Their relationship is further cemented by the sharing 
               of this vital secret.

                                     HELEN
                              (studying his face 
                              anxiously)
                         You hold great hope for this meeting.

                                     KLAATU
                         I can see no other hope for your 
                         planet. If the meeting should fail, 
                         then I'm afraid there is no hope.

               Suddenly and without warning, the elevator starts moving and 
               the lights go on. Startled, Helen looks at him.

                                     KLAATU
                              (calmly)
                         It must be twelve-thirty.

                                     HELEN
                              (looks at her watch, 
                              then back at him, 
                              awe-struck)
                         Yes -- Just exactly.

               STREET - MED. SHOT - DAY

               Showing a section of street traffic as it comes back to life. 
               From everywhere comes the sound of self-starters. Trolley 
               bells start clanging. Then automobile horns. People climb 
               back into there vehicles and traffic starts to move.

               SERIES OF CUTS

               of other streets, as the strident sounds of traffic build up 
               and normalcy is regained.

               INT. LOBBY - DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE BLDG - MED. SHOT - DAY

               as Helen and Klaatu come out of the elevator and start across 
               the lobby, CAMERA HOLDING ON THEM. Helen is preoccupied with 
               concern for Klaatu's safety.

                                     HELEN
                         Where are you going now?

                                     KLAATU
                         Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be 
                         safe there for the afternoon -- and 
                         I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the 
                         only other person who knows anything 
                         about--

               This recalls to Helen something she had forgotten and she 
               stops in sudden concern.

                                     HELEN
                         No, wait a minute -- there's someone

                         Who?

                                     HELEN
                         Tom... He was there last night when 
                         Bobby told me what he saw.

               The look of concern on Klaatu's face heightens Helen's 
               overwhelming fear and uncertainty.

                                     HELEN
                              (worriedly)
                         Of course, he doesn't know anything 
                         definite. He'd talk to me first, 
                         anyway, before--
                              (interrupting herself 
                              in sudden decision)
                         We can't take that chance. I'll get 
                         in touch with him right away and 
                         make sure.

               Helen turns and starts determinedly for the lobby door, 
               followed by Klaatu, as we--

               INT. TELEPHONE BOOTH

               Helen is nervous and worried as she speaks into the phone.

                                     HELEN
                              (into phone)
                         --But I've got to talk to him. It's 
                         terribly important. When is he coming 
                         back?

               INT. TOM'S OUTER OFFICE - CLOSE SHOT - SECRETARY

               Tom's secretary has not yet recovered from the shock of what 
               has happened to the world.

                                     SECRETARY
                         I don't know, Mrs. Benson. He left 
                         before noon -- before that awful 
                         electric business. I'm scared to 
                         death, Mrs. Benson. I -- No, he 
                         wouldn't tell me where he was gong. 
                         Said it was something personal.

                         Tell him I want to see him the minute 
                         he gets in... No, I'll call back.

               Helen hangs up, thoroughly worried and distraught now.

               their boarding their plane. The passengers mill about in 
               consternation as a voice is heard over a p.a. system.

               The Army has thrown a roadblock across a main highway on the 
               outskirts of the city and is permitting no one to leave. 
               From the line of halted cars we see and the insistent honking 
               of horns we hear, we get the impression of hundreds of cars 
               stacked up.

               INT. TOM'S OUTER OFFICE - FULL SHOT - DUSK

               It is 6:00 P.M. and growing dark outside, but the lights are 
               not on. The office is small and unpretentious, the business 
               habitat of a man who works in a big insurance agency. Tom's 
               secretary is on the phone, reflecting the world-wide terror 
               of the moment.

                                     SECRETARY
                              (into phone, nervous 
                              and jittery)
                         --Honest, Mary, I'm so scared I can't 
                         sit still. I'd like to run some place, 
                         but I don't know where to go--
                              (hearing the door 
                              open, she cuts off)
                         'Bye now.

               The corridor door opens and Tom enters with an air of urgency.

                                     TOM
                         Call the Pentagon and find out who's 
                         in charge of this space man business. 
                         Whoever it is I want to talk to him.

               The secretary has a reaction of surprise, but she manages to 
               stop Tom at his door. He has flipped on the lights in passing.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Mrs. Benson's been trying to get you 
                         all afternoon. She says it's 
                         important.

                                     TOM
                         Get this other call first.

               Tom disappears into his office, closing the door. The 
               secretary is getting out a telephone directory when the 
               corridor door opens and Helen enters, tense and nervous.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Oh, Mrs. Benson -- He just walked 
                         in.
                              (misery loves company)
                         Are you nervous, too?

                                     HELEN
                         Yes, I am, Margaret.

               The secretary buzzes the intercom and speaks into it.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Mrs. Benson is here.
                              (turning to Helen)
                         Go on in.

               Helen is starting for the door when it opens and Tom appears.

                                     HELEN
                         Tom -- I've been trying to get you 
                         all afternoon--

                                     TOM
                              (preoccupied with his 
                              own excitement)
                         Come on in.

               INT. TOM'S PRIVATE OFFICE - FULL SHOT

               as Tom follows Helen inside and closes the door. He turns to 
               her, his voice tense with excitement.

                                     TOM
                         I've got some terrific news about 
                         your friend, Mr. Carpenter.

                                     HELEN
                              (trying to appear 
                              calm)
                         What about him?

                                     TOM
                         Helen, he's the man from the space 
                         ship!
                              (she eyes him evenly, 
                              apprehensively, as 
                              he hurries on)
                         I had that diamond checked at three 
                         different places. Nobody on earth's 
                         ever seen a stone like that! After 
                         what Bobby told us, that's enough 
                         for me. Why is it nobody knows 
                         anything about him? Why hasn't he 
                         got any money?

                                     HELEN
                              (evenly, with quiet 
                              tension)
                         All right, Tom -- it's true. I know 
                         it's true.

                                     TOM
                         How do you know?

                                     HELEN
                         Never mind about that.
                              (urgently, with great 
                              concern)
                         You've got to promise me you won't 
                         say a word to anybody.

                                     TOM
                         Are you crazy? After what happened 
                         today?

                                     HELEN
                         You don't understand. You don't 
                         realize how important it is.

                                     TOM
                              (impatiently)
                         Important? Of course it's important. 
                         The point is we can do something 
                         about it.

                                     HELEN
                         That's what I'm trying to tell you. 
                         We mustn't do anything about it. 
                         Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm 
                         talking about.

                                     TOM
                              (irritated by her 
                              opposition)
                         He's a menace to the whole world! 
                         It's our duty to turn him in.

                                     HELEN
                              (desperately)
                         But he isn't a menace! He told me 
                         what he came here for.

                                     TOM
                              (dismissing this with 
                              annoyed contempt)
                         He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- 
                         just because you like the guy.
                              (busy with his own 
                              thoughts)
                         You realize what this'd mean for us? 
                         I'd be the biggest man in the country. 
                         I could write my own ticket.

                                     HELEN
                              (eyeing him coldly)
                         Is that what you're thinking about?

                                     TOM
                              (guiltily, defensive)
                         Why not? Somebody's got to get rid 
                         of him.

               They are interrupted by the sharp sound of the interoffice 
               buzzer.

                                     HELEN
                         I'm not going to let you do it, Tom.
                              (with deep personal 
                              urgency)
                         Believe me, this is literally the 
                         most important thing in the world.

               Tom picks up the phone and answers it.

                                     TOM
                              (into phone)
                         Yes?... What's his name, Margaret? 
                         General Cutler?
                              (disappointed that 
                              the connection isn't 
                              completed)
                         All right, I'll hold on.

               Realizing what he's doing, Helen crosses to him, pleading 
               wildly, desperately.

                                     HELEN
                         Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know 
                         what you're doing! It isn't just you 
                         and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the 
                         world, is involved!

                                     TOM
                              (exasperated)
                         I don't care about the rest of the 
                         world!

               It is as though he had slapped her across the face. Suddenly 
               he has revealed himself, naked and distasteful. Feeling guilty 
               as he sees the contempt and revulsion in her eyes, he tries 
               the old charm, holding his hand over the phone.

                                     TOM
                         You'll feel different when you see 
                         my picture in the papers.

                                     HELEN
                              (staring at him starkly)
                         I feel different right now.

                                     TOM
                              (uneasily)
                         You wait and see. You're going to 
                         marry a big hero!

                                     HELEN
                         I'm not going to marry anybody.

               She turns and runs quickly out of the room. Tom's inclination 
               is to follow her, when his connection is completed.

                                     TOM
                              (into phone)
                         Hello, General Cutler?
                              (irritated)
                         No, I don't want to speak to his 
                         aide. I want to speak to the General. 
                         Tell him it's about the space man... 
                         My name is Tom Stevens. S-t-e-v-e-n-
                         s.

               EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - MED. SHOT - DUSK

               Helen hurries out of the building, hails a cab, gets into it 
               and the cab drives off.

               INT. TOM'S OFFICE - CLOSE SHOT - TOM

               Tom now has General Cutler on the phone.

                                     TOM
                              (into phone)
                         That's right, General. That's where 
                         he's staying... Yes, of course I'm 
                         sure.

               INT. GENERAL CUTLER'S OFFICE - PENTAGON BLDG.

               The General is on the phone and is making notes. There are a 
               couple of officers standing near his desk, a Colonel and a 
               Lieutenant Colonel.

                                     GENERAL CUTLER
                              (after listening for 
                              a moment)
                         Thank you very much, Mr. Stevens. 
                         I'll want to talk to you further but 
                         I haven't time now.
                              (hangs up and turns 
                              to Colonel)
                         Deploy all Zone 5 units according to 
                         Plan B -- immediately.

               The Colonel nods and starts out of the room, as we--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. TAXI - MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN - NIGHT

               The cab is traveling through city traffic. Nervous and edgy, 
               Helen glances at her watch impatiently.

               EXT. STREET - MED. SHOT

               A jeep filled with armed soldiers is moving down the street 
               at a fast clip. Behind the jeep is an Army staff car.

               MED. CLOSE- SHOT - STAFF CAR

               shooting from outside into the car. In the front seat beside 
               the driver is a full Colonel, wearing helmet and side-arms. 
               The car is moving swiftly through traffic as the Colonel 
               speaks into the transmitter of a radio.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - COMMAND AND RECONNAISSANCE CAR

               It is filled with soldiers wearing helmets and carrying rifles 
               and Tommy guns. It is traveling quite fast. A soldier with a 
               handy-talkie transmits an order to the driver.

               MED. LONG SHOT - STREET

               The C. and R. car is seen to be at the head of a convoy of 
               eight Army vehicles which are moving swiftly down the street. 
               The trucks are filled with armed soldiers.

               MED. LONG SHOT - ANOTHER STREET

               On this street also an armed convoy is racing by, headed by 
               a Jeep mounting a .30 caliber machine gun.

               MED. LONG SHOT - ANOTHER STREET

               On this street also a convoy rolls by.

               EXT. STREET CORNER - MED. SHOT

               Helen's cab rounds the corner into the boardinghouse street. 
               CAMERA PANS with cab as it draws up in front of the 
               boardinghouse. The cab waits as Helen jumps out and runs up 
               the steps to the front door. A couple of children are playing 
               jump-rope in the light of a street lamp.

               EXT. MOVING - STAFF CAR - MED. CLOSE SHOT

               shooting in at the Colonel as he issues an order into the 
               radio.

               MED. SHOT - ARMY CONVOY

               CAMERA FOLLOWS the rear of the convoy as it races down a 
               main thoroughfare. As the convoy reaches each intersection, 
               the last vehicle peels off the column and, turns into the 
               side street.

               MED. SHOT ANOTHER CONVOY

               racing down another street, the rear vehicles peeling off at 
               the intersections as in previous scene.

               MED. SHOT - INTERSECTION

               Following one of the vehicles after it has peeled off into a 
               side street. It turns around in the side street and draws up 
               facing the intersection, its motor still running. We get the 
               impression of a methodical plan to block off each street.)

               EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE - MED. SHOT

               as Klaatu and Helen come hurrying down the steps and pile 
               into the waiting taxi. The kids playing Jump-rope stop and 
               watch as the door is closed and the cab pulls out, 
               disappearing as it makes a right turn at the end of the 
               street.

               EXT. STREET CORNER NEAR BOARDINGHOUSE - MED. SHOT

               (This is opposite end of street from last shot.) Barreling 
               across the intersection into the boardinghouse street is the 
               jeep followed by the Colonel's staff car.

               EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE STREET - MED. SHOT

               As the Jeep and staff car pull up in front of the boarding 
               house, the soldiers in the jeep pile out and cover the 
               entrance to the house. Meanwhile the Colonel, still in the 
               staff car, is talking to the two kids playing out front. 
               They chatter excitedly, pointing in the direction taken by 
               the cab.

               INT. STAFF CAB - CLOSE SHOT - COLONEL

               He speaks into his radio in tones of clipped and quiet 
               efficiency. The car remains standing at the curb.

                                     COLONEL
                              (into radio)

                         license number and report.

               INT. TAXI - FULL SHOT

               The cab 's moving through traffic at a normal speed. Klaatu 
               and Helen are tense and nervous.

               INT. TAXI - FULL SHOT

               The cab's moving through traffic at a normal speed. Klaatu 
               and Helen are tense and nervous.

                                     KLAATU
                         I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to 
                         hide me until the meeting.

                                     HELEN
                         Where is the meeting going to be?

                                     KLAATU
                         At the ship.

               CLOSE SHOT - CAB DRIVER

               as he looks out to his left, approaching an intersection.

               From driver's viewpoint. A C. and R. car is parked in the 
               side street, facing the intersection, its occupants armed 
               and helmeted.

               CLOSE SHOT - CAB DRIVER

               Abreast of the intersection now, he looks to his right.

               EXT. STREET INTERSECTION - MED. SHOT

               shooting over the rear of a jeep which is halted in a side 
               street facing the intersection. The cab crosses the 
               intersection and the jeep driver squints to catch its number. 
               Then he picks up his radio and speaks into the transmitter.

               INT. STAFF CAR - CLOSE SHOT - COLONEL

               (The car is still in front of the boardinghouse.) The Colonel 
               listens to his radio for a moment, then speaks into his 
               transmitter.

                                     COLONEL
                              (into radio)

                         of target vehicle is W 4936... All 
                         vehicles maintain your positions -- 
                         and hold your fire.

               INT. TAXI - MED. CLOSE SHOT

               shooting at the driver, over the shoulders of Klaatu and 
               Helen, as he turns and points out the Army vehicles to them 
               with a shrug of bewilderment. They look ahead at the 
               intersection they are approaching.

               CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               looking ahead out of her side of the cab, at the intersection.

               MED. SHOT - INTERSECTION

               from Helen's viewpoint. There is an Army vehicle waiting in 
               the side street.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               as he looks out of his side of the cab.

               MED. SHOT - INTERSECTION

               In this side street, too, an Army vehicle is standing.

               TWO SHOT - HELEN AND KLAATU

               Their eyes meet for a moment, neither willing to conjecture 
               what this might mean. The very quietness of the operation is 
               ominous and menacing. Their faces show grave concern.

               INT. STAFF CAR - CLOSE SHOT - COLONEL

                                     COLONEL
                              (into radio)
                         Attention, Zone 5 -- report when 
                         target vehicle passes your position.

               EXT. TAXI MED. CLOSE SHOT

               shooting through the window at Helen and Klaatu, who are 
               growing more tense and nervous.

               MED. SHOT - INTERSECTION

               shooting over the back of a jeep mounting a machine gun as 
               the cab passes the intersection. The driver picks up his 
               radio and reports into it.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - WEAPONS CARRIER

               shooting through the windshield as the driver reports by 
               radio, his eyes shifting to follow the moving cab.

               INT. TAXI - TWO SHOT - HELEN AND KLAATU

               Helen is biting her lips nervously. She steals a sidelong 
               glance at Klaatu to find him staring ahead, deeply preoccupied 
               and concerned.

                                     HELEN
                              (trying to give him 
                              encouragement)
                         It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.

                                     KLAATU
                         I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid 
                         of what he might do -- if anything 
                         should happen to me.

                                     HELEN
                         Gort?
                              (puzzled)
                         But he's a robot. I mean -- without 
                         you, what could he do?

                                     KLAATU
                              (slowly)
                         There's no limit to what he could 
                         do. He could destroy the Earth.
                              (with great urgency)
                         If anything should happen to me, you 
                         must go to Gort. You must give him 
                         this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." 
                         Please repeat that.

                                     HELEN
                              (shocked and 
                              bewildered, she 
                              repeats nervously)
                         "Klaatu barada nikto."

                                     KLAATU
                              (gravely)
                         Remember those words.

               Helen nods, repeating the words soundlessly.

               SERIES OF CUTS

               of vehicle drivers reporting by radio as their eyes follow 
               the progress of the taxi. (These should be shot so we don't 
               hear what is said.)

               CLOSE SHOT - COLONEL IN STAFF CAR

               listening to these reports. Then he speaks into his 
               transmitter with quiet tension.

                                     COLONEL
                              (into radio)
                         Attention, Zone 5... Section number 
                         2 -- block off Tenth Street at 
                         Massachusetts. All vehicles close 
                         in.

               The Colonel motions to his driver and the staff car pulls 
               out.

               EXT. STREET - MED. SHOT

               as a convoy of eight vehicles moves down the street going 
               very fast and swings around a corner.

               SERIES OF CUTS

               of individual vehicles that have been waiting at 
               intersections, as they pull out and down the main streets to 
               converge on the taxi.

               MED. SHOT

               at a major intersection, as the convoy of eight vehicles 
               previously seen dashes through the intersection and stops. 
               The cars quickly arrange themselves so that they form a 
               roadblock, completely sealing off the street.

               INT. TAXI

               shooting over the driver's shoulder. The cab is proceeding 
               down the street. When the road block comes into range of its 
               headlights. The driver, who has been getting uneasy, turns 
               to face his fares accusingly.

                                     DRIVER
                         Hey, what's this all about?

               As he slows his cab down, Helen leans forward into scene. 
               Frenzied, she is about to urge the driver on when Klaatu 
               puts a restraining hand on her shoulder.

               EXT. STREET - MED. SHOT

               shooting down the street from the barricade, as the taxi 
               stops. Army cars are closing in behind the taxi, so it is 
               trapped. The cab door ovens and Klaatu steps out, making a 
               run for the entrance to a pedestrian underpass.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - JEEP

               It is one of the lead vehicles in the group coming up behind 
               the taxi. It mounts a .30 caliber machine gun and, with the 
               Jeep still moving, the gunner fires a burst at Klaatu.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - RIFLEMAN

               He's on one of the vehicles that form the barricade. He takes 
               a bead on the running figure of Klaatu and fires.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He has almost reached the underpass. His hand is on the 
               railing when he slumps to the ground, badly hit. In a moment, 
               Helen rushes into scene, dropping down to hold Klaatu's head 
               in her arms. He looks up at her with a feeble smile. Then 
               his face takes on an expression of urgency.

                                     KLAATU
                              (weakly, insistently)
                         Get that message to Gort. Right away--

               Klaatu is unable to say any more. He is dead. Helen looks 
               around wildly, helplessly, with tears and terror in her eyes.

               MED. SHOT

               as the soldiers pile out of their vehicles and close in on 
               the place where Klaatu lies. He is their first and all-
               important concern, and Helen finds herself pushed out of the 
               way, toward the edge of the growing crowd of soldiers.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Shocked and, staggered by what's happened, she realizes she 
               must get to Gort. Taking advantage of the milling confusion 
               in the dark, she edges toward the pedestrian underpass until 
               she can slip into its entrance without being noticed. And 
               she disappears.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BUILDING ENCLOSING SPACE SHIP - MED. SHOT - GORT - 
               NIGHT

               In the eerie light of the huge building, the great robot 
               stands encased in a solid block of clear, transparent plastic. 
               As CAMERA MOVES IN slowly, we hear a low whirring sound, as 
               of power being generated. A faint glow, visible through the 
               plastic, emanates from Gort's body. His eyes, which seem to 
               express rage, shifts as though he were straining to break 
               out. As the whirring sound and the glow of Gort's body 
               increase in intensity, the sharp edges at the top of the ice-
               like block melt into roundness and the plastic starts to 
               drip away. (About 150 folding chairs are arranged on the 
               floor near the space ship for the meeting tonight.)

               EXT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - TWO SOLDIERS

               The whirring sound can be heard faintly from inside. The two 
               soldiers standing guard at the door hear the sound and listen 
               apprehensively. The two men exchange an uneasy glance. After 
               hesitating a moment, one of them decides to investigate. He 
               turns and goes inside the door.

               INT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE SOLDIER

               As he stops and looks up at the robot, his eyes go wide with 
               terror.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               Gort is an awesome and terrifying sight. His head is free 
               now and he seems to be straining against the plastic, which 
               is dripping down the sides of the block.

               CLOSE SHOT - SOLDIER

               He glances around nervously to see that his companion has 
               entered the building and is staring up at the robot, bug-
               eyed. Slowly the second soldier moves up beside the first. 
               Wordlessly, they bring their rifles up to the ready and click 
               them off safety. In spite of their terror, they advance slowly 
               toward the robot.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               The whirring sound is ominous and his body glows brightly. 
               And his eyes are fixed on the two advancing figures.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - TWO SOLDIERS

               as they move toward Gort.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               From inside him comes a new and terribly sharp crackling. 
               sound. And from his eyes two pencils of light dart out. After 
               a moment the crackling sound stops and the light goes off.

               REVERSE SHOT

               from same angle as scene before last. But the two soldiers 
               have utterly disappeared.

               FULL SHOT

               as Gort resumes breaking out of the plastic. There is no 
               sign of the two soldiers.

               EXT. MALL - MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN - NIGHT

               Hurrying along a footpath, nervous and distraught, she pauses 
               for a moment, looking at the entrance of the building. Then 
               she starts determinedly across the grass toward the entrance.

               MED. SHOT

               PANNING with Helen as she approaches the entrance fearfully. 
               Rallying all her courage and determination, she forces herself 
               to step inside.

               INT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               as she enters the huge, weirdly lighted building. She stops 
               short as her glance falls on the awesome figure of Gort. 
               Loneliness and terror grip her and she wants to run -- but 
               she realizes she can't.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT -GORT

               He has seen Helen and his flashing eyes bore into her. His 
               upper body and arms are free now, and the plastic is rapidly 
               melting away.

               CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               She is held fascinated by the robot's staring eyes. For 
               another moment it looks as if she would, break and run. But 
               she summons all her courage, and moves slowly toward Gort, 
               whose legs are still held captive.

               MED. SHOT - HELEN AND GORT

               as she moves slowly, fearfully toward him.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               The plastic is dripping off his legs now. With great effort, 
               he pulls his legs free and steps out of the stuff. A huge 
               figure in the heavy shadows, he moves slowly and menacingly 
               toward Helen.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               as she stops advancing, rooted to the spot in fear. Then she 
               starts backing away, keeping her eyes on him.

               MED. SHOT - HELEN AND GORT

               As the great, hulking figure approaches, Helen can't stand 
               her ground. She turns and runs wildly toward the far end of 
               the building. Gort follows her with unhurried, inescapable 
               strides. Unwittingly, Helen has run into a corner, and the 
               robot is closing in on her.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               Her eyes go wide with terror as she realizes she's trapped. 
               In a wild effort to run around him, she stumbles and falls 
               to the floor. Immobilized with fright, she lies breathless, 
               looking up at him. Then she gives a piercing scream.

               TWO SHOT - HELEN AND GORT

               as the great robot bends over her menacingly, arms 
               outstretched as though to grab or smash her.

               CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               All hope gone, she is blessed with a moment of lucidity, and 
               she remembers the message Klaatu told her to deliver.

                                     HELEN
                         Gort--!
                              (with desperate clarity)
                         Klaatu -- barada -- nikto.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               He pauses as he hears the words. His face doesn't change 
               expression, but the words obviously have an effect on him. 
               He hesitates thoughtfully for a moment.

               TWO SHOT - HELEN AND GORT

               Helen watches him in an agony of suspense. Then the robot 
               slowly bends down, picks her up in his arms and starts walking 
               toward the space ship.

               MED. SHOT

               PANNING with Gort as he carries Helen, speechless with fright, 
               to the side of the ship. He touches the side, and the ramp 
               moves slightly out. He mounts the ramp, still carrying Helen, 
               and disappears into the ship with her. And the ramp closes 
               silently behind them.

               INT. SMALL CORRIDOR - SPACE SHIP

               CAMERA FOLLOWS as Gort carries Helen through the dimly lighted 
               corridor into the main cabin, where he flips a switch that 
               lights up the cabin. The robot proceeds to a small door 
               leading off the main cabin and disappears with Helen inside 
               it.

               INT. SMALL CABIN - FULL SHOT

               This is revealed as a weirdly equipped laboratory, the walls 
               of which are lined with the most complex array of mechanical 
               and electronic apparatus. Gort sets Helen down on a stool 
               and indicates for her to stay there. Too terrified to move, 
               Helen watches as he busies himself with the apparatus. He 
               starts flipping switches and turning dials. As a result, 
               lights begin to flash and there's a strange series of 
               mechanical noises.

               CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               Unable to guess the reason for these preparations, she is 
               gripped with a terrible fear.

               FULL SHOT

               Ignoring Helen completely, Gort finishes his work. Then he 
               moves to the door and goes out, closing the door behind him. 
               Helen rushes to the door and searches frantically for the 
               knob -- only to find, to her terror, that there is none. 
               Frenziedly she beats on the solid metal door.

               EXT. SPACE SHIP - MED. SHOT

               as the ramp comes down and Gort steps out. With grim, 
               determined strides he starts toward the entrance of the 
               building as the ramp silently closes.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. POLICE PRECINCT STATION - NIGHT

               The Colonel who was in charge of Klaatu's apprehension is 
               speaking into a phone at the desk of the Police Sergeant. 
               Standing by are three or four Army officers, among them a 
               Captain and a Lieutenant.

                                     COLONEL
                              (into phone)
                         Yes, sir, we've got the body here 
                         now. Downstairs in a cell... No 
                         question about it, General -- he's 
                         dead all right... Yes, sir. Yes -- I 
                         understand.

               The General has apparently hung up and the Colonel does 
               likewise, turning to the officers in the room.

                                     COLONEL
                         General Cutler's coming down here 
                         right away.
                              (to the Lieutenant)
                         Take a squad of men, Lieutenant, and 
                         post a guard around that cell.
                              (to Captain)
                         Captain, don't let anyone in or out 
                         of the building.

               The two officers mutter their "yes, sirs" and start off about 
               their business.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               A squad of armed soldiers, led by the lieutenant, is admitted 
               to the corridor by a Police guard and they start marching 
               down the corridor toward a cell at the far end.

               INT. CELL - POLICE STATION

               This is a cell on the ground floor. In the far wall is a 
               heavily barred window, beyond which is as alley. In f.g. are 
               Klaatu's feet, stretched out on a crude table. As CAMERA 
               HOLDS, the huge figure of Gort appears outside the barred 
               window, Seeing Klaatu, he reaches up and yanks out the steel 
               bars as though they were chicken wire. With a crushing blow 
               of his knee he crumbles the brick and mortar below the window 
               and steps inside the cell. He moves without interruption 
               toward the body of Klaatu.

               INT. JAIL CORRIDOR

               Hearing the sounds of clattering metal and mortar, the 
               soldiers race down the corridor toward the cell.

               MED. SHOT

               shooting over the backs of the soldiers as they reach the 
               cell and look inside. There they see the giant robot picking 
               up the body of Klaatu and starting deliberately toward the 
               gaping hole in the side of the building. They raise their 
               weapons and fire at Gort, but the bullets have no effect on 
               him. Continuing uninterruptedly, he steps over the debris 
               and disappears, carrying Klaatu in his arms.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. SPACE SHIP BUILDING - MED. SHOT

               as Gort enters the empty building, still carrying the body 
               of Klaatu. CAMERA PANS with him as he strides over to the 
               ship. The ramp opens and Gort goes inside. Then the ramp 
               closes after him.

               INT. LABORATORY CABIN IN SPACE SHIP

               Alone in the cabin, Helen is still terrified. She looks up, 
               startled as the door opens and Gort enters, carrying Klaatu's 
               body over to a long counter. Once again he starts fiddling 
               with knobs, switches and dials. As Helen watches, speechless, 
               he starts to fasten strange-looking electrodes to Klaatu's 
               wrist and ankle.

               EXT. POLICE PRECINCT STATION - NIGHT

               shooting from the outside, near the front entrance to the 
               building, through a window into the main room where the Police 
               Sergeant's desk is. The Lieutenant who was ordered to guard 
               Klaatu's cell is excitedly reporting to the Colonel how Gort 
               broke in and took Klaatu's body. Considerably agitated, the 
               Colonel snaps orders to the other officers, glances at his 
               watch and motions for the Lieutenant to follow him. He and 
               the Lieutenant cross to the door and CAMERA PANS with them 
               as they come outside the building, hurry down the steps and 
               get into a staff car. Several other Army vehicles join the 
               staff car as it roars away from the curb.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. SPACE SHIP BUILDING - MED. SHOT - NIGHT

               A good many of the 150 chairs are filled, and more guests 
               are still arriving. There is no one to greet them at the 
               door, so they wander in and seat themselves.

               INT. LABORATORY IN SPACE SHIP

               Gort is still working over the body of Klaatu. From a socket 
               in the wall he pulls a strange-looking hypodermic needle on 
               the end of a cord or tube and gives Klaatu a shot in the 
               arm.

               CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               as she watches, fascinated in spite of her terror.

               FULL SHOT

               Gort fiddles with the dials again and there are electrical 
               cracklings and sputterings. Suddenly he flips a switch and 
               all sound ceases. Gort removes the electrodes and watches 
               Klaatu. CAMERA MOVES IN on Klaatu and we see him start to 
               breathe. In a moment his eyelids flutter. Then his eyes open 
               and he looks around.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               as Klaatu slowly lifts himself to a sitting position. Helen 
               watches breathlessly as he glances around the room, as though 
               to orient himself. Then he lowers his feet to the floor and 
               stands up. He blinks uncertainly, then smiles at them.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a grateful glance 
                              at Gort, he turns to 
                              Helen)
                         Hello.

                                     HELEN
                              (staring at him)
                         I -- I thought you were--

                                     KLAATU
                              (nodding, with a smile)
                         I was.

                                     HELEN
                              (looking at Gort in 
                              awe)
                         You mean he has the power of life 
                         and death?

                                     KLAATU
                         No -- that is a power reserved to 
                         the Almighty Spirit.

                                     KLAATU
                              (indicating the 
                              equipment Gort used)
                         This technique, in certain cases, 
                         can re-stimulate life for a limited 
                         period. It's a refinement of 
                         scientific principles known to your 
                         own people.

                                     HELEN
                              (concerned for him)
                         But how -- how long--?

                                     KLAATU
                         How long will I live?
                              (he shrugs)
                         That no one can say.

               Klaatu moves one of the sliding panels and reaches for a 
               suit of his "other world" clothing from behind the panel. 
               With a nod of apology, he steps behind the panel to change.

               EXT. BUILDING - MED. SHOT - NIGHT

               shooting from the door. In f.g. Barnhardt, who has just 
               arrived, is greeting several friends outside the door. In 
               b.g. a staff car and three or four other Army vehicles are 
               driving up.

               MED. SHOT - ARMY VEHICLES

               As the convoy pulls up to a halt in front of the building, 
               the Colonel hurries out of the staff car and moves over to 
               Barnhardt. Barnhardt is motioning his friends into the 
               building as the Colonel comes up to him.

               TWO SHOT - COLONEL AND BARNHARDT

               The Colonel speaks to Barnhardt with deference but with 
               unyielding authority.

                                     COLONEL
                         I'm sorry, Professor Barnhardt -- I 
                         have to ask you to call off this 
                         meeting.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Call it off? I... But I had permission 
                         from the Army--

                                     COLONEL
                         I know you did. But the robots on 
                         the loose now and it isn't safe around 
                         here. You'll have to get your friends 
                         out of that building.

               INT. SPACE SHIP - TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND HELEN

               as Klaatu steps out from behind the sliding panel where he 
               has changed into his "other world" tunic.

                                     KLAATU
                         Gort and I will be leaving soon.

               Helen is genuinely upset at the thought of his leaving and 
               the knowledge that he is to die. There is a compelling warmth 
               of feeling between these two.

                                     HELEN
                              (simply, sincerely)
                         We'll miss you very much -- Bobby 
                         and I.
                              (smiling to conceal 
                              her real feelings)
                         He won't have anyone to play with.

                                     KLAATU
                         He'll have you -- and Tom.

                                     HELEN
                              (quietly -- definitely)
                         No. That's all finished.

                                     KLAATU
                         I'm sorry.

                                     HELEN
                              (she is sensible and 
                              objective, but not 
                              unfeeling)
                         I think I'm very lucky. You don't 
                         always get a chance to recognize a 
                         mistake before you make it.

               Klaatu looks at her in warm, considered admiration. Then he 
               moves to one side of the cabin and flips a switch. Suddenly 
               an entire section of the side wall is made transparent. 
               Through it, as through a screen, we can see out into the 
               building. Most of the chairs are already occupied, and 
               latecomers are still moving in through the door. Facing the 
               group, on a little dais, is Barnhardt. As Klaatu and Helen 
               watch, Barnhardt raps for order and begins to speak. His 
               voice comes in the ship through a speaker.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Ladies and Gentlemen--

               INT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - BARNHARDT

               He addresses them gravely, with a note of terrible 
               disappointment in his voice.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         I called you from your work and from 
                         your homes all over the world because 
                         we were to meet here tonight with a 
                         man from another planet -- the man 
                         who came here in this ship.
                              (there are audible 
                              exclamations of 
                              surprise and 
                              disappointment)
                         As you all know, this is no longer 
                         possible. I can only say that I share 
                         the bitterness of your disappointment.

               INTERCUT with the above are group and individual shots of 
               the people in the meeting. They are the cream of Earth's 
               intellectuals -- scientists, churchmen, educators, leaders 
               of social and political thought. There are several women 
               among them. There are turbaned Indians, Chinese, Japanese, 
               several Negroes. All religions are represented. Every 
               important world power is represented.

               INT. MAIN CABIN - SPACE SHIP

               Klaatu and Helen are watching and listening, as the last 
               sentence of Barnhardt's speech above comes over the speaker. 
               Klaatu flips off the switch, which cuts off the view of the 
               meeting and also Barnhardt's voice. At this moment Gort moves 
               across the cabin and Klaatu speaks to him.

                                     KLAATU
                         Gort -- berengo.

               Gort moves off obediently.

               INT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - BARNHARDT

               Full of chagrin, he continues addressing the meeting.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         --under the circumstances, the Army 
                         people have asked us to leave the 
                         building. And, since their concern 
                         is for our safety, I can do nothing 
                         but suggest that we comply--

               Barnhardt is interrupted by the sudden and unexpected 
               appearance of the ramp, silently opening out of the side of 
               the space ship.

               MED. SHOT - BARNHARDT'S AUDIENCE

               as they react in startled amazement to the mysterious 
               appearance of the ramp. Then, as they watch, there is a sudden 
               gasp of terror.

               MED. SHOT - AT SHIP

               as Gort appears on the ramp and walks slowly down to the 
               ground. In a moment, Klaatu and Helen appear at the entrance 
               of the ship. Helen comes down the ramp to join Barnhardt, 
               while Klaatu remains at the head of the ramp.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT COLONEL AND SOLDIERS

               The Colonel stands near the door, flanked by a group of 
               soldiers, their rifles at the ready. The Colonel is startled 
               by what he sees. His eyes are on the revered figure of Klaatu 
               and he's debating what he should do.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He is a figure of intense dignity in his impressive otherworld 
               tunic. He stares with even defiance at the armed soldiers, 
               as though holding them off by sheer weight of his personality. 
               He turns to look out at the audience, which is held 
               spellbound. Then, after a breathless moment, he speaks.

                                     KLAATU
                              (straightforwardly, 
                              with almost stern 
                              authority)
                         I am leaving soon and you will forgive 
                         me if I speak bluntly.
                              (he pauses, studying 
                              the faces)
                         The Universe grows smaller every day -- 
                         and the threat of aggression by any 
                         group -- anywhere -- can no longer 
                         be tolerated.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - IN AUDIENCE

               of three of the delegates, listening intently. (These three 
               are from Russia, India and France.)

                                     KLAATU'S VOICE
                              (over scene)
                         There must be security for all -- or 
                         no one is secure... This does not 
                         mean giving up any freedom except 
                         the freedom to act irresponsibly.

               CLOSE SHOT - A DELEGATE

               He is an American.

                                     KLAATU'S VOICE
                              (over scene)
                         Your ancestors knew this when they 
                         made laws to govern themselves -- 
                         and hired policemen to enforce them.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

                                     KLAATU
                         We of the other planets have long 
                         accepted this principle. We have an 
                         organization for the mutual protection 
                         of all planets -- and for the complete 
                         elimination of aggression. A sort of 
                         United Nations on the Planetary 
                         level... The test of any such higher 
                         authority, of course, is the police 
                         force that supports it. For our 
                         policemen, we created a race of robots--
                              (indicating Gort)
                         Their function is to patrol the 
                         planets -- in space ships like this 
                         one -- and preserve the peace. In 
                         matters of aggression we have given 
                         them absolute power over us.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               emphasizing his great size and inscrutable expression. The 
               normal blinking of his piercing eyes as he gazes imperturbably 
               at the audience is his only movement.

                                     KLAATU'S VOICE
                              (over scene)
                         At the first sign of violence they 
                         act automatically against the 
                         aggressor. And the penalty for 
                         provoking their action is too terrible 
                         to risk.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

                                     KLAATU
                         The result is that we live in peace, 
                         without arms or armies, secure in 
                         the knowledge that we are free from 
                         aggression and war -- free to pursue 
                         more profitable enterprises.
                              (after a pause)
                         We do not pretend to have achieved 
                         perfection -- but we do have a system -- 
                         and it works.
                              (with straightforward 
                              candor)
                         I came here to give you the facts. 
                         It is no concern of ours how you run 
                         your own planet -- but if you threaten 
                         to extend your violence, this Earth 
                         of yours will be reduced to a burned-
                         out cinder.

               QUICK REACTION CUTS

               of four delegates, reflecting their stark terror and 
               bewilderment. And a cut of the Colonel and the soldiers, 
               impressed and held by what Klaatu is saying.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY as he concludes quietly, incisively.

                                     KLAATU
                         Your choice is simple. Join us and 
                         live in peace. Or pursue your present 
                         course -- and face obliteration.
                              (after a pause)
                         We will be waiting for your answer. 
                         decision rests with you.

               By the time he reads the last line, the CAMERA HAS MOVED 
               INTO a BIG HEAD CLOSEUP.

               MED. SHOT - THE DELEGATES

               CAMERA MOVES along a row of their faces, stunned and silent, 
               their minds unable to cope with the enormity of what they 
               have heard.

               MED. SHOT

               CAMERA MOVES IN on Klaatu as he is saying goodbye to Barnhardt 
               and Helen. He turns then and speaks to Gort, glancing up at 
               the building as he does so.

                                     KLAATU
                         Gort -- veracto.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               He looks up at the roof of the building, and once again we 
               hear the peculiar generating sound from within him.

               MED. LONG SHOT

               including the delegates, the space ship, everything that is 
               inside the building. As we watch, the roof and walls of the 
               temporary structure suddenly disintegrate as the tanks did 
               in the opening. The entire layout -- delegates, space ship 
               and all -- remain exactly as they were except that instead 
               of being under a roof they are out in the open Mall under a 
               starry sky. The area is ringed with the debris of the 
               building.

               MED. SHOT AT SHIP

               Klaatu is standing at the head of the ramp as Gort comes up 
               the ramp and disappears inside the ship. Klaatu is nodding 
               goodbye to Barnhardt and Helen.

               TWO SHOT - BARNHARDT AND HELEN

               as they wave to Klaatu. Barnhardt is moved and impressed, 
               and Helen's face shows her emotions at this strange parting.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He nods and smiles at them with warm affection. Then he turns 
               and disappears into the ship, and the ramp closes behind 
               him.

               MED. SHOT - THE SPACE SHIP

               From inside the ship comes the muffled roar of great power 
               generating -- not the sound of earthly motors, but of a 
               tremendous dynamo.

               MED. SHOT - THE DELEGATES

               watching breathless, stunned by what they have heard and 
               seen.

               MED. LONG SHOT - THE SHIP

               As the sound from inside it builds to a climax, the great 
               ship takes off with a tremendous roar.

               REACTION CUTS OF DELEGATES

               All are deeply moved and impressed. In the mind of each is 
               the burning question that Klaatu has posed for them.

               LONG SHOT - THE SHIP

               as it soars away into the inky blackness of the outer spaces 
               from which it came.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
"THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL"

                                    February 21, 1951

                

               EXT. BEACH - PACIFIC ISLAND - MED. SHOT - DAY

               Backgrounded by palm trees and rolling surf, an American 
               army radar operator sits at his huge instrument, intently 
               tracking a target. Without interrupting this, he speaks with 
               tense excitement into a telephone transmitter strapped to 
               his chest. (It is 8:00 a.m.)

               (In this and the subsequent scenes, music and cutting build 
               to an exciting crescendo).

               EXT. FIELD - HONG KONG - MED. SHOT - DAY

               A group of British soldiers, in shorts and tropical gear, 
               are gathered tensely around a piece of radar equipment, which 
               is tracking a target. The radar operator says something to 
               another soldier, who turns and speaks excitedly into a field 
               telephone. (It is 5:00 a.m.)

               INT. INDIAN RADIO STATION - NIGHT

               The microphone bears the word CALCUTTA. An Indian announcer, 
               his expression one of excitement and terror, jabbers into 
               the mike in a native tongue. A clock on the wall indicates 
               that it is 2:26

               EXT. RUSSIAN BOMBER IN FLIGHT - (STOCK) - NIGHT

               The plane is identified by a red star on the fuselage.

               INT. RUSSIAN BOMBER - NIGHT

               The radioman is tracking an object on his radar scope. He 
               points it out excitedly to the pilot. The pilot adjusts his 
               microphone and starts making a report back to his base in 
               Russian.

               EXT. FRENCH VILLAGE - STREET CORNER - MED. CLOSE SHOT - 
               NIGHT

               A group of French farmers is collected around a radio, 
               listening wide-eyed to the keyed-up voice which is telling 
               them, in French, of a strange object that has been seen in 
               the sky. They exchange uneasy glances. One old man crosses 
               himself.

               SPLIT SCREEN SHOT

               RIGHT SECTION OF SCREEN SHOWS INT. AMERICAN RADIO STATION - 
               DAY

               A breathless American radio reporter is speaking into his 
               mike, but we can't hear what he's saying. On the wall behind 
               him is a clock which reads 3:32.

               LEFT SECTION OF SCREEN SHOWS INT. BRITISH RADIO STATION - 
               NIGHT

               A clock shows the time to be 8:32. The British announcer 
               tries to maintain his traditional BBC calm, but finds it 
               almost impossible to control his excitement.

                                     BRITISH ANNOUNCER
                         Reports are coming in from all over 
                         the Empire -- from all over the world. 
                         The Government have not yet issued a 
                         statement, but there seems to be no 
                         question that there actually is a 
                         large, unidentified object circling 
                         the earth at incredible speed.

               This announcer keeps talking, but his voice fades out, and 
               now we hear the words the American announcer is saying...

                                     AMERICAN ANNOUNCER
                              (staccato with 
                              excitement)
                         We still don't know what it is or 
                         where it's from - but we do know 
                         there's something there. It's been 
                         tracked around the world by radar 
                         traveling at a rate of four thousand 
                         miles an hour.

               INT. NEW YORK TAXI - DRIVER AND FARE  DAY

               The driver and his fare are listening intently to the radio, 
               as we hear the voice of another radio reporter.

                                     2ND RADIO REPORTER
                              (voice off scene)
                         This is not another "flying saucer" 
                         scare. Scientists and military men 
                         have already agreed on that. Whatever 
                         this is -- it's something real.

               EXT. SUBURBAN GAS STATION

               The attendant, who is filling a car with gas, leans around 
               to hear the car's radio, oblivious to the fact that the car's 
               tank is overflowing.

                                     3RD RADIO REPORTER
                              (voice off scene)
                         We interrupt this program to give 
                         you a bulletin just received from 
                         one of our naval units at sea. "A 
                         large object, traveling at supersonic 
                         speed, is headed over the North 
                         Atlantic toward the east coast of 
                         the United States."

               Music builds to a climax and ends.

               INT. WASHINGTON RADIO STATION

                                     4TH RADIO REPORTER
                              (with deliberately 
                              controlled calm)
                         Here in the nation's capital, there 
                         is anxiety and concern, but no outward 
                         sign of panic. As a matter of fact, 
                         there are signs of normalcy that 
                         seem strangely out of place; the 
                         beautiful spring weather, the tourist 
                         crowds at the various monuments and 
                         public buildings...

               EXT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - LONG SHOT (STOCK)

               A small crowd of tourists is climbing the steps to the 
               columned entrance.

               EXT. WASHINGTON MONUMENT - LONG SHOT (STOCK)

               Under this shot a barely audible, distant hum is heard. It 
               grows in volume so imperceptibly in this and the next two 
               shots that we are unconscious of it.

               EXT. JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - LONG SHOT (STOCK)

               EXT. THE MALL - LONG SHOT

               Crowds are strolling on the Mall and across the well-kept 
               lawns in front of the Smithsonian Institution with the 
               leisurely, meandering quality that distinguishes sight-seers.

               MED. SHOT

               Including several small groups of people moving toward the 
               Smithsonian. Their attention is attracted as the hum off 
               scene becomes a roar. The sound is unearthly in its intensity 
               and almost unbearable in its swiftly increasing volume. The 
               people stop in their tracks and look up in the sky in terror.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               Several people on the steps of the Smithsonian have turned 
               to look. There is cold, frozen fear in their eyes. The awful 
               sound keeps increasing in volume.

               CLOSE SHOT

               A man, following the progress of a huge object in the sky 
               with his eyes. He is held terror-stricken.

               LONG SHOT INTO SKY (SERSEN SHOT)

               A giant shape, still at some distance, is approaching the 
               earth at incredible speed.

               LONG SHOT ON GROUND

               A group of people run wildly across a large expanse of lawn. 
               A huge shadow cast from above onto the grass seems to be 
               pursing them.

               LONG SHOT INTO SKY (SERSEN SHOT)

               The great shape is considerably nearer now.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Of a woman, thoroughly shaken, held immobile by what she 
               sees and hears.

               LONG SHOT

               People scatter madly in all directions as the huge spaceship 
               comes in for a landing on a smooth, grassy area. The 
               tremendous roar of its motors is suddenly cut off and the 
               great ship settles gently to a perfect landing.

               MED. SHOT - THE SHIP

               The gleaming surface of the ship shows no break of any kind -- 
               no windows, no ports, not even the outline of a hatch. It is 
               a fearsome, terrifying object, giving no evidence of its 
               source or its intention.

               LONG SHOT - (FROM PARALLEL)

               Shooting down on a section of lawn, showing the varying 
               reactions of people to the landing. Some are still running 
               madly away; others, singly and in little groups, stand as 
               though rooted, staring at the ship from a respectful distance.

               CLOSE SHOT - MAN

               As he stares at the ship with fascination and horror. He'd 
               like to run but he can't. His mouth twitches and he emits a 
               nervous little laugh.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               A woman is holding a two-year-old child by the hand as she 
               watches the ship, awe-struck. Several people run past them. 
               Suddenly the woman grabs up the child with a little sob, 
               turns and runs away.

               MED. SHOT

               A middle-aged man runs up to a group of several people, 
               pointing wildly toward the ship and yelling irrationally:

                                     MAN
                         They're here! They're here!

               He runs off toward another group as we--

               A series of short DISSOLVES showing:

               1. A man dashing up to a crowded Washington street corner 
               shouting wildly and gesticulating in the direction from which 
               he came.

               2. Policemen piling into squad cars, which roar out of their 
               garage.

               3. Soldiers rushing out of a barracks at Fort Myer, with 
               rifles and side arms, to form up on their company street.

               4. Newspaper presses rolling at high speed.

               5. Newscasters chattering excitedly into their microphones.

               6. A large telephone switchboard with the girls in a frenzy 
               of activity as they try to handle the calls pouring in.

               EXT. BASEBALL STADIUM - LONG SHOT

               The players are standing on the field in the crowded stadium, 
               but the game has been interrupted and everyone is listening 
               to the voice on the loudspeaker system. (Actual stock shot 
               would be coverage of some dedication or ceremonial.)

               INT. OFFICE - CLOSE SHOT

               A distinguished-looking government official speaks into the 
               phone with a sense of subdued urgency.

                                     GOVERNMENTAL OFFICIAL

                         I'm sorry -- you'll have to interrupt 
                         him.

               A nationally known news commentator -- for purposes of this 
               script let's say Drew Pearson -- is seated before a radio 
               mike. He is also being photographed by TV cameras. In a wall 
               near him is a TV screen which shows what is going out on the 
               air. During the ensuing speech, a man comes in a hands him a 
               sheaf of news bulletins.

                         of panic in several large Eastern 
                         cities. I am authorized to assure 
                         you that so far there is no reasonable 
                         cause for alarm. The rumors of 
                         invading armies and mass destruction 
                         are based on hysteria and are 
                         absolutely false. I repeat -- these 
                         rumors are absolutely false!

                         The ship, designed for travel outside 
                         the earth's atmosphere, landed in 
                         Washington today at 3:47 p.m., Eastern 
                         Standard Time. We still don't know 
                         where it came from, but I can reveal 
                         that military leaders are considering 
                         two possibilities; that it came from 
                         some unfriendly power here on earth -- 
                         or that it actually arrived from 
                         another planet.

                         The ship is resting exactly where it 
                         landed two hours ago, and there has 
                         been no sign of life from inside it.

               EXT. THE MALL - MED. SHOT

               Two platoons of infantry soldiers surround the ship, their 
               rifles at the ready.

                              (over scene)
                         Troops have been rushed from Fort 
                         Myer and they have formed a cordon 
                         around the ship.

               MED. SHOT

               showing two machine guns, two Sherman tanks and two 75MM 
               guns. The gun crews are posted for action and all weapons 
               are trained on the space ship.

                         They are supported by machine guns, 
                         tanks and artillery.

               MED. SHOT - POLICE CORDON

               Cops are holding back a section of a large crowd, some 
               distance away from the ship. The people are wide-eyed and 
               tense with excitement.

                              (over scene)
                         Behind police lines, there is a large 
                         crowd of curiosity seekers.

               SERIES OF INDIVIDUAL CUTS

               1. Civilians in the crowd, their eyes and nerves taut with 
               suspense.

               2. A young soldier, who grips his rifle and moistens his 
               lips nervously, his eyes never leaving the ship.

               3. A tank commander blinks from the tension of staring at an 
               unmoving object.

               4. The last cut is of the ship itself.

                         As you can see for yourself, the 
                         Army has taken every precaution to 
                         meet whatever the situation may 
                         require. Every eye -- every weapon -- 
                         is trained on the ship. It's been 
                         this way for two hours and the tension--

               CLOSE SHOT - PEARSON

               as he interrupts himself excitedly, his attention riveted on 
               the TV screen.

                                     PEARSON
                         Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen! 
                         I think I see something moving!

               EXT. THE MALL - MED. LONG SHOT - DAY

               We are at the actual location now, not looking at TV. We see 
               the ship surrounded by soldiers, two medium tanks, two 
               artillery pieces, and a couple of machine guns. Some distance 
               away is a suggestion of the crowd of civilians, held back by 
               police. Prominent in the scene are newsreel and television 
               cameras. OUR CAMERA MOVES IN to MED. SHOT. As it does so, we 
               see a couple of metal objects rising slowly from the top of 
               the ship. One, which is an oddly-designed coil of wire, slides 
               up and revolves slowly. The other is a section of vented 
               pipe with a convex cap on it.

               REVERSE ANGLE

               on the soldiers, their eyes glued to this first sign of 
               activity from the ship. They shift uneasily, gripping their 
               rifles more firmly.

               MED. SHOT - THE SHIP

               After a long, tense moment, a ramp appears silently out of 
               the side of the ship and slides down to the ground. There is 
               an audible gasp as a man appears at the top of the ramp. He 
               looks around at the crowd with cool and imperturbable dignity. 
               This is KLAATU. He is completely human in appearance. The 
               only unearthly thing about him is his clothing. He wears a 
               tunic that is very good looking, but at the same time 
               thoroughly comfortable and practical. On his head is a metal 
               helmet that obscures most of his face. (It would be impossible 
               to identify him later.) The design of this helmet gives the 
               impression that it is more a formal headdress than for 
               protection. Klaatu is above all an impressive man -- a man 
               of tremendous dignity and presence. He has the tolerant 
               superiority that comes with absolute knowledge.

               INDIVIDUAL REACTION CUTS

               of soldiers, people in the crowd, and policemen. The newsreel 
               and TV men are busy at their cameras.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               After an impressive moment, he raises his arms in the 
               universal gesture of neutrality. Then he speaks, in perfect 
               English, his voice amplified as though through an enunciator.

                                     KLAATU
                         We have come to visit you in peace -- 
                         and with good will.

               Klaatu walks slowly down the ramp toward the soldiers. As he 
               does so, he draws from inside his tunic a strange looking 
               object, longish and tubular. It might be a a telescope -- or 
               it might be some strange kind of weapon.

               MED. SHOT

               shooting from the side, showing Klaatu advancing slowly toward 
               the line of soldiers. He holds out the mysterious object in 
               front of him in a gesture that is actually one of offering 
               but could be misinterpreted as menacing. There is a growing, 
               uneasy rumble of muttering among the soldiers as Klaatu 
               advances. They are clearly frightened of what he may do.

               CLOSE SHOT - PLATOON LEADER

               A young second lieutenant, standing in front of his platoon. 
               As Klaatu advances, the lieutenant unslings his carbine.

               MED. SHOT

               Klaatu starts toward the platoon leader, raising the object 
               he holds toward the man, trying to make clear his intentions. 
               Misinterpreting this as a menacing gesture, the platoon leader 
               raises his carbine to his shoulder.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               of one of the tank commanders in the turret of his tank. He 
               is watching Klaatu advancing toward the platoon leader and 
               he has drawn his pistol. Convinced that the lieutenant is in 
               jeopardy, the tank commander aims at Klaatu and fires.

               MED. SHOT

               as Klaatu falls to the ground wounded. The object he was 
               holding has dropped from his hand and smashed. The soldiers 
               start to gather around Klaatu excitedly when suddenly there 
               appears in the entrance to the space ship a huge robot. There 
               is a gasp of amazement from the crowd and the solders draw 
               back at sight of him. The robot is ten feet tall, is made in 
               the almost-perfect image of a man. He is to be played by an 
               actor and his flesh appears to be made of a greenish metal. 
               His eyes flash as though lighted internally. His perfectly-
               fashioned, muscular body is covered only with a loincloth. 
               This is GORT.

               There are cries of amazement as Gort walks slowly ponderously, 
               down the ramp to the ground. As he does so, the ramp closes 
               behind him. Gort's face is, and always remains, utterly 
               expressionless. He stops to look at Klaatu, lying on the 
               ground. Then he looks around at the soldiers, the tanks and 
               guns. All the guns have been traversing to follow him.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               From inside him there comes an ominous crackling sound, as 
               though power were being generated within him. His eyes flash 
               toward the tank from which Klaatu was shot.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - TANK

               There is a great metallic clatter and the Sherman tank is 
               suddenly reduced to a pile of junk metal, its parts completely 
               disintegrated. Only a piece of tank track and twisted gun 
               barrel emerge from the heap on the ground to identify what 
               had been there. The tank's crew has remained unharmed.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               The crackling sound continues as his eyes start to sweep in 
               a semicircle taking in all the troops.

               MED. SHOT - THE TROOPS

               SHOOTING FROM BEHIND Gort, with the back of his head in f.g., 
               CAMERA PANS to follow Gort's sweeping gaze. In a growing 
               crash and clatter of metal, every weapon in sight is 
               destroyed. The two machine guns are little heaps of junk. 
               The 75's are larger heaps. The second tank, like the first, 
               is a three-foot pile of scrap. Rifles have dropped from the 
               soldier's hands and lie on the ground as little mounds of 
               wood and metal. None of the men has been harmed, but their 
               faces show the utter terror of what they have experienced.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - THE TROOPS

               as they react to the full shock of what has happened. Most 
               of them stand rooted to the ground. Several laugh 
               hysterically. A few break and run wildly.

               MED. SHOT - CROWD OF CIVILIANS

               Sudden pandemonium breaks out. Utterly terrified by what 
               they have witnessed, the crowd becomes a wild, milling, 
               screaming mob, concerned only with escape.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               He is walking slowly, deliberately, menacingly toward the 
               tank commander who fired on Klaatu. Standing by the debris 
               of his tank, the man is immobilized with terror. The robot 
               starts to reach out to grab him.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               lying on the ground. He speaks to Gort sharply, in a strange 
               language.

                                     KLAATU
                         Gort! Deglet ovrosco!

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               He pauses obediently in the act of reaching out for the tank 
               commander. Dropping his arms, he stands motionless and remains 
               that way.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He has raised himself to a sitting position on the ground, 
               his wounded shoulder giving him considerable pain. The two 
               platoon leaders come into scene hesitantly, badly shaken by 
               the awesome demonstration of power they have seen. They are 
               uncertain as to what they should do. The platoon leader eyes 
               the smashed object on the ground curiously and turns 
               questioningly to Klaatu. With great dignity, Klaatu picks up 
               the broken object, which we see well for the first time. It 
               is a delicately-made tubular telescope, badly smashed. On it 
               are indications of small electronic gadgets.

                                     KLAATU
                         It was a gift. For your President.
                              (glances at the broken 
                              object ruefully)
                         With this he could have studied life 
                         on other planets.

               Klaatu lets the object drop with a shrug of mild exasperation. 
               The two lieutenants exchange a helpless look of bewilderment. 
               Then Klaatu raises himself to his feet painfully, holding 
               his wounded shoulder. As he does so, a colonel and a captain 
               come into scene.

                                     COLONEL
                              (to the lieutenants)
                         Is he all right?

                                     FIRST PLATOON LEADER
                         Got hit in the shoulder, sir.

               The three junior officers exchange ineffectual glances and 
               look to the colonel, who thinks for a moment before making 
               his decision.

                                     COLONEL
                         Send for an ambulance. Get him to 
                         Walter Reed Hospital right away.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Yes, sir.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. SITTING ROOM - WALTER REED HOSPITAL - NIGHT

               There is a door to the corridor and a door to Klaatu's room. 
               In the small sitting room, talking in tones of hushed concern, 
               is a group of men. There's a Major General, a likable man 
               with a chest full of ribbons. There are also a Colonel in 
               command of the hospital, a high-ranking police officer, a 
               couple of medical officers and two civilians. The conversation 
               is interrupted by the entrance from Klaatu's room of a Medical 
               Corps Major, followed by an Army Nurse.

                                     GENERAL
                              (to Major)
                         How is he?

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                         He's all right, General... Blood 
                         pressure's a little high, but it 
                         could be aggravation.

                                     GENERAL
                              (wryly)
                         Can't blame him. I always get mad 
                         when somebody shoots me.

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                         He still wants to see the President.

                                     COLONEL
                              (to General)
                         We informed the White House over an 
                         hour ago.

                                     GENERAL
                              (to Major)
                         Didn't drop any hints about where 
                         he's from, did he?

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                         No, sir, he didn't.

               The door to the corridor opens and a worried young Captain 
               enters.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Excuse me.
                              (to the Colonel)
                         What about the reporters, Colonel? 
                         They're swarming all over the lobby.

               The Colonel turns, in deference, to the General.

                                     GENERAL
                              (quietly)
                         Tell them there won't be any statement 
                         tonight.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Yes, sir.
                              (glancing down the 
                              corridor)
                         Mr. Harley's here from the White 
                         House.

               Harley appears in the doorway, a brief case under his arm. 
               He's a dignified, intelligent member of the White House 
               secretariat. He proceeds uninterruptedly into the room, 
               nodding cordially to the General.

                                     HARLEY
                         General --

                                     GENERAL
                              (indicating Klaatu's 
                              room)
                         Right in there, Mr. Harley.

               Harley proceeds in businesslike fashion to the door. He knocks 
               and then enters.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - FULL SHOT

               as Harley enters, closing the door behind him. Klaatu no 
               longer wears his helmet and we see his face clearly for the 
               first time. Even sitting up in bed, with his shoulder strapped 
               in bandages, he is a figure of great authority. His face 
               reflects inner dignity and assurance. Harley, who is a 
               hardened diplomatist, can't help being impressed by his 
               present assignment and a little awed by Klaatu. Harley 
               obviously has been sent by the President to find out what he 
               can. Klaatu's eyes study him, cool, penetrating, reserved.

                                     HARLEY
                         My name is Harley -- Secretary to 
                         the President
                              (Klaatu continues to 
                              study him silently)
                         I've been told that you speak our 
                         language -- that your name is Mr. 
                         Klaatu.

                                     KLAATU
                              (coolly)
                         Just Klaatu.

                                     HARLEY
                         The President asked me to convey his 
                         deepest apologies for what has 
                         happened. We all feel--

                                     KLAATU
                              (evenly)
                         Sit down, Mr. Harley.

               Somewhat relieved, Harley seats himself. He speaks with a 
               half smile, hoping to ease the tension.

                                     HARLEY
                         I'm sure I don't have to point out 
                         that your arrival was something of a 
                         surprise.
                              (getting a little 
                              smile from Klaatu, 
                              he is encouraged to 
                              do some fishing)
                         Had you been traveling long?

                                     KLAATU
                         About five months -- your months.

                                     HARLEY
                         You must have come a long way.

                                     KLAATU
                         About 250 million of your miles.

               Harley glances at him quickly to be sure he's not joking. 
               He's not.

                                     HARLEY
                         Naturally we're very curious to know 
                         where it is you come from.

                                     KLAATU
                              (easily; he's a 
                              diplomat, too)
                         From another planet. Let's just say 
                         that we're neighbors.

               Harley reacts, as his wildest assumptions are so blandly 
               corroborated.

                                     HARLEY
                         It's rather difficult for us to think 
                         of another planet as a neighbor.

                                     KLAATU
                         I'm afraid, in the present situation 
                         you'll have to learn to think that 
                         way.

                                     HARLEY
                              (eyebrows raised)
                         The present situation?

                                     KLAATU
                         I mean the reasons for my coming 
                         here.

                                     HARLEY
                              (his eagerness apparent)
                         We're very curious about that, too. 
                         Would you care to talk about it?

                                     KLAATU
                         I'd be glad to.
                              (noticing that Harley 
                              is settling himself 
                              expectantly)
                         Not now, of course -- with you alone.

                                     HARLEY
                         Perhaps you'd rather discuss it 
                         personally with the President--

                                     KLAATU
                              (somewhat sharply)
                         This is not a personal matter, Mr. 
                         Harley. It concerns all the people 
                         on your planet.

                                     HARLEY
                              (Startled by the scope 
                              of this statement)
                         I -- I'm not sure I understand--

                                     KLAATU
                         I want to meet with representatives 
                         from all the nations of the Earth.

                                     HARLEY
                              (shocked and perturbed 
                              by this notion)
                         I'm afraid that would be a little 
                         awkward. It's -- it's completely 
                         without precedent. And there are 
                         practical considerations -- the time 
                         involved -- the enormous distances.

                                     KLAATU
                              (coolly)
                         I traveled 250 million miles. What 
                         about your United Nations?

                                     HARLEY
                              (Surprised and a little 
                              puzzled)
                         You know about the United Nations?

                                     KLAATU
                         We've been monitoring your radio 
                         broadcasts for a good many years. 
                         That's how we learned your languages. 
                         Lately, we've been getting your 
                         television also.

                                     HARLEY
                              (wryly)
                         You must have a rather strange 
                         impression of us.

                                     KLAATU
                              (smiling)
                         The first two years of television we 
                         were convinced that all you did was 
                         wrestle.

               Harley smiles. Then his mind reverts to the seriousness of 
               the situation and he speaks gravely.

                                     HARLEY
                         I'm sure you recognize from our broad-
                         casts the evil forces that have 
                         produced the tension in our world. 
                         Surely you would agree--

                                     KLAATU
                              (evenly)
                         I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with 
                         the internal affairs of your planet. 
                         I consider that to be your business -- 
                         not mine.

                                     HARLEY
                         I was only hoping to make you 
                         understand.

                                     KLAATU
                              (sternly, impressively)
                         My mission here is not to solve your 
                         petty squabbles. It concerns the 
                         existence of every last creature who 
                         lives on Earth.

                                     HARLEY
                              (uncomfortably)
                         Perhaps if you could explain a little--

                                     KLAATU
                         I intend to explain. To all the 
                         nations -- simultaneously.
                              (his manner precludes 
                              opposition)
                         How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?

               Harley is thoroughly shaken. The tremendous force and power 
               implicit in Klaatus's manner preclude the possibility of 
               argument.

                                     HARLEY
                              (after a long 
                              thoughtful moment)
                         We could call a special meeting of 
                         the General Assembly... But of course 
                         the UN doesn't represent all of the 
                         nations.

                                     KLAATU
                         Then why not a meeting of all the 
                         Chiefs of State?

                                     HARLEY
                              (helplessly, but 
                              patiently)
                         Believe me, you don't understand. 
                         They wouldn't sit down at the same 
                         table.

               Growing a little impatient with such nonsense, Klaatu eyes 
               him evenly, speaks with Jovian authority.

                                     KLAATU
                         I don't want to resort to threats, 
                         Mr. Harley. I simply tell you bluntly 
                         that the future of your planet is at 
                         stake... I suggest you transmit that 
                         message to the nations of the Earth.

               The eyes of the two men meet for a long, silent moment. Then 
               Harley rises quietly.

                                     HARLEY
                         I will make that recommendation to 
                         the President.
                              (he picks up his brief 
                              case and hat)
                         I must tell you in all honesty that 
                         I'm extremely dubious about the 
                         results.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a half-smile)
                         Apparently I'm not as cynical about 
                         Earth's people as you are.

                                     HARLEY
                         I've been dealing in Earth's politics 
                         a good deal longer than you have.
                              (he bows)
                         Goodnight, sir.

               He turns and goes out.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He stares after Harley for a moment, puzzled by this strange 
               and apparently unreasoning world he has come to. He shakes 
               his head in thoughtful, tolerant bewilderment.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. SPACE SHIP - LONG SHOT - NIGHT

               Searchlights have lighted up up the eerie shapes of the space 
               ship and Gort. A circle of soldiers guard the area, while a 
               crew of men can be seen working around the ship.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT SHIP

               A Master Sergeant of Engineers, dressed in fatigues, is 
               inspecting the side of the ship carefully. He has an acetylene 
               torch in his had and a welding helmet over his face. The 
               Major General, previously seen in the hospital sitting room, 
               enters and speaks to the Sergeant.

                                     GENERAL
                         Getting any place, Sergeant?

                                     SERGEANT
                              (raising his helmet)
                         No, sir.
                              (shaking his head in 
                              annoyance)
                         Beats me, General. I saw that ramp 
                         come out of the side of the ship -- 
                         right here. Now I can't even find a 
                         crack!

               A man named Carlson, a civilian metallurgical expert, comes 
               into scene. The General nods to him.

                                     GENERAL
                         What's the report, Carlson?

                                     CARLSON
                              (discouraged)
                         We've tried everything from a 
                         blowtorch to a diamond drill.

                                     GENERAL
                              (nodding toward Gort)
                         What about him?

                                     CARLSON
                         He's made out of the same stuff.

               THREE SHOT  GENERAL, CARLSON AND SERGEANT

                                     GENERAL
                         Has he moved?

                                     SERGEANT
                         No sir. Not an inch

                                     CARLSON
                         This is the toughest material I ever 
                         saw, General. For hardness and 
                         strength, it's out of this world.

                                     GENERAL
                              (with a wry half-smile)
                         I can tell you officially - that's 
                         where it came from.

               The two men exchange an uneasy glance, then turn to look at 
               the ship.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. SITTING ROOM  WALTER REED HOSPITAL

               Two Medical Corps officers, a Captain and a Major are 
               interestedly studying a series of X-ray films.

                                     MAJOR
                         The skeletal structure is completely 
                         normal.
                              (pointing)
                         Same for the major organs - heart, 
                         liver, spleen, kidneys.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         And the lungs are the same as ours. 
                         Must mean a similar atmosphere -- 
                         similar pressure.
                              (nodding, toward 
                              Klaatu's room)
                         How old do you think he is?

                                     MAJOR
                         Oh, I'd say forty-five.

                                     CAPTAIN
                              (smiling)
                         He told me this morning when I 
                         examined him. He's seventy-eight.

                                     MAJOR
                         I don't believe it.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Their life expectancy is a hundred 
                         and thirty.

                                     MAJOR
                         How does he explain that?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         He says their medicine is that much 
                         more advanced.
                              (the major stares at 
                              him blankly)
                         He was very nice about it. But he 
                         made me feel like a third-class witch 
                         doctor.

               The door to Klaatu's rooms opens and Major White appears. 
               He's the man who attended Klaatu the day before. He closes 
               the door behind him and stands motionless facing the other 
               two, his face wearing a blank expression.

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                         I took a bullet out of that man's 
                         arm yesterday.

                                     FIRST MAJOR
                         What about it?

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                              (utterly bewildered)
                         I just examined the wound and it's 
                         all healed.

                                     FIRST MAJOR
                         What does he say about it?

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                         Said he put some salve on it -- some 
                         stuff he had with him.
                              (shows them a small, 
                              odd-looking tube in 
                              his hand)

                                     CAPTAIN
                         What are you going to do with it?

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                         Take it downstairs and have it 
                         analyzed.
                              (on his way to the 
                              door, shaking his 
                              head)
                         Then I don't know whether I'll just 
                         get drunk or give up the practice of 
                         medicine.

               As he starts out the door to the corridor, he passes Mr. 
               Harley, who is on his way in, carrying his ever-present brief 
               case. Harley is accompanied by an enlisted M.P.

                                     FIRST MAJOR
                         Afternoon, Mr. Harley.

                                     HARLEY
                         Afternoon, gentlemen.

               Harley goes to the door of Klaatu's room, a businesslike 
               expression on his face. He knocks on the door, then enters. 
               The M.P. remains in the sitting room.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - FULL SHOT - DAY

               as Harley enters. Klaatu is up out of bed, walking around in 
               a Medical Corps robe and pajamas. He appears to be completely 
               recovered.

                                     HARLEY
                         Good afternoon.
                              (surprised not to 
                              find him in bed)
                         I'm glad to see you up and around.

                                     KLAATU
                         Thank you... Have you any news?

                                     HARLEY
                         Not very good news, I'm afraid.
                              (digs into his 
                              briefcase for some 
                              papers)
                         The President accepted your suggestion 
                         and cabled the invitations for a 
                         meeting last night.
                              (grimly)
                         Let me read you some of the replies.
                              (he selects a cable 
                              and reads)
                         "The Premier wishes to inform the 
                         Government of the United States that 
                         it will be impossible for him to 
                         attend the meeting suggested by the 
                         President unless the meeting is held 
                         in Moscow."
                              (with a grimly-pointed 
                              glance at Klaatu, 
                              Harley reads another 
                              cable)
                         "The suggestion of the President 
                         regarding the possibility of a meeting 
                         in Moscow would be unacceptable to 
                         Her Majesty's Government at the 
                         present time. Representation could 
                         be sent only if the meeting were 
                         held in Washington."
                              (he looks up at Klaatu 
                              and shrugs)
                         Well -- there you have it.

               Harley extends a sheaf of cables for Klaatu's inspection, 
               but he ignores them. Klaatu has listened to this recital, 
               first incredulously, then with mounting indignation. Conscious 
               of his quiet, Olympian wrath, Harley continues uncomfortably.

                                     HARLEY
                         I tried to make you understand. The 
                         suspicions -- the jealousies -- the 
                         mistrust--
                              (uneasily, under 
                              Klaatu's level gaze)
                         Surely you realize that my government 
                         has done everything in its power--

                                     KLAATU
                         It's not your government I'm thinking 
                         about. It's your world.

                                     HARLEY
                         Now that you understand the situation 
                         more clearly, perhaps you'd like to 
                         discuss the matter with the President

                                     KLAATU
                              (sternly)
                         I will not speak to any one nation 
                         or group of nations.
                              (sharply, bitterly)
                         I don't intend to add my contribution 
                         to your childish jealousies and 
                         suspicions.

                                     HARLEY
                         Our problems are very complex, Mr. 
                         Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too 
                         harshly.

                                     KLAATU
                         I can judge only by what I see.

                                     HARLEY
                         Your impatience is quite 
                         understandable.

                                     KLAATU
                              (sharply)
                         I am impatient with stupidity. My 
                         people have learned to live without 
                         it.

                                     HARLEY
                              (ruefully)
                         I'm afraid my people haven't.
                              (with real sincerity)
                         I'm very sorry -- I wish it were 
                         otherwise.

               Reluctantly Harley has picked up his hat and brief case. He 
               finds Klaatu staring out the window.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               As he looks out the window thoughtfully. What he sees has 
               given him an idea.

               MED. SHOT - HOSPITAL GROUNDS

               shooting down, from Klaatu's viewpoint, at people strolling 
               about the hospital grounds. Most of them are civilian 
               visitors, but there is a sprinkling of nurses and ambulatory 
               patients.

               FULL SHOT - HOSPITAL ROOM

               As Klaatu turns back to Harley, he speaks thoughtfully, 
               incisively.

                                     KLAATU
                         Before making any decisions, I think 
                         I should get out among your people -- 
                         become familiar with the basis for 
                         these strange, unreasoning attitudes.

                                     HARLEY
                         Under the circumstances I'm afraid 
                         that will be impossible.

               Harley has paused near the door, a little embarrassed by 
               Klaatu's level gaze.

                                     HARLEY
                         I must ask that you don't attempt to 
                         leave the hospital. Our military 
                         people have insisted on this. I'm 
                         sure you'll understand.

               With a polite nod, he goes out. Klaatu stares after him as 
               he realizes that he is in effect a prisoner. He shakes his 
               head slowly, thoughtfully. The ways of this planet are strange 
               indeed.

               INT. SITTING ROOM - MED CLOSE SHOT - AT DOOR

               Harley has paused to watch as the M.P. takes out a key and 
               inserts it in the lock of Klaatu's door.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               As he hears the click of the lock, he turns toward the door. 
               Realizing they've locked him in, he smiles with tolerant 
               amusement.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL SITTING ROOM - MED CLOSE SHOT - NIGHT

               In the dim light of one lamp, the door to the corridor opens 
               and a nurse enters carrying a tray of medication. She is 
               accompanied by the same M.P. as previously seen. The nurse 
               pauses as the M.P. takes out a key and inserts it in the 
               lock of Klaatu's door. To his surprise he finds that the 
               door is not locked. He exchanges a glance with the nurse, 
               then pulls the door open and hurries inside.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

               as the M.P. crosses the unlighted room toward the bed. The 
               only light cones from the open door to the sitting room. The 
               M.P.'s eyes go wide as he looks at the bed. It is unmade and 
               unoccupied. Terrified, the M.P. turns to the nurse, who is 
               standing in the doorway.

               M.P.  He's gone!

               The M.P. dashes out of the room, through the doorway past 
               the nurse. She turns to follow him as we--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MONTAGE - NIGHT

               A series of short DISSOLVES, showing:

               1. The M.P. excitedly reporting Klaatu's disappearance to 
               the Officer of the Day.

               2. The hospital guard detail hurrying out of the guardhouse 
               to form up in front of the Sergeant of the guard.

               3. A high-level military conference gathered at a table, 
               discussing the matter with great concern.

               4. A street corner newsstand, with people eagerly grabbing 
               papers. The headline reads: "MAN FROM MARS" ESCAPES FROM 
               ARMY HOSPITAL!

               5. Radio announcers chattering excitedly into their 
               microphones

               6. A series of close-ups of people listening to the radio. 
               Their faces reveal their awestruck terror.

               7. A terrified mother drags her two children in from the 
               street through the front door, slams the door and bolts it.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - MED. CLOSE SHOT - NIGHT

               CAMERA is on the back of a man dressed in a business suit, 
               who is walking along the sidewalk of a dimly lighted, almost 
               deserted, middle-class street. He carries a suitcase and he 
               glances idly at the drab-looking stone facades of the old 
               two-story houses. As he passes, from the open windows of the 
               houses come the voices of radio announcers. We get a sentence 
               or two from one house and then, as the man and our CAMERA 
               pass on, this voice fades and another is picked up. We get 
               the impression that everyone is glued to his radio.

                                     RADIO VOICES
                              (over scene)
                         --authorities at Walter Reed Hospital 
                         refused to comment on how he managed 
                         to escape, or what measures might be 
                         taken to apprehend him.

               --these fantastic descriptions of the creature are denounced 
               as rumor by police Chief Walter Baxter. He is not eight feet 
               tall, as reported -- nor does he have tentacles in place of 
               arms--

               --there's no denying that there is a monster at large -- 
               that we are dealing with forces beyond our knowledge and 
               power. The public is urged to take ordinary precautions and 
               to remain calm, as we await further developments--

               --three separate reports of people who claim to have seen 
               the "space man" in the past hour. One from Des Moines, Iowa; 
               one from a village in northern Florida; and one from Chicago.

               CAMERA OVERTAKES the man as he pauses under the light of a 
               street lamp, and reveals that it is Klaatu. He has stopped 
               to look at something out of scene.

               CLOSE SHOT

               from Klaatu's viewpoint, of a sign on one of the houses, 
               reading: ROOM FOR RENT

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He seems to hesitate, debating a plan he has in mind. He 
               raises his right arm to scratch his head thoughtfully, and 
               notices for the first time a small tag, or ticket, attached 
               to the inside of the right forearm of the coat he is wearing. 
               Puzzled, he pulls off the ticket and looks at it.

               INSERT - TICKET

               It is the sort of tag a cleaning establishment attaches to 
               clothing. Printed on it is the legend: CAPITOL DRY CLEANING 
               SERVICE. Scrawled in a penciled hand is the notation: Dr. 
               Carpenter, Bldg. A - Walter Reed Hospital. Cl. & pr. $1.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He smiles wryly at this reminder of where he got the suit, 
               and he destroys the ticket. He glances down at the suitcase 
               beside him.

               CLOSE SHOT - SUITCASE

               It bears the initials L.M.C. Klaatu's hand comes into scene 
               and lifts up the suitcase. CAMERA HOLDS as Klaatu carries 
               the bag toward the house and mounts the stone steps to the 
               entrance.

               INT. BOARDINGHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               There 's no light in the room except what splashes in from 
               the hall. Gathered around a television set are five adults 
               and a little boy, their faces eerie in the reflected light 
               from the screen. The room is done in average boardinghouse 
               style -- antimacassars and all. The attention of the people 
               is riveted on the television screen, where a newscaster is 
               reading a bulletin.

                                     TELEVISION COMMENTATOR
                         --while the President made no effort 
                         to minimize the crisis, he urged 
                         people all over the country to remain 
                         calm. He said the entire facilities 
                         of FBI and other federal agencies 
                         are being bought to bear. He pointed 
                         out, however, that this is no ordinary 
                         man hunt. He warned we may be up 
                         against powers that are beyond our 
                         control.

               FULL SHOT

               The landlady, a stern-faced woman of middle age, named MRS. 
               CROCKETT, rises nervously and crosses to the television set.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (tensely)
                         I can't stand any more of this. It's 
                         enough to drive a person crazy.

               She snaps off the set sharply.

               TWO SHOT

               BOBBY BENSON, a bright-eyed, eleven-year-old, is seated beside 
               his mother, HELEN BENSON, an attractive girl of thirty. 
               Disappointed that the set has been turned off, Bobby's roving 
               eye has fallen on something in the doorway to the hall... 
               Wide-eyed, he nudges his mother and points.

                                     BOBBY
                         Hey, Mom -- who's that?

               FULL SHOT

               including the doorway to the hall. Silhouetted motionless 
               against the light from the hall is the figure of a man. All 
               eyes follow Hobby's pointed finger, and there is a stifled 
               gasp as they are startled out of their preoccupation. One of 
               the men turns on the lights and Klaatu is revealed standing 
               calmly in the doorway. There is a shocked silence for a 
               moment, then Mrs. Crockett speaks.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (apologizing nervously 
                              for the tension in 
                              the room)
                         I -- I'm sorry. What is it you want?

                                     KLAATU
                         My name is Carpenter. I'm looking 
                         for a room.

               There is a noticeable letdown in the general tension, during 
               which Booby has been studying Klaatu, his imagination working 
               overtime.

                                     BOBBY
                         Are you an FBI man?

                                     KLAATU
                         No -- I'm afraid not.

               Helen has stepped forward to make Bobby desist.

                                     BOBBY
                         Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking 
                         for that space man.

                                     HELEN
                              (with an apologetic 
                              smile at Klaatu)
                         I think we've all been hearing too 
                         much about "space men."

               Mrs. Crockett reverts to her role as landlady. She likes to 
               think of her house as a home.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (starting the 
                              introductions with 
                              Helen)
                         This is Mrs. Benson, Mr. Carpenter.
                              (with a smile that 
                              would split a brick)
                         And little Bobby.
                              (indicating a middle-
                              aged couple and a 
                              younger but more 
                              wizened man)
                         Mr. and Mrs. Barley -- and Mr. 
                         Krull... I'm Mrs. Crockett.

               There are polite noddings and how-do-you-do's. Mrs. Crockett 
               is satisfied that she's established a cozy atmosphere.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (pleased to the point 
                              of challenge)
                         Well -- this is our little family.
                              (then, getting down 
                              to business)
                         I have a very nice room on the second 
                         floor.

               She leads the way toward the hall and Klaatu starts to follow, 
               picking up his suitcase, when he is intercepted by Bobby.

                                     BOBBY
                         Can I help you look for the space 
                         man? Can I?
                              (excitedly)
                         I know what he looks like! He's got 
                         a square head -- and, three great 
                         big eyes!

                                     HELEN
                              (good-naturedly, 
                              calming him down)
                         That's enough, Bobby. I think it's 
                         time you went to bed.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (to Bobby, with a 
                              prop smile)
                         We mustn't annoy Mr. Carpenter -- or 
                         he won't want to stay here. She goes 
                         on into the hall, followed by Klaatu, 
                         who has exchanged a polite smile 
                         with Helen.

               INT. HALLWAY

               as Mrs. Crockett leads the way up the stairs.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                         He's really a dear little boy -- and 
                         quiet as a mouse.
                              (with a shrewd, chatty 
                              smile)
                         You're a long way from home, aren't 
                         you, Mr. Carpenter?

                                     KLAATU
                         How did you know?

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (pleased with her 
                              cleverness)
                         Oh, I can tell a New England accent 
                         a mile away.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BOARDINGHOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

               Five of the boarders -- Mr. and Mrs. Barley, Mr. Krull, Helen 
               Benson and Klaatu - are finishing their Sunday morning 
               breakfast. Mrs. Barley is a middle-class Helen Hokinson lady, 
               form and unrelenting. Her husband is a born complainer. Mr. 
               Krull is a shriveled little accountant, precise and finicky. 
               As they finish their coffee, all except Helen are immersed 
               in the Sunday papers. Helen seems preoccupied with her own 
               thoughts. From a portable radio on the table comes Gabriel 
               Heater's voice.

                                     GABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE
                         --and so, this Sunday morning, we 
                         ask the question that's been plaguing; 
                         the entire nation for two days now: 
                         "Where is this creature and what is 
                         he up to?" If he can build a space 
                         ship that can fly to Earth -- and a 
                         robot that can destroy our tanks and 
                         guns -- what other terrors can he 
                         unleash at will? ...Obviously we 
                         must find this monster. We must track 
                         him down like a wild animal and 
                         destroy him.

               INSERT - NEWSPAPER PAGE IN MRS. BARLEY'S HANDS

               It is a full page layout, in the style of the American Weekly, 
               showing a demented artist's conception of a mass invasion of 
               space ships. Weird-looking creatures are slaughtering Earth 
               people with ray guns. The caption at the top of the image 
               reads: "Are We Long For This World?" (Gabriel Heater's voice 
               continues uninterruptedly over this and the next two scenes.)

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He is reading his paper with considerable interest.

               INSERT - NEWSPAPER STORY

               The third-page story reads: SAVANT CALLS MEETING TO STUDY 
               SPACE SHIP. Professor Jacob Barnhardt, world-famous scientist 
               and Nobel Prize winner, has invited fellow scientists from 
               all over the world to meet with him in Washington and study 
               the recently landed "Space Ship."

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               His face is thoughtful as he finishes reading. This story 
               seems to impress and interest him. Then suddenly he finds 
               his attention caught at what the Radio Voice is saying.

                                     GABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE
                         But where would such a creature hide 
                         himself? Would he disappear into the 
                         north woods? Or would he slither off 
                         into the sewers of some great city?

               Klaatu has a reaction of affronted dignity at this monstrously 
               distasteful idea.

               GROUP SHOT

               AS THE RADIO VOICE CONTINUES:

                                     GABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE
                         There is grave danger -- everyone 
                         agrees to that. The question is what 
                         can we do to protect ourselves? What 
                         measures can we take that will--

               During the above, Mrs. Barley has turned to her husband in 
               sharp annoyance.

                                     MRS. BARLEY
                         George, I wish you'd turn that radio 
                         off. I'm trying to concentrate.

               Mr. Barley reaches out and snaps off the radio.

                                     MR. BARLEY
                              (snorting, he tosses 
                              his paper down)
                         Why doesn't the Government do 
                         something -- that's what I want to 
                         know.

                                     MR. KRULL
                              (mildly)
                         What can they do? They're only people -- 
                         Just like us.

                                     MR. BARLEY
                         People my foot! They're Democrats!

                                     MR. KRULL
                         It's enough to give you the shakes. 
                         He's got that robot standing there -- 
                         ten-foot tall -- just waiting for 
                         orders to destroy us.

                                     HELEN
                              (thoughtfully)
                         This space man -- or whatever he is. 
                         We automatically assume he's a 
                         menace... Maybe he isn't at all.

                                     MR. BARLEY
                              (glaring at her for 
                              this silly notion)
                         Then what's he hiding for? Why doesn't 
                         he come out in the open?

                                     MR. KRULL
                         Yeah.
                              (indicating the radio)
                         Like the fella says: "What's he up 
                         to?"

                                     HELEN
                         Maybe he's afraid.

                                     MRS. BARLEY
                              (with a derisive snort)
                         He's afraid!

                                     HELEN
                         After all, he was shot the moment he 
                         landed here.
                              (she pauses for a 
                              moment thoughtfully)
                         I was just wondering what I would 
                         do.

                                     KLAATU
                              (to Helen, helpfully)
                         Perhaps before deciding on a course 
                         of action, you'd want to know more 
                         about the people here -- to orient 
                         yourself in a strange environment.

                                     MRS. BARLEY
                              (sharply)
                         There's nothing strange about 
                         Washington, Mr. Carpenter.

                                     KLAATU
                              (quietly, tongue in 
                              cheek)
                         A person from another planet might 
                         disagree with you.

                                     MRS. BARLEY
                         If you want my opinion, he came from 
                         right here on Earth.
                              (with significant 
                              emphasis)
                         And you know where I mean.

                                     MR. KRULL
                         They wouldn't come in a space ship. 
                         They'd come in airplanes.

                                     MRS. BARLEY
                              (as though with 
                              superior knowledge)
                         I wouldn't be so sure about that.

                                     MR. BARLEY
                              (delivering the final 
                              word)
                         Stands to reason that fella wants 
                         some thing or he wouldn't be here.
                              (facing Klaatu)
                         That make sense, Carpenter?

               Klaatu pauses for a moment, then recites pleasantly.

                                     KLAATU
                         I must admit I'm a little confused.

               Mrs. Crockett enters and speaks to Helen.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                         Mrs. Benson -- Mr. Stevens is here 
                         to see you.

                                     HELEN
                         Oh -- thank you.

               She rises and goes out.

                                     MRS. BARLEY
                         Finish your coffee, George. I told 
                         the Carsons we'd be there at eleven.

               INT. BOARDINGHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MED. CLOSE SHOT

               as Helen crosses the room to greet TOM STEVENS. He's a 
               personable young man with a breezy manner and considerable 
               charm. There is between them an easy air of Intimacy.

                                     HELEN
                              (smiling warmly)
                         Good morning.

               Tom kisses her.

                                     TOM
                         We're all set. I picked up some 
                         sandwiches and put gas in the car. 
                         And the radio's still busted, so me 
                         can forget about the space man for 
                         today.

                                     HELEN
                              (a little disturbed)
                         There's only one thing -- I haven't 
                         been able to arrange for anyone to 
                         stay with Bobby.
                              (tentatively)
                         I don't suppose we could take him 
                         with us?

                                     TOM
                              (understandably 
                              unenthusiastically)
                         Well, we could--

                                     HELEN
                         There's always somebody here, but 
                         today of course they've all got plans.

                                     KLAATU'S VOICE
                         I haven't any plans.

               Helen and Tom turn in surprise.

               THREE SHOT

               including Klaatu, who has wandered in from the dining room, 
               unnoticed by Tom and Helen. Klaatu continues, with an air of 
               wanting to be helpful without wanting to interfere.

                                     KLAATU
                         I'd be glad to spend the day with 
                         him -- if you'd let me.

                                     TOM
                              (impulsively)
                         Say, that'll be great! Wouldn't it, 
                         Helen.

                                     HELEN
                              (hesitating, a little 
                              confused, by the 
                              offer)
                         It's awfully nice of you to suggest 
                         it.
                              (remembering the two 
                              men haven't met)
                         I'm sorry Mr. Carpenter -- this is 
                         Tom Stevens.

               The two men shake hand's and exchange how-do-you-do's. Then 
               Klaatu turns back to Helen.

                                     KLAATU
                         Bobby and I had a fine time yesterday 
                         afternoon. We talked -- and listened 
                         to the radio.
                              (smiling at Helen)
                         I thought today he might show me 
                         around the city.

               Helen is debating the matter in her mind, concerned about 
               leaving Bobby with a comparative stranger, but tempted because 
               of her favorable impression of Klaatu.

                                     KLAATU
                              (easily)
                         Suppose I ask Bobby how he feels 
                         about it.

               He turns, with a little smile, and starts out of the room. 
               Helen, still not quite decided, turns to Tom with a 
               questioning look. Tom nods.

               DISSOLVE T0:

               INT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - FULL SHOT - DAY (STOCK)

               The great seated, brooding figure of Lincoln is at the far 
               end of the impressive main hall. A few tourists are moving 
               about the place.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

               They are in the south hall, on the wall of which is inscribed 
               the Gettysburg Address. They stand silently, side by side, 
               reading the inscription.

               INSERT - GETTYSBURG ADDRESS (STOCK)

               Featuring the last part of the Address. It reads: "--and 
               that government of the people, by the people, for the people, 
               shall not perish from the earth."

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

                                     KLAATU
                              (visibly impressed)
                         Those are great words.
                              (with an air of 
                              discovery)
                         He must have been a great man.

               Bobby is impressed by the depth and sincerity of Klaatu's 
               tribute, but a little confused by his air of having discovered 
               Lincoln. Hobby watches Klaatu with a puzzled expression, 
               then follows as Klaatu moves off slowly.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - MED. CLOSE SHOT - DAY

               shooting against one of the huge fluted columns as Klaatu 
               and Bobby come out of the building. Deeply preoccupied, Klaatu 
               speaks with impatient urgency.

                                     KLAATU
                         That's the kind of man I'd like to 
                         talk to.

               Bobby looks up at him in bewilderment. After a moment Klaatu 
               speaks slowly, thoughtfully.

                                     KLAATU
                         Bobby -- who's the greatest man in 
                         America today?

                                     BOBBY
                              (puzzling it over)
                         Gee -- I don't know... The space 
                         man, I guess.

                                     KLAATU
                              (secretly amused)
                         I was speaking of earth men. I meant 
                         the greatest philosopher -- the 
                         greatest thinker.

                                     B0BBY
                         You mean the smartest man in the 
                         whole world?

                                     KLAATU
                         Yes -- that would do nicely.

                                     BOBBY
                              (after a moments 
                              thought)
                         Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. 
                         He's the greatest scientist in the 
                         world.

                                     KLAATU
                              (he pauses 
                              thoughtfully, speaks 
                              slowly, as he recalls 
                              the newspaper story 
                              he read)
                         He lives here in Washington, doesn't 
                         he?

                                     BOBBY
                         Sure. Right near where my mother 
                         works.

                                     KLAATU
                         Where is that?

                                     BOBBY
                         Department of Commerce. She's a 
                         secretary.
                              (Klaatu nods)
                         They have a man they call the 
                         Secretary, but he isn't at all. My 
                         mother's a real secretary.
                              (after a moment; 
                              eagerly)
                         Mr. Carpenter -- now can we go see 
                         the space ship?

               EXT. THE MALL - LONG SHOT - SPACE SHIP AND GORT - DAY

               A crew of Army engineers is in process of erecting a temporary 
               structure such as a large Quonset hut or B29 hanger to enclose 
               the space ship and Gort. The walls are partially up and 
               already have concealed part of the ship. The area is roped 
               off and there are Army guards to keep the sightseers back. 
               There is a crowd of people behind the ropes, watching. CAMERA 
               MOVES IN to reveal the backs of Bobby and Klaatu.

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

               Bobby is studying the ship and Gort eagerly, his imagination 
               thoroughly aroused. Klaatu is watching the men at work with 
               mild, quiet amusement.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               from Bobby's viewpoint.

               TWO SHOT - BOBBY AND KLAATU

               Bobby's eyes are wide with awe as he watches the giant robot.

                                     BOBBY
                         Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he 
                         could knock down a whole building.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a quizzical 
                              smile)
                         I shouldn't be at all surprised.

               Bobby's attention shifts to the ship.

               MED. SHOT - SPACE SHIP

               From Bobby's viewpoint.

               TWO SHOT - B0BBY AND KLAATU

                                     BOBBY
                              (excitedly, indicating 
                              the ship)
                         Gee, I'd like to get inside and see 
                         how it works. What do you think makes 
                         it go?

                                     KLAATU
                              (quietly, after a 
                              glance around)
                         Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.

                                     BOBBY
                              (looking at Klaatu 
                              incredulously)
                         I thought that was only for bombs.

                                     KLAATU
                         No. It's for a lot of other things, 
                         too.

                                     BOBBY
                         You think it can go faster than an F-
                         36?

                                     KLAATU
                         Yes -- I think so.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT KLAATU AND BOBBY

               shooting from a side angle to include a couple of men who 
               are listening to Klaatu's conversation. They are nudging 
               each other, amused at the way this man is pretending to 
               explain things to the little boy.

                                     BOBBY
                         About a thousand miles an hour?

               Klaatu has noticed the two men, who have edged a little closer 
               to listen. He is not perturbed by them, but he lowers his 
               voice a bit.

                                     KLAATU
                         Maybe four thousand miles an hour. 
                         And outside the Earth's atmosphere a 
                         good deal faster.

                                     BOBBY
                              (excitedly)
                         Gee! How could they make a landing?

                                     KLAATU
                         Well -- there are several ways to 
                         reduce landing speed. You see, the 
                         velocity--

               Klaatu interrupts himself as he realizes that he may be going 
               too far. The two men have moved closer, listening and 
               grinning. One of them whispers to the other behind the back 
               of his hand. Then the man realizes that Klaatu has stopped 
               speaking and is looking at him.

                                     MAN
                              (grinning)
                         Keep goin', Mister. He was fallin' 
                         for it.

               The two men burst out laughing and move off together. Bobby, 
               who has missed the point of this by-play, looks at Klaatu, 
               then after the men. As they move out of scene they laugh 
               loudly at the little boy's confusion. Klaatu takes Bobby's 
               hand to lead him away from the roped-off area.

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

               CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they move away through the crowd.

               As they do so, several newsboys are working their way through 
               the crowd with newly arrived extras. The boys are calling 
               out the extras: "Police under fire!" "Army put in charge!" 
               "Space man still at large!" etc. People are eagerly buying 
               the papers. Klaatu and Booby watch this as they pass through 
               the crowd.

               CLOSE SHOT - EXTRA

               In newsboy's hand. The headline reads: SPACE MAN ELUDES POLICE 
               ARMY PUT IN CHARGE.

               CLOSE SHOT - ANOTHER EXTRA

               In another newsboy's hand. This headline reads: DISTRICT 
               UNDER MARTIAL LAW. CONGRESS ACTS AS POLICE CHIEF REIGNS.

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

               as they move on away from the excited crowd of people. 
               Klaatu's reaction has been one of mild curiosity. Bobby looks 
               up at him.

                                     BOBBY
                         You think they'll ever find him?

                                     KLAATU
                              (alter a moment's 
                              pause)
                         I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to 
                         doubt it.

                                     BOBBY
                              (as they continue 
                              walking)
                         Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity 
                         mean?

                                     KLAATU
                              (preoccupied)
                         Velocity is the time rate of change 
                         of position.

               This explanation misses Bobby by several light years. He 
               glances up at Klaatu blankly.

                                     BOBBY
                         I'll bet that's the way Professor 
                         Barnhardt talks.

               Pulled out of his reverie, Klaatu glances down at Bobby and 
               smiles apologetically. Bobby grins back at him. Then, as 
               they walk on a few more steps, Klaatu stops and speaks 
               thoughtfully.

                                     KLAATU
                         Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go 
                         see Professor Barnhardt and find out 
                         how he talks.

                                     BOBBY
                              (with a half-smile of 
                              accusation)
                         You're just kidding, aren't you?

                                     KLAATU
                         Wouldn't you like to meet him?

                                     BOBBY
                         Well, sure I would, but --
                              (he's to be not going 
                              taken in)
                         Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a private smile)
                         We can scare him more than he can 
                         scare us.

               Bobby stares up at him and his face breaks into a broad 
               admiring grin.

                                     BOBBY
                         I like you, Mr. Carpenter. You're a 
                         real screwball.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. BARNHARDT'S HOUSE - MED. SHOT - DAY

               The house is an unimposing old-fashioned structure, shouldered 
               on either side by similar one-family dwellings. There is a 
               flight of stone steps leading up to the entrance and a large 
               porch across the front of the house. Klaatu and Bobby walk 
               into scene and pause, Klaatu glances at Bobby and Bobby nods 
               toward the house. They move on up the steps to the entrance.

               MED. CHOOSE SHOT - AT FRONT DOOR

               Bobby, all eagerness and excitement, presses the bell. They 
               wait a moment and there is no answer.

                                     BOBBY
                              (disappointed at the 
                              thought)
                         Gee -- maybe he isn't home.

               Bobby wanders down the porch and looks into a window. 
               Fascinated by what he sees, he gestures to Klaatu.

                                     BOBBY
                         Betcha this is where he works--

               After a glance at the front door, Klaatu joins Bobby at the 
               window and looks in.

               FULL SHOT - BARNHARDT'S STUDY

               SHOOTING through the window, over the heads of Klaatu and 
               Bobby. The room is more of a workroom than a study. It is in 
               comfortably shabby disarray, with papers and books everywhere. 
               There's a battered old desk and a day bed. One wall is solid 
               bookshelves and on the other two are blackboards covered 
               with a fantastic array of complex equations, graphs and 
               diagrams.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               His attention has been caught by one of the blackboards and 
               he studies it with great interest and curiosity.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - SECTION OF BLACKBOARD

               It is covered with a particularly complicated series of 
               equations in a chalky scrawl, involving angles of vector, 
               Keplerian ellipses, etc. The final equations are unsolved; 
               they have no answers after the "equals" sign. Across are 
               little printed signs tacked to the blackboard reading: "Don't 
               erase!" and "Don't touch!"

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

               Bewildered, Bobby looks from the blackboard up at Klaatu. 
               Still studying the blackboard, Klaatu is shaking his head 
               and clucking his tonsure as one might at the attempts of a 
               child to solve a problem in arithmetic.

                                     BOBBY
                              (indicating the 
                              equations)
                         What does that mean?

                                     KLAATU
                         It's a problem in celestial mechanics.

                                     BOBBY
                         Bet he's the only one in the world 
                         knows the answer.

                                     KLAATU
                              (he shakes his head, 
                              smiling)
                         He doesn't know the answer. And he'll 
                         never get it that way.

               Bobby moves over to a pair of French doors beyond the window 
               and tries to peer in through the curtained doors. He absently 
               tries the doors and finds them locked. Then he turns away 
               with a disappointed but philosophical shrug.

                                     BOBBY
                         We probably couldn't get to see him 
                         even if he was home.

               As Bobby moves away from the doors dejectedly, Klaatu puts 
               his hand on the knob.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               He's watching Klaatu and his eyes widen at what he sees.

                                     BOBBY
                              (in complete surprise)
                         Hey -- where you going?

               CHOOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He has opened the door and is standing in the doorway, his 
               hand, still on the knob. He is smiling at Bobby with secret 
               amusement. He's got an idea.

                                     KLAATU
                         If he's that difficult to see, perhaps 
                         we ought to leave a calling card.

               Klaatu disappears into the study. Amazed, Bobby follows.

               INT. BARNHARDT'S STUDY

               Bobby watches as Klaatu walks to the blackboard and picks up 
               a piece of chalk. As though correcting a schoolboy's work, 
               he makes large check marks at several points in each equation.

               EXT. PORCH - BARNHARDT'S HOUSE

               An efficient-looking middle-aged woman is mounting the steps 
               to the entrance, getting her front door key out of her purse, 
               when her eye falls on the French doors, which are standing 
               ajar. Puzzled, she starts down the porch toward the doors. 
               This woman is Barnhardt's secretary and her name is HILDA.

               Bobby is watching as Klaatu writes across the blackboard in 
               a bold hand: Differentiate the equation ( ).

               Klaatu underlines this comment with a sharp stroke, when a 
               stern voice is heard off screen.

                                     HILDA'S VOICE
                         What are you doing in here?

               FULL SHOT

               as Klaatu and Bobby turn in surprise. Standing in the open 
               French doors is Hilda, eyeing them with stern suspicion.

                                     HILDA
                              (outraged by Klaatu's 
                              desecration of the 
                              sacred blackboard)
                         How dare you write on that blackboard!
                              (Klaatu eyes her mildly)
                         Do you realize the Professor has 
                         been working on that problem for 
                         weeks?

                                     KLAATU
                              (pleasantly)
                         He'll catch on to it in no time now.

                                     HILDA
                              (controlling herself 
                              with an effort)
                         How did you get in here? And what do 
                         you want?

                                     KLAATU
                         We came to see Professor Barnhardt.

                                     HILDA
                         Well, he's not here. And he won't be 
                         back till this evening.
                              (sternly)
                         I think you'd better leave now. 
                         Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk 
                         and scribbles something on a scratch 
                         pad. He tears off the piece of paper 
                         and hands it to Hilda.

                                     KLAATU
                         You might keep this.
                              (with easy assurance)
                         I think the professor will want to 
                         get in touch with me.

               With a polite nod he goes out the French doors, followed by 
               Bobby. Hilda eyes the door for a moment, then glances down 
               at the paper in her hand, disturbed and puzzled by this 
               stranger. Her glance wanders to the blackboard and she picks 
               up an eraser, debating whether to erase Klaatu's corrections. 
               At that moment the French door opens and Klaatu sticks his 
               head in. Startled, Hilda drops the eraser.

                                     KLAATU
                              (pointing to the 
                              blackboard)
                         I wouldn't erase that. The Professor 
                         needs it very badly.

               And he disappears, leaving Hilda to glare after him in 
               impotent rage. Deciding that this man is either a crackpot 
               or a menace, she goes to the telephone on the desk and starts 
               dialing a number.

               EXT. BARNHARDT'S HOUSE - MED. SHOT

               as Klaatu and Bobby come down the steps and turn into the 
               sidewalk. They are talking and laughing together, but we 
               can't hear their conversation. CAMERA PANS with them as they 
               move on up the sidewalk, revealing two kids playing hopscotch. 
               Klaatu watches, fascinated, as he walks by. Then, having 
               passed the kids, he tries the one-footed, then two-footed 
               hop that characterizes the game.

               INT. BARNHARDT'S STUDY

               Hilda is talking on the phone.

                                     HILDA
                         --no, Sergeant, there was no 
                         classified material around, but I 
                         have instructions to report anything 
                         unusual to the police... Yes -- I'm 
                         Professor Barnhardt's secretary.
                              (consulting the paper 
                              in her hand)
                         The man's name is Carpenter -- and 
                         he lives at 1615 St. Street, N.W... 
                         Yes, that's right--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - LONG SHOT - DAY

               Bobby and Klaatu come out of a wooded path into a section of 
               the cemetery where the myriad crosses seem to reach into 
               infinity. They pause for a moment, then Bobby leads the way 
               through one of the rows.

               EXT. ARLINGTON CEMETERY - CLOSE SHOT

               in one of the many rows are crosses that extend beyond CAMERA 
               RANGE. CAMERA MOVES IN on one of the crosses. It bears the 
               name LT. ROBERT BENSON.

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND B0BBY

               as they come into scene and look down at the grave.

                                     BOBBY
                         That's my father.
                              (Klaatu glances at 
                              the boy, then nods 
                              understandingly)
                         He was killed at a place called Anzio.

               Klaatu's glance roves out thoughtfully to the infinite rows 
               of crosses, and his eyes are sad as they return to Bobby.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. ARLINGTON CEMETERY - MED. SHOT - DAY

               Klaatu and Bobby are approaching a bench beside a pathway 
               overhung with trees. Bobby leads the way to the bench and 
               they sit down. Klaatu's eyes stray out to the myriad crosses.

                                     KLAATU
                              (Reflectively)
                         Did all these people die in wars?

                                     BOBBY
                              (somewhat surprised)
                         Sure. Didn't you ever hear of 
                         Arlington Cemetery?

                                     KLAATU
                         No -- I'm afraid not.

                                     BOBBY
                              (very serious)
                         Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to 
                         know about anything.

                                     KLAATU
                              (Amused)
                         I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been 
                         away for a long time. Very far away.

                                     BOBBY
                         Is it different where you've been?
                              (indicating the 
                              cemetery)
                         Don't they have places like this?

                                     KLAATU
                              (slowly)
                         They have cemeteries. But not like 
                         this one... You see, they don't have 
                         any wars.

               Bobby looks at him, puzzled and impressed by this 
               incomprehensible notion.

                                     BOBBY
                         Gee -- that's a good idea.

               His eyes are drawn subconsciously out to the rows of crosses. 
               Then he turns back to Klaatu with a slow-dawning look of 
               curiosity, and Klaatu deliberately changes the subject.

                                     KLAATU
                         What would you like to do this 
                         afternoon?

               After a moment Bobby's expression changes and he breaks into 
               a broad grin.

                                     BOBBY
                         Go to the movies.

                                     KLAATU
                         All right.

                                     BOBBY
                              (he didn't dare hope 
                              for this)
                         No foolin'? Will you?

                                     KLAATU
                         Certainly.
                              (then he hesitates)
                         Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to 
                         have money to go there?

               Bobby gives him a look of amazement, then grins, assuming 
               Klaatu was kidding and simply hasn't any money.

                                     BOBBY
                              (eagerly)
                         I've got some money. My mother gave 
                         me two dollars.

                                     KLAATU
                         No -- I want to take you to the 
                         movies.
                              (he takes some objects 
                              out of his pocket)
                         Do you think they'd accept these?

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU'S HAND

               Sparkling in his palm are eight or ten cut diamonds of various 
               sizes.

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

               The boy is staring at the stones in wide-eyed amazement.

                                     BOBBY
                         Gee -- those look like diamonds!

                                     KLAATU
                         Some places that's what people use 
                         for money. They're easy to carry -- 
                         and they don't wear out.

                                     BOBBY
                              (staring at them 
                              fascinated)
                         Bet they're worth about a million 
                         dollars.

                                     KLAATU
                         Would you give me your two dollars 
                         for a couple of them?

                                     BOBBY
                              (with a nervous, unsure 
                              smile)
                         Well, sure, but--

               The boy studies Klaatu's face to see if he's kidding. 
               Realizing that he's not, Bobby's face takes on a childishly 
               shrewd expression -- as though he were about to trade a 
               jackknife for an ocean liner.

                                     BOBBY
                              (slowly)
                         Okay.

               The boy takes out two dollar bills and offers them almost 
               challengingly. Klaatu takes the bills and hands Bobby two 
               good-sized Diamonds. They study their new acquisitions with 
               interest. Bobby looks up from his diamonds to steal a guilty 
               glance at Klaatu.

                                     BOBBY
                         Let's not say anything to my mother 
                         about this, Mr. Carpenter.

                                     KLAATU
                              (mildly curious)
                         Why not, Bobby?

                                     BOBBY
                              (gravely)
                         She doesn't like me to steal from 
                         people.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE STREET - MED. SHOT - NIGHT

               Shooting toward the curb as a police prowl car drives up and 
               stops in front of the boardinghouse. A Detective in 
               plainclothes gets out and gestures to the uniformed Driver 
               to pull up the street a way and wait. The Driver nods and 
               the car moves off as the Detective crosses the sidewalk to 
               the boardinghouse.

               EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE - MED. CLOSE SHOT

               As the Detective mounts the steps he glances through a window 
               into the living room. Klaatu can be seen reading to Bobby, 
               who is perched happily on the arm of Klaatu's chair. The 
               Detective moves to the front door ant rings the bell. There 
               is the sound of running feet and in a moment the door is 
               opened and Bobby appears.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Mr. Carpenter come home yet?

                                     BOBBY
                              (studying the man 
                              curiously)
                         Yeah -- he's right inside.

               INT. DOWNSTAIRS - BOARDINGHOUSE

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Tell him I'd like to see him.

                                     BOBBY
                              (calling out)
                         Mr. Carpenter--!
                              (to the Detective)
                         Come on in.

               The Detective steps inside and Bobby closes the door, as 
               Klaatu appears from the living room.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Your name Carpenter?

                                     KLAATU
                              (puzzled that anyone 
                              should know him)
                         Yes.
                              (then recalling, with 
                              a smile of 
                              satisfaction)
                         Oh -- I suppose Professor Barnhardt's 
                         looking far me.

                                     DETECTIVE
                              (dryly, with grim 
                              emphasis)
                         I been looking for you all afternoon.

               EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE STREET - MED. SHOT - NIGHT

               An inexpensive convertible -- a 1948 Ford, or Chevrolet -- 
               drives up and stops in front of the house. Helen and Tom are 
               in it.

               INT. CONVERTABLE - TW0 SHOT - HELEN AND TOM

               You get the feeling that Helen and Ton have spent a very 
               enjoyable day together and are reluctant to say goodnight. 
               Tom puts his arm around her and kisses her.

                                     HELEN
                              (fondly)
                         It was a wonderful day.

                                     TOM
                         You still haven't answered my 
                         question.

                                     HELEN
                              (warmly sincere)
                         You know how I feel, Tom. I just 
                         want to think it over.

                                     TOM
                         The boss is leaving for Chicago 
                         tomorrow. If I could tell him I was 
                         getting married -- with two dependents--

                                     HELEN
                              (smiling)
                         You're a good salesman -- but I've 
                         got to think about it.

                                     TOM
                         A good insurance salesman wouldn't 
                         give you time to think.

               With a smile and, a quick kiss, Helen gets out of the car.

                                     HELEN
                         'Night.

               MED. SHOT

               as Helen turns and hurries across the sidewalk to the house. 
               In the entrance she turns and waves to Tom. He waves back 
               and drives off slowly. Helen lets herself in with her key.

               INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL - BOARDINGHOUSE

               The Detective is putting on his hat and preparing to leave 
               with Klaatu as Helen enters. There is a moment of awkwardness 
               and confusion as she glances, puzzled, at the Detective. 
               Bobby runs to her and greets her excitedly.

                                     BOBBY
                         Hi Mom!

                                     HELEN
                         Hello, darling.
                              (she kisses Bobby, 
                              then turns 
                              questioningly to 
                              Klaatu and the 
                              Detective)
                         Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.

               Klaatu is uneasy but tries not to show it as he smiles in 
               greeting and introduces the Detective.

                                     KLAATU
                         Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.

                                     BOBBY
                              (Impressively)
                         Mr. Brady's a cop.

               Helen glances quickly at the Detective, then at Klaatu, 
               surprised and troubled. She turns to Bobby to cover her 
               confusion.

                                     HELEN
                              (to Bobby)
                         Did you have a nice day, dear?

                                     BOBBY
                              (enthusiastically)
                         Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, 
                         Mr. Carpenter?

                                     KLAATU
                         We certainly did.

                                     BOBBY
                         We went to the movies -- and we had 
                         ice cream cones -- and we went to 
                         see Daddy--

                                     HELEN
                              (moved and grateful, 
                              she's uneasy and 
                              concerned as she 
                              turns to Klaatu)
                         I don't know how to thank you.

                                     KLAATU
                         I enjoyed every minute of it.

                                     DETECTIVE
                              (with quiet insistence)
                         We better get goin', Mr. Carpenter.

               As Klaatu nods and prepares to follow him, Bobby speaks to 
               Klaatu.

                                     BOBBY
                         Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.

                                     KLAATU
                         We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, 
                         Bobby.

                                     BOBBY
                              (reluctantly)
                         Goodnight.

               Klaatu and the Detective nod to Helen and they go out. Helen 
               watches the door close with real concern, wondering why the 
               police want Klaatu and hoping he hasn't done anything wrong. 
               Still disturbed, she turns to lead Bobby upstairs.

                                     HELEN
                         Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.

                                     BOBBY
                              (he followers her, 
                              then hesitates)
                         Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have 
                         to go down to the police station?

                                     HELEN
                         I -- I don't know, dear... Perhaps 
                         there's some mistake.

               This satisfies him for the moment -- even though it doesn't 
               satisfy Helen. He is climbing the stairs beside her.

                                     BOBBY
                         We sure had fun today. We saw the 
                         space ship and we went to see 
                         Professor Barnhardt -- and--

                                     HELEN
                              (flashing him a 
                              puzzled, incredulous 
                              look)
                         Professor Barnhardt.

                                     BOBBY
                              (almost ignoring the 
                              interruption)
                         Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to 
                         school tomorrow?

                                     HELEN
                         Of course, dear.

                                     BOBBY
                         Aw, gee, Mom -- I had plans to play 
                         with Mr. Carpenter.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - FULL SHOT - NIGHT

               The place is crowded and there is a feeling of feverish but 
               well-ordered activity. Unidentified people who have been 
               picked up in the search for the space man are being screened 
               by the police. They are all men -- all between forty and 
               sixty years old -- and they are from all walks of life. A 
               series of desks have been arranged in a row, with signs over 
               them reading IDENTIFICATION. At each desk is a team of cops 
               and before each desk is a line of men waiting to be screened. 
               At the far end of the room Klaatu can be seen at the desk of 
               a Police Lieutenant, with the detective who picked him up.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               Shooting over the shoulders of two cops at one of the desks, 
               toward the line of people they are screening. A nondescript, 
               middle-aged vagrant stands before the desk as one of the 
               cops flips through a card file.

                                     FIRST COP
                              (to the cop beside 
                              him)
                         B.M. Alberts -- no prior arrests.

                                     SECOND COP
                              (to the vagrant)
                         No identification?
                              (the man shakes his 
                              head dully)
                         Send him over to G-2.

               The man is taken out of the line as CAMERA MOVES ON to the 
               next desk, with another pair of cops and another line. A 
               rather distinguished-looking business man is placing a sheaf 
               of identification cards and papers on the desk.

                                     BUSINESSMAN
                         My wife just arrived with my 
                         identification.

               One of the cops at the desk glances over the papers and nods 
               to the man.

                                     THIRD COP
                         That'll be all, Mr. Baxter. Sorry to 
                         bother you... Next.

               CAMERA MOVES ON to a third desk where a small, rat-faced man 
               is standing uneasily before the two cops, one of whom is 
               flipping through a card file.

                                     FOURTH COP
                         Cappo, John C?
                              (the man nods)
                         Two priors -- one for petty theft -- 
                         one for shoplifting.

                                     FIFTH COP
                              (waving the man away)
                         Okay, Jonny -- you can go.

                                     MAN
                              (with a nervous grin)
                         Sometimes a record comes in handy.
                              (and he moves off)

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT LIEUTENANT'S DESK

               A Detective Lieutenant in plain clothes is questioning Klaatu, 
               who stands beside the Detective who brought him in. The 
               Lieutenant is a rugged but dignified man about fifty, 
               intelligent and businesslike.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         The Professor's secretary says she 
                         found you in Barnhardt's room, making 
                         marks on his blackboard.

                                     KLAATU
                         I was only trying to be helpful. He 
                         was having difficulty with a problem.

               The Lieutenant exchanges a look with the Detective.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                              (sardonically)
                         Oh, I see. He was having trouble and 
                         you were helping him out.

                                     KLAATU
                              (pleasantly)
                         That's right.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                              (quietly sharp and 
                              accusing)
                         I suppose you know that Barnhardt 
                         does a lot of secret work for the 
                         Army.

                                     KLAATU
                         In this case the secret wouldn't be 
                         worth much. He doesn't know the answer 
                         himself.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                              (growing impatient)
                         But I suppose you know the answer.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a deprecating 
                              shrug)
                         It's really quite simple... The three-
                         body problem, you know.

               The lieutenant shifts in his chair, annoyed that he has to 
               deal with this madman. He glances at a report on his desk, 
               trying to control his impatience.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         Your name's Carpenter -- that right?
                              (Klaatu nods)
                         Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? 
                         Driver's license -- social security 
                         number?

                                     KLAATU
                         No -- I'm afraid not.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         Well, how do I know who you are?

                                     KLAATU
                              (secretly amused)
                         You don't.

               The Lieutenant is turning away in exasperation as a uniformed 
               cop comes into the scene.

                                     COP
                         Excuse me, Lieutenant --
                              (pointing offscene)
                         The Doc says this man needs treatment 
                         right away.

               MED. SHOT

               A man about forty-five, bloodied and badly beaten, is being 
               supported and half-carried by two policemen. A police doctor 
               is guiding them to a doorway, near which is a sign INFIRMARY. 
               The man is almost unconscious, incapable even of holding up 
               his head.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT LIEUTENANT'S DESK

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         What's the story?

                                     COP
                         Some fella caught him lookin' in a 
                         window and figured he was the space 
                         man. The whole neighborhood went 
                         crazy and they ganged up on him. 
                         Would have killed him if we hadn't 
                         come along... Turns out he was just 
                         a prowler.

               The Lieutenant grimaces his disgust and impatience with mob 
               violence.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         Okay -- book him and get him fixed 
                         up.
                              (the cops nods and 
                              goes, and the 
                              Lieutenant growls as 
                              he turns back to 
                              Klaatu and the 
                              Detective)
                         Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.

                                     KLAATU
                              (appalled by what he 
                              has seen and heard)
                         They would have killed this man?

                                     LIEUTENANT
                              (gruffly)
                         People get hysterical enough, they 
                         do anything.
                              (impatiently)
                         Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't 
                         identify yourself, I got to send you 
                         over to the Army.

                                     KLAATU
                              (pretending impatience, 
                              but actually growing 
                              concerned)
                         How long will that take?

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         They can tell right away. They've 
                         got a couple of doctors who saw this 
                         man in the hospital.
                              (to the Detective)
                         Take him over to G2.

               Really concerned now, Klaatu tries to find a way out. He 
               attempts an authoritative air.

                                     KLAATU
                         It's very important, Lieutenant, 
                         that I see Professor Barnhardt.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Come on, Mr. Carpenter--

               Shaking off the Detective's hand, Klaatu speaks to the 
               Lieutenant.

                                     KLAATU
                         May I suggest that you call the 
                         Professor?

                                     LIEUTENANT
                              (all patience gone)
                         Get going, will you, Brady -- before 
                         I get mad!

               The Detective takes Klaatu's arm and leads him toward the 
               door. As they go they pass a Military Police Captain, who 
               makes his way straight to the Lieutenant's desk.

               EXT. POLICE STATION - TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND DETECTIVE

               as they come out of the station. Klaatu hesitates a moment, 
               looks around. His face reveals nothing, but he seems to be 
               momentarily considering the idea of making a break. The 
               Detective, sensitive to such a possibility, hooks his arm 
               under Klaatu's and nods his head toward the sidewalk in silent 
               command. Klaatu allows himself to be led off.

               MED. SHOT

               as the Detective leads Klaatu across the sidewalk to the 
               curb, where a police car is standing. Parked just behind it 
               is an Army staff car.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - ENTRANCE TO POLICE STATION

               as the M.P. Captain appears in the entrance, accompanied by 
               the Police Lieutenant. They see Klaatu and the Detective 
               approaching the police car and hurry out of scene after them.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT POLICE CAR

                                     LIEUTENANT
                              (to the Detective)
                         Wait a minute, Brady--
                              (indicating orders in 
                              his hand)
                         The Captain here's got orders from 
                         General Cutler to take this man over 
                         to Professor Barnhardt.

                                     M.P. CAPTAIN
                              (to Klaatu firmly but 
                              respectfully)
                         Will you come with me, Sir?

               MED. SHOT

               as Klaatu gets out of the police car and the Captain escorts 
               him toward the staff car. Passing the Lieutenant, Klaatu 
               speaks with a polite smile, a smile that might be one of 
               mild triumph.

                                     KLAATU
                         Sorry to trouble you, Lieutenant.

               The Lieutenant reacts with impatient exasperation as the 
               Captain holds the staff car door open for Klaatu, who steps 
               into the Army vehicle, as we--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. HALLWAY - BARNHARDT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               as the M.P. Captain and Klaatu enter the front door, which 
               is held open for then by Hilda. She gestures them toward the 
               half-open door of Barnhardt's study, where Barnhardt can be 
               seen puzzling over the problem on the blackboard. The Captain 
               knocks on the open door to attract his attention and enters 
               with Klaatu.

               INT. BARNHARDT'S STUDY

               Barnhardt turns from his deep preoccupation at the blackboard, 
               chalk in hand.

                                     M.P. CAPTAIN
                         This is the man you wanted to see, 
                         Professor.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (studying Klaatu 
                              curiously)
                         Thank you, Captain.

                                     M.P. CAPTAIN
                         I'll wait outside.

               He steps out into the hall, closing the door. Barnhardt 
               continues to study Klaatu for a moment, then points to the 
               notations he made on the blackboard. There is a controlled 
               but anxious excitement in Barnhardt's attitude.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         You wrote this?

                                     KLAATU
                              (nodding easily)
                         It was a clumsy way to introduce 
                         myself -- but I understand you're a 
                         difficult man to see.
                              (glancing at the 
                              blackboard 
                              reproachfully)
                         I thought you'd have the solution by 
                         this time.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Not yet. That's why I wanted to see 
                         you.

               Klaatu glances at the work Barnhardt has been doing on the 
               board. Then he points to one of the expressions in an 
               equation.

                                     KLAATU
                         All you have to do now is substitute 
                         this expression--
                              (pointing to a specific 
                              place)
                         --at this point.

               Impressed and interested, Barnhardt tugs at his chin as he 
               studies and weighs the results.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (slowly, thoughtfully)
                         Yes -- that will reproduce the first-
                         order terms. But what about the effect 
                         of the other terms?

                                     KLAATU
                         Almost negligible... With variation 
                         of parameters, this is the answer.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         How can you be so sure? Have you 
                         tested this theory?

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a slight smile)
                         I find it works well enough to get 
                         me from one planet to another.
                              (Barnhardt stares at 
                              him blankly)
                         I understand you've called a meeting 
                         to study our space ship.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         As though unsure of what he's heard) 
                         Yes -- yes, I have.

                                     KLAATU
                         My name is Klaatu.
                              (noting that 
                              Barnhardt's expression 
                              is changing from 
                              amazement to 
                              incredulity)
                         I spent two days at your Walter Reed 
                         Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name 
                         was Major White -- and I had a very 
                         attractive nurse called Ruth, who's 
                         getting married next Wednesday.
                              (Klaatu waits for 
                              this to sink in, 
                              then speaks with 
                              quiet authority)
                         If you are not interested -- or if 
                         you intend to turn me over to your 
                         Army -- we needn't waste any more 
                         time.

               Barnhardt hesitates for a long, thoughtful moment. Then he 
               goes to the door, opens it and speaks to the Captain outside.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (to the Captain, his 
                              voice a little 
                              unsteady)
                         You can go now, Captain. Please thank 
                         General Cutler and tell him -- tell 
                         him that I know this gentleman.

               Barnhardt closes the door and turns to find Klaatu watching 
               him with a faint smile. Barnhardt sinks into a chair, trying 
               to adjust his mind.

                                     KLAATU
                              (dryly)
                         You have faith, Professor Barnhardt

                                     BARNHARDT
                         It isn't faith that makes good 
                         science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.
                              (unable to conceal 
                              his interest)
                         Sit down, please. I have several 
                         thousand questions to ask you.

                                     KLAATU
                              (ignoring the 
                              invitation)
                         I would like to explain something of 
                         my mission here.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         That was my first question.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with some bitterness)
                         It was my intention to discuss this 
                         officially -- with all the nations 
                         of the Earth -- but I was not allowed 
                         the Opportunity. I have come to 
                         realize since that your mutual fears 
                         and suspicions are merely the normal 
                         reactions of a primitive society.
                              (gathering his thoughts)
                         We know from scientific observation 
                         that you have discovered a rudimentary 
                         kind of atomic energy. We also know 
                         that you are experimenting with 
                         rockets.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Yes -- that is true.

                                     KLAATU
                         In the hands of a mature civilization, 
                         these would not be considered weapons 
                         of aggression. But in the hands of 
                         your people--
                              (he shrugs and shakes 
                              his head)
                         We've observed your aggressive 
                         tendencies, and we don't trust you 
                         with such power.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (puzzled)
                         If you mean that you are afraid of 
                         us--

                                     KLAATU
                              (with cool impressive 
                              emphasis)
                         We want to be sure you don't make -- 
                         let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. 
                         We know the potentiality of these 
                         developments and we are disturbed to 
                         find them in the hands of children... 
                         You see, we've had atomic energy for 
                         five thousand of your years.
                              (indicating the 
                              telephone)
                         We discarded instruments like this 
                         many centuries ago.
                              (he paces thoughtfully)
                         So long as you were limited to 
                         fighting among yourselves -- with 
                         your primitive tanks and planes -- 
                         we were unconcerned. But soon you 
                         will apply atomic energy to space 
                         ships -- and then you become a threat 
                         to the peace and security of other 
                         planets. That, of course, we cannot 
                         tolerate.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (thoughtful and 
                              impressed)
                         These other planets -- do they have 
                         peace and security?

                                     KLAATU
                         We had our atomic wars -- thousands 
                         of years ago.
                              (he smiles wryly)
                         After that we fought with bows and 
                         arrows. Then, slowly, we learned 
                         that fighting is no solution -- that 
                         aggression leads to chaos.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (with deep conviction)
                         We scientists understand this. Even 
                         we primitive scientists.
                              (Straightforwardly)
                         What exactly is the nature of your 
                         mission, Mr. Klaatu?

                                     KLAATU
                         I came here to warn you that, by 
                         threatening danger, your planet faces 
                         danger -- very grave danger. I am 
                         prepared, however, to offer a 
                         solution.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Would you care to be more specific?

                                     KLAATU
                              (evenly)
                         What I have to say must be said to 
                         all concerned.
                              (with a suggestion of 
                              deference to Barnhardt)
                         It is too important to be entrusted 
                         to any individual.

               Barnhardt is forced reluctantly to accept Klaatu's refusal 
               to go any further. After a moment's thought, he speaks 
               seriously, but with a twinkle in his eye.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         I gather that your efforts on the 
                         official level were not entirely 
                         successful.

                                     KLAATU
                              (sternly, as this 
                              unpleasant episode 
                              is recalled)
                         I come to you as a last resort -- 
                         and I confess that my patience is 
                         wearing thin.
                              (with Jovian annoyance)
                         Must I take drastic action in order 
                         to get a hearing?

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (uneasily)
                         What -- what sort of action do you 
                         mean?

                                     KLAATU
                         Violent action -- since that seems 
                         to be the only thing you people 
                         understand.
                              (quietly)
                         Leveling the island of Manhattan, 
                         perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of 
                         Gibraltar into the sea.

               Barnhardt stands staring at him for a moment, passes his 
               hand across his brow. Then, as Klaatu watches, Barnhardt 
               paces the floor, trying to digest what he has heard. After a 
               moment, he turns to Klaatu.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Would you be willing to meet with 
                         the group of scientists I am calling 
                         together?. Perhaps you could explain 
                         your mission to them, and they in 
                         turn could present it to their various 
                         peoples.

                                     KLAATU
                              (quietly, evenly)
                         That's what I came to see you about.

               Barnhardt flings him a glance, then looks momentarily 
               sheepish. But his own eagerness carries him on. He paces the 
               floor thoughtfully.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         It is not enough to have men of 
                         science. We scientists are too easily 
                         ignored -- or misunderstood. We must 
                         get important men from every field. 
                         Educators -- philosophers -- church 
                         leaders -- men of vision and 
                         imagination -- the finest minds in 
                         the world.

                                     KLAATU
                         I leave that in your hands.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         You'd have no objection to revealing 
                         yourself at this meeting?

                                     KLAATU
                         No -- not at all.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         What about your personal safety in 
                         the meantime? What about the Army -- 
                         and the police?

                                     KLAATU
                         My name is Carpenter and I'm a very 
                         earthy character living in a 
                         respectable boarding house.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (smiling, but a little 
                              concerned)
                         I'm afraid I can't offer you any 
                         real protection. I have no influence 
                         in cases of inter-planetary 
                         conspiracy.

                                     KLAATU
                         I'm sure I'll be quite safe until 
                         the meeting.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (he suddenly pauses, 
                              thoughtfully)
                         One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this 
                         group should reject your proposals. 
                         What is the alternative?

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a sense of quiet, 
                              inescapable power)
                         I'm afraid you have no alternative. 
                         In such, a case the planet Earth 
                         would have to be--
                              (he looks for the 
                              right word)
                         --eliminated.

               The implications of this statement leave Barnhardt speechless, 
               his keen mind reeling.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Such power exists?

                                     KLAATU
                         I assure you such power exists.

               Barnhardt stands silent for a moment, trying to collect his 
               shattered thoughts. Klaatu watches him as he starts pacing 
               again.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         The people who came to the meeting 
                         must be made to realize this. They 
                         must understand what is at stake.
                              (after a thoughtful 
                              moment, he looks up)
                         You mentioned a demonstration of 
                         force--

                                     KLAATU
                         Yes.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Would such, a demonstration be 
                         possible before the meeting?

                                     KLAATU
                         Yes -- of course.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Something that would dramatize for 
                         them and for their people the 
                         seriousness of the situation. 
                         Something that would affect the entire 
                         planet.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a nod)
                         That can easily be arranged.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (frightened by his 
                              easy assumption of 
                              infinite power)
                         I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- 
                         or destroy anything.

                                     KLAATU
                              (easily)
                         Why don't you leave it to me? I'll 
                         think of something.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (with a nervous half-
                              smile)
                         Maybe a little demonstration.

                                     KLAATU
                              (thinking about it)
                         Something dramatic -- but not 
                         destructive.
                              (intellectually amused)
                         It's quite an interesting problem.
                              (Barnhardt nods vaguely)
                         Would day after tomorrow be all right? 
                         Say about noon?

               Klaatu's bland manner leaves Barnhardt shaken, almost wishing 
               he'd never started this business.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               INT. LIVING ROOM - BOARDINGHOUSE - NIGHT

               It is about 3:30 the following evening. Helen is sitting in 
               a chair leafing through a magazine. She is dressed to go 
               out. A corner of the dining room can be seen, where Mr. and 
               Mrs. Barley are playing cards with Mr. Krull. Mrs. Crockett, 
               the landlady, enters from the hall on her way to the dining 
               room and notices Helen.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                         Going out, dear?

                                     HELEN
                         Yes, I'm waiting for Tom to pick me 
                         up.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (with a shudder)
                         Personally, I won't go out after 
                         dark these days.
                              (with an attempt at 
                              slyness)
                         But then -- I'm not courting, am I?

               She turns to go on into the dining room and as she does so 
               almost bumps into Klaatu who is coming out, having been 
               kibitzing the card game.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (thoroughly startled)
                         Oh -- Mr. Carpenter--!

               Klaatu steps aside as she hurries nervously into the dining 
               room. He turns, puzzled, to find Helen watching with a slight 
               smile.

                                     KLAATU
                         Everyone seems so--
                              (he shakes his hands 
                              to indicate 
                              nervousness)

                                     HELEN
                         Jittery is the word.

               Helen watches him, a little uneasy in his presence. She is 
               fond of him, and she can't help being curious and concerned 
               about his brush with the police.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a contemplative 
                              smile)
                         Bobby's the only person I know who 
                         isn't -- Jittery.

                                     HELEN
                         He has his homework to keep him 
                         occupied.

                                     KLAATU
                              (fondly, sincerely)
                         He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.

                                     HELEN
                         Naturally I think so.

                                     KLAATU
                         Warm and friendly and intelligent--
                              (thoughtfully)
                         You know -- he's the only real friend 
                         I've made since I've been here.

               Helen is deeply moved by Klaatu's affection for the boy, She 
               tried to dismiss her curiosity about him, but she can't. She 
               decides to face it.

                                     HELEN
                              (hesitantly and with 
                              some difficulty)
                         Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my 
                         business, but -- why did that 
                         detective come here last night?

                                     KLAATU
                              (with easy frankness)
                         Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a 
                         few questions. Bobby and I tried to 
                         see Professor Barnhardt in the 
                         afternoon, but he wasn't in. 
                         Apparently they thought I was looking 
                         for secrets of some kind.

               Helen has reacted in puzzlement at this second mention of 
               Barnhardt. They are interrupted by the ringing of the 
               doorbell. Helen goes to answer it.

               INT. HALLWAY

               as Helen opens the front door to admit Tom. He appears 
               impatient, anxious to get going.

                                     HELEN
                         Hello--

                                     TOM
                         You ready?

                                     HELEN
                         I will be in just a minute.

                                     TOM
                              (a little annoyed 
                              that she hasn't her 
                              coat on, he consults 
                              his watch)
                         The picture starts at eight-fifty.

                                     HELEN
                              (in explanation)
                         I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.

                                     TOM
                              (lightly, but with 
                              real sarcasm 
                              underneath)
                         I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm 
                         intruding.

               Helen tries to shush him, to indicate Klaatu is in the next 
               room, when Klaatu appears in the doorway. He must have heard 
               Tom's remark, and there is an awkward moment. Klaatu is 
               completely unperturbed, but Helen is embarrassed.

                                     KLAATU
                         Excuse me. I was just going up to my 
                         room.

                                     HELEN
                              (guiltily)
                         Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.

               Klaatu stops and turns to face them pleasantly.

                                     KLAATU
                         Have a good time -- both of you.

               He goes on up the stairs. Helen steers Tom toward the living 
               room.

                                     HELEN
                         Why don't you wait in here while I 
                         get my things?

               INT. LIVING ROOM

               As they enter from the hall, Helen turns to Tom reproachfully.

                                     HELEN
                              (quietly)
                         Oh, Tom, that was awful.

                                     TOM
                              (momentary apologetic)
                         I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of 
                         hearing about Mr. Carpenter.
                              (Helen shushes him)
                         I don't like the way he's attached 
                         himself to you and Bobby. After all, 
                         what do you know about him?

               This touches on Helen's own private doubts, and she cannot 
               answer.

                                     HELEN
                         I'll go get my things.

               She turns quickly and goes into the hall and hurries up the 
               stairs. Tom looks after her, dismissing the matter with a 
               shake of the head and a philosophical sigh. Of such stuff 
               are women made.

               INT - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

               Helen reaches the top of the stairs, crosses to her room and 
               grabs a coat off the bed. She's putting it on as she moves 
               down the hall to Bobby's room, the door of which is open.

               INT. BOBBY'S ROOM

               Bobby is at a table doing his homework and Klaatu has just 
               finished explaining an arithmetic problem to him, as Helen 
               enters, still putting on her coat.

                                     KLAATU
                              (about to leave)
                         All you have to remember is, first 
                         find the common denominator -- then 
                         subtract.

                                     BOBBY
                         Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.

                                     KLAATU
                              (to Helen, pleasantly)
                         I'll say goodnight again.

               Helen is embarrassed. She would like to apologize for the 
               awkwardness downstairs but she doesn't quite know how to go 
               about it.

                                     HELEN
                         Mr. Carpenter, I--
                              (it's too complicated; 
                              she can't do it)
                         Goodnight.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a warm smile of 
                              complete understanding 
                              and appreciation)
                         Goodnight, my dear.

               He turns and goes out, closing the door. A little distracted, 
               Helen turns to Bobby.

                                     HELEN
                         Go to bed, darling. You can finish 
                         that in the morning.

                                     BOBBY
                         Okay.

               Helen watches as he starts to put away his work. She wants 
               to tell him something, but finds it difficult to say.

                                     HELEN
                              (hesitantly, almost 
                              guiltily)
                         Bobby -- I think it would be better 
                         if we didn't see quite so much of 
                         Mr. Carpenter

                                     BOBBY
                              (shocked, and 
                              bewildered)
                         Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... 
                         And he's awful good in arithmetic. 
                         He even helps Professor Barnhardt.

                                     HELEN
                         Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go 
                         to see Professor Barnhardt?

                                     BOBBY
                         Sure we did! He wasn't there but we 
                         went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter 
                         showed him how to do his arithmetic.

               Helen is surprised to get this corroboration for Klaatu's 
               story. Sensing his mother's uneasiness, the boy looks for 
               something intriguing -- some deep, dark secret.

                                     BOBBY
                              (shrewdly)
                         Mom -- is there something wrong with 
                         Mr. Carpenter?

                                     HELEN
                         What do you mean, dear?

                                     BOBBY
                         I mean -- on account of that policeman 
                         last night.
                              (his eyes light up 
                              hopefully)
                         You think he's a bank robber, maybe? 
                         Or a gangster?

                                     HELEN
                         No, dear, of course not. He's a very 
                         nice man. I Just think he might prefer 
                         to be left alone. Now you get to bed 
                         and forget about it.
                              (she kisses him)
                         'Night, darling.

               With a reassuring smile, she starts for the door.

                                     BOBBY
                         Goodnight.
                              (stopping her in the 
                              doorway, his 
                              imaginative suspicions 
                              mounting)
                         Hey Mom -- why would he want to be 
                         alone?

               Not wanting to go into this any further, Helen blows him a 
               kiss and backs out, closing the door. Bobby stands thinking 
               for a moment, his mind still speculating on all sorts of 
               wonderful possibilities. Still preoccupied, he drifts over 
               to his bed and sits down to take of his shoes. He drops the 
               first one to the floor and is starting on the other, when 
               there is a light rap on his door. The door opens and Klaatu 
               appears.

                                     KLAATU
                         Bobby -- have you a flashlight?

                                     BOBBY
                              (surprised by his 
                              appearance and his 
                              request)
                         Yeah -- sure.
                              (he goes to a drawer 
                              and gets a large 
                              hand flashlight)
                         It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.

               Bobby hands him the light, studying his face with eager 
               curiosity.

                                     BOBBY
                         What do you want it for, Mr. 
                         Carpenter?

                                     KLAATU
                              (evasively)
                         Why -- the light in my room went 
                         out.
                              (cutting off further 
                              questions)
                         Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.

               Klaatu goes out, closing the door behind him. Bobby hesitates 
               a moment, puzzled and curious. Then he goes over to the door, 
               flips off the lights, and slowly, noiselessly opens the door 
               a crack so he can peer out into the hall.

               MED. SHOT

               shooting down the hall through the crack in Bobby's door.

               Klaatu's door is ajar and through it the lights in his room 
               can be seen burning brightly. Klaatu goes to his door, reaches 
               in and flips off the lights and closes the door. He then 
               scans the hall in both directions. Satisfied he isn't seen, 
               he moves surreptitiously down the hall toward the stairs, 
               still carrying the flashlight.

               MED CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               as he closes his door carefully, an expression of intense 
               excitement on his face. What he has seem is certainly, 
               unmistakably suspicious. Why did Mr. Carpenter lie to him? 
               What does he want the flashlight for and where is he going? 
               Bobby decides he's got to find out. Hurriedly he laces on 
               the shoe he had taken off, and peers out the door to find 
               the hall clear. He slips out the door, closing it behind 
               him.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. STREET - MED. CLOSE SHOT - NIGHT

               Klaatu is walking down the dark, semi-deserted street with 
               the determined stride of a man with a definite objective.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               Half a block behind, he's following Klaatu, eagerly, flushed 
               with a sense of excitement and adventure.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER - NIGHT

               Walking along the sidewalk, Klaatu turns into a side street, 
               disappearing from view around the corner. In a moment, Bobby 
               hurries into scene breathlessly. He pulls up for a moment to 
               rest. Then, getting his breath, he dashes on around the corner 
               after Klaatu.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. LARGE TEMPORARY BUILDING - LONG SHOT - NIGHT

               This is a temporary structure that has been erected to enclose 
               the space ship and Gort. In front of the one small door are 
               two soldiers, standing guard. Concealed in some foreground 
               foliage, studying the layout, is Klaatu. Nearby 's a sign 
               reading: KEEP OUT! This area OFF LIMITS to the public. U.S. 
               ARMY.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               He is a short distance away, watching Klaatu eagerly.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               as he studies the situation.

               MED. SHOT

               shooting over Klaatu's shoulder. As he watches, a Jeep filled 
               with armed soldiers -- apparently regular patrol -- drives 
               up to the entrance of the building. They stop for a moment 
               while their Sergeant checks with the guards. Assured that 
               everything is under control, the Sergeant signals his driver 
               and the Jeep moves off.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               Scanning the side of the building, he sees what he's looking 
               for. Waiting until the Jeep disappears, he starts toward one 
               side of the building, keeping himself concealed in the 
               foliage.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               puzzled and interested, as he watches Klaatu.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               The two sentries standing in front of the building.

               MED. SHOT

               as Klaatu maneuvers around the side of the building, where 
               there is a window. It has no glass in it but is heavily 
               barred.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               as he leaves the concealing foliage and crosses the clear, 
               grassy area surrounding the building. He stops and tries to 
               see through the window.

               MED. SHOT - GORT

               shooting through the barred window into the building. The 
               huge robot looms large and eerie in the shadows cast by a 
               couple of naked work-lights. His head is angled, away from 
               the window.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               as Klaatu approaches the window. Aiming his flashlight at 
               Gort, he flashes the light intermittently, as though 
               signaling. (This should not approximate any known code.)

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               As we watch, the intermittent flashes of Klaatu's light appear 
               on the wall ahead of Gort. Slowly, evenly, the robot's head 
               turns to face the window.

               MED. SHOT

               from Gort's viewpoint, of the window, with Klaatu's light 
               flashing its signals.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               shooting on his back, as he finishes signaling and cuts off 
               the flashlight. He turns ant starts back for the concealment 
               of the foliage.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               craning his neck to look for Klaatu, who has eluded his view. 
               Suddenly he sees Klaatu again.

               MED. SHOT - KLAATU

               making his way behind the foliage toward the front of the 
               building. Arriving at a point opposite the entrance, Klaatu 
               waits and watches.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - ENTRANCE TO BUILDING

               The two guards are standing in the doorway in positions of 
               relaxed alertness. Suddenly, inside the building behind them, 
               the giant figure of Gort looms silently in the doorway. His 
               two great arms reach out, grab the two guards and drag then 
               back inside the building.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               He lets out an inaudible gasp as he sees this. Bug-eyed, he 
               glances quickly to the point where he last saw Klaatu. He is 
               amazed at what he sees.

               MED. SHOT

               from Bobby's viewpoint. Klaatu has emerged from the 
               concealment of the tree-lined path and is making his way 
               calmly toward the entrance of the building.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               As he watches Klaatu enter the building, his curiosity 
               conquers his fear and he starts tremblingly toward the 
               structure.

               INT. BUILDING - FULL SHOT

               as Klaatu enters. The huge shapes of the space ship and Gort 
               loom large and eerie. Klaatu starts across the barren 
               enclosure toward the ship.

               EXT. ENTRANCE TO BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT

               as Bobby approaches the door, fearful but fascinated. He 
               peers cautiously inside and his eyes grow wide as saucers.

               EXT. BUILDING - MED. SHOT

               In *f.g., near the door, the two guards lie unconscious. As 
               Klaatu walks toward the ship Gort slowly turns his head to 
               follow him with him with eyes. Klaatu touches a point on the 
               unbroken surface of the ship and the ramp silently swings 
               out and down to the ground. Klaatu mounts the ramp and 
               disappears inside the ship, whereupon the ramp silently 
               closes.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               as he watches this; his eyes bulging. He can scarcely believe 
               what he has seen. Suddenly a wave of sheer terror sweeps 
               over him. Scrambling to his feet, he turns and runs wildly 
               away.

               INT. SMALL CORRIDOR - SPACE SHIP

               CAMERA FOLLOWS Klaatu as he moves down the tiny, dimly lighted 
               entrance corridor. He steps into the main cabin of the ship 
               and flips a switch which bathes the cabin in a diffused, 
               shadowless light. The walls are lined with a complex of 
               mysterious gadgetry -- knobs, dials, indicators, etc. All of 
               this should be as imaginative and unorthodox as possible, 
               while still retaining a feeling of sound but highly advanced 
               engineering.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               as Klaatu moves to the communications panel, flipping switches 
               and turning dials. Indicators light up. There are crackling, 
               whirring and buzzing sounds. Klaatu starts speaking into a 
               built-in microphone in his own strange language. He speaks 
               in rapid-fire explanation, continuing to talk, as we--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BUILDING - MED. SHOT - NIGHT

               as Klaatu walks calmly away from the ship, past the two 
               unconscious guards and disappears out of the door.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT THE TWO GUARDS

               as one of them slowly regains consciousness. Looking around, 
               he sees the great figure of Gort and is terror-stricken. He 
               shakes his companion frantically in an effort to bring him 
               to.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. LIVING ROOM BOARDINGHOUSE NIGHT

               Bobby is curled up in a chair waiting for his mother to come 
               home. He's sleepy, but the excitement of what he has seen 
               precluded any such possibility. From the hall we hear the 
               front door opening as Helen and Tom come in.

                                     HELEN'S VOICE
                              (off scene)
                         Why don't you come on in for a minute?

               Helen and Tom appear in the doorway, Helen is startled to 
               see Bobby, who has Jumped up and run toward her.

                                     HELEN
                         Bobby--! What are you doing up at 
                         this hour?

                                     BOBBY
                              (excitedly)
                         I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had 
                         to tell you!

                                     HELEN
                         Tell me what?

                                     BOBBY
                              (the words tadpole 
                              out breathlessly)
                         I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right 
                         after you left -- and, gee, Mom, 
                         where do you think he went? Right 
                         into the space ship!

                                     HELEN
                              (patiently disbelieving)
                         Now, Bobby, just a minute--

                                     BOBBY
                         Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened 
                         up and he walked right in. And that 
                         great big iron man was moving around!

                                     HELEN
                         Bobby, you've been dreaming again.

                                     BOBBY
                              (desperately)
                         No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... 
                         I saw it!

               Helen and Tom exchange a glance of tolerant amusement.

                                     TOM
                         Where did you see all this, Bobby?

                                     BOBBY
                         On the lawn down at the mall -- in 
                         that place with the soldiers out 
                         front.

                                     TOM
                              (trying to trap him)
                         Where were the soldiers all this 
                         time?

                                     BOBBY
                         That robot fella grabbed 'em and 
                         dragged 'em inside!
                              (his lips trembling)
                         I like Mr. Carpenter -- but I'm 
                         scared, Mom.

               He rushes into Helen's arms, clutching her desperately, trying 
               to hold back his tears.

                                     HELEN
                              (holding him close to 
                              her sympathetically)
                         Mustn't be frightened, darling -- It 
                         was just a bad dream. Here -- we'll 
                         prove it to you.
                              (with a look and a 
                              nod to Tom)
                         Tom, will you ask Mr. Carpenter if 
                         he'll come down for a minute.
                              (Tom turns to go)
                         The room right opposite mine.

               Nodding, Tom disappears into the hall and up the stairs. 
               Still holding Bobby, Helen tries to dispel his fears by an 
               appeal to logic.

                                     HELEN
                         Now think back hard. You didn't follow 
                         Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You 
                         haven't even been out of the house.

                                     BOBBY
                         Yes, I have!

                                     HELEN
                              (determinedly)
                         You didn't really see the space ship. 
                         You just thought you did.

               Bitterly hurt, Bobby faces his mother gravely, accusingly.

                                     BOBBY
                         I'd never call you a liar.

               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MED. CLOSE SHOT

               Tom is knocking softly at Klaatu's door. Getting no answer, 
               he tries the door, pushes it open and peers in. Then he steps 
               into the darkened room.

               INT. KLAATU'S ROOM - FULL SHOT

               Tom snaps on the light and looks around the empty room. The 
               bed is still made. Glancing around, Tom's eye is caught by a 
               flash of something bright on the floor below the dresser. He 
               stoops down and picks up a fair-sized diamond. Tom studies 
               the stone curiously, holding it up to the light. Thoroughly 
               puzzled, he keeps the stone in his hand, switches off the 
               light and goes out.

               UPSTAIRS HALL - MED. SHOT

               Closing the door, Tom hurries along the hall and down the 
               stairs

               INT. LIVING ROOM - FULL SHOT

               Through the hall door Tom can be seen coming down the stairs. 
               Helen and Bobby watch expectantly as he enters.

                                     TOM
                         He's not there.
                              (crossing to Helen)
                         But look what I found in his room

                                     HELEN
                              (takes the stone and 
                              studies it, amazed 
                              by its size)
                         Is it real?

                                     TOM
                              (with the shrug of an 
                              amateur)
                         Looks real to me.

                                     BOBBY
                         Mr. Carpenter's got a lot of diamonds.
                              (he digs into his 
                              pocket)
                         He gave me a couple of them.

               Helen takes the two diamonds Bobby holds out in his hand, 
               looking at them in amazement.

                                     HELEN
                         He gave these to you?

                                     BOBBY
                              (guilty for his own 
                              sharp dealing)
                         Well, not exactly. I gave him two 
                         dollars.

                                     TOM
                         This doesn't make sense... I think 
                         the guy's a crook. I never did trust 
                         him.

               Helen tries to shush Tom, not wanting to re-stimulate Bobby's 
               imagination, but it's too late.

                                     BOBBY
                         Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a 
                         diamond smuggler?

                                     HELEN
                              (firmly)
                         Come on, darling -- we're going up 
                         to bed.

                                     TOM
                         I wonder if we ought to--

                                     HELEN
                              (cutting him off with 
                              a look)
                         Bobby and I have had enough excitement 
                         for tonight.

                                     TOM
                              (seriously concerned)
                         You think it's all right for you to 
                         stay here?

                                     HELEN
                              (nods reassuringly)
                         I've got a good lock on my door.
                              (smiling at Bobby)
                         And Bobby's going to sleep in my 
                         room tonight.

                                     BOBBY
                         Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?

                                     HELEN
                         Yes, dear. Come on now.
                              (she happens to look 
                              down at his feet. 
                              Puzzled, and 
                              concerned, she feels 
                              his shoes)
                         Bobby, your shoes are soaking!

                                     BOBBY
                              (reluctantly, with 
                              childish guilt)
                         Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.

               As the impact of this sinks in, Helen and Tom turn to stare 
               at each other in questioning consternation.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               INT. OFFICE - DEPT. OF COMMERCE BLDG. - MED. CLOSE SHOT DAY

               It is a typical government office, with lots of desks in it. 
               Helen is at her desk, straightening it up to go to lunch. 
               This done, she moves briskly to get her coat. CAMERA PANS to 
               follow her and suddenly, startlingly reveals Klaatu standing 
               near the clothes rack, as though he had materialized out of 
               thin air. Helen is thoroughly startled.

                                     HELEN
                              (unnerved)
                         Oh -- hello--

                                     KLAATU
                         May I see you for a minute?

                                     HELEN
                         I -- I was Just going to lunch.

                                     KLAATU
                              (quietly insistent)
                         May I walk out with you?

               She is nervous and uneasy but obviously can't refuse. The 
               telephone on her desk rings and Helen turns to answer it.

                                     HELEN
                              (into phone)
                         Mrs. Benson speaking.
                              (recognizing the voice, 
                              she glances nervously 
                              at Klaatu)
                         Oh, hello...

               INT. JEWELRY SHOP - MED. CLOSE SHOT

               It's a rather swank shop. Tom is standing at the counter 
               phoning. The Jeweler is behind the counter examining a stone 
               through his eyepiece.

                                     TOM
                              (into phone, cheerily)
                         I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal 
                         on that diamond. I thought we might 
                         have lunch together.

               INT. OFFICE - DEPT. OF COMMERCE - MED. CLOSE SHOT

                                     HELEN
                              (with a nervous glance 
                              at Klaatu)
                         I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right 
                         now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, 
                         that'll be fine. 'Bye.

               She hangs up and smiles uneasily as she rejoins Klaatu and 
               leads the way out into the corridor.

               INT. CORRIDOR - TWO SHOT

               CAMERA MOVES with Helen and Klaatu as they go down the 
               corridor. Klaatu's mood is one of quiet tension.

                                     KLAATU
                              (watching Helen's 
                              reaction)
                         I saw Bobby this morning before he 
                         went to school--

                                     HELEN
                              (glancing at him 
                              apprehensively)
                         Yes--?

                                     KLAATU
                         I want to know what he told you last 
                         night.

                                     HELEN
                              (nervous and evasive)
                         I -- I didn't really pay much 
                         attention--
                              (with a nervous little 
                              laugh)
                         Bobby has such an active imagination.

                                     KLAATU
                              (refusing to be put 
                              off)
                         Did you believe what he told you?
                              (Helen hesitates, 
                              trapped by uncertainty)
                         I have a reason for asking this -- a 
                         very important reason.

               MED. SHOT

               They are approaching the elevator at the end of the corridor. 
               There is a large crowd of lunch-goers milling around the 
               elevator, which is quickly filled. Half the crowd is left as 
               the elevator doors close and it descends.

               TWO SHOT - HELEN AND KLAATU

               Nervous and distracted, Helen doesn't want to get caught up 
               in this jam.

                                     HELEN
                         There's another elevator we can use--

               She nods toward a side corridor and starts for it, Klaatu 
               following.

               MED. SHOT

               CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they turn into the side corridor. 
               Helen leads the way to a small, automatic elevator. She 
               presses the button and the doors open. Klaatu follows her 
               in.

               INT. ELEVATOR

               As Helen presses the first floor button, the doors close and 
               the elevator starts down. She turns to face Klaatu.

                                     HELEN
                              (her nerves raw and 
                              edgy)
                         What is it you want?

                                     KLAATU
                         Before I ask you to be honest with 
                         me, perhaps I should be completely 
                         honest with you--

               Without warning the elevator comes to a jolting, jarring 
               stop as the power is cut off and the lights go out. The car 
               is illuminated faintly and eerily by light that seeps through 
               the ventilating grills from a skylight in the shaft. Helen 
               is terrified.

                                     HELEN
                              (gasping with fright)
                         What happened?

                                     KLAATU
                              (a moment's hesitation; 
                              then he remembers)
                         What time is it?

               Helen fumbles to get her wrist watch into a faint beam of 
               light.

                                     HELEN
                         Just twelve.

                                     KLAATU
                         We'll be stuck here for a little 
                         while -- about thirty minutes.

                                     HELEN
                              (preoccupied with her 
                              own thinking)
                         We could try pushing the other 
                         buttons.
                              (digging in her purse)
                         I have a flashlight in my purse.

                                     KLAATU
                         It won't work.

               Helen has the flashlight out and is snapping it on, but it 
               doesn't work. She looks up at him blankly.

                                     HELEN
                         Why not?

                                     KLAATU
                              (after a moment, 
                              quietly)
                         You see -- the electricity's been 
                         neutralized -- all over the world.

               The impact of this calm, quiet statement is shattering. Helen 
               stares at him awe-struck. Then she speaks numbly, almost 
               inaudibly.

                                     HELEN
                         Bobby was telling the truth -- wasn't 
                         he?

               Klaatu stares at her evenly, as we--

               MED. SHOT - STREET

               All vehicular traffic in the street is at a dead stop. 
               Automobiles, busses, trolley cars -- all are stalled. Drivers 
               and passengers are climbing out of the vehicles in utter 
               bewilderment. Except for the people, it is as though the 
               street had been frozen in motion.

               INT. CITY POWER PLANT

               The great generators and dynamos are silent and motionless 
               in the dim, unlighted plant.

               INT. FACTORY

               A huge automobile or airplane assembly line, with nothing 
               moving, no machinery going.

               INT. PRESSROOM - METROPOLITAN NEWSPAPER

               The giant presses are threaded with newsprint, but they are 
               silent and motionless.

               INT. CONTROL ROOM - RADIO STATION

               A couple of engineers are working feverishly over a huge and 
               complicated control panel. They are working by the light of 
               two incongruous and ineffectual candles.

               INT. NEW YORK SUBWAY KIOSK

               People carne pouring up the stairs wildly, feverishly anxious 
               to escape the darkness below. Their eyes blink weakly in the 
               unaccustomed sunlight.

               EXT. SHOT - NEW YORK STREET

               Cars, taxis and busses are stalled, their frenzied drivers 
               unable to figure out what's happened. A junk peddler with a 
               broken-down horse and wagon moves grandly and leisurely 
               through the stalled vehicles. The peddler bears a happy grin 
               of superiority. This is his moment of triumph over modern 
               civilization.

               LONG SHOT - TIMES SQUARE

               of two cab drivers whose taxis have stalled beside each other 
               in traffic. One has gotten out of his cab. The other is seated 
               at his wheel, looking around in awe and terror, his tough 
               Manhattan heart shaken.

                                     CAB DRIVER
                         My ol' lady was right. We shoulda 
                         got a place in the country.

               standing on the sidewalk, awe-struck at the weird sight before 
               them. One of them speaks in terror, hardly daring to 
               articulate his thoughts.

                                     COCKNEY
                         It's that space man -- that's wot it 
                         is.

               They are an elderly couple. Staring bug-eyed at the strange 
               street scene, the woman mutters some terror-stricken comment 
               in Russian.

               She is middle-aged and there are tears of fright in her eyes. 
               She is mumbling a prayer in French.

               Barnhardt is seated comfortably at his desk with a book on 
               his lap. He has been interrupted by the entrance of Hilda, 
               his secretary. At the moment she`s beside herself with 
               excitement. Barnhardt watches her with a half-smile of secret 
               amusement. He has already deduced the cause of what's 
               happening.

                                     HILDA
                         You should see it, Professor 
                         Barnhardt! You should go out and see 
                         it for yourself!

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.

                                     HILDA
                         The whole city has stopped. People 
                         are running around like ants!

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (musing admiringly on 
                              Klaatu's cleverness)
                         What a brilliant idea. I never would 
                         have thought of it.

               Hilda flings him a questioning look, annoyed that he won't 
               share her excitement.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         What about the people who are coming 
                         to the meeting tonight? Have they 
                         all arrived?

                                     HILDA
                              (nodding)
                         I talked to most of them this 
                         morning... They were all very curious 
                         about the meeting.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Good. Did you speak to our friend 
                         Mr. Carpenter?

                                     HILDA
                              (nodding)
                         He'll be there at 8:30.

                              (studying her for a 
                              moment)
                         Tell me, Hilda -- does all this 
                         frighten you -- does it make you 
                         feel insecure?

                                     HILDA
                         Yes, sir -- it certainly does!

                              (nodding with a bland 
                              little smile)
                         That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - PENTAGON BLDG. - DAY

               Seated at a conference table are high-ranking officers of 
               the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps. There is the 
               uneasy tension of people dealing with unknown forces. An 
               Army Major General, who's Chairman of the meeting, is 
               speaking.

                                     GENERAL
                         --as far as we can tell, all power's 
                         been cut off everywhere -- with a 
                         few exceptions: hospitals, planes in 
                         flight -- that sort of thing. I wish 
                         I could be more specific but, as you 
                         now, all communications are out 
                         telephone, radio, cable -- everything.
                              (gravely)
                         I can tell you that the President is 
                         prepared to declare a state of 
                         national emergency.
                              (pausing to let this 
                              sink in)
                         Before we start discussing plans, I 
                         want a report from Colonel Ryder. 
                         What about the robot, Colonel?

               Ryder is a Colonel of engineers, a man about forty-five.

                         When it was discovered last night 
                         that the robot had moved, I was 
                         directed by the Joint Chiefs to find 
                         a means of immobilizing him. We 
                         accomplished that this morning by 
                         encasing him in a block of KL 93.
                              (he hands a small 
                              block of plastic to 
                              the General)
                         It's a new plastic material -- 
                         stronger than steel.

                                     GENERAL
                         Is it possible that he's broken out 
                         of this stuff?

                                     COLONEL
                         No, sir. I've Just checked on that. 
                         He's locked up tight as a drum.

                                     GENERAL
                         All right -- that means we concentrate 
                         on the man.
                              (to the group with 
                              force and authority)
                         Up till now we've agreed on the 
                         desirability of capturing this man 
                         alive. We can no longer afford to be 
                         so particular. We'll get him alive, 
                         if possible -- but we must get him!
                              (eyes the group sternly)
                         Is that clear?

               The shop and its glittering display cases, which were 
               brilliantly lighted in the previous scene, are now gloomy 
               and dim. All artificial light is off. The Jeweler is a bright-
               eyed old man of seventy with a middle European accent. He is 
               completely fascinated as he examines the diamond Tom has 
               given him, and is annoyed by the lack of light. He speaks 
               impatiently to one of the girls in the shop who happens to 
               pass by.

                                     JEWELER

                         I tried, Mr. Bleeker. But the phone 
                         doesn't work, either.

                                     JEWELER
                              (absently, as he 
                              studies the stone)
                         Well, call the phone company.

                         But the phone doesn't work.

               The Jeweler gives her a preoccupied glance of annoyance and 
               turns back to the stone.

                                     TOM
                         Is it worth anything?

                         from?

                                     TOM
                         That's what I wanted you to tell me.

                                     JEWELER
                              (overwhelmed and 
                              absorbed by the stone, 
                              he shakes his head, 
                              bewildered)
                         There are no diamonds like this -- 
                         any place in the world.

               Impressed by the import of what the man is saying, Tom's 
               mind is racing wildly.

                                     TOM
                         You sure about that?

                                     JEWELER
                              (eagerly, shrewdly)
                         Would you like to sell it?

                                     TOM
                              (picking up the stone)
                         No -- no, thanks.

                                     JEWELER
                         I'd give you a very good price.

               Preoccupied with his own excited thoughts, Tom has already 
               started for the door.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. ELEVATOR - TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND HELEN

               In the dim light of the stalled elevator, Klaatu is finishing 
               explaining to Helen the story of his mission. Overwhelmed by 
               the staggering import of what he has told her, Helen is 
               listening with great interest and concern.

                                     KLAATU
                              (speaking gravely)
                         --I've already told you more than I 
                         told Professor Barnhardt, because my 
                         life, in a sense, is in your hands. 
                         I thought if you knew the facts you'd 
                         appreciate the importance of my not 
                         being -- apprehended, -- before the 
                         meeting tonight.

               Helen is staring at him in awe, but also in complete 
               admiration and sympathy.

                                     HELEN
                         Yes, of course. Of course I do.

               Klaatu smiles at her warmly and she manages to return the 
               smile. Their relationship is further cemented by the sharing 
               of this vital secret.

                                     HELEN
                              (studying his face 
                              anxiously)
                         You hold great hope for this meeting.

                                     KLAATU
                         I can see no other hope for your 
                         planet. If the meeting should fail, 
                         then I'm afraid there is no hope.

               Suddenly and without warning, the elevator starts moving and 
               the lights go on. Startled, Helen looks at him.

                                     KLAATU
                              (calmly)
                         It must be twelve-thirty.

                                     HELEN
                              (looks at her watch, 
                              then back at him, 
                              awe-struck)
                         Yes -- Just exactly.

               STREET - MED. SHOT - DAY

               Showing a section of street traffic as it comes back to life. 
               From everywhere comes the sound of self-starters. Trolley 
               bells start clanging. Then automobile horns. People climb 
               back into there vehicles and traffic starts to move.

               SERIES OF CUTS

               of other streets, as the strident sounds of traffic build up 
               and normalcy is regained.

               INT. LOBBY - DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE BLDG - MED. SHOT - DAY

               as Helen and Klaatu come out of the elevator and start across 
               the lobby, CAMERA HOLDING ON THEM. Helen is preoccupied with 
               concern for Klaatu's safety.

                                     HELEN
                         Where are you going now?

                                     KLAATU
                         Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be 
                         safe there for the afternoon -- and 
                         I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the 
                         only other person who knows anything 
                         about--

               This recalls to Helen something she had forgotten and she 
               stops in sudden concern.

                                     HELEN
                         No, wait a minute -- there's someone 
                         else.

                                     KLAATU
                         Who?

                                     HELEN
                         Tom... He was there last night when 
                         Bobby told me what he saw.

               The look of concern on Klaatu's face heightens Helen's 
               overwhelming fear and uncertainty.

                                     HELEN
                              (worriedly)
                         Of course, he doesn't know anything 
                         definite. He'd talk to me first, 
                         anyway, before--
                              (interrupting herself 
                              in sudden decision)
                         We can't take that chance. I'll get 
                         in touch with him right away and 
                         make sure.

               Helen turns and starts determinedly for the lobby door, 
               followed by Klaatu, as we--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. TELEPHONE BOOTH

               Helen is nervous and worried as she speaks into the phone.

                                     HELEN
                              (into phone)
                         --But I've got to talk to him. It's 
                         terribly important. When is he coming 
                         back?

               INT. TOM'S OUTER OFFICE - CLOSE SHOT - SECRETARY

               Tom's secretary has not yet recovered from the shock of what 
               has happened to the world.

                                     SECRETARY
                         I don't know, Mrs. Benson. He left 
                         before noon -- before that awful 
                         electric business. I'm scared to 
                         death, Mrs. Benson. I -- No, he 
                         wouldn't tell me where he was gong. 
                         Said it was something personal.

               INT. TELEPHONE BOOTH

                                     HELEN
                         Tell him I want to see him the minute 
                         he gets in... No, I'll call back.

               Helen hangs up, thoroughly worried and distraught now.

               at passenger loading gate. A group of passengers is held 
               back as soldiers close the gate to the runway, preventing 
               their boarding their plane. The passengers mill about in 
               consternation as a voice is heard over a p.a. system.

                                     VOICE

               The Army has thrown a roadblock across a main highway on the 
               outskirts of the city and is permitting no one to leave. 
               From the line of halted cars we see and the insistent honking 
               of horns we hear, we get the impression of hundreds of cars 
               stacked up.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. TOM'S OUTER OFFICE - FULL SHOT - DUSK

               It is 6:00 P.M. and growing dark outside, but the lights are 
               not on. The office is small and unpretentious, the business 
               habitat of a man who works in a big insurance agency. Tom's 
               secretary is on the phone, reflecting the world-wide terror 
               of the moment.

                                     SECRETARY
                              (into phone, nervous 
                              and jittery)
                         --Honest, Mary, I'm so scared I can't 
                         sit still. I'd like to run some place, 
                         but I don't know where to go--
                              (hearing the door 
                              open, she cuts off)
                         'Bye now.

               The corridor door opens and Tom enters with an air of urgency.

                                     TOM
                         Call the Pentagon and find out who's 
                         in charge of this space man business. 
                         Whoever it is I want to talk to him.

               The secretary has a reaction of surprise, but she manages to 
               stop Tom at his door. He has flipped on the lights in passing.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Mrs. Benson's been trying to get you 
                         all afternoon. She says it's 
                         important.

                                     TOM
                         Get this other call first.

               Tom disappears into his office, closing the door. The 
               secretary is getting out a telephone directory when the 
               corridor door opens and Helen enters, tense and nervous.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Oh, Mrs. Benson -- He just walked 
                         in.
                              (misery loves company)
                         Are you nervous, too?

                                     HELEN
                         Yes, I am, Margaret.

               The secretary buzzes the intercom and speaks into it.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Mrs. Benson is here.
                              (turning to Helen)
                         Go on in.

               Helen is starting for the door when it opens and Tom appears.

                                     HELEN
                         Tom -- I've been trying to get you 
                         all afternoon--

                                     TOM
                              (preoccupied with his 
                              own excitement)
                         Come on in.

               INT. TOM'S PRIVATE OFFICE - FULL SHOT

               as Tom follows Helen inside and closes the door. He turns to 
               her, his voice tense with excitement.

                                     TOM
                         I've got some terrific news about 
                         your friend, Mr. Carpenter.

                                     HELEN
                              (trying to appear 
                              calm)
                         What about him?

                                     TOM
                         Helen, he's the man from the space 
                         ship!
                              (she eyes him evenly, 
                              apprehensively, as 
                              he hurries on)
                         I had that diamond checked at three 
                         different places. Nobody on earth's 
                         ever seen a stone like that! After 
                         what Bobby told us, that's enough 
                         for me. Why is it nobody knows 
                         anything about him? Why hasn't he 
                         got any money?

                                     HELEN
                              (evenly, with quiet 
                              tension)
                         All right, Tom -- it's true. I know 
                         it's true.

                                     TOM
                         How do you know?

                                     HELEN
                         Never mind about that.
                              (urgently, with great 
                              concern)
                         You've got to promise me you won't 
                         say a word to anybody.

                                     TOM
                         Are you crazy? After what happened 
                         today?

                                     HELEN
                         You don't understand. You don't 
                         realize how important it is.

                                     TOM
                              (impatiently)
                         Important? Of course it's important. 
                         The point is we can do something 
                         about it.

                                     HELEN
                         That's what I'm trying to tell you. 
                         We mustn't do anything about it. 
                         Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm 
                         talking about.

                                     TOM
                              (irritated by her 
                              opposition)
                         He's a menace to the whole world! 
                         It's our duty to turn him in.

                                     HELEN
                              (desperately)
                         But he isn't a menace! He told me 
                         what he came here for.

                                     TOM
                              (dismissing this with 
                              annoyed contempt)
                         He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- 
                         just because you like the guy.
                              (busy with his own 
                              thoughts)
                         You realize what this'd mean for us? 
                         I'd be the biggest man in the country. 
                         I could write my own ticket.

                                     HELEN
                              (eyeing him coldly)
                         Is that what you're thinking about?

                                     TOM
                              (guiltily, defensive)
                         Why not? Somebody's got to get rid 
                         of him.

               They are interrupted by the sharp sound of the interoffice 
               buzzer.

                                     HELEN
                         I'm not going to let you do it, Tom.
                              (with deep personal 
                              urgency)
                         Believe me, this is literally the 
                         most important thing in the world.

               Tom picks up the phone and answers it.

                                     TOM
                              (into phone)
                         Yes?... What's his name, Margaret? 
                         General Cutler?
                              (disappointed that 
                              the connection isn't 
                              completed)
                         All right, I'll hold on.

               Realizing what he's doing, Helen crosses to him, pleading 
               wildly, desperately.

                                     HELEN
                         Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know 
                         what you're doing! It isn't just you 
                         and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the 
                         world, is involved!

                                     TOM
                              (exasperated)
                         I don't care about the rest of the 
                         world!

               It is as though he had slapped her across the face. Suddenly 
               he has revealed himself, naked and distasteful. Feeling guilty 
               as he sees the contempt and revulsion in her eyes, he tries 
               the old charm, holding his hand over the phone.

                                     TOM
                         You'll feel different when you see 
                         my picture in the papers.

                                     HELEN
                              (staring at him starkly)
                         I feel different right now.

                                     TOM
                              (uneasily)
                         You wait and see. You're going to 
                         marry a big hero!

                                     HELEN
                         I'm not going to marry anybody.

               She turns and runs quickly out of the room. Tom's inclination 
               is to follow her, when his connection is completed.

                                     TOM
                              (into phone)
                         Hello, General Cutler?
                              (irritated)
                         No, I don't want to speak to his 
                         aide. I want to speak to the General. 
                         Tell him it's about the space man... 
                         My name is Tom Stevens. S-t-e-v-e-n-
                         s.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - MED. SHOT - DUSK

               Helen hurries out of the building, hails a cab, gets into it 
               and the cab drives off.

               INT. TOM'S OFFICE - CLOSE SHOT - TOM

               Tom now has General Cutler on the phone.

                                     TOM
                              (into phone)
                         That's right, General. That's where 
                         he's staying... Yes, of course I'm 
                         sure.

               INT. GENERAL CUTLER'S OFFICE - PENTAGON BLDG.

               The General is on the phone and is making notes. There are a 
               couple of officers standing near his desk, a Colonel and a 
               Lieutenant Colonel.

                                     GENERAL CUTLER
                              (after listening for 
                              a moment)
                         Thank you very much, Mr. Stevens. 
                         I'll want to talk to you further but 
                         I haven't time now.
                              (hangs up and turns 
                              to Colonel)
                         Deploy all Zone 5 units according to 
                         Plan B -- immediately.

               The Colonel nods and starts out of the room, as we--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. TAXI - MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN - NIGHT

               The cab is traveling through city traffic. Nervous and edgy, 
               Helen glances at her watch impatiently.

               EXT. STREET - MED. SHOT

               A jeep filled with armed soldiers is moving down the street 
               at a fast clip. Behind the jeep is an Army staff car.

               MED. CLOSE- SHOT - STAFF CAR

               shooting from outside into the car. In the front seat beside 
               the driver is a full Colonel, wearing helmet and side-arms. 
               The car is moving swiftly through traffic as the Colonel 
               speaks into the transmitter of a radio.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - COMMAND AND RECONNAISSANCE CAR

               It is filled with soldiers wearing helmets and carrying rifles 
               and Tommy guns. It is traveling quite fast. A soldier with a 
               handy-talkie transmits an order to the driver.

               MED. LONG SHOT - STREET

               The C. and R. car is seen to be at the head of a convoy of 
               eight Army vehicles which are moving swiftly down the street. 
               The trucks are filled with armed soldiers.

               MED. LONG SHOT - ANOTHER STREET

               On this street also an armed convoy is racing by, headed by 
               a Jeep mounting a .30 caliber machine gun.

               MED. LONG SHOT - ANOTHER STREET

               On this street also a convoy rolls by.

               EXT. STREET CORNER - MED. SHOT

               Helen's cab rounds the corner into the boardinghouse street. 
               CAMERA PANS with cab as it draws up in front of the 
               boardinghouse. The cab waits as Helen jumps out and runs up 
               the steps to the front door. A couple of children are playing 
               jump-rope in the light of a street lamp.

               EXT. MOVING - STAFF CAR - MED. CLOSE SHOT

               shooting in at the Colonel as he issues an order into the 
               radio.

               MED. SHOT - ARMY CONVOY

               CAMERA FOLLOWS the rear of the convoy as it races down a 
               main thoroughfare. As the convoy reaches each intersection, 
               the last vehicle peels off the column and, turns into the 
               side street.

               MED. SHOT ANOTHER CONVOY

               racing down another street, the rear vehicles peeling off at 
               the intersections as in previous scene.

               MED. SHOT - INTERSECTION

               Following one of the vehicles after it has peeled off into a 
               side street. It turns around in the side street and draws up 
               facing the intersection, its motor still running. We get the 
               impression of a methodical plan to block off each street.)

               EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE - MED. SHOT

               as Klaatu and Helen come hurrying down the steps and pile 
               into the waiting taxi. The kids playing Jump-rope stop and 
               watch as the door is closed and the cab pulls out, 
               disappearing as it makes a right turn at the end of the 
               street.

               EXT. STREET CORNER NEAR BOARDINGHOUSE - MED. SHOT

               (This is opposite end of street from last shot.) Barreling 
               across the intersection into the boardinghouse street is the 
               jeep followed by the Colonel's staff car.

               EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE STREET - MED. SHOT

               As the Jeep and staff car pull up in front of the boarding 
               house, the soldiers in the jeep pile out and cover the 
               entrance to the house. Meanwhile the Colonel, still in the 
               staff car, is talking to the two kids playing out front. 
               They chatter excitedly, pointing in the direction taken by 
               the cab.

               INT. STAFF CAB - CLOSE SHOT - COLONEL

               He speaks into his radio in tones of clipped and quiet 
               efficiency. The car remains standing at the curb.

                                     COLONEL
                              (into radio)
                         Attention, Zone 5... Yellow cab, 
                         moving north on B from Ninth Street.

                         license number and report.

               INT. TAXI - FULL SHOT

               The cab 's moving through traffic at a normal speed. Klaatu 
               and Helen are tense and nervous.

               INT. TAXI - FULL SHOT

               The cab's moving through traffic at a normal speed. Klaatu 
               and Helen are tense and nervous.

                                     KLAATU
                         I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to 
                         hide me until the meeting.

                                     HELEN
                         Where is the meeting going to be?

                                     KLAATU
                         At the ship.

               CLOSE SHOT - CAB DRIVER

               as he looks out to his left, approaching an intersection.

               From driver's viewpoint. A C. and R. car is parked in the 
               side street, facing the intersection, its occupants armed 
               and helmeted.

               CLOSE SHOT - CAB DRIVER

               Abreast of the intersection now, he looks to his right.

               EXT. STREET INTERSECTION - MED. SHOT

               shooting over the rear of a jeep which is halted in a side 
               street facing the intersection. The cab crosses the 
               intersection and the jeep driver squints to catch its number. 
               Then he picks up his radio and speaks into the transmitter.

               INT. STAFF CAR - CLOSE SHOT - COLONEL

               (The car is still in front of the boardinghouse.) The Colonel 
               listens to his radio for a moment, then speaks into his 
               transmitter.

                                     COLONEL
                              (into radio)

                         of target vehicle is W 4936... All 
                         vehicles maintain your positions -- 
                         and hold your fire.

               INT. TAXI - MED. CLOSE SHOT

               shooting at the driver, over the shoulders of Klaatu and 
               Helen, as he turns and points out the Army vehicles to them 
               with a shrug of bewilderment. They look ahead at the 
               intersection they are approaching.

               CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               looking ahead out of her side of the cab, at the intersection.

               MED. SHOT - INTERSECTION

               from Helen's viewpoint. There is an Army vehicle waiting in 
               the side street.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               as he looks out of his side of the cab.

               MED. SHOT - INTERSECTION

               In this side street, too, an Army vehicle is standing.

               TWO SHOT - HELEN AND KLAATU

               Their eyes meet for a moment, neither willing to conjecture 
               what this might mean. The very quietness of the operation is 
               ominous and menacing. Their faces show grave concern.

               INT. STAFF CAR - CLOSE SHOT - COLONEL

                                     COLONEL
                              (into radio)
                         Attention, Zone 5 -- report when 
                         target vehicle passes your position.

               EXT. TAXI MED. CLOSE SHOT

               shooting through the window at Helen and Klaatu, who are 
               growing more tense and nervous.

               MED. SHOT - INTERSECTION

               shooting over the back of a jeep mounting a machine gun as 
               the cab passes the intersection. The driver picks up his 
               radio and reports into it.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - WEAPONS CARRIER

               shooting through the windshield as the driver reports by 
               radio, his eyes shifting to follow the moving cab.

               INT. TAXI - TWO SHOT - HELEN AND KLAATU

               Helen is biting her lips nervously. She steals a sidelong 
               glance at Klaatu to find him staring ahead, deeply preoccupied 
               and concerned.

                                     HELEN
                              (trying to give him 
                              encouragement)
                         It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.

                                     KLAATU
                         I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid 
                         of what he might do -- if anything 
                         should happen to me.

                                     HELEN
                         Gort?
                              (puzzled)
                         But he's a robot. I mean -- without 
                         you, what could he do?

                                     KLAATU
                              (slowly)
                         There's no limit to what he could 
                         do. He could destroy the Earth.
                              (with great urgency)
                         If anything should happen to me, you 
                         must go to Gort. You must give him 
                         this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." 
                         Please repeat that.

                                     HELEN
                              (shocked and 
                              bewildered, she 
                              repeats nervously)
                         "Klaatu barada nikto."

                                     KLAATU
                              (gravely)
                         Remember those words.

               Helen nods, repeating the words soundlessly.

               SERIES OF CUTS

               of vehicle drivers reporting by radio as their eyes follow 
               the progress of the taxi. (These should be shot so we don't 
               hear what is said.)

               CLOSE SHOT - COLONEL IN STAFF CAR

               listening to these reports. Then he speaks into his 
               transmitter with quiet tension.

                                     COLONEL
                              (into radio)
                         Attention, Zone 5... Section number 
                         2 -- block off Tenth Street at 
                         Massachusetts. All vehicles close 
                         in.

               The Colonel motions to his driver and the staff car pulls 
               out.

               EXT. STREET - MED. SHOT

               as a convoy of eight vehicles moves down the street going 
               very fast and swings around a corner.

               SERIES OF CUTS

               of individual vehicles that have been waiting at 
               intersections, as they pull out and down the main streets to 
               converge on the taxi.

               MED. SHOT

               at a major intersection, as the convoy of eight vehicles 
               previously seen dashes through the intersection and stops. 
               The cars quickly arrange themselves so that they form a 
               roadblock, completely sealing off the street.

               INT. TAXI

               shooting over the driver's shoulder. The cab is proceeding 
               down the street. When the road block comes into range of its 
               headlights. The driver, who has been getting uneasy, turns 
               to face his fares accusingly.

                                     DRIVER
                         Hey, what's this all about?

               As he slows his cab down, Helen leans forward into scene. 
               Frenzied, she is about to urge the driver on when Klaatu 
               puts a restraining hand on her shoulder.

               EXT. STREET - MED. SHOT

               shooting down the street from the barricade, as the taxi 
               stops. Army cars are closing in behind the taxi, so it is 
               trapped. The cab door ovens and Klaatu steps out, making a 
               run for the entrance to a pedestrian underpass.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - JEEP

               It is one of the lead vehicles in the group coming up behind 
               the taxi. It mounts a .30 caliber machine gun and, with the 
               Jeep still moving, the gunner fires a burst at Klaatu.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - RIFLEMAN

               He's on one of the vehicles that form the barricade. He takes 
               a bead on the running figure of Klaatu and fires.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He has almost reached the underpass. His hand is on the 
               railing when he slumps to the ground, badly hit. In a moment, 
               Helen rushes into scene, dropping down to hold Klaatu's head 
               in her arms. He looks up at her with a feeble smile. Then 
               his face takes on an expression of urgency.

                                     KLAATU
                              (weakly, insistently)
                         Get that message to Gort. Right away--

               Klaatu is unable to say any more. He is dead. Helen looks 
               around wildly, helplessly, with tears and terror in her eyes.

               MED. SHOT

               as the soldiers pile out of their vehicles and close in on 
               the place where Klaatu lies. He is their first and all-
               important concern, and Helen finds herself pushed out of the 
               way, toward the edge of the growing crowd of soldiers.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Shocked and, staggered by what's happened, she realizes she 
               must get to Gort. Taking advantage of the milling confusion 
               in the dark, she edges toward the pedestrian underpass until 
               she can slip into its entrance without being noticed. And 
               she disappears.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BUILDING ENCLOSING SPACE SHIP - MED. SHOT - GORT - 
               NIGHT

               In the eerie light of the huge building, the great robot 
               stands encased in a solid block of clear, transparent plastic. 
               As CAMERA MOVES IN slowly, we hear a low whirring sound, as 
               of power being generated. A faint glow, visible through the 
               plastic, emanates from Gort's body. His eyes, which seem to 
               express rage, shifts as though he were straining to break 
               out. As the whirring sound and the glow of Gort's body 
               increase in intensity, the sharp edges at the top of the ice-
               like block melt into roundness and the plastic starts to 
               drip away. (About 150 folding chairs are arranged on the 
               floor near the space ship for the meeting tonight.)

               EXT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - TWO SOLDIERS

               The whirring sound can be heard faintly from inside. The two 
               soldiers standing guard at the door hear the sound and listen 
               apprehensively. The two men exchange an uneasy glance. After 
               hesitating a moment, one of them decides to investigate. He 
               turns and goes inside the door.

               INT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE SOLDIER

               As he stops and looks up at the robot, his eyes go wide with 
               terror.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               Gort is an awesome and terrifying sight. His head is free 
               now and he seems to be straining against the plastic, which 
               is dripping down the sides of the block.

               CLOSE SHOT - SOLDIER

               He glances around nervously to see that his companion has 
               entered the building and is staring up at the robot, bug-
               eyed. Slowly the second soldier moves up beside the first. 
               Wordlessly, they bring their rifles up to the ready and click 
               them off safety. In spite of their terror, they advance slowly 
               toward the robot.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               The whirring sound is ominous and his body glows brightly. 
               And his eyes are fixed on the two advancing figures.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - TWO SOLDIERS

               as they move toward Gort.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               From inside him comes a new and terribly sharp crackling. 
               sound. And from his eyes two pencils of light dart out. After 
               a moment the crackling sound stops and the light goes off.

               REVERSE SHOT

               from same angle as scene before last. But the two soldiers 
               have utterly disappeared.

               FULL SHOT

               as Gort resumes breaking out of the plastic. There is no 
               sign of the two soldiers.

               EXT. MALL - MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN - NIGHT

               Hurrying along a footpath, nervous and distraught, she pauses 
               for a moment, looking at the entrance of the building. Then 
               she starts determinedly across the grass toward the entrance.

               MED. SHOT

               PANNING with Helen as she approaches the entrance fearfully. 
               Rallying all her courage and determination, she forces herself 
               to step inside.

               INT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               as she enters the huge, weirdly lighted building. She stops 
               short as her glance falls on the awesome figure of Gort. 
               Loneliness and terror grip her and she wants to run -- but 
               she realizes she can't.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT -GORT

               He has seen Helen and his flashing eyes bore into her. His 
               upper body and arms are free now, and the plastic is rapidly 
               melting away.

               CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               She is held fascinated by the robot's staring eyes. For 
               another moment it looks as if she would, break and run. But 
               she summons all her courage, and moves slowly toward Gort, 
               whose legs are still held captive.

               MED. SHOT - HELEN AND GORT

               as she moves slowly, fearfully toward him.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               The plastic is dripping off his legs now. With great effort, 
               he pulls his legs free and steps out of the stuff. A huge 
               figure in the heavy shadows, he moves slowly and menacingly 
               toward Helen.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               as she stops advancing, rooted to the spot in fear. Then she 
               starts backing away, keeping her eyes on him.

               MED. SHOT - HELEN AND GORT

               As the great, hulking figure approaches, Helen can't stand 
               her ground. She turns and runs wildly toward the far end of 
               the building. Gort follows her with unhurried, inescapable 
               strides. Unwittingly, Helen has run into a corner, and the 
               robot is closing in on her.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               Her eyes go wide with terror as she realizes she's trapped. 
               In a wild effort to run around him, she stumbles and falls 
               to the floor. Immobilized with fright, she lies breathless, 
               looking up at him. Then she gives a piercing scream.

               TWO SHOT - HELEN AND GORT

               as the great robot bends over her menacingly, arms 
               outstretched as though to grab or smash her.

               CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               All hope gone, she is blessed with a moment of lucidity, and 
               she remembers the message Klaatu told her to deliver.

                                     HELEN
                         Gort--!
                              (with desperate clarity)
                         Klaatu -- barada -- nikto.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               He pauses as he hears the words. His face doesn't change 
               expression, but the words obviously have an effect on him. 
               He hesitates thoughtfully for a moment.

               TWO SHOT - HELEN AND GORT

               Helen watches him in an agony of suspense. Then the robot 
               slowly bends down, picks her up in his arms and starts walking 
               toward the space ship.

               MED. SHOT

               PANNING with Gort as he carries Helen, speechless with fright, 
               to the side of the ship. He touches the side, and the ramp 
               moves slightly out. He mounts the ramp, still carrying Helen, 
               and disappears into the ship with her. And the ramp closes 
               silently behind them.

               INT. SMALL CORRIDOR - SPACE SHIP

               CAMERA FOLLOWS as Gort carries Helen through the dimly lighted 
               corridor into the main cabin, where he flips a switch that 
               lights up the cabin. The robot proceeds to a small door 
               leading off the main cabin and disappears with Helen inside 
               it.

               INT. SMALL CABIN - FULL SHOT

               This is revealed as a weirdly equipped laboratory, the walls 
               of which are lined with the most complex array of mechanical 
               and electronic apparatus. Gort sets Helen down on a stool 
               and indicates for her to stay there. Too terrified to move, 
               Helen watches as he busies himself with the apparatus. He 
               starts flipping switches and turning dials. As a result, 
               lights begin to flash and there's a strange series of 
               mechanical noises.

               CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               Unable to guess the reason for these preparations, she is 
               gripped with a terrible fear.

               FULL SHOT

               Ignoring Helen completely, Gort finishes his work. Then he 
               moves to the door and goes out, closing the door behind him. 
               Helen rushes to the door and searches frantically for the 
               knob -- only to find, to her terror, that there is none. 
               Frenziedly she beats on the solid metal door.

               EXT. SPACE SHIP - MED. SHOT

               as the ramp comes down and Gort steps out. With grim, 
               determined strides he starts toward the entrance of the 
               building as the ramp silently closes.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. POLICE PRECINCT STATION - NIGHT

               The Colonel who was in charge of Klaatu's apprehension is 
               speaking into a phone at the desk of the Police Sergeant. 
               Standing by are three or four Army officers, among them a 
               Captain and a Lieutenant.

                                     COLONEL
                              (into phone)
                         Yes, sir, we've got the body here 
                         now. Downstairs in a cell... No 
                         question about it, General -- he's 
                         dead all right... Yes, sir. Yes -- I 
                         understand.

               The General has apparently hung up and the Colonel does 
               likewise, turning to the officers in the room.

                                     COLONEL
                         General Cutler's coming down here 
                         right away.
                              (to the Lieutenant)
                         Take a squad of men, Lieutenant, and 
                         post a guard around that cell.
                              (to Captain)
                         Captain, don't let anyone in or out 
                         of the building.

               The two officers mutter their "yes, sirs" and start off about 
               their business.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               A squad of armed soldiers, led by the lieutenant, is admitted 
               to the corridor by a Police guard and they start marching 
               down the corridor toward a cell at the far end.

               INT. CELL - POLICE STATION

               This is a cell on the ground floor. In the far wall is a 
               heavily barred window, beyond which is as alley. In f.g. are 
               Klaatu's feet, stretched out on a crude table. As CAMERA 
               HOLDS, the huge figure of Gort appears outside the barred 
               window, Seeing Klaatu, he reaches up and yanks out the steel 
               bars as though they were chicken wire. With a crushing blow 
               of his knee he crumbles the brick and mortar below the window 
               and steps inside the cell. He moves without interruption 
               toward the body of Klaatu.

               INT. JAIL CORRIDOR

               Hearing the sounds of clattering metal and mortar, the 
               soldiers race down the corridor toward the cell.

               MED. SHOT

               shooting over the backs of the soldiers as they reach the 
               cell and look inside. There they see the giant robot picking 
               up the body of Klaatu and starting deliberately toward the 
               gaping hole in the side of the building. They raise their 
               weapons and fire at Gort, but the bullets have no effect on 
               him. Continuing uninterruptedly, he steps over the debris 
               and disappears, carrying Klaatu in his arms.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. SPACE SHIP BUILDING - MED. SHOT

               as Gort enters the empty building, still carrying the body 
               of Klaatu. CAMERA PANS with him as he strides over to the 
               ship. The ramp opens and Gort goes inside. Then the ramp 
               closes after him.

               INT. LABORATORY CABIN IN SPACE SHIP

               Alone in the cabin, Helen is still terrified. She looks up, 
               startled as the door opens and Gort enters, carrying Klaatu's 
               body over to a long counter. Once again he starts fiddling 
               with knobs, switches and dials. As Helen watches, speechless, 
               he starts to fasten strange-looking electrodes to Klaatu's 
               wrist and ankle.

               EXT. POLICE PRECINCT STATION - NIGHT

               shooting from the outside, near the front entrance to the 
               building, through a window into the main room where the Police 
               Sergeant's desk is. The Lieutenant who was ordered to guard 
               Klaatu's cell is excitedly reporting to the Colonel how Gort 
               broke in and took Klaatu's body. Considerably agitated, the 
               Colonel snaps orders to the other officers, glances at his 
               watch and motions for the Lieutenant to follow him. He and 
               the Lieutenant cross to the door and CAMERA PANS with them 
               as they come outside the building, hurry down the steps and 
               get into a staff car. Several other Army vehicles join the 
               staff car as it roars away from the curb.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. SPACE SHIP BUILDING - MED. SHOT - NIGHT

               A good many of the 150 chairs are filled, and more guests 
               are still arriving. There is no one to greet them at the 
               door, so they wander in and seat themselves.

               INT. LABORATORY IN SPACE SHIP

               Gort is still working over the body of Klaatu. From a socket 
               in the wall he pulls a strange-looking hypodermic needle on 
               the end of a cord or tube and gives Klaatu a shot in the 
               arm.

               CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               as she watches, fascinated in spite of her terror.

               FULL SHOT

               Gort fiddles with the dials again and there are electrical 
               cracklings and sputterings. Suddenly he flips a switch and 
               all sound ceases. Gort removes the electrodes and watches 
               Klaatu. CAMERA MOVES IN on Klaatu and we see him start to 
               breathe. In a moment his eyelids flutter. Then his eyes open 
               and he looks around.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               as Klaatu slowly lifts himself to a sitting position. Helen 
               watches breathlessly as he glances around the room, as though 
               to orient himself. Then he lowers his feet to the floor and 
               stands up. He blinks uncertainly, then smiles at them.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a grateful glance 
                              at Gort, he turns to 
                              Helen)
                         Hello.

                                     HELEN
                              (staring at him)
                         I -- I thought you were--

                                     KLAATU
                              (nodding, with a smile)
                         I was.

                                     HELEN
                              (looking at Gort in 
                              awe)
                         You mean he has the power of life 
                         and death?

                                     KLAATU
                         No -- that is a power reserved to 
                         the Almighty Spirit.

                                     KLAATU
                              (indicating the 
                              equipment Gort used)
                         This technique, in certain cases, 
                         can re-stimulate life for a limited 
                         period. It's a refinement of 
                         scientific principles known to your 
                         own people.

                                     HELEN
                              (concerned for him)
                         But how -- how long--?

                                     KLAATU
                         How long will I live?
                              (he shrugs)
                         That no one can say.

               Klaatu moves one of the sliding panels and reaches for a 
               suit of his "other world" clothing from behind the panel. 
               With a nod of apology, he steps behind the panel to change.

               EXT. BUILDING - MED. SHOT - NIGHT

               shooting from the door. In f.g. Barnhardt, who has just 
               arrived, is greeting several friends outside the door. In 
               b.g. a staff car and three or four other Army vehicles are 
               driving up.

               MED. SHOT - ARMY VEHICLES

               As the convoy pulls up to a halt in front of the building, 
               the Colonel hurries out of the staff car and moves over to 
               Barnhardt. Barnhardt is motioning his friends into the 
               building as the Colonel comes up to him.

               TWO SHOT - COLONEL AND BARNHARDT

               The Colonel speaks to Barnhardt with deference but with 
               unyielding authority.

                                     COLONEL
                         I'm sorry, Professor Barnhardt -- I 
                         have to ask you to call off this 
                         meeting.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Call it off? I... But I had permission 
                         from the Army--

                                     COLONEL
                         I know you did. But the robots on 
                         the loose now and it isn't safe around 
                         here. You'll have to get your friends 
                         out of that building.

               INT. SPACE SHIP - TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND HELEN

               as Klaatu steps out from behind the sliding panel where he 
               has changed into his "other world" tunic.

                                     KLAATU
                         Gort and I will be leaving soon.

               Helen is genuinely upset at the thought of his leaving and 
               the knowledge that he is to die. There is a compelling warmth 
               of feeling between these two.

                                     HELEN
                              (simply, sincerely)
                         We'll miss you very much -- Bobby 
                         and I.
                              (smiling to conceal 
                              her real feelings)
                         He won't have anyone to play with.

                                     KLAATU
                         He'll have you -- and Tom.

                                     HELEN
                              (quietly -- definitely)
                         No. That's all finished.

                                     KLAATU
                         I'm sorry.

                                     HELEN
                              (she is sensible and 
                              objective, but not 
                              unfeeling)
                         I think I'm very lucky. You don't 
                         always get a chance to recognize a 
                         mistake before you make it.

               Klaatu looks at her in warm, considered admiration. Then he 
               moves to one side of the cabin and flips a switch. Suddenly 
               an entire section of the side wall is made transparent. 
               Through it, as through a screen, we can see out into the 
               building. Most of the chairs are already occupied, and 
               latecomers are still moving in through the door. Facing the 
               group, on a little dais, is Barnhardt. As Klaatu and Helen 
               watch, Barnhardt raps for order and begins to speak. His 
               voice comes in the ship through a speaker.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Ladies and Gentlemen--

               INT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - BARNHARDT

               He addresses them gravely, with a note of terrible 
               disappointment in his voice.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         I called you from your work and from 
                         your homes all over the world because 
                         we were to meet here tonight with a 
                         man from another planet -- the man 
                         who came here in this ship.
                              (there are audible 
                              exclamations of 
                              surprise and 
                              disappointment)
                         As you all know, this is no longer 
                         possible. I can only say that I share 
                         the bitterness of your disappointment.

               INTERCUT with the above are group and individual shots of 
               the people in the meeting. They are the cream of Earth's 
               intellectuals -- scientists, churchmen, educators, leaders 
               of social and political thought. There are several women 
               among them. There are turbaned Indians, Chinese, Japanese, 
               several Negroes. All religions are represented. Every 
               important world power is represented.

               INT. MAIN CABIN - SPACE SHIP

               Klaatu and Helen are watching and listening, as the last 
               sentence of Barnhardt's speech above comes over the speaker. 
               Klaatu flips off the switch, which cuts off the view of the 
               meeting and also Barnhardt's voice. At this moment Gort moves 
               across the cabin and Klaatu speaks to him.

                                     KLAATU
                         Gort -- berengo.

               Gort moves off obediently.

               INT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - BARNHARDT

               Full of chagrin, he continues addressing the meeting.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         --under the circumstances, the Army 
                         people have asked us to leave the 
                         building. And, since their concern 
                         is for our safety, I can do nothing 
                         but suggest that we comply--

               Barnhardt is interrupted by the sudden and unexpected 
               appearance of the ramp, silently opening out of the side of 
               the space ship.

               MED. SHOT - BARNHARDT'S AUDIENCE

               as they react in startled amazement to the mysterious 
               appearance of the ramp. Then, as they watch, there is a sudden 
               gasp of terror.

               MED. SHOT - AT SHIP

               as Gort appears on the ramp and walks slowly down to the 
               ground. In a moment, Klaatu and Helen appear at the entrance 
               of the ship. Helen comes down the ramp to join Barnhardt, 
               while Klaatu remains at the head of the ramp.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT COLONEL AND SOLDIERS

               The Colonel stands near the door, flanked by a group of 
               soldiers, their rifles at the ready. The Colonel is startled 
               by what he sees. His eyes are on the revered figure of Klaatu 
               and he's debating what he should do.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He is a figure of intense dignity in his impressive otherworld 
               tunic. He stares with even defiance at the armed soldiers, 
               as though holding them off by sheer weight of his personality. 
               He turns to look out at the audience, which is held 
               spellbound. Then, after a breathless moment, he speaks.

                                     KLAATU
                              (straightforwardly, 
                              with almost stern 
                              authority)
                         I am leaving soon and you will forgive 
                         me if I speak bluntly.
                              (he pauses, studying 
                              the faces)
                         The Universe grows smaller every day -- 
                         and the threat of aggression by any 
                         group -- anywhere -- can no longer 
                         be tolerated.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - IN AUDIENCE

               of three of the delegates, listening intently. (These three 
               are from Russia, India and France.)

                                     KLAATU'S VOICE
                              (over scene)
                         There must be security for all -- or 
                         no one is secure... This does not 
                         mean giving up any freedom except 
                         the freedom to act irresponsibly.

               CLOSE SHOT - A DELEGATE

               He is an American.

                                     KLAATU'S VOICE
                              (over scene)
                         Your ancestors knew this when they 
                         made laws to govern themselves -- 
                         and hired policemen to enforce them.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

                                     KLAATU
                         We of the other planets have long 
                         accepted this principle. We have an 
                         organization for the mutual protection 
                         of all planets -- and for the complete 
                         elimination of aggression. A sort of 
                         United Nations on the Planetary 
                         level... The test of any such higher 
                         authority, of course, is the police 
                         force that supports it. For our 
                         policemen, we created a race of robots--
                              (indicating Gort)
                         Their function is to patrol the 
                         planets -- in space ships like this 
                         one -- and preserve the peace. In 
                         matters of aggression we have given 
                         them absolute power over us.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               emphasizing his great size and inscrutable expression. The 
               normal blinking of his piercing eyes as he gazes imperturbably 
               at the audience is his only movement.

                                     KLAATU'S VOICE
                              (over scene)
                         At the first sign of violence they 
                         act automatically against the 
                         aggressor. And the penalty for 
                         provoking their action is too terrible 
                         to risk.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

                                     KLAATU
                         The result is that we live in peace, 
                         without arms or armies, secure in 
                         the knowledge that we are free from 
                         aggression and war -- free to pursue 
                         more profitable enterprises.
                              (after a pause)
                         We do not pretend to have achieved 
                         perfection -- but we do have a system -- 
                         and it works.
                              (with straightforward 
                              candor)
                         I came here to give you the facts. 
                         It is no concern of ours how you run 
                         your own planet -- but if you threaten 
                         to extend your violence, this Earth 
                         of yours will be reduced to a burned-
                         out cinder.

               QUICK REACTION CUTS

               of four delegates, reflecting their stark terror and 
               bewilderment. And a cut of the Colonel and the soldiers, 
               impressed and held by what Klaatu is saying.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY as he concludes quietly, incisively.

                                     KLAATU
                         Your choice is simple. Join us and 
                         live in peace. Or pursue your present 
                         course -- and face obliteration.
                              (after a pause)
                         We will be waiting for your answer. 
                         decision rests with you.

               By the time he reads the last line, the CAMERA HAS MOVED 
               INTO a BIG HEAD CLOSEUP.

               MED. SHOT - THE DELEGATES

               CAMERA MOVES along a row of their faces, stunned and silent, 
               their minds unable to cope with the enormity of what they 
               have heard.

               MED. SHOT

               CAMERA MOVES IN on Klaatu as he is saying goodbye to Barnhardt 
               and Helen. He turns then and speaks to Gort, glancing up at 
               the building as he does so.

                                     KLAATU
                         Gort -- veracto.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               He looks up at the roof of the building, and once again we 
               hear the peculiar generating sound from within him.

               MED. LONG SHOT

               including the delegates, the space ship, everything that is 
               inside the building. As we watch, the roof and walls of the 
               temporary structure suddenly disintegrate as the tanks did 
               in the opening. The entire layout -- delegates, space ship 
               and all -- remain exactly as they were except that instead 
               of being under a roof they are out in the open Mall under a 
               starry sky. The area is ringed with the debris of the 
               building.

               MED. SHOT AT SHIP

               Klaatu is standing at the head of the ramp as Gort comes up 
               the ramp and disappears inside the ship. Klaatu is nodding 
               goodbye to Barnhardt and Helen.

               TWO SHOT - BARNHARDT AND HELEN

               as they wave to Klaatu. Barnhardt is moved and impressed, 
               and Helen's face shows her emotions at this strange parting.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He nods and smiles at them with warm affection. Then he turns 
               and disappears into the ship, and the ramp closes behind 
               him.

               MED. SHOT - THE SPACE SHIP

               From inside the ship comes the muffled roar of great power 
               generating -- not the sound of earthly motors, but of a 
               tremendous dynamo.

               MED. SHOT - THE DELEGATES

               watching breathless, stunned by what they have heard and 
               seen.

               MED. LONG SHOT - THE SHIP

               As the sound from inside it builds to a climax, the great 
               ship takes off with a tremendous roar.

               REACTION CUTS OF DELEGATES

               All are deeply moved and impressed. In the mind of each is 
               the burning question that Klaatu has posed for them.

               LONG SHOT - THE SHIP

               as it soars away into the inky blackness of the outer spaces 
               from which it came.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END

 "Troops of nomads swept over the country at harvest time like a visitation of locusts, reckless young fellows, handsome, profane, licentious, given to drink, powerful but inconstant workmen, quarrelsome and difficult to manage at all times. They came in the season when work was plenty and wages high. They dressed well, in their own peculiar fashion, and made much of their freedom to come and go."
 "They told of the city, and sinister and poisonous jungles all cities seemed in their stories. They were scarred with battles. They came from the far-away and unknown, and passed on to the north, mysterious as the flight of locusts, leaving the people of Sun Prairie quite as ignorant of their real names and characters as upon the first day of their coming."						Hamlin Garland, Boy Life on the Prairie (1899) 
 DAYS OF HEAVEN
 1	INT. CHICAGO MILL - SERIES OF ANGLES
 WORKERS in a dark Chicago mill pound molten iron out in flaming sheets. The year is 1916.
 2	EXT. MILL
 BILL, a handsome young man from the slums, and his brother
STEVE sit outside on their lunch break talking with an
older man named BLACKIE. By the look of his flashy clothes
Blackie is not a worker.
 BLACKIE
 Listen, if I ever seen a tit, this here's a tit. You understand? Candy. My kid sister could do this one. Pure fucking candy'd melt in your hand. Don't take brains. Just a set of rocks. I told you this already.
 STEVE
 Blackie, you told me it was going to snow in the winter, I'd go out and bet against it. You know?
 (to Bill)
 There is nothing, nothing in the world, dumber than a dumb guinea.
 BLACKIE
 Okay, all right, fine. Why should I be doing favors for a guy that isn't doing me any favors? I must be losing my grip.
 (pause)
 I got to give it to you, though. Couple of guys look like you just rolled in on a wagonload of chickens. You ever get laid?
 STEVE
 Sure.
 BLACKIE
 Without a lot of talk, I mean? 'Cause I'm beginning to understand these guys, go down the hotel, pick something up for a couple of bucks. It's clean, and you know what you're in for.
 3	EXT. ALLEY
 Sam the Collector's GANG swaggers around in the alley behind a textile plant. ONE of them has filed his teeth down to points and stuck diamonds in between them. ANOTHER wears big suspenders.
Sam and Bill appear to know one another.
 SAM
 Hey, Billy, you made a mistake. You made somebody mad. Nothing personal, okay? It's just gotta be done. You made a mistake. Happens in the best of families.
 BILL
 I paid you everything I have. Search me. The rest he gets next week.
 SAM
 Listen, what happens if I don't do this? I gotta leave town?
 BILL
 I could do something, you know. You guys wanta do something to me, I know who to tell about it. You guys ought to think about that. 
 SAM
 You maybe already did something. Maybe that's why you're here, on account of you already done something.
 BILL
 I haven't done anything.
 SAM
 Then you're all right, Billy.
 RAZOR TEETH
 You got nothing to worry about.
 SAM
 Cut it out, Billy, all right? You know what can happen to a guy that doesn't wanta do what people tell him? You know. So don't give us a lot of trouble. You're liable to get everybody all pissed off.
 Sam, a busy man, checks his watch.
 4	NEW ANGLE
 Bill puts his hand on the ground. Sam drops a keg of roofing nails on it and, his work done, leaves with his gang. Bill sobs with pain.
 5	EXT. LOT BEYOND MILL
 Bill and Steve drag a safe by a rope through a vacant lot beyond the mill. Blackie walks behind.
 BLACKIE
 You know what I'm doing with my end? Buy a boat. Get that? I had a boat. I had a nice apartment, I had a boat. Margie don't like that. We got to have a house. "I can't afford no house," I said. She says, "Sell the boat." I didn't want to sell my boat. I didn't want to buy the house. I sell the boat, I buy the house. Nine years we had the house, eight of them she's after me, we should get another boat. I give up.
 STEVE
 Same as always, I do all the work, you gripe about it.
Suddenly FOUR POLICEMEN surprise them from ambush. Bill lets go of the rope and starts to run. Steve does not give up immediately, however, and they shoot him down. Bill picks up Steve's gun and fires back. Three of the Policemen go chasing after Blackie, whom they soon bring to heel. The FOURTH stays behind taking potshots at Bill while he attends to Steve.
 6	TIGHT ON STEVE
 Steve, badly wounded, is about to die.
 STEVE
 Run. Get out of here.
 BILL
 (weeping)
 I love you so much. Why didn't  you run. Don't die.
Steve dies. Bullets kick up dust around him. He takes off running. One of the bullets has caught him in the shoulder.
 7	INT. SEWER
 ABBY, a beautiful woman in her late twenties, attends to Bill's wounds in a big vaulted sewer. Her sister URSULA, a reckless girl of14, stands watch.
 BILL
 (weeping)
 They shot the shit out of him. My brother. I couldn't believe what I was seeing.
 ABBY
 Hold still, or I can't do anything.
 BILL
 I love you, Abby. You're so good to me. Remember how much fun we had, on the roof...
 8	EXT. ROOF - MATTE SHOT
 Bill and Abby flirt on the root of a tenement, happily in love. The city stretches out behind them.
 9	INT. BED - QUICK CUT
 Abby lies shivering with fever.  Bill spoons hot soup into her mouth. Ursula rolls paper flowers for extra change.
 BILL (o.s.)
 (continuing)
 ... even when you were sick and I was in the mill.
 10	INT. MILL - QUICK CUT (VARIOUS ANGLES OF OTHER WORKERS)
 Bill works in the glow of a blast furnace. He does not seem quite in place with the rest of the workers. A pencil moustache lends a desired gentlemanliness to his appearance. He looks fallen on hard times, without ever having known any better--like Chaplin, an immigrant lost in the heartless city, with dim hopes for a better way of life.
 BILL (o.s.)
 I won't let you go back in the mill. People die in there. I'm a man, and I can look out for you.
 11	EXT. SIDING OUTSIDE MILL
 Along a railroad spur outside the mill, Abby and Ursula glean bits of coal that have fallen from the tenders.
 BILL (o.s.)
 We're going west. Things gotta be better out there.
 12	EXT. TENEMENT
 A POLICEMAN, looking for Bill, roughs Abby up behind the tenement where they live. Suddenly Bill runs out from a doorway and slams him over the head with a clay pitcher full of water.
 POLICEMAN
 What'd you do?
 Bill shrugs, then hits him again, knocking him unconscious, when he reaches for a gun. Abby calls Ursula and they take off running, Bill stopping only to collect some of their laundry off a clothesline.
 13	EXT. FREIGHT YARDS
 They hop a freight train.
 14	CREDITS (OVER EXISTING PHOTOS)
 The CREDITS run over black and white photos of the Chicago they are leaving behind. Pigs roam the gutters. Street urchins smoke cigar butts under a stairway. A blind man hawks stale bread. Dirty children play around a dripping hydrant. Laundry hangs out to dry on tenement fire escapes. Police look for a thief under a bridge. Irish gangs stare at the camera, curious how they will look. The CREDITS end.
 15	EXT. MOVING TRAIN
 Abby and Bill sit atop a train racing through the wheat country of the Texas Panhandle.
 BILL
 I like the sunshine.
 ABBY
 Everybody does.
They laugh. She is dressed in men's clothes, her hair tucked up under a cap. They are sharing a bottle of wine.
 BILL
 I never wanted to fall in love with you.
 ABBY
 Nobody asked you to.
 He draws her toward him. She pulls away.
 BILL
 What's the matter? A while ago you said I was irresistible. I still am.
 ABBY
 That was then.
 She pushes her nose up against his chest and sniffs around.
 BILL
 You playing mousie again?
 ABBY
 I love how nice and hard your shoulders are. And your hair is light. You're not a soft, greasy guy that puts bay rum on every night.
 BILL
 I love it when you've been drinking.
 ABBY
 You're not greasy, Bill. You have any idea what that means?
 BILL
 Kind of.
 They share the boxcar with a crowd of other HARVEST HANDS. Ursula is among them, also dressed like a man. Bill gestures out at the landscape.
 BILL
 Look at all that space. Oweee! We should've done this a long time ago. It's just us and the road now, Abby.
 ABBY
 We're all still together, though. That's all I care about.
 16	EXT. JERKWATER
 The train slows down to take on water. The hands jump off. Each carries his "bindle"-- a blanket and a few personal effects wrapped in canvas. TOUGHS with ax handles are on hand to greet them.
The harvesters speak a Babel of tongues, from German to Uzbek to Swedish. Only English is rare. Some retain odd bits of their national costumes, they are pathetic figures, lonely and dignified and so far from home. Others, in split shoes and sockless feet, are tramps. Most are honest workers, though, here to escape the summer heat in the factories of the East. They dress inappropriately for farm work, in the latest fashions.
 BILL
 Elbow room! Oweee! Give me a chance and I'm going to dance!
 Bill struts around with a Napoleonic air, in a white Panama hat and gaiters, taking in the vista. Under his arm he carries a sword cane with a pearl handle. It pleases him, in this small way, to set himself apart from the rest of toiling humanity. He wants it known that he was born to greater things.
 17	NEW ANGLE
 Bill comes upon a BIG MAN whose face is covered with blood.
 BILL
 Good, very good. Where you from,  mister?
 BIG MAN
 Cleveland.
 BILL
 Like to see the other guy.
 Bill helps him to his feet and dusts him off. A TOUGH walks up.
 TOUGH
 You doing this shit?
 (pause)
 Then keep it moving.
 BILL
 Oh yeah? Who're you?
The Tough hits Bill across the head with his ax handle.
 TOUGH
 Name is Morrison.
Bill looks around to see whether Abby has seen this. She hasn't. He walks dizzily off down the tracks.
 18	NEW ANGLE
 He takes Abby by the arm.
 ABBY
 What happened to your ear?
 BILL
 Nothing.
She is a sultry beauty--emancipated, full of bright hopes and a zest for life. Her costume does not fool the men. Wherever she goes they ogle her insolently.
EXT. WAGONS The FOREMEN of the surrounding farms wait by their wagons to carry the workers off. A flag pole is planted by each wagon. Those who do not speak English negotiate their wages on a blackboard.
BENSON, a leathery man of fifty, bellows through a megaphone. In the background a NEWCOMER to the harvest talks with a VETERAN.
 BENSON
 Shockers! Four more and I'm leaving.
 BILL
 How much you paying?
 BENSON
 Man can make three dollars a day, he wants to work.
 BILL
 Who're you kidding?
Bill mills around. They have no choice but to accept his offer.
 BENSON
 Sackers!
Abby steps up. Benson takes her for a young man.
 BENSON
 You ever sacked before?
 She nods.
 Transcriber's Note: the following seven lines of dialogue between the NEWCOMER and the VETERAN runs concurrent with the previous six lines of dialogue between Benson and Bill and Abby. In the original script they are typed in two columns running side-by-side down the page.
 *****
 NEWCOMER (o.s.)
 How's the pussy up there?
 VETERAN
 Not good. Where you from?
 NEWCOMER (o.s.) 
 Detroit.
 VETERAN
 How's the pussy up there?
 NEWCOMER (o.s.) 
 Good.
 (pause)
 The guys tough out here?
 VETERAN (o.s.)
 Not so tough. How about up there?
 NEWCOMER (o.s.)
 Tough.
***** BENSON
 When's that?
 ABBY
 Last year.
He waves her on. Abby nods at Ursula.
 ABBY
 You're making a mistake, you pass this kid up.
 BENSON
 Get on.
He snaps his fingers at her. Bill climbs up ahead of the women. Anger makes him extremely polite.
 BILL
 You don't need to say it like that.
Benson ignores this remark but dislikes Bill from the first.
 20	EXT. PLAINS
 Benson's wagons roll across the plains toward the Razumihin, a "bonanza" or wheat ranch of spectacular dimensions, its name spelled out in whitewashed rocks on the side of a hill.
 21	EXT. BONANZA GATES (NEAR SIGN)
 The wagons pass under a large arch, set in the middle of nowhere, like the gates to a vanished kingdom. Goats peer down from on top.
Bill looks at Abby and raises his eyebrows.
 22	EXT. BELVEDERE
 At the center of the bonanza, amid a tawny sea of grain, stands a gay Victorian house, three stories tall. Where most farm houses stand more sensibly on low ground, protected from the elements, "The Belvedere" occupies the highest ridge around, commanding the view and esteem of all.
Filigrees of gingerbread adorn the eaves. Cottonwood saplings, six feet high, have recently been planted in the front. Peacocks fuss about the yard. There is a lawn swing and a flagpole, used like a ship's mast for signaling distant parts of the bonanza. A wind generator supplies electric power.
A white picket fence surrounds the house, though its purpose is unclear; where the prairie leaves off and the yard begins is impossible to tell.
Bison drift over the hills like boats on the ocean. Bill shouts at the nearest one.
 BILL
 Yo, Beevo!
 23	TIGHT ON CHUCK
 CHUCK ARTUNOV, the owner--a man of great reserve and dignity, still a bachelor--stands on the front porch of the Belvedere high above, observing the new arrivals.
 24	EXT. DORMITORY
 Benson drops the hands off at the dormitory, a hundred yards below, a plain clapboard building with a ceiling of exposed joists. Ursula sees Chuck watching them.
 URSULA
 Whose place is that?
 BENSON
 The owner's. Don't none of you go up around his place. First one that does is fired. I'm warning you right now.
 In the warm July weather most of the hands forsake the dorm to spread their bedrolls around a strawpile or in the hayloft of the nearby barn.
 Abby and Bill slip off to share a cigarette. Ursula tags behind.
 25	EXT. ROCK
 Bill lifts a big rock. Abby applauds. Ursula kneels down behind
him. Abby pushes him over backwards.
 26	EXT. BARN
 Ursula gasps as Abby tumbles off the roof of the barn and falls through the air screaming:
 ABBY
 Urs!
She lands in a straw pile.
 27	TIGHT ON ABBY AND BILL
 Bill takes Abby by the hands, spins her around until she is thoroughly dizzy, then grasps her across the chest.
 BILL
 Ready?
She giggles her consent. He crushes her in a bear hug until she is just on the verge of passing out, then lets her go. She sinks to the grass, in a daze of sweet intoxication.
 28	EXT. LANTERN - NIGHT
 Bill looks deeply into Abby's eyes by the light of a lantern that night. They have made a shallow cut on their thumbs and press them together mixing their blood like children.
 BILL
 You're all I've got, Abby. No, really, everything I ever had is a complete piece of garbage except you.
 ABBY
 I know.
They laugh. He bends to kiss her. She pulls away.
 BILL
 Sometimes I think you don't like men.
 ABBY
 As individuals? Very seldom.
She kisses him lovingly.
 29	EXT. WHEAT FIELDS - DAWN
 The sun peers over the horizon. The wheat makes a sound like a waterfall. It stretches for as far as the eye can see. A PREACHER has come out, in a cassock and surplice, to offer prayers of thanksgiving.
 PREACHER
 "... that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the Lord swore unto your fathers to give them, as the days of' heaven upon the earth."
The harvesters spit and rub their hands as they wait for the dew to burn off. They have slept in their coats. The dawn has a raw edge, even in summer.
 30	TIGHT ON WHEAT
 Chuck looks to see if the wheat is ready to harvest. He shakes the heads; they make a sound like paper. He snaps off a handful, rolls them between his palms, blows away the chaff and pinches the kernels that remain to make sure they have grown properly hard.
Tiny sounds are magnified in the early morning stillness:
grasshoppers snapping through the air, a cough, a distant hawk.
He pops the kernels into his mouth, chews them up, and rolls the wad around in his mouth. Satisfied, he spits it out and gives a nod. The Preacher begins a prayer of thanksgiving. Two ACOLYTES flank him, one with a smoking censer, the other with a crucifix.
All repeat the "Amen." Benson makes a tugging signal with his arm. A Case tractor--forty tons of iron, steam-driven, as big and as powerful as a locomotive--blasts its whistle. This is the moment they have been waiting all year for.
 31	OTHER FIELDS - SERIES OF ANGLES
 A SIGNALMAN with two hand flags passes the message on from the crest of a nearby hill. In the far-flung fields of the bonanza other tractors answer as other crews set to work.
Abby and Bill join in, Bill reaping the wheat with a mowing machine called a binder, Abby propping the bound sheaves together to make bunches or "shocks."
A cloud of chaff rises over the field, melting the sun down to a cold red bulb.
Abby is well turned out, in a boater and string tie, as though she were planning any moment to leave for a picnic.
Bill, too, dresses with an eye to flashy fashion: Tight dark trousers, a silk handkerchief stuck in the back pocket with a copy of the Police Gazette, low-top calfskin boots with high heels and pointed toes, a shirt with ruffled cuffs, and a big signet ring. While at work he wears a white smock over all this to keep the chaff off. It gives him the air more of a researcher than a worker.
The harvesters itch madly as the chaff gets into their clothes. The shocks, full of briars, cut their hands; smut and rust make the cuts sting like fire. Nobody talks. From time to time they raise a chant.
Ursula, plucking chickens by the cookhouse--a shack on wheels-- steals a key chain from an unwatched coat.
Benson follows the reapers around the field in a buggy. He keeps their hours, chides loafers, checks the horses, etc. The harvesters are city people. Few of them are trained to farming. Most--Abby and Bill are no exception--have contempt for it and anybody dull enough to practice it. Tight control is therefore exercised to see that the machines are not damaged. 
Where the others loaf whenever Benson's back is turned, Bill works like a demon, as a point of pride.
 32	CHUCK AND BENSON
 Lightning shivers through the clouds along the horizon. Chuck looks concerned. Benson consults a windsock.
 BENSON
 Should miss us.
 CHUCK
 They must be having trouble over there, though.
Abby, passing by, lifts her hat to wipe her face. As she does her hair falls out of the crown. Women are rare in the harvest fields. One so beautiful is unprecedented.
 CHUCK
 I didn't know we had any women on.
 BENSON
 (surprised)
 I thought she was a boy. Should I get rid of her?
 CHUCK
 No.
 33	MONTAGE
 A COOK stands on the horizon waving a white flag at the end of a fishing pole. Ursula bounds through the wheat blowing a horn.
Benson consults the large clock strapped to the back of his buggy, then fires a smoke pistol in the air.
Their faces black with chaff, the hands fall out in silence. They shuffle across the field toward the cookhouse, keeping their feet close to the ground to avoid being spiked by the stubble.
 34	EXT. COOKHOUSE - STUBBLE FIELD IN B.G.
 The COOKS, Orientals in homburgs, serve from planks thrown across sawhorses. The hands cuff and push each other around as they wash up. The water, brought up fresh in wagons from the wells, makes them gasp. An ice wagon and a fire truck are parked nearby.
Most sit on the ground to eat, under awnings or beach umbrellas dotted around the field like toadstools. The Belvedere is visible miles away on the horizon.
Bill is carrying Abby's lunch to her when a loutish DUTCH MAN makes a crack.
 DUTCHMAN
 Your sister keep you warm at night?
Bill throws a plate of stew at him and they are quickly in a fight. No fists are used, just food. The others pull them apart. Bill storms away, flicking mashed potatoes off his shirt.
 35	EXT. GRAIN WAGON - STUBBLE FIELD IN B.G.
 Bill and Abby sit by themselves in the shade of a grain wagon. Demoralized, Abby soaks her hands in a pail of bran water. Bill inspects them anxiously. They are swollen and cracked from the morning's work.
 ABBY
 I ran a stubble under my nail.
 BILL
 Didn't you ever learn how to take care of yourself? I told you to keep the gloves on. What can I do if you don't listen?
Bill presses her wrists against his cheek, ashamed that he can do nothing to shield her from such indignities. In the b.g. a MAN with a fungo bat hits flies to SOME MEN with baseball gloves.
 BILL
 You can't keep on like this.
 ABBY 
 What else can we do?
She nods at the others.
 ABBY
 Anyway, if they can, I can too.
 BILL
 That bunch? Don't compare yourself to them.
She flexes her fingers. They seem lame.
 BILL
 You drop off this weak. I can make enough for us both. It was a crime to bring you out here. Somebody like you.
 (pause)
 Right now, what I'm doing, I'm just dragging you down.
 (pause)
 Maybe you should go back to Chicago. We've got enough for a ticket, and I can send you what I make.
He seems a little surprised when she does not reject this idea out of hand. Perhaps he fears that if she ever did go back, he might never see her again.
 BILL
 What's the matter?
She begins to cry. He takes her in his arms.
 BILL
 I know how you feel, honey. Things won't always be this way. I promise.
 36	ABBY AND BILL - CHUCK'S POV
 The men knock out their pipes as Benson's whistle summons them back to their stations.
 BENSON
 Tick tockl Tick tock! Nothing moving but the clock!
Bill pulls Abby to her feet. He sees the Dutchman he fought with and shoots him the finger.
 ABBY
 You better be careful.
 BILL
 Of him? He's just a. sack of shit.
 ABBY
 Stop it! He's liable to see you.
 BILL 
 I want him to. He's the one better be careful.
 37	TIGHT ON CHUCK
 Chuck looks on. Something about her captivates hint, not so much her beauty--which only makes her seem beyond his reach--as the way she takes it utterly for granted.
 38	MONTAGE (DISSOLVES)
 The work goes on through the afternoon. The pace is stern and incessant, and for a reason: a storm could rise at any moment and sweep the crops flat, or a dry wind shrivel them up. A series of dissolves gives the sense of many days passing.
Iany moment and sweep the crops flat, or a dry wind shrivel them up.Animals--snakes and gophers, rabbits and foxes--dart through the field into the deep of the wheat, not realizing their sanctuary is growing ever smaller as the reapers make their rounds. The moment will come when they will every one be killed with rakes and flails.
The wheat changes colors in the wind, like velvet. As the sun drops toward the horizon a dew sets, making the straw hard to cut. Benson fires his pistol. A vine of smoke sinks lazily through the sky. As the workers move off, the fields grow vast and inhospitable.
Oil wells can be seen here and there amid the grain.
 39	EXT. ABBY'S ROW
 Bill helps Abby finish up a row. Thousands of shocks stretch out in the distance. Benson comes up behind her, making a spray of the stalks that she missed.
 BENSON
 You must've passed over a dozen bushels here. I'm docking you three dollars.
 BILL
 What're you talking about? That's not fair.
 BENSON
 Then leave. You're fired.
Abby is speechless. Bill squeezes the small rubber ball which he carries around to improve his grip and swallows his pride.
 BILL
 BILL
 Wait a minute.
 BENSON
 You want to stay?
 (pause)
 Then shut up and get back to work.
Benson leaves. Abby covers Bill's embarrassment.
 BILL
 I guess he meant it.
She turns her back to him and goes about picking up the sheaf Benson threw down.
 BILL
 He did. Ask him. If you can't sing or dance, what do you do in this world? You might as well forget it.
Ising or dance, what do you do this world? You might as wellu
rorget it.
 40	EXT. STOCK POND - DUSK
 Their day's work done, the men swim naked in a stock pond.
Their faces are black, their bodies white as a baby's.
A retriever plunges through the water fetching sticks.
 41	EXT. ROAD - DUSK
 Some bowl with their hats on in a dusty road and argue in Italian.
 42	EXT. BELVEDERE - DOCTOR'S WAGON - DUSK
 A physician's wagon stands in front of the Belvedere.
Bill hunts nervously through it for medicine to soothe Abby's 
hands. Not knowing quite what to look for, he sniffs whatever 
catches his eye. 
Suddenly the front door opens and Chuck steps out with a DOCTOR, a stooped old man in a black frock coat. Bill, surprised, crouches behind the wheel. As they draw closer their conversation becomes faintly audible.
 CHUCK (o.s.)
 How long you give it?
DOCTOR (o.s.)
Could be next month. Could be a year. Hard to say. Anyway, I'm sorry.
 CHUCK (o.s.)
 Got to happen sometime.
They shake hands

 The peacock, a resplendent white, leads Abby through a bright yellow rapeseed field. It keeps just out of reach, as though it were enticing her on.
as though it were enticing her on.'U
All at once she looks up with a start. Chuck is standing in front of her, 
dressed in his habitual black. The Belvedere rises behind him like a 
castle in a fairy tale. She remembers Benson's warning that this is forbidden ground.
 ABBY
 (afraid)
 I forgot where I was.
 CHUCK
 Don't worry. Where you from?
 ABBY
 Chicago.
 CHUCK
 We hardly ever see a woman on the harvest.
There is a small rip in the side of her shirt, which the camera observes with Chuck. She pulls her sweater over it.
 CHUCK
 You like the work?
 (she shrugs)
 Where do you go from here?
 ABBY
 Wyoming and places. I've never been up that way. You think I'll like it?
He shrugs. Shy at first, she begins to open up.
 ABBY
 That dog belongs to you that was running around here? That little pointer?
 (he nods)
 What's his name
 CHUCK
 Buster.
 ABBY
 He seems like a good dog.
 CHUCK
 I think so.
 ABBY
 He came over and tried to eat my bread from lunch.
 CHUCK
 Maybe I should keep him penned up.
 ABBY
 (smiling)
 You asking me?
 46	EXT. SPIT - DUSK
 Bill finds Ursula roasting a peacock on a spit. She has arranged some of its tail feathers in her hair.
 BILL
 You're getting prettier every day.
 URSULA
 Aren't you sweet!
 BILL
 Depends how people are with me. Where's Abby? I found her something.
He holds out a jar of salve. Ursula shrugs.
 BILL
 She mention anything to you about going back?
 (pause)
 What?
Ursula has no idea what he is talking about.
 47	EXT. STRAW STACK - MAGIC HOURMost of the workers are fast asleep around the strawp±lU
 Most of the workers are fast asleep around the strawpile, their bodies radiating out like the spokes of a wheel.  A few stay up late to shoot dice in the back of a wagon.
 48	EXT. SEPARATE STACK - MAGIC HOUR
 Abby and Bill have laid their bedrolls out by a stack away from the others. A fire burns  nearby. Abby look at the stars. Bill shines his shoes. The straw is fragrant as thyme.
 ABBY
 I've had it.
 BILL
 You're tired, that's all. I'm going to find you another blanket.
 ABBY
 No, it's not that. I'm not tired. I just can't.
 BILL
 Don't you want to be with me?
 ABBY
 You know I do. It's just that, well, I'm not a bum, Bill.
 BILL
 I know. I told you though, this is only for a while. Then we're going to New York.Then we're New York. 
 ABBY
 And after that?
 BILL
 Then we're there. Then we get fixed up.
 ABBY
 You mean spend one night in a flophouse and start looking for work.
They are silent for a moment.
 BILL
 You should go back.
 ABBY
 And leave you? I couldn't do that.
 (pause)
 Someday, when I'm dying, I'd like somebody to ask me if I
still see life the same way as before--and I'd like them to
write down what I say. It might be interesting.I
Suddenly they look around. The chief domestic at the Belvedere, a churlish lady named MISS CARTER, stands above them with a salver of fruit and roast fowl.
 BILL
 (suspicious)
 What's going on? Who sent it?
She nods up toward the Belvedere and sets it down.I
 BILL
 What for?
She withdraws with a shrug. She does not appear to relish 
this duty. Bill watches her walk back to the buggy she 
came down in. Benson waits beside it.U
 BILL

 She's the kind wouldn't tell you if your coat was on fire.U
 49	NEW ANGLE - MAGIC HOURI
 Abby, with the look of a child that has wandered into aI
magic world, digs in. Bill looks on, suspicious of the_
motives behind this generosity.
 50	EXT. FIELD WITH OIL WELL - URSULA'S THEME - MAGIC HOUR
 A bank of clouds moves across the moon. Ursula roams the fields, keen with unsatisfied intelligence. The stubble hisses as a hot wind blows up from the South, driving bits of grain into her face like sleet. From time to time she does a cartwheel.
Equipment cools in the fields. Little jets of steam escape the 
boilers of the tractors.Ursula stops in front of a donkey well. It nods up and down in ceaseless agreement, pumping up riches from deep
in the earth.
 51	EXT. BEDROOM WINDOW  -  MAGIC HOUR

asleep on his pillow. The wind taps the curtain into the room.

 53	EXT. FIELDS - DAY
 The next day Benson yells through a megaphone from atop a stool.
 BENSON
 Hold your horses!I
The huge tractors start up with a bang. Despite Benson's warning a team of Percherons breaks free. Threshing, the separating of the wheat from the chaff, has begun.
 54	EXT. SEPARATOR - SERIES OF ANGLESI
 Sixty foot belts connect the tractors to the separating machines, huge rattletrap devices that shell the wheat out at deafening volume. Benson tosses bundles down the hissing maw, squirts oil into the gears, tightens belts, chews out a MAN who's sliced a hand on the driveshaft, etc. 
Bill works on the straw pile at the back of the machine, in a soft rain of chaff, spreading it out with a pitchfork. 
Ursula helps stoke the tractor with coal and water. When nothing is required of her she sneaks off to burrow in the straw. 
Gingerbread on the eaves of the tractors gives them a Victorian appearance. Tall flags mark their position in the field.
Abby moves quickly, without a moment's rest, sewing up the
sacks of grain as they are measured out at the bottom of
the separator. A clowning WORKER comes up and smells herU
like a flower.
 55	EXT. GRAIN ELEVATORSU
 Fully laden wagons set off toward distant grain elevators.U
 56	EXT. COUCH ON RIDGE
 Chuck and McLEAN, his accountant, sit on a ridge away from the chaff, in the shade of a beach umbrella. 
Chuck keeps track of operations through a telescope. Our last view of Abby, we realize, was from his POV. A plush Empire couch has been drawn up for his to rest in. At a table beside it, McLean computes the yield.
 McLEAN
 This must be wrong. No, dammit, nineteen bushels an acre.
Chuck sails his hat out in the stubble with a whoop.
McLean leans over his adding machine, cackling like a thief. 
 McLEAN
 Say it goes at fifty-five cents a bushel, that means a profit of
four dollars and seventy-five cents per acre. Multiply by twenty
thousand and you're talking over six figures.I
 CHUCK
 Big year.
 McLEAN
 Your biggest ever. This could make you the richest man in thePanhandle.

 You ought to get out while you're this far ahead. You'll never do
better. I mean it. You have nothing to gain by staying.U nothing to gain by staying. I

 I want to expand. I want to run this land clear to the Oklahoma border. Next spring I will. 
 McLEAN
 And gamble everything?U

 You're crazy.

cutting my heart out. This is the only home I ever had. ThisI
is where I belong.  Besides, I don't want to live in town.

Bill puts his hat back on. He keeps wet cottonwood leaves in the crown to cool himself off.
 BILL
 Why's that guy dragging an expensive piece of furniture out here? Reason
I ask is he's going to ruin thefinish and have to strip it.I
Benson hesitates, uncertain whether he might be divulging
a confidence.
 BENSON
 He's not well.
 BILL
 What's the matter with him?I
Benson immediately regrets having spoken so freely. He checks his watch to suggest Bill should get back to work. This uneasiness confirms Bill's sense that Chuck is gravely ill.
 59	EXT. SEPARATOR - DUSKI
 Abby is sewing up her last sacks by the separator that evening when Chuck walks up, still in the flush of McLean's good news.
The others have finished and left to wash up. He sits down and helps her. Shy and upright, he does not know quite how to behave with a woman.
 CHUCK
 Probably be all done tomorrow.
 (pause)
 You still plan on going North?
She nods and draws her last stitch. Chuck musters his courage. It must be now or never.
 CHUCK
 Reason I ask is maybe you'd like to stay on. Be easier than now. There's hardly any work after harvest. The pay is just as good, though. Better in fact.
 ABBY
 Why're you offering me this?  My honest face?
Chuck takes a moment to compose his reply.
 CHUCK
 I've watched you work. Think about it.
 ABBY
 Maybe I will.
She backs off toward Bill, who is waiting in the distance.
 CHUCK
 Who's that?
 ABBY
 (hesitant)
 My brother.
Chuck nods.
 60	NEW ANGLE - DUSK
 She joins Bill. He gives her a melon, wanting to pick up her spirits.
 BILL
 This is all I could find. You feeling better?
 (she shrugs)
 What'd he want?
They look at each other.
 61	EXT. RIVER - DUSK
 As Bill and Abby bathe in the river that evening, he tells her what he seems to have learned about Chuck's state of health. Down the way Ursula sits under a tree playing a guitar. Otherwise they are alone. They all wear bathing suits, Bill a shirt as well.
 BILLU
 It must be something wrong with his lungs.
 (pause)
 He doesn't have any family, either.his lungs.I
 (pause)I
 ABBY
 So what?
Bill shrugs. Does he have to draw her a picture? A shy, virginal light has descended over the world. Cranes peer at them from the tamarack.
 BILL
 Tell him you'll stay.
 ABBY
 What for?
Bill is wondering what might happen if Chuck got interested enough to marry her. Isn't he soon to die, leaving a vast inheritance that will otherwise go to waste?
 BILL
 You know I love you, don't  you?
ABBY Yes.
Abby guesses what is going through his mind, and it shocks her.
 ABBY
 Oh, Bill!
He takes her into his arms, full of emotion.I
 BILL
 What else can we really do?  I know how you feel, but we keepon this way, in five years we'll be washed up.
He catches a stick drifting by and throws it further down stream.
 BILL
 You ever think about all those ladies parading up and downU
Michigan Avenue? Bunch of whores! You're better than anyI
of them. You ever think how they got where they are?
He wants to breathe hope into her. He thinks of himself as responding
to what she needs and secretly wants. When she does not answer he gives up with a sigh.
 BILL
 Let's forget it.
 ABBY
 I know what you mean, though.
He takes her hand, with fresh hope of convincing her. 
 BILL
 We weren't meant to end up like this. At least you weren't.
You could be something. I've heard you sing. You have a lot
of fine qualities that need to come out. Ursula, too. What.U
kind of people is she meeting
up with, riding the rods? The girl's never had a clean shot--
never will. She oughta be in school.
 ABBY

 You wouldn't say this if you really loved me.
 BILL
 But I do. You know I do. This just shows how much. We're shitI
out of luck, Abby. People need luck. What're you crying about? Oh, 
don't tell me. I already know. All on account of your unhappy life and all
that stuff. Well, we gotta do something about it, honey. We can't expect
anybody else to.
Abby runs into the woods.U
 BILL
 Always the lady! Well, you don't know how things work in this country. This is why every hunkie I ever met is going nowhere.

 63	EXT. WOODS BY RIVER
 Abby is dressing in the cool woven shade of the woods when
Ursula, her face caked with a mask of river mud, jumps from the bushes with a shriek, scaring the wits out of her sister.
 64	EXT. BELVEDERE - DUSKU
 On their way home they pass the Belvedere. A single light
burns on the second floor. Abby picks cornflowers to put
in her hair. Bill runs his hand down her back.
 ABBY
 Why're you touching me that way?
He shrugs. Muffled by the walls of the house, above the cries of the peafowl, they can faintly hear Chuck singing to himself.
 BILL
 He's singing.
 ABBY
 He can't be too sick if he's singing to himself.
 BILL
 He might be singing to God.
They look at each other and smile. It does not appear that she has held what he said by the river against him. Bill stands for a moment and looks up at the Belvedere before passing on.
 65	EXT. SEPARATOR, LAST SHEAVES, RATS
 Work goes on the next day. As they near the last sheaves of unthreshed grain, hundreds of rats burst out of hiding. The harvesters go after them with shovels and stones. The dogs chase down the ones that escape.
 66	BENSON AND CHUCK
 Benson and Chuck smile at each other.
 BENSON
 We should be done around four.
They improvise a chat about past harvests. Years of  shared hardship have drawn them close. Chuck trails off in the middle of a reminiscence. Something else weighing on his mind.

 If you're knocking yourself out like this, I hope it's for a woman. And I hope she's good looking. You understand?
 70	TIGHT ON ABBY AND URSULAI
 Abby snatches a cigarette out of Ursula's mouth, takes a drag and throws it away. When Ursula goes to pick it up, she stamps it out.
 ABBY
 Don't spend a cent of that.
 URSULA
 Why don't you leave me alone?U
 ABBY
 I'm not going to sit around and watch you throw your life away.
Nobody's going to look at you twice if you've got nothing to
your name.
Ursula dislikes meddlesome adults. She takes out a pouch  of tobacco to roll another cigarette. Abby swats it out of her hand and chases her off.
 ABBY
 You want me to cut a switch?
 71	SERIES OF ANGLES - FESTIVITIES - DUSKU
 There are feats of strength and prowess as workers from the many fields of the bonanza join to celebrate the harvest home: boxing, wrestling, barrel jumping, rooster bouts, bear hugs, "Crack the Whip" and nut fights. Two tractors, joined by a heavy chain, vie to see which can outpull the other. Chuck lifts the back wheel of the separator off the ground; Benson replies by holding an anvil at arm's length; they tease each other about showing off. A GYMNAST does flips. They all seem happy as kids on holiday.
 72	NEW ANGLE
 Bill and Ursula share a cigarette. Ursula tries on his sunglasses.
 URSULA
 We going to stay?
 BILL
 If she wants to.
 URSULA
 You'd rather go?_
Bill, after a moment's thought, shrugs.
 BILL
 She's the one has to say. You put aspirin in this?
 URSULA
 No. 
She hands back his sunglasses.
 BILL
 Keep them.
 73	EXT. MUD PIT - DUSK
 Two TEAMS of harvesters have a tug of war. The losers are dragged through a pit of mud. Cradling handfuls of slime, they chase the winners off into the dusk.
 74	BILL AND ABBY - DUSKI
 Bill finds Abby sitting off by herself, wanting no part of the festivities. This is the first time since their arrival in Texas we have seen her wearing a dress.
 BILL
 Sunny Jim, look at this. My first ice cream in six months. And the lady even asks do I want sprinkles on top, thank you. Big, deep dish of ice cream. You couldn't pay me to leave this place, Got you one, too. You should've heard the line I had to give her, though. Oowee!
 ABBY
 Good, huh?
 BILL
 Great.
 ABBY
 Now you're trying to coax me. You never used to act like this.
Bill throws down the bowls of ice cream. In the distance, some MEN compete at throwing a sledge hammer.
 BILL
 For as long as I can remember, people been giving me a hard time about one thing or another. Don't you start in, too!
 ABBY
 You want to turn me into a whore?
 BILL
 We don't have to decide anything final now. Just if we're going to
stay. You never have to touch him if you don't feel like it. Minute
you get fed up, we take off. Worst that can happen is we had it soft
for a while.
 ABBY
 Something's made you mean.  
She walks off, uncertain what Bill really wants.
 BILL
 Or else we can forget it. I'm not going to spend the whole
afternoon on this, though. That I'm not going to do.
 75	ISOLATED ON CHUCK
 Chuck watches from a distance, fearful that tonight may
be the last he will ever see of her.U
 76	TGHT ON ABBY, EFFIGY, MARS, ETC.I
 The harvesters shape and dress the final sheaf as a woman.
The LAST of them to finish that day carries the effigy at
the end of the pole to the Belvedere. His mates follow
behind, jeering and throwing dirt clods at him.U
Aby watches. We sense that anything she sees mightI
figure in her decision.U
Mars hangs low and red in the western sky._
 77	URSULA AND DRUNK
 Ursula is looking at her figure in a pocket mirror whenU
a DRUNK appears behind her.I
 DRUNK
 See what happens to you? Little shit. Get out there and make that
big money and don't spend time dicking around.
 78	EXT. PIT OF COALS - DUSKU
 A feast is laid on. ONE PERSON rolls a flaming wheel down a hill. ANOTHER sets off a string of firecrackers. GERMANS pelt each other with spareribs. Ursula  spears hogsheads out of a pit of hot coals. The YOUNGER MEN tease her. She is too much of a tomboy to interest any of thm seriously. The effigy sits off in a chair by itself.
1 79	TIGHT ON ABBY AND CHUCK - DUSKChuck awaits Abby's answer.I
 ABBY
 There's a problem. I have to keep my baby sister with me. Someday_ my baby sister with me. Someday
I'm going to save up enough, see, and send her to school.
 (pause)
 My brother, too. I can't leave him.I
Abby fears she has asked too much. Chuck hesitates, but only to suggest he still has the prudence he long since has abandoned.
 CHUCK
 There's work for them, too.
 ABBY
 Really?
 80	EXT. BONFIRE - DUSK.
 A bonfire burns like a huge eye in the vat of the prairie night. The band strikes up a reel.
Chuck and Abby lead the dancing off, as though to celebrate their agreement. Their giant shadows dance with them. Soon the other harvesters join in.
 81	TIGHT ON BILL - DUSKU
 Bill watches Abby dance--it almost seems in farewell to their innocence. After a moment he turns off into the night.I
 82	MONTAGE - NIGHT_
 The effigy is held over the flame at the end of a pole until it catches fire. The harvesters prance around in the dark, trading it from hand to hand.
The MUSICIANS, drunk and happy, bow their hearts out.
 83	TIGHT ON BILL - DAWN
 While the others pursue their merriment, Bill walks the fields by himself, trembling with grief and indecision. Dawn is breaking. The eastern sky glows like a forge. Suddenly he comes upon a wolf. He catches his breath. 
The wolf stares back at him for a moment, then turns and pads off into the stubble.
 84	EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - DAWNEEXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - DAWNU
 Early the next morning the HARVESTERS wander by the hundreds down to the railroad tracks to catch a train for the North, where the crops are just now coming into maturity. A subtle feeling of sadness pervades the group. Bill gives his sword cane away to a MAN who seems to have admired it. The MAN offers him money, but he declines it.
 85	EXT. TRAIN - URSULA AND JOHN - LATER
 Ursula says goodbye to her favorite, a redhead named JOHN. She is hoarse, as always.
 JOHN
 Why don't you come with us?
 URSULA
 They won't let me. So when am I going to see you again?
 JOHN
 Maybe in Cheyenne.
She nods okay. They both know they will never see each other again. On a sudden impulse she gives him a love note.
 JOHN
 What's this?
She takes it back immediately, but he snatches it away from her and, after a brief, giggling scuffle, hops aboard the train, now picking up speed. Ursula runs along behind, cursing and throwing rocks at him.
 86	TIGHT ON BILL AND ABBY
 Bill and Abby look on.
 BILL
 I told her, "none of my business Urs, I just hope you're not rolling
around with some redhead is all." She looks me over. "Why?" she says, 
"What've you guys got that redheads don't?" I pity that kid.
Ursula runs up and throws herself tearfully into Abby's arms.
 BILL
 What's the matter? What'd he do?
Bill starts off after the train.
 87	EXT.-"SHEEP POWER"
 Abby tends a washing machine driven by a sheep on a treadmill. Chuck
watches from the front steps of the Belvedere.
 ABBY
 I'm just about done with this.
 CHUCK
 Good.
 ABBY
 So what's next?
 CHUCK
 Next?
 ABBY
 There's nothing else you want done?
 CHUCK
 Not that I can think of. Not right now.
Miss Carter, the housekeeper, steps out on the porch and pours a bucket of milk into a cream separator. 
 ABBY
 How about the cream?
 CHUCK
 She takes care of that.
He nods at Miss Carter, who conspicuously lets the screen door clap shut as she goes back inside. She misses no opportunity to express her disdain for these newcomers.
She and Benson are the only employees seen at the Belvedere. Several dozen others have stayed on after the harvest but they keep to their quarters down at the dorm. 
 ABBY
 You mean I'm done for today?
 CHUCK
 (uncomfortably)
 Something else might come up.
In truth, Chuck does not want to see Abby degraded by menial labor, considering her more a guest than an employee. They look at each other. Abby does not know quite what to make of him
 ABBY
 Well, I'm going back to the dorm.
 CHUCKU
 Is everything okay down there? In the way of accommodations, I mean.U
She nods and waves goodbye.I
 88	EXT. BARN
 Down by the barn Bill teaches Chuck how to shoot dice.  Chuck feigns interest.
 BILL
 I like to gamble, and I like to win. I make no bones about it.
Got to where the guys on Throop Street wouldn't even lag pennies
with me on account of I was such a winner. I'm starting out level
with you, you understand.
 CHUCK
 Have you ever been in trouble with the law?
Bill looks around. Abby would think it impolitic of him to speak so openly with Chuck.
 BILLI
 Nothing they could make stick. 
My problem has always been not having the education. I bullshitted
my way into school. They gave me a test. It was ridiculous. I got in fights. Ended up paying for a window. They threw me out. Don't blame them either. Still, I wanted to make something of myself. I mean, guys look at
you across a desk, you know what they're thinking. So I went in
the mill. Couldn't wait to get in there. Begin at seven, got to have a smile on your face. Didn't work out, though. No matter what you do, sometimes
things just don't go right. It gets to you after a while. It gives you that feeling,  "Oh hell, what's the use?"
 (pause)
 My dad told me, forget what the people around you are doing. You got enough to worry about without considering what somebody else does. Otherwise you get fouled up. He used to say (tapping his temple)
"All you got is this." Only one day you wake up, find you're not the smartest guy in the world, never going to come up with the big score. I really believed when I was growing up that somehow I would. I worked like a bastard in that mill. I felt all right about it, though. I felt that somewhere along the line somebody would see I had that special gleam. "Hey, you, come over here." So then I'd go.
They are silent for a moment.
 CHUCKI
 You seem close to your sister._
 BILL
 Yeah. We've been together since we were kids. You like her, don't you?
 (pause)
 She likes you, too.
Chuck looks down, feeling transparent in the pleasure he takes at this news.
 89	TIGHT ON ABBY
 The camera moves back to reveal Abby listening in from the other side of the barn. Her eyes are full of tears. How can Bill prize her so lightly?
 BILL (o.s.)
 Don't get the wrong idea, though.
 90	ISOLATED ON BILL - LATERI
 Bill sits on the ground reading his Police Gazette. Abby walks up and without a word of explanation, slaps him. He jumps up and protests but quickly tapers off. She turns on her heel and leaves.U
Bill sits down feeling misunderstood and abused. Does she think all this pleases him?
1 91	EXT. FAIRY RINGS (PRAIRIE)
 Chuck, out for a stroll with Abby and Ursula, shows them a fairy ring--a colony of mushrooms growing in a circle thirty feet across.
 URSULA
 I heard you farmers were big and dumb. You aren't so big. Where do they learn how to?
 ABBY
 They're so darling! Can you eat them?
Chuck nods. Abby snaps the mushrooms off flush at the ground. The music underscores this moment. She smiles at Chuck as she eats the dark earthy flesh.
 92	EXT. POST
 They pitch rocks at a post and exchange intimacies. Abby has grown more lively.
 ABBY
 You know sometimes I think there might have been a mixup at the
hospital where I. was born and that I could actually be the interesting
daughter of some big financier. Nobody would actually know.I
 (pause)
 Are you in love with me, Chuck, or why are you always so nervous?
 CHUCK
 (Stumbling)
 Maybe I am. I must be.
 ABBY
 Why? On account of something I've done?
 CHUCK
 Because you're so beautiful.
 ABBY
 What a nice thing to say. Look, I hit it. Did you see?
She goes right on with their game, as though she attached no great importance to his momentous declaration.
 93	TIGHT ON CHUCK AND ABBY - LATERI
 Chuck takes Abby's hand for the first time. Abby, startled, gives him a gentle smile, then lets go.
 ABBY
 What about my shoes? Aren't they pretty?U94EXT. SWING
 94	EXT. SWING
 Bill sits in a swing and plays a clarinet. The music flows out across the fields like a night breeze from the city.  Abby, passing by, glowers at him, as though to ask if things are going along to his satisfaction.
 95	ASTRONOMICAL SIGHTS (STOCK)
 Jupiter, the Crab Nebula, the canals of Mars, etc.
 CHUCK (o.s.)
 It turns out that people might have built them. Does that surprise you?
 ABBY (o.s.)U
 No.
 96	EXT. RIDGE - DAWN
 They are on a ridge opposite the Belvedere looking at the heavens through Chuck's telescope. Abby tingles with a sense of wonder. Chuck has opened a whole new world to her.
 ABBY
 You know so much! Would you bring my sister up here and tell
her some of this stuff?
 97	EXT. FATHER'S GRAVE - NIGHT
 Nearby the grave of Chuck's father stands in helpless witness to Abby's deception. A cottonwood tree rises against the cold blue sky, still as a statue.
 98	TIGHT ON BOOK - FLASHBACK
 A hand turns the pages of a book from Chuck's childhood. The text and VOICE reading it are in Russian, the picture of Russian wood folk and animals.
 99	EXT. VIRGIN PRAIRIE - FLASHBACK
 Chuck's father rushes around marking off his property with stakes.
 100	EXT. UNFINISHED SOD HOUSE - FLASHBACK
 Chuck, ten years old, scours up the blade of a scythe. Family effects -- a big green stove, a bird cage, a table stacked with melons and a mirror--stand waiting in front of their half-finished sod house. We see no sign of Chuck's mother.
 101	EXT. PLOWED FIELD - FLASHBACK
 A plow folds back the earth. The roots of the prairie grass twang like harp strings.
The plowing done, his father sows the seed. Poverty requires that for a harrow he drag a tree branch in back of his ox. Over his shoulder he carries a rifle.
Chuck blows a horn to chase the blackbirds off the seed.
A scarecrow is rigged to his back, to make him more intimidating.
 102	CHUCK AND FATHER - FLASHBACK
 Chuck's father has caught smallpox. His face is covered
with sores. Chuck wants to embrace him, but the father
wards him off with a long stick as he passes on some last
instructions in Russian.
 103	EXT. RIVER - FLASHBACK
 The father stands on a ledge above the river, filling his pockets with rocks to weight him down.
 CHUCK (V.0.)
 My father caught smallpox when I was eleven. I fished him out of the river and buried him myself.
 104	EXT. SAND BAR - FLASHBACK
 Chuck drags his father's drowned body across a sand bar with a rope.
 105	EXT. FATHER'S GRAVE - FLASHBACK
 Chuck heaps the last bit of earth on his father's grave. The stove stands as a marker.
 ABBY (o.s.)
 So who raised you?
 CHUCK (o.s.)
 Nobody. Did it myself.
 106	CHUCK AS BOY - WITH COYOTE, INDIANS - FLASHBACK
 Famished, Chuck eats from the carcass of a coyote. Some INDIANS watch him from a ridge.
 ABBY (o.s.)
 From the time you were a kid? How?
 CHUCK
 Worked hard, didn't fool around. I never saw a city. Never had
time. All I ever did is work.
He digs a post hole with a shovel twice his size.
 107	PAN OVER HILLS-DAWN
 The camera pans across Chuck's vast domain.
 CHUCK (o.s.)
 I gave my life to that land.
But what do I really have now? It'll still be here when I'm gone. It won't remember me.
 (pause)
 I'd give it all up for you. I could make you happy, too, I think-if only you'd trust me.
The camera settles on Ursula, playing with a dog on a seesaw Chuck
has built her, then begins to move again, to a long shot of Chuck and 
Abby on the ridge by the telescope. Chuck is proposing.
 108	EXT. DORM
 Abby has told him of the proposal. Bill broods over an unlit cigarette. Is this a great blessing or a great misfortune which has befallen them?
 ABBY
 He's asked me to marry him.
 BILL 
 I never really thought he would.
 ABBY
 I thought you wanted me to.
 BILL
 Before I did. You cold?
Abby is shivering. Bill takes off his jacket and slips it over her shoulders.
 BILL 
 What're you thinking?
 ABBY
 We've never done anything like this.
 BILL
 Who'd know but you and me?
 ABBY
 Nobody.
 BILL
 That's it, Ab. That's all that matters, isn't it?  
 ABBY
 You talk like it was all right. It would be a crime.
 BILL
 But to give him what he wants more than anything? Two, threeI
months of sunshine? He'll never get to enjoy his money anyway.
What're you talking about? We'd be showing him the first good
times of his life.
 ABBY
 Maybe you're right.
At each hint of consent from Abby, Bill feels he must press on.
 BILL
 You know what they're going to stick on his tombstone? "Born
like a fool, worked like a mule." Two lines.
Abby cannot say the proposal is devoid of principle. The idea of easing Chuck's imminent death gives them just the shade of a good motive. This would be a trade.
 ABBY
 What makes you think we're just talking about a couple of months?U
 BILL
 Listen, the man's got one foot on a banana peel and the other
on a roller skate. What can I say? We'll be gone before theI
President shows up.
He straightens his coat and smooths back his hair, to make her smile, without success.
BILL Hey, I know how you feel. II
Hey, I know how you feel. I feel just as bad. Like I was sticking an icepick in my heart. Makes me sick just to think about it!
heart. Makes me sick just to
 ABBY
 I held out a long time. I could've taken the first guy with a gold watch, but I held out.
 (pause)
 I told myself that when I found somebody, I'd stick by him.
 BILL
 I know. We're in quicksand, though. We stand around, it's
going to suck us down like everybody else.
 (pause)
 Somewhere along the line you have to make a sacrifice. Lots of people want to sit back and take a piece without doing nothing. 
He waits to see how she will respond. Half of him wants her to turn him down flat. Abby is bewildered. 
 ABBY
 Have I ever complained? Have I said anything that would make
you think...
 BILL
 You don't have to. I hate it when I see you stooped over and
them looking at your ass like you were a whore. I personally
feel ashamed! I want to take a .45 and let somebody have it.
 (pause)
 We got to look on the bright side of this, Ab. Year from
today we got a Chinese butler and no shit from anybody.
 (pause)
 Some people need more'n they have, some have more'n they need. It's
just a matter of getting us all together.
 (pause)
 I don't even know if I believe what I'm saying, though. I
feel like we're on the edge of a big cliff. 
Abby looks at the ground for a moment, then nods.
 109	TIGHT ON CHUCK
 Chuck lies in bed, daydreaning.
 110	TIGHT ON ABBY AND URSULA
 Ursula decorates Abby's hair with flowers and tells her how pretty she looks.
 111	EXT. RIVER BANK
 The wedding takes place along the river. The Preacher has come back with his ACOLYTES. A chest of drawers serves as the altar. Benson is the best man--a joyless one. Ursula bounces around in a beautiful gown, looking for the first time like a young woman. The BAND practically outnumbers the guests: ELDERS from the local Mennonites, the MAYORS of a few surrounding towns decked out in sashes and medals, etc.
 112	TIGHT ON ABBY AND BILL
 Bill kisses the bride on the cheek. Each believes she is going through with this for the other's sake. They whisper back and forth.
 ABBY
 You know what this means, don't you?
 (he nods)
 We won't ever let each other down, will we?
 BILL
 I love you more than ever. I always will. I couldn't do this unless I loved you.
 113	SERIES OF ANGLES
 The Acolytes ring an angelus bell. Chuck slips a sapphire on her finger. The Preacher, with outstretched arms, reminds them all that they are witness to a great event. 
 114	SKY - ABBY'S POV
 Abby, frightened, looks off at the rolling sky, wondering how all thislooks in the sight of heaven.
 115	INT. BEDROOM - DUSK
 From her pillow, Abby watches Chuck shyly enter the bedroom
He comes over and sits down beside her
 CHUCK
 You're wonderful.
She is silent for a moment. The wind moans in the rafter
 ABBY
 No. But I wish I were.
 (pause)
 Listen. It sounds like the ocean.
They smile at each other.
 116	EXT. BELVEDERE - DUSKI
 Bill watches the lights go out in the Belvedere. A lump rises to his throat. How exactly did this happen? He sets his jaw, vowing not to give way to weakness or jealousy. This is the price they have to pay for a lasting
happiness.
 117	TIGHT ON ABBY, CHUCK, ETC.
 The next morning the newlyweds set off on their honeymoon. 
Chuck tells Bill to move his things from the dorm into the Belvedere.
Abby, a basket of cucumbers under her arm, waves goodbye, angling her wrist so that Bill and Ursula can see the diamond bracelet Chuck has given her.
 118	EXT. PRAIRIEI
 They steer out across the prairie in a1912 Overland auto. Ursula runs after them, slaps the back fender and hops around on one foot, pretending the other was run over. Abby laughs. She knows this stunt.
When they are gone Ursula turns fiercely on Bill.U
 URSULA
 I hate you.
 BILL
 What for? Don't be any more of a pain in the neck than you gotta
be, okay?
She swings at him with her fist. He pushes her away._
 BILL
 You think I like this? I'm doing it for her!
 URSULA
 You scum.
Bill slaps her.
 BILL
 Still think so?
She throws a rock at him and runs off. He catches her, repenting of his meanness.
 BILL
 I know you can't understand this, but there's nothing I want except good things for Abby and you. Go ahead and hit me back.
She hesitates a second, then slaps him as hard as she can. Blood glistens on his lip. He does not say a word in protest. She looks at the wound, horrified, then throws her arms tight around him.
 119	EXT. PIERI
 Abby and Chuck disembark from a paddleboat steamer at a
pier along the river. Chuck looks excited.
 120	EXT. YELLOWSTONE POOL
 Chuck and Abby have gone to Yellowstone Park for their honeymoon. Abby wades in a pool, wreathed by mists from the underworld. She carries a parasol to protect her from the sun. The trees in the vicinity are bare of leaves.
 121	EXT. ANTLERS - FREEZE FRAME
 Chuck kneels with a box camera to photograph a large pair of antlers lying on the ground.
 122	SERIES OF STILLS (STOCK)
 This photo becomes the first in a series from their Yellowstone trip: fishermen displaying sensational catches by a river, buggies vying with early autos on rutted roads, the giant Beaupre who stood eight feet tall, etc. Each of the pictures bears a caption. Together they make a little story.
 ABBY (o.s.)
 We saw grizzly bears and a boar. The bears scared me the most.
They eat garbage.
 (whispering)
 I was so lonesome. I missed you.
 123	TIGHT ON BILL AND ABBY
 Bill and Abby kiss, renewing old ties.U
 ABBY
 There was a mountain partly made of glass, too, but we didn't get to see it. And a petrified tree.
 BILL
 We'll go back.
 ABBY
 Can we? Because there's a whole lot I didn't get to see.
Bill straightens up. Chuck sits down on Abby's other side.
 124	EXT. DINNER TABLE UNDER NETI
 They are having dinner on the lawn in front of the Belvedere. A fine mesh net is spread above them like a tent to keep the insects out. Ursula sits on Bill's lap. He puts a hand up the back of her shirt and they play as though she were a ventriloquist's dummy.
 125	TIGHT ON RABBIT
 Bill displays a rabbit which he trained in their absence to perform a card trick.
 BILL (o.s.)
 I have you now, Ed. Only thing that can beat me is the ace of spades. (His name's Ed..) Her name's Abigail. Hungarian name.
 (mumbling)
 Andrew drew Ann. Ann drew Andrew.
From the whole of a spread deck it picks the ace of spades.
 126	NEW ANGLE
 Abby and Chuck applaud. Ursula cranks up the victrola and puts on a record. Bill strokes the rabbit.
 BILL
 You know why I like him? He minds his business and isn't full of baloney.
Chuck turns to Abby and, for nearly the first time, smiles.
 CHUCK
 He's funny.
Bill holds a plate up for Abby to see. Limoges china. Abby rolls her eyes and spits out a cherry pit. They eat like pigs, with no respect for bourgeois manners.
 URSULA
 You have any talents, Chuck?
 CHUCK
 No, but I admire people who do.
 ABBY
 That's not so. He can do a duck. Show them.
 BILL
 Stand back. Get the women and children someplace safe.
Chuck, feeling it would be wrong not to enter the spirit of the occasion, does his imitation. The likeness is astonishing. Abby wipes a bit of food off his chin with her napkin. Bill drums on the table with his spoon.
 ABBY
 You saw how modest he was?
 BILL
 How'd you get along so long without a woman?
Chuck shrugs. Ursula makes a gesture as though to say by masturbating. Chuck does not see it. Billy laughs. Abby slaps her. The rabbit jumps out of the way.
 ABBY
 Don't you ever behave that way at table!
 (to Chuck)
 She's adopted. I had nothing to do with her upbringing. I'd trade her off for a yellow dog.
 (to Ursula)
 Now eat. You want to starve to death?
 URSULA
 That's what you'd like.
Abby, overcome with impatience, throws her food to the dogs. Ursula catches a grasshopper and holds it out to Chuck.
 URSULA
 You give me a quarter to eat this hopper?
Chuck does not reply. She pops it into her mouth anyway, enjoying his look of shock. Bill throws down his fork.
 BILL
 All right, okay, nobody's hungry anymore. What's the worst thing you ever did, Chuck? Besides missing church and that kind of stuff.
Chuck thinks about this.
 CHUCK
 Once I turned a man out in the middle of winter, without a cent of pay. For  all I know he froze.
 BILL
 If you went that far, he must've deserved it. What else?
 CHUCK
 He didn't. I fired him out of resentment.
 BILL
 Well, you're the boss, right? That's how it works. Got to make decisions on the spot. Anyway, this guy-what's his name?--if I know his kind, which I do, he's probably doing okay for himself, got a hand in
somebody else's pocket for a change. Is that all?
 CHUCK
 All I can think of right now. How about yourself?
 BILL
 (to Abby)
 He wants to know. I'm not going to count setting Blackie's 
on fire either. He had it coming.
 BILL (con't)
 (pause)
 Once I punched a guy while he was asleep.
Chuck looks surprised. Bill glances at Abby, worried that he might have said too much.
 BILL
 I was just kidding. Actually a guy I know did, though.
 ABBY
 Maybe he did it to you.
 BILL
 Yeah. I think so.
Chuck gets up to ring for Miss Carter. Bill looks him up and down. Chuck, though older, is physically more imposing.
 URSULA
 Can I have the rabbit?
 BILL
 Get serious. I can win money with him.
She licks his ear. He laughs.
 URSULA
 I want that bunny.
 BILL
 You still believe in Santa Claus.
Bill closes his eyes as he feels the soft fur of the rabbit. Ursula looks around to make sure Chuck is gone, then wings a roll at Bill. It bounces off his forehead. He retaliates with a pat of butter.
 127	BENSON
 Benson watches from another hill. He finds his displacement by these newcomers a humiliating injustice.
 128	NEW ANGLE
 Chuck returns to the table and draws Bill aside.
 CHUCK
 Almost forgot. Here's your pay. Bill takes the envelope Chuck holds out. Then, in a spasm of conscience, he gives it back. 
 CHUCK
 hat's the matter?
 BILL
 I got no right to.
 CHUCK
 Why?
Bill is momentarily at a loss for words.
 BILL
 I haven't worked hard enough to deserve it. I been goofing off.I
 CHUCK
 Don't be silly.
 BILL
 Give it to charity or something.
 (pause)
 Don't worry. I always know to look out for myself, because ifI
I don't, who will? See what I'm driving at?
Chuck sees a sense of honor at work in Bill here, and
though he considers the gesture misguided and a little
grand, admires him for it.
 129	EXT. BASESU
 They play a game with big lace pillows for bases. The
rules are unintelligible.
 130	NEW ANGLE
 Bill is expert at throwing knives. As the others watch, he goes into a big windup and pins a playing card to the side of the house.U
Everyone seems happy and congenial. They have reached some kind of plateau. Chuck's ignorance of the ruse does not cause the others to treat him with less respect. They seem themselves almost to have forgotten it. 
 131	BILL AND ABBY'S POV - LATERU
 Benson collects the bases, a job he doubtless feels is beneath him.
The Doctor's wagon, unmistakable even at such a great distance, thunders away from the Belvedere.
 132	TIGHT ON BILL AND ABBYU
 Bill and Abby, waiting for Chuck to join them for a swim,U
look questioningly at each other.S
 133	EXT. RIVER
 Ursula, in her bathing suit, jumps from a ledge above the river. She holds a big umbrella over her to see if it will act as a parachute.
Bill and Chuck have a water fight. Abby wades in the shallows with a parasol.
 134	TIGHT ON ABBY AND URSULA - LATER
 Abby is teaching Ursula how to kiss.
 ABBY
 Too like a mule.
 URSULA
 (trying again)
 What about that?
 ABBY
 It's got to be--how should I say?-- more relaxed.
They laugh and kiss again.
 135	NEW ANGLE
 Farther up the slope Bill and Chuck wring out their bathing suits. Bill, thinking of the Doctor's visit, puts a hand on Chuck's shoulder. This time Chuck does not stiffen or ease it off.
 BILL
 You okay?
 CHUCK
 Sure. Why?
Bill shrugs, beaming with admiration for this man who does not burden others with his secrets.
 BILL
 I appreciate everything you've done for Abby. I really do. You've given her all the things she always deserved. I got to admit you have.
Chuck looks off, embarrassed but oddly pleased. Bill snatches up a handful of weeds and smells them.
. 136	CRANE SHOT
 Returning home they portray the movements of the sun, earth and moon 
relative to each other. Abby is the sun and keeps up a steady pace across 
the prairie.
Chuck, the earth, circles her at a trot, giving instructions. Bill, with the 
most strenuous role of all--the moon-- runs around Chuck while he circles Abby.
 137	EXT. PRAIRIE - SERIES OF ANGLES
 They play golf on the infinite fairway of the prairie. Bill and Abby make a team against Chuck and Ursula. Nightingales call out like mermaids from the sea.
 BILL
 You liking it here?
 (she nods)
 Feel good?
 (she nods)
 Feels good to feel good.
He smiles, satisfied that he has done well by her, and lets a new ball slip down his pant leg to replace the one he played.
 138	NEW ANGLE
 Ursula, meanwhile, grinds Abby's ball into the dirt with the heel of her boot. She winks at Chuck. Chuck smiles back.
 CHUCK
 What's your mother like?
 URSULA
 Her? Like somebody that just got hit on the head. She used to pray for me. Rosary, the stations, everything. "Hey, Ma," I tell her, "I ain't crippled." They don't know, though. They say you're in trouble. They don't know.
 (pause)
 My dad, the same way. Thought the world owed him a living. He drowned in Lake Michigan.
 139	EXT. BELVEDERE
 They walk home. Bill stays behind to work on his strokes. Ursula sends the dogs after the balls.
 BILL
 You shag them, not those dogs. They might choke or run off with them.
 URSULA
 Who made you the boss? Shag them yourself.
 BILL
 Listen, some day all this is going to be mine. Or half is. Somebody like that, you want to get on his good side, not give him a lot of gas. You want to do what he says.
He steps off a few paces of his future kingdom and draws a deep breath.
 BILL
 This reminds me of where I came from. I left when I was six. That's when I met your sister.
He looks at the land with a new sense of reverence. He snatches up a handful of grass and rolls it between his palms.
 BILL
 I can't wait to go back to Chicago, bring them down for a visit. Blackie and them. There's a lot of satisfaction in showing up people who thought you'd never amount to anything.
 (pause)
 I'd really like to see this place run right. I got a lot of ideas I'd like to try out.
 140	BILL'S POV AND TIGHT ON BILL
 In the distance he sees Chuck put his arm on Abby's waist and whisper something in her ear. This intimacy rubs him the wrong way. He gives his clubs to Ursula and starts after them.
 141	INT. KITCHEN
 Bill finds them in the kitchen. Chuck goes into the other room to look for something. Abby lifts the cigarette out of Bill's mouth, takes a drag and does a French inhale. Bill kisses her.
 ABBY
 Nobody's all bad, are they?
 BILL
 I met a few I was wrong on, then.
Suddenly they hear Chuck's footsteps. They pull back just in time, Abby returning the cigarette to him behind her back. They chat as though nothing had happened.
 BILL
 I have a headache. I probably should've worn a hat.
Abby rolls her eyes at this improvisation. No sooner does Chuck turn his back than Bill's hand darts out to touch her breast. He snatches it away a moment before Chuck turns back.
Together they walk into the living room.
 BILL
 You ever see anybody out here?
 CHUCK
 Not after harvest.
 BILL
 How often do you get into town?
 CHUCK
 Once or twice a year.
 BILL
 You're kidding. He must be kidding.
 CHUCK
 Why do I need to?
Bill catches Abby's eyes. He frowns at the idea of being cooped up with this Mormon all winter.
 BILL
 Relaxation. Look at the girls. Opportunity to see how other folks live.
Chuck looks at him blankly. None of these reasons seems to carry
much weight for him. Bill turns to Abby.
 BILL
 Somebody is nuts. I don't know whether it's him or me, but somebody is definitely nuts.
 ABBY
 Why don't I fix tea?
 BILL
 Maybe I should help you.
He follows her back into the kitchen, where he starts to kiss her. She pushes him away and turns to making the tea.
 ABBY
 You're worse than an Airedale.
 (raising her voice)
 You want jasmine or mint?
 CHUCK (o.s.)
 Mint.
Bill lifts up the back of her dress and looks under it, testing the breadth of his license. She slaps it back down. He lifts it again, standing on his right to. She glowers at him.
 ABBY
 Don't do that.
 (calling to Chuck)
 How much sugar?
 BILL
 Why not? I'm just seeing what kind of material it's made of.
 CHUCK (o.s.)
 One spoonful.
Bill walks around absentmindedly, inspecting Chuck's things, stealing whatever catches his fancy. A book, a paperweight, a bell--things he does not really want and has no use for. His conscience is clear, however; the sacrifices they are making excuse these little sins.
As Chuck walks in, Bill has pocketed a candlestick.
 ABBY
 Where's the candlestick?
Chuck shrugs. Bill gives Abby a cold look and goes outside.
 CHUCK
 He's a strange one.
 ABBY
 (nodding)
 Once he named his shoes like they were pets. It was a joke, I guess.
 142	EXT. WELL
 Bill drops the candlestick down the well, stands for a moment, then punches the bucket with his fist. He looks up. Benson has seen him.
 143	EXT. SAPLINGS AGAINST WINDOW - NIGHT
 Outside the saplings thrash in the wind.
 144	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
 Abby wakes up with a gasp.
 CHUCK
 What's the matter?
 ABBY
 I had a dream.
 CHUCK
 What about?
 (pause)
 Was something after you?
 ABBY
 I forgot it already.
 145	AERIAL SHOT (STOCK)
 The camera falls through the clouds as though in a lost fragment of Abby's dreams.
 146	EXT. BARN
 Benson sulks by the barn. Chuck approaches him.
 CHUCK
 You come down here a lot, don't you? Always when you're mad. You never change.
 BENSON
 It might not be my place to say this, sir, but I don't think they're honest people.
 CHUCK
 He gets on your nerves, doesn't he? He always has.
 (cutting in)
 Now don't say something you're going to regret.
. BENSON
 Why should I regret it? I think they're a pair of scam artists,
sir. Let me tell you what I've seen, and you judge for yourself.
Chuck, who of course has seen the same things and more, raises a hand to silence him.
 CHUCK
 Maybe you'd be happier taking over the north end till spring. I don't say this in anger. We've been together a long time, and I've always felt about you like, well, close. It just might work out better is all. Less friction.
 BENSON
 Don't believe me, then. You shouldn't. But why not check it out, sir? Hire a detective in Chicago. It won't cost much. What's there to lose?
Chuck's brow darkens as Benson goes on. For a moment we glimpse the anger that would be unleashed if ever he woke up. Somewhere he already knows the truth but refuses to acknowledge it.
 CHUCK
 You're talking about my wife.
And so Chuck, too, becomes an accomplice in the scheme.
 BENSON
 Maybe I better pack my things.
Benson turns and walks off. Chuck watches him go, ashamed at himself. What has this man done but a friend's duty?
 147	INT. MASTER BEDROOM
 Abby sits at the dresser in the master bedroom. Bill walks in through the door and tries Chuck's hat on for size.
 ABBY
 What're you doing in here?
 BILL
 Just walked in through the door, like any other white man.
On the bureau he finds a pistol. He aims it out the window. All this will soon be theirs!
 BILL
 Smith and Wesson. You ought to see one of these plow into a watermelon.
She holds a hairbrush out for him to see. He looks it over and  gives it back without comment. He finds a stain on the tabletop.
 BILL
 Somebody's been staining this fake inlay with a water glass. Actually I don't blame them.
He walks around trying out more of Chuck's appurtenances. Abby, caught up, models a shawl before an imaginary mirror. She blows a kiss at herself.
 ABBY
 Don't say I did that.
 BILL
 The bed should be over next to the window. Where the view is.
Bill is already making plans for life after Chuck's demise.
 BILL
 Maybe we build on a balcony.
 (pause)
 First the birds go.
The peacocks are crowing outside. They burst out laughing. Bill checks the mussed bedsheets.
 ABBY
 That doesn't concern you.
 BILL
 Why not?
 (no reply)
 Look, I know you've got urges. It wouldn't be right if you didn't.
Abby stands up, angry.
 ABBY
 You think I enjoy it?
 BILL
 Lower your voice.
 ABBY
 You act like it's harder on you than me! I never want to talk
about this again.
Bill, consoled, holds an eyelet blouse against the light.
 BILL
 I bet he enjoys looking at you in this.
 ABBY
 I thought you liked it.
 BILL
 He likes it, too, is what I'm saying.
 ABBY
 Well, it's the style.
 BILL
 I see.
 ABBY
 What do you want me to wear in this heat? A blanket?
 BILL
 That's your problem.
Abby puts on her wedding bracelet and admires it. Bill softens at the sight of her beauty, properly adorned.
 BILL
 I told you someday we'd be living in style. When this whole thing is over I'm going to buy you a necklace with diamonds as big as that.
He holds out the tip of his little finger. They laugh, as though they suddenly felt the absurdity of all this make-believe.
 BILL
 You're cute. Maybe a shade too cute.
She touches his face sympathetically, as though to say that she knows the pain this was causing him.
 ABBY
 This is terrible for us both. 
 CHUCK (o.s.)
 Abby?
They jump as Chuck calls up from downstairs.
 ABBY
 Down in a minute.
She kisses Bill.
 148	EXT. BACK DOOR OF BELVEDERE
 Bill sneaks out the back door of' the Belvedere, only to find Benson drinking at the well. They look at each other in silence for a moment. Benson's horse stands beside him, a suitcase fixed to the saddle.
 BENSON
 I know what you're doing.
 BILL
 What're you talking about?
 BENSON
 That boy's like a son to me. Don't you forget it. I know what you're doing.
Benson gets on his horse, turns and rides off. Miss Carter waves goodbye from the side of the house. She and Bill exchange a look.
 149	EXT. FRONT PORCH
 Bill finds the others around front. Abby lolls in the hammock writing in her diary and eating a peach. Ursula plays the guitar.
Little by little the newcomers have done the house over from the austere structure that it was. Living room furniture has been moved out onto the front lawn and there arranged as though by a child. Goats sleep on the divan. Archery targets hang from the side of the house. The porch is covered with a striped awning, bird cages and twirls of bunting. Everywhere an atmosphere of drunken ease prevails.
 BILL
 Nice fall day.
 URSULA
 Wish I'd said that.
 BILL
 (to Abby)
 Watcha doing?
 ABBY
 Eating a green peach. 'Spect to die any minute.
 BILL
 Listen, I had a great idea. Let's spend Christmas in Chicago. Break
up the old routine. Rhino's never been to a baseball game or a horse
race. I know guys one month off the boat that have. Don't even
speak the English language, but they eat it right up.
 (pause)
 You're just a young guy, Rhino; you oughta be running around
raising hell. No offense to the little woman.
He bows apologetically to Abby. She pinches a dead leaf off a plant.
 CHUCK
 Abby says that in the poor section people eat cats.
 BILL
 Did you, sis? Well, there's always something doing. I can't
begin to tell you. State and Madison? Mmmm. Lights everywhere.
You'd love it.
 CHUCK
 It can be rough, though.
 BILL
 Rough? Listen, you can't walk down the street without somebody
reaching in your pocket! You've got to keep your coat like this
and poke them away.
 ABBY
 Bill got shot once. The bullet's still in him.
 CHUCK
 Really?
 BILL
 Doctor said he took it out, but I never saw it. Hurt like a bastard.
You got no idea how it hurt.
Suddenly he worries this might discourage Chuck from going.
 BILL
 They won't mess with you, though. Big fella like you. I can see it
now.
He offers a taste of the talk Chuck is like to provoke on the street corners.
 BILL
 "Hey, hey, hey. Who's this here, fresh out of the African Jungle,
moving down the sidewalk with a whowhowho, taking ten feet at a step
and making all the virgins run for cover? Why, it's Big Rhino, the
King of Beasts. He walks, he talks, he sucks up chalk."
Bill steps back and sees, as though for the first time, how imposing Chuck really is.
 BILL
 You are big, aren't you? Sunny Jim! You must've had a real moose
for an old lady.
 ABBY
 Take it easy.
But Chuck holds none of this against him. He knows it comes from respect.
 BILL
 So what do you say?
 (pause)
 What a sorry outfit! Bunch of old ladies. You better stay behind.
Your mammas'd probably get upset.
But when the time comes, I'm out of here. Hit the road, Toad!
Ursula passes the sandwiches around until there is just
one left, Miss Carter's. While the others are talking,
she scoops up a handful of dirt and pours it into the middle.
Bill, lighting a cigarette, notices Chuck's hand on Abby's.
 BILL
 Ever seen a match burn twice?
 CHUCK
 No.
Bill blows out the match and touches Chuck's hand with
the hot ember, causing him to yank it away.
 BILL
 That's old.
Chuck starts to cough. Bill looks at Abby, then whips the handkerchief out of his pocket and puts it over his nose, as though to keep from getting Chuck's germs.
Miss Carter's face goes blank as she bites into her sandwich.
She jumps up and rushes back into the house. Chuck frowns.
Bill glares at Ursula, then turns to Chuck and, referring to the dead prairie grass which runs through the front yard right up to the house, continues:
 BILL
 You ever thought of putting in some fescue here? Some fescue grass?
Of course, it might not take in this soil.
Chuck stands up and winds a stole, a long religious scarf, around his neck.
 CHUCK
 You ready?
 BILL
 I still have a little of this sore throat. Where you going, though?
 CHUCK
 To kill a hog.
 BILL
 What's the necktie for?
 (pause)
 Or does it just come in handy?
 CHUCK
 Keeps the stain of guilt off.
Chuck nods goodbye and walks off, taking a stool with him. Bill sighs with admiration.
 BILL
 I try and try.
 ABBY
 What a splendid person! I've never met anybody like him!
 BILL
 Splendid people make you nervous.
 ABBY
 They do! I breathe a sigh of relief when they step outside the room.
Bill puts on his boater and opens a copy of the Police Gazette. 
They are silent for a moment. 
 BILL
 A guy ate a brick on a bet. Must of busted it up first with a hammer. Guy in New York City. Where else?
 (Jumping up)
 Anybody want to bet me I can't stick this knife in that post?
Nobody takes him up on this. Abby leafs through the
Sears catalogue, her mind dancing with visions of splendor.
 150	TIGHT ON CATALOGUE
 Pictured. in the catalogue are bath oils and corsets and feathered hats. A grasshopper is perched on the page among them, its eyes blank and dumb.
 151	TIGHT ON ROSE
 Bill watches her run her finger slowly around the closed heart of a rose. Suddenly they both look at each other. They have heard the squeals, faint but unmistakable, of a hog being led to slaughter.
 152	TIGHT ON STOOL - QUICK CUT
 Chuck has tied the hog's feet to the inverted legs of  the stool.
 153	OTHER QUICK CUTS
 Ursula, off by herself, skips rope.
A flag on the pole by the front gate snaps in the breeze. From the branch of a lone tree the hog dangles by its hocks into the mouth of a barrel.
 154	EXT. BELVEDERE - ABBY'S POV FROM SECOND FLOOR WINDOW
 Miss Carter storms down the hill with her bags. Fed up, she is leaving the bonanza. Chuck tries in vain to appease her. She keeps walking, out the front gate and into the prairie on a straight course for the railroad tracks.
Chuck will now be alone at the Belvedere with the newcomers and no other point of reference.
 155	EXT. CLOTHES LINE
 Later that afternoon, Bill catches sight of Abby's underthings rustling on the clothes line.
 156	INT. STAIRS
 That evening he watches her from behind as she climbs the stairs to join Chuck at their bedroom door. She nods goodnight, sensing the jealousy that is growing in him.
 157	INT. MASTER BEDROOM
 Chuck looks impatiently through a drawer.
 CHUCK
 I can't find anything around here. Last week it was my gloves; this
week my talc. What's going on?
He stands and watches Abby get ready for bed. She fills him with a deep adoration. He feels that in the tulip of her mouth at last he has found heaven.
 CHUCK
 You're beautiful.
 ABBY
 You don't think my skin's too fair?
He comes up behind her and touches her long hair.
 CHUCK
 You're smart, too, aren't you?
 ABBY
 I know what the Magna Carta is.
 CHUCK
 Can I help you brush it out?
 ABBY
 Not right now.
She is cold to discourage false expectations in him--and because she feels that she at least owes Bill this. Chuck, however, assumes the fault must be his own. His naivete about women, and the world in general, protects
the conspirators--and protects him, too, for he glimpses enough of the truth not to want to know any more.
 CHUCK
 What makes you so distant with me?
 ABBY
 Distant? I don't mean to be.
 CHUCK
 You know what I'm talking about,  though. You aren't that way
with your brother.
 158	INT.ATTIC
 Bill, eavesdropping in the attic above them, surveys Chuck's dusty heirlooms.
 CHUCK (o.s.)
 It must be something I'm doing. I wish you'd tell me what, though.
 159	INT. BEDROOM
 These gentle endearments, so rarely heard from Bill, stir her deeply. She throws herself in his arms.
 ABBY
 Oh, Chuck I Please forgive me. Does it mean anything that I'm
sorry?
 CHUCK
 (pleased) 
 But I don't blame you. Did I make it sound that way?
 ABBY
 You should. You have a right to.
 CHUCK
 It's just that sometimes I feel I don't know you well.
 ABBY
 You don't. It's true.
 CHUCK
 I think you love me better than before, though.
She rubs her cheek against his hands. Daily she feels warmer toward him. How much of this is love, how much respect or devotion, even she cannot say.
 160	TIGHT ON BILL - LATER - NIGHT
 The night throbs with crickets. Bill cracks open the bedroom door. Chuck lies asleep in a shaft of moonlight next to Abby. He hesitates a moment, but a strange compulsion drives him on. He has never done anything
so dangerous, or had so little idea why.
 161	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
 Abby wakes up to find him staring her in the face. He kisses her. Chuck stirs. Abby signals they should go outside.
 162	EXT. BELVEDERE - DAY FOR NIGHT
 They sneak out of the Belvedere. The night is warm.
 ABBY
 You're no good.
 BILL
 Mmmm. But I love you.
 ABBY
 I can't stand it any more. This is just so cruel. We're both no
good. I've got to get drunk with you, Bill. You know what I mean?
Drunk.
Bill wags a bottle. The dogs, awakened, bay from the kennel. They wait a moment to see if a light will go on in the house, then dart off toward the fields. A plaster lawn dwarf seems to watch them go.
 163	EXT. FIELDS - DAY FOR NIGHT
 They run through the fields, hand in hand, laughing and flirting. The moon makes Abby's nightgown a ghostly white.
 ABBY
 We can never do this again, though. Okay? It really is too dangerous.
 BILL
 This one night.
He toes a sodden old shoe.
 BILL
 Hey, I found a shoe.
 164	SHOE, COYOTES, SCARECROW - DAY FOR NIGHT
 The shoe gleams in the moonlight. Coyotes yelp from the hilltops. A scarecrow spreads its arms against the sky. The waving fields of wheat have given way to vast reaches of cleanly shaven stubble, stained with purple morning glories. Odd, large stakes are planted among them.
 165	NEW ANGLE - DAY FOR NIGHT
 BILL
 You want me to spin you around?
She nods okay. He takes her by the hands and spins her around the way he used to--until they go reeling off, too dizzy to stand.
 166	EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY FOR NIGHT
 They lie by the river looking at the great dome of stars. Bill wants to believe things are the same between them as before. So does Abby--but she knows better.
 BILL
 Suppose we woke up tomorrow and it was a thousand years ago. I
mean, with all we know? Electricity, the telephone, radio, that kind of
stuff. They'd never figure out how we came up with it all. Maybe
they'd kill us.
She looks at him, and they laugh.
 BILL
 You sleepy?
 ABBY
 This is the first time we slept together in a while, Bill.
 BILL
 You like it?
 ABBY
 Of course.
 BILL
 Kiss me, then.
 ABBY
 It's so sweet to be able to kiss you when I want to.
 167	NEW ANGLE
 Before the marriage his lovemaking was gentle and soft. Now it has a brutal air, as though he were asserting his right to her for the last time.
 168	TIGHT ON ABBY - DAWN
 Dawn is breaking. Abby jumps to her feet, alarmed. They have slept too long.
 169	EXT. BELVEDERE - DAWN
 They have run back to the Belvedere. It seems they are safe until Chuck appears on the porch, yawning and stretching. Bill drops to the ground while Abby goes ahead.
Abby appears at one side of the house while Bill steals around the other. Luckily, they have come up from the back.
 CHUCK
 Abby! I've been looking all over for you. Where have you been?
While she distracts Chuck, Bill slips back in the house. It has been a close call.
 ABBY
 Watching the ducks.
 CHUCK
 Didn't you sleep well?
 ABBY
 No.
 170	TIGHT ON ABBY (DISSOLVE TO PAGE, THEN TO URSULA)
 Abby looks sympathetically at Chuck. Her face dissolves into a page of her diary and from there to Ursula, balancing an egg on her fingertip.
 ABBY (o.s.)
 Chuck saw Ursula balance an egg. He begged her to repeat this trick,
but she wouldn't.
 171	TIGHT ON CHUCK
 Chuck tries to reduplicate Ursula's feat. Abby, amused, reaches out and touches his face.
We wonder if, despite herself, she might be falling in love with him.
 172	EXT. BELVEDERE
 Bill watches the Doctor walk out the front door and down the steps to his wagon. Chuck follows, smiling.
 ABBY (o.s.)
 The Doctor came. Chuck looked pleased for a change.
 173	EXT. PRAIRIE - BILL'S POV
 The Doctor's wagon rolls off across the prairie.
 ABBY (o.s.)
 Tomorrow the President passes through. Plans have changed, and he can't stop.
 174	EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - DUSK
 They have come down to the railroad tracks to watch the President pass through.
 URSULA
 We should have brought a flag.
 ABBY
 Does she have time to ride back and get it?
Abby and Bill hold hands. Chuck by now is accustomed to such displays. They seem, however, to make Abby increasingly uncomfortable.
 175	MOVING TRAIN - THEIR POVS
 The train bursts past at twenty yards, its great light rolling like a lunatic eye. Bill's heart pounds with excitement. Chuck holds Abby by the waist. Ursula waves a handkerchief... They cannot make out anything specific in the windows, but there is the sense of people going more important places, getting on with the serious business of their lives - while out here they stagnate.
Dimly visible, on the back platform of the caboose, a MAN in a frock coat salutes them with his cane.
The train has quickly vanished into the declining sun. Everything is quiet again. Ursula rushes up the grade to collect some pennies she laid on the tracks.
 ABBY
 Did you see him wave?
 CHUCK
 He was shorter than I expected.
 BILL
 How do you know it was him?
 ABBY
 I saw!  He had a hat on.
 BILL
 You didn't understand my question.
They walk back to the buggy. Ursula holds up a dead snake she found on the tracks.
 URSULA
 You know what I'm going to do with this? Take it home and put it in
vinegar.
 BILL
 That was the President, shortie. Wake up.
Bill watches Chuck help Abby into the buggy. She is laughing about something or other. His hand lingers for a moment on hers. She does not brush it aside, as once she might have, but to Bill's dismay, presses
it against her breast. Chuck seems to have breathed a hope into her that he, Bill, was never able to.
 176	EXT. FIELDS
 Abby and Ursula race across the fields trying to fly a kite. Ursula rides a tiny Shetland pony. Just as the wind lifts the kite away, they run into Bill. He sits by himself observing a spear of grass. Abby drops off. Ursula rides off over the hill with the kite, leaving her alone with Bill.
 ABBY
 You look deep in thought.
She touches his cheek. He brushes her hand away.
 ABBY
 What's the matter?
 BILL
 Nothing.
 ABBY
 There's nothing wrong?
 BILL
 No.
 ABBY 
 What're you so mad about then?
 BILL
 Who said I was mad?
 BILL
 Can't I be alone once in a while without everybody getting all
worked up? 
 ABBY
 You're the only person getting worked up.
Some buffalo appear on the crest of the next hill. Abby looks at them. They do not seem quite part of this world but mythical, like minotaurs.
 ABBY
 Chuck says they're good for the grass.
 (pause)
 Stop giving me that look.
 BILL
 You can't keep your hands off him these days.
 ABBY
 What're you talking about?
 BILL
 You know.
 ABBY
 I haven't touched him.
 BILL
 How about the other night? I saw you, Abby. The other night
by the tracks? If only you wouldn't lie! Really, there's
some things about you I'm never going to understand.
 ABBY
 I forgot. Anyway it doesn't matter. What are you doing, always trying
to trap me?
Bill paces around, disgusted with himself and the whole situation.
 BILL
 I can't stand it any more. It's just too degrading.
 (pause) 
 You and him. Why do I have to spell it out? I thought it would be all
over in a month or two. Guy might go another five years. We've got to
clear out, Abby.
They stare at each other in silence for a moment.
 ABBY
 Why stop now?
 (pause)
 We've come this far.
 BILL
 What?
 ABBY
 You heard me.
 BILL
 Why stay? Go ahead and tell me! I'm standing here.
Bill trembles with shock and anger. The buffalo cast aware glances at them.
 ABBY
 You want us to lose everything?
 BILL
 I'm telling you I can't stand it.
 ABBY
 You're weak then. What about all I've been through?
 (pause)
 And what about him? It would be the worst thing we could do. Worse
than anything so far. It would break his heart.
Bill is silent for a moment.
 BILL
 You're getting to like him, aren't you?
 ABBY
 It would kill him. Leaving now would be just cruel.
 BILL
 Would it? So what's it matter to somebody in his shape?
 (pause)
 In fact you're just leaving us one way out.
 ABBY
 What're you talking about? Murdering him? Ursula comes riding over the hill, without the kite.
 BILL
 You watch and see.  
 URSULA
 I had to let it go. One of them started following me, and I threw
a rock at him. I had a bunch stored in my pocket.
They take off running after her.
 177	EXT. BELVEDERE
 As they approach the Belvedere, Bill sees Chuck standing on the front steps. Suddenly angry, he draws Abby to him and in plain view kisses her on the lips.
 ABBY
 He can see you!
Bill nods; he knows. Abby runs ahead, angry and alarmed.
 BILL
 Don't you believe in being honest?
 178	NEW ANGLE
 Abby bounds up the steps. Chuck has bent his mind to understand all this as mere sibling love, but here is the greatest test so far.
 ABBY
 Aren't you going to kiss me?
 CHUCK
 Why?
 ABBY
 Today's my birthday.
Chuck gives her a kiss, glad to put aside his suspicions.
 179	TIGHT ON POINTERS, QUAIL AND PHEASANTS
 Tails level, their noses thrust high in the air, a pair of pointers prance through the high uplands grass, following a scent like sailors taking in a rope. Pheasants and quail tremble in their coveys, their eyes big with fear.
 180	EXT. UPLANDS
 Chuck has taken Bill out bird-hunting. They wear heavy canvas leggings and carry shotguns.
 BILL
 Did you ever tell Abby the buffalo help keep up the grass?
 CHUCK
 I think so. Why?
Bill shrugs. Chuck welcomes this opportunity to speak of his wife. He considers Bill a good friend, in fact the only person with whom he can talk about delicate matters.
 CHUCK
 I want to get her something nice for Christmas.
Bill, who means to kill Chuck the first chance he gets, forgets this intention for a moment to give him advice.
 BILL
 (thoughtfully)
 She likes to draw. Maybe some paints. Nothing too expensive--
she might want to exchange it. Maybe a coat. She likes to show
off sometimes. She's sweet that way.
 CHUCK
 I wish I knew how to make her happy. Nothing I do really seems to.
 BILL
 That's how they are. They like to make you work for it. I couldn't
ever figure out why.
 (pause)
 Sometimes you can't go wrong, though. You know that one Abby showed you a picture of? Elizabeth? I took her cherry.
 CHUCK
 I know. You told me.
 BILL
 Actually, I didn't, but I could have. The point I'm making is you've got
to understand how they operate. Get them thinking you can take it or
leave it, you're usually okay.
Suddenly the dogs stop rigid, on point. At Chuck's hiss they sink into the  grass.
Bill looks at Chuck's exposed back. Nobody would know. It could be made to seem like a hunting accident. He cocks the hammer of his shotgun. His heart pounds wildly. Chuck talks in a low voice to the dogs.
 CHUCK (o.s.)
 All right, put them up, girl.
The dogs rise and inch toward the birds, as slowly as the minute hand of a clock. All at once the quail explode out of hiding. Bill jumps at the noise. Chuck fires twice. Two birds fall. The retriever notes where. Chuck turns around.
 CHUCK
 Why aren't you shooting? I left you those two on the left.
 BILL
 They caught me off guard.
 CHUCK
 You have to keep your gun up.
Chuck walks ahead. The music builds a mood of tension. Bill takes a practice shot into the ground. Bill looks around. There is nobody in sight. He turns the sights on Chuck's back. It would be simple enough.
Though only twenty feet away, he closes the gap, to make sure he does not miss.
Chuck whistles the scattered birds back to their covey. "Pheo! Pheo!" Soon, faint and far away, comes a reply-the sweet, pathetic whistle of the quail lost in a forest of grass. The mother bird utters a low "all is well."
One by one, near and far, the note is taken up, and they begin to return.
Bill holds his breath. His finger moves inside the trigger guard. He only has to squeeze a fraction of an inch. Three more birds shoot out of the grass. Chuck fires. At first we think Bill has, but he cannot stoop this low. He does not have the heart. Disgusted, he throws his gun on the ground. Both barrels go off. Chuck snaps around, startled and concerned. Bill is
shaking like a leaf.
 CHUCK
 What's the matter? What are you so upset about?
 BILL
 They surprised me again. Chuck sends a retriever after the fallen birds, then--in an unprecedented gesture-he puts his arm over Bill's shoulder to comfort him, like an older brother.
 181	NEW ANGLE
 They return home, the day's kill slung over the back of a Shetland pony.
 182	EXT. BACK YARD
 They sit on stools in the back yard plucking the birds.
 BILL
 You like to box?
 CHUCK
 I never have.
 BILL
 Just wondering. I got a pair of gloves I brought with me.
Bill feels oddly better, as though Chuck had backed down.
 CHUCK
 Abby bought me this at Yellowstone.
Chuck shows Bill his knife. Bill reads a name off the handle.
 BILL
 That's what she calls you? 'Chickie?'
He gets up, his nostrils flaring with anger. Chuck thinks this indignance is on his behalf.
 CHUCK
 Doesn't bother me. Should it?
Bill throws down the pheasant he was plucking.
 CHUCK
 What's the matter?
 BILL
 Don't let her fool you, too. She warms up to whoever says please and thank you.
 CHUCK
 What's the matter?
Bill, still angry at himself, considers telling him.
 BILL
 You really want to know?
He would like Chuck to know the truth but does not want theresponsibility for revealing it. He must find out by accident.
Luckily they are interrupted as Ursula runs up, pointing over her shoulder. A pair of three-wing airplanes sputters into view low overhead. One seems to be having engine trouble.
 183	EXT. FIELD NEAR BELVEDERE
 The planes set down in a nearby field. "Toto's Flying Circus" is emblazoned on the wings.
 184	NEW ANGLE
 Five PEOPLE clamber out, members of a seedy vaudeville troupe. They swagger around, filthy with oil from the backwash of the props, looking more like convicts than entertainers. Their LEADER is an excitable Levantine.
LEADER How long it take to fix? Very mooch time! Now look where you
hab stuck us. Salaupe! You forget who I aim!
Bill, Abby and Ursula approach the aircraft with the greatest caution, like the Indians at Cortez's ships.
 185	EXT. SCREEN - NIGHT
 A JUGGLER and a SNAKE CHARMER perform first separately,
then jointly as a slap act. A DOUBLE TALKER weaves sentences of absolute nonsense. After a moment a black and white image appears over his face and he drops out of sight.
The troupe is putting on a show to earn its supper. ONE of them stands behind the viewers -- Abby and Bill, Chuck and Ursula -- cranking a carbide projector by hand. A silent movie appears on the screen, full of extraordinary pratfalls, disappearances and other tricks of the early
cinema. Chuck has never seen anything remotely like this.
 CHUCK (o.s.)
 How'd they do that? Where'd he go? There must be a wire. Etc.
He steps forward to inspect the screen, actually just a sheet hung along a clothesline, to see whether the image is coming from behind. Bill and Abby sit rapt as children, nostalgic for Chicago.
 186	EXT. DINNER TABLE - NIGHT
 Ursula serves dinner. She is excited by the visitors'
city ways. They are bored with her, all except the
youngest, GEORGE, a young pilot in a white scarf.
 URSULA
 We never hear a thing out here. It's like being on a boat in the
middle of a lake. You see things going on, but way far away, with no voices.
GEORGE Maybe time to clear out.
George puts his hand on hers. She snatches it away.
GEORGE What's the matter? Aren't I your
type or something?
The Doubletalker pokes his fork into a pudding. A balloon, concealed beneath the surface, explodes to general delight. Down the table Abby and Bill chat with the Leader.
LEADER You do not understand, sir. I am saddled with asses, yaays? I, who
once played the Albert Hall
 BILL
 You. hear that? He called me 'sir.'
In their gaiety he carelessly puts a hand on Abby's leg.
 187	TIGHT ON CHUCK - NIGHT
 Chuck looks on from the shadows, no longer just puzzled but angry. He has watched them behave this way a dozen times before, but tonight, with other people around, he must see it more directly.
 188	EXT. STRAW STACK - NIGHT
 George tells Ursula a joke. She dissolves in giggles before he can finish, as though amazed at his power to dispense illusion.
 189	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
 Chuck, alone in the darkened living room, calms himself down by breathing through a rubber mask into a respirator. Joyful noises reach him from outside.
 190	CHUCK'S POV - NEXT MORNING
 The next morning Chuck looks down out his bedroom window.
The troupe is packing to leave. Still troubled, he walks to the bed and and stands over Abby.
 CHUCK
 What's going on, Abby?
She does not respond. He yanks the sheet off. She is wearing a nightgown. She looks up and frowns. This is the first time she has ever seen him this way.
 CHUCK
 You know what I mean. Between you and Bill.
 ABBY
 I have no idea.....
 CHUCK
 (interrupting)
 Something's not right, and I want to know what.
Abby jumps out of bed and assumes the offensive. She has no other choice.
 ABBY
 Say it out loud. What're you worried about? 
 (pause)
 Incest?
 CHUCK
 It just doesn't look right. I don't know how brothers and
sisters carry on where you come from, but...
 ABBY
 (interrupting)
 Did you ever have a brother. Then who are you to judge? Maybe if
you had, you'd understand. Anyway, times have changed while you've been stuck out in this weed patch. We're
************************line missing****************
She puts on a robe and walks out. Her last argument has worked best. Chuck never imagined he was in step with the times.
 191	EXT. BELVEDERE
 Abby slips out the front door. She looks around to make sure that Chuck is not watching her, then heads off to find Bill. The vaudevillians gorge themselves on last night's leftovers, steal flowers from the flower beds,
etc. ONE sits off by himself, playing a French horn.
 192	EXT. DORM
 She finds Bill by the dorm throwing a switchblade in the ground, a toothbrush in his mouth.
 ABBY
 I have to talk to you.
 BILL
 Look what I traded off those clowns. For a bushel of corn!
She draws him by the arm behind a wall. She is trembling with fear.
 ABBY
 Chuck is suspicious.
 BILL
 Chickie you mean? So what?
 ABBY
 Really. This is the first time he's ever been like this. I'm scared.
All this flatters Chuck in a way Bill does not like.
 BILL
 What for? Why're you so worried what he thinks?
 ABBY
 He could kill us. I want to live a long time, okay? I just got
started and I like it.
Bill shrugs, as though to say he can handle whatever Chuck can dish out and a little more.
 ABBY
 You might take a little responsibility here. You got us into all this.
 BILL
 Did I? Well, it never would've come up if you hadn't led him on.
Led Chickie on!
 ABBY
 Is that the best you can do? Knowing you it probably is.
You've made a mess of our lives, okay. Don't pretend it was my
fault.
Bill combs his hair to calm himself down.
 BILL
 Why's this guy still hanging on like a goddamn snapping turtle?
Because of you. Boy, this was a great idea. Right up there
with Lincoln going down to the theater, see what's on!
 ABBY
 Keep your voice down.
 BILL
 Don't give me that. When a guy's getting screwed, he's got a right
to holler.
 ABBY
 You're such a fool!
 BILL
 What?
 ABBY
 Nothing.
 BILL
 I heard what you said.
 ABBY
 Then why'd you ask? Oh, how did I ever get mixed up with you?
Abby, in terror of Chuck's finding out, cannot understand why Bill seems to care so little.
 BILL
 You've gone sweet on him. You have, haven't you?
Abby hesitates. Bill throws his knife away.
 ABBY
 I admire him. He's a good man.
 BILL
 Broad shoulders. I know. Very high morals. Why can't he talk
faster? It's like waiting for a hen to lay an egg.
 ABBY
 You wouldn't understand, though. He's not like you. You don't
know how people feel. You only think of yourself.
 BILL
 What's going on between us, Abby? Think about that. If you figure it
out, tell me, will you? I'd appreciate it.
 (pause)
 Lord, but you do come on! You talking like this, used to play
around right under his nose. Somebody I met in a bar, remember?
Or maybe you walked in, thought it was a church. Well, I've had
it.I'm clearing out. You understand?
They look at each other for a moment.
 ABBY
 Go ahead.
This is not what he expected to hear. But now his pride requires that he face the truth and not back down.
 BILL
 Okay.
He looks at her for a moment. He cannot be dealt with this way. He turns and walks off.
 193	NEW ANGLE
 Ursula flirts with George. He slips a hand inside her blouse. She bats it away.
 194	EXT. BEDROOM WINDOW
 Bill stands on the ground below the master bedroom. Chuck leans out the window above him. Peacocks roost on the balcony, beneath the telescope. The vaudevillians are loading up their planes. Abby watches from the porch.
 BILL
 I'm going away for a while. They're giving me a lift.
 CHUCK
 What for?
He shrugs.
 BILL
 I'm wearing one of your shirts. Let me take it off for you.
 CHUCK
 Never mind.
 BILL
 I got my own. Just wasn't any clean today.
Bill takes off the shirt, drapes it over a post and walks off, hurt and angry, but with a sad dignity.
Chuck is not entirely sorry to see him go, nor is Abby; she knows that he is getting out just in time. One more episode like last night's and the fuse would hit the powder.
 195	NEW ANGLE
 Bill gives Ursula his money.
 BILL
 We get split up for any reason, you spend that on school.
 196	EXT. PRAIRIE
 The vaudevillians are ready to take off. Bill boards the plane which George is piloting, wondering if today's break with Abby is real or just in anger, a necessary gesture. With him he carries his only possessions, a bindle and his trick rabbit. Abby, Chuck and Ursula look on.
 CHUCK
 What's eating him?
Abby shrugs and walks down to Ursula.
 URSULA
 Why aren't we going with him?
 ABBY
 What for? To sleep in boxcars?
 197	AIRPLANES
 The planes set their wheels in the furrows, rev their engines and wobble off into the sky. Ursula waves goodbye to George.
 198	EXT. PLAINS UNDER SNOW - SERIES OF ANGLES
 Winter has come. Snow falls across the breadth of the plains, on the river and the dark sleeping fields.
 199	EXT. SLEIGH (OR ICE BOAT) - SNOW
 Chuck and Abby skim over the snow in a gaily painted sleigh (or ice boat). She is wrapped up snug in a buffalo robe, her feet on a hot brick. Pigs forage along the fences.
 200	INT. CAVE
 They inspect a cave with a kerosene lantern. Blocks of ice, covered with burlap and sawdust, cool shelves of preserves.
Abby drops a stone into a dark pit. Two seconds pass before it hits the bottom.
 ABBY
 Probably that's the first noise down there for thousands of years.
She speaks as though she had done it a favor. He puts his hand on hers. She presses it against her chest.
 ABBY
 You ever wish you could turn your heart off for a second and
see what happened?
 201	OTHER ANGLES
 Views of backlit gems, stalactites, salamanders in their cold dark pools, hidden springs and other mysteries of nature.
 ABBY (o.s.)
 Maybe nothing would.
They round a corner and come upon an underground waterfall. It flows out of darkness back into darkness.
 202	INT. FORGE
 Bill, meanwhile, stands in a line of panting, sweating IMMIGRANTS.
On their shoulders they carry the huge barrel of a cannon. With a grunt they drive it into the fiery mouth of a forge.
 203	EXT. CITY STREET
 Bill stands on the corner of a big city street, stamping his feet against the cold. He tries to catch a pigeon with some bread crumbs under a box propped up by a stick, but just as he pulls the string to drop the trap it darts
out of the way.
 204	BILL AND YOUNG GIRL
 Bill has an improvised conversation with a YOUNG GIRL who has run away from home. He asks her where she comes from, whom she belongs to, etc. She tells him of her hopes, then passes on. Bill gives her all the money in his pocket.
 205	MONTAGE
 Enthralled, Abby surveys the wonders of Babylon and
Nineveh in a book about the Near East.
Ursula sits with a world globe, taking a geography lesson from a traveling TUTOR. No doubt this was Abby's idea.
Abby copies from a small plaster model of a Roman bust. She wants painfully to improve herself.
 206	EXT. FROZEN LAKE -NIGHT
 Abby and Chuck skate around a bonfire on a frozen prairie lake, carrying torches to guide them through the dark.
 207	INT. CHICAGO FLOPHOUSE
 Bill sits in a cold flophouse trying to write a letter. After a moment he wads it up and throws it away.
 208	EXT. BELVEDERE
 Abby, Ursula and Chuck are on a walk outside the Belvedere. The snow is gone. Abby's hands are stuffed in a chinchilla muff.
All at once they hear a distant noise like the whoops of an Indian war party. It seems mysteriously to come from every hilltop. Abby turns to Chuck with a puzzled look.
 CHUCK
 Prairie chickens. That means winter's broken.
 ABBY
 Really? Where are they?
 CHUCK
 You hardly ever see them.
They stand and listen to the birds. There is a sense of the earth stirring back to life. Abby breathes in with a wild joy and hugs Chuck tightly by the waist.
 209	EXT. TENEMENT HALLWAY
 Bill is talking with a FRIEND in the hallway of a tenement.
 BILL
 I can't seem to get my mind on anything. I thought, when I came
off that place, boy, they'd better get all the women out of town that day, you know? Somewhere safe. But you know what I do? I sleep, nothing but
sleep.
A PANHANDLER approaches them with a hard-luck story.
 FRIEND
 Okay, here's a quarter, but give me some entertainment, okay?
Not this old song and dance.
While the Panhandler performs, Bill looks around.
Two POLICEMEN have appeared in the entryway talking with the LANDLADY. Bill edges out the back door and down the steps, as though they might be after him.
He walks briskly down the alley without looking back.
 210	TIGHT ON CHUCK (DISSOLVE TO DIARY)
 Chuck holds a handful of seed under his nose. His heart stirs at the dark, mellow smell.
Into this dissolves an image of Abby writing in her diary.
 211	EXT. FIELD
 Chuck swings a barometer round and round, checking the weather. Two Case tractors pitch across a field like boats on a rolling sea. Long plumes of smoke wind off behind them. Each tows a fourteen-gang plow. A third
tractor follows, putting in the seed.
Ursula chases a flock of blackbirds off with a big rattle.
Every acre of ground for as far as the eye can see is under cultivation.
 ABBY (o.s.)
 They put in the wheat the other day. This will be the biggest
year ever. There was a scare
when a locust turned up. Luckily it wasn't the bad kind.
 212	NEW ANGLE
 The plows have turned up a hibernating locust. Chuck stands by the tractor, inspecting it under a magnifying glass. The creature nestles like a fossil in the black earth.
 ABBY (o.s.)
 They sleep in the ground for seventeen years, then crawl up
around the end of May and spend a week flying around before they die.
Chuck kicks up the dirt around the plow, looking for others. Benson, back from exile, looks concerned.
 CHUCK
 Nothing to worry about. Just shows the land is good.
 213	SERIES OF ANGLES
 Various wonders of the prairie:  a charred tree, a huge mastodon bone, a flowering bush, a pelican, the rusted hulk of an ancient machine, etc.
 ABBY (o.s.)
 How strange this new world is! You walk out in the morning
sometimes to find a lake rippling where the day before solid land
was.
 214	EXT. STONE BOAT
 Chuck has laid out the outline of a 50-foot boat in whitewashed stones. He walks around the imaginary deck showing Abby where the cabins will be.
 ABBY (o.s.)
 Chuck wants to build a boat and take us off to Java, which he's
never seen.
 215	EXT. FIELDS
 Ursula goes out to the fields with an organist named JOEY
whom Chuck has hired to play for the crops. He and Ursula
seem to hit it off.
 ABBY (o.s.)
 Last month he brought in a kid to play the organ. He claims it
helps the crops grow. Personally I doubt it.
 216	EXT. MIDDLE OF FIELDS
 They have brought an organ out into the middle of the fields. Ursula pumps up the bellows. Joey sits in front of the keyboard and shoots his cuffs.
His fingers strike the keys.
 217	CLOUDS, CLOSEUPS OF PLANTS - TIME LAPSE PHOTOGRAPHY (STOCK)
 Clouds build in huge toadstools. Thunder rolls across the
plains. A rain begins to fall. The music seems to work a magic on the crops, to draw them forth. The seeds germinate in the darkness of the
soil. Water finds its way down. Roots, tiny hairs at
first, spread and grow.
 218	DOLLS, TIGHT ANGLES ON THEIR FACES
 Rude dolls fixed at the ends of pointed sticks--agricultural fetishes that Chuck's father brought with him from the Old World--stand around the field to join in aiding the crops.
 219	EXT. BELVEDERE
 Flags and bunting adorn the porch for Independence Day. Ursula sets off some fireworks.
 ABBY (o.s.)
 Time has flown, and once again harvest is near.
 220	EXT. GREEN FIELDS(TRIFFIDS)
 The bald earth has, as though by a mystery, become a sheet of grain, its green already fading to gold. The music dies away, replaced by the whirr of summer crickets.
 ABBY (o.s.)
 It will be a year that we have been here.
The camera holds and holds on the fields until in their vacant depths, we begin to sense the presence of a deep malevolence, still biding its time but growing every minute.
Seagulls--like strange emissaries from another world--glide back and forth over the fields in search of grasshoppers.
 221	INT. LANTERN - NIGHT
 Ursula takes curling irons from the chimney of a lantern where she has set them to heat, and applies them to Abby hair.
 URSULA
 Suppose I never fall in love, Abby?
 ABBY
 Don't be silly. Everybody does. What do you think all those songs
are about? You need to be careful, though, and not throw it away.
 URSULA
 Throw what away?
 ABBY
 You know, your chances. It's too hard to explain to a little
squirrel like you.
 URSULA
 That sounded just like Bill. Don't you miss him?
 ABBY
 Sometimes.
From her tone, however, we sense that she finds it easier with him gone.
 222	INT. MASTER BEDROOM
 Abby whispers something to Chuck in bed that evening.
 CHUCK
 You ever said that to anybody else?
She giggles.
 CHUCK
 You're lying, aren't you? Well, go right on lying.
The camera moves to the window, beneath the eave. Outside, peacocks strut back and forth.
 223	EXT. MUDDY ROAD
 Bill rides an Indian motorcycle along a muddy road back to the bonanza. His rabbit is strapped to the back. He stops for a moment to look at the new fields.
 224	EXT. BELVEDERE - BILL'S POV
 Abby sings to herself as she beats out a carpet. Bill appears on the ridge behind her. Hope leaves him like a ghost. She looks happily settled into a new life with Chuck. All at once she turns around.
 ABBY
 Bill!
She rushes up and embraces him, but her warmth just seems a tease to Bill. She is different. She looks different. The tutors and tailors Chuck has brought in over the winter have given her more polish. Her hair is nicely
coiffed. Where she used to dress in cotton shirtwaists, she wears crinolines now.
 BILL
 How's everybody been?
 ABBY
 Including me? Okay. Gee, you look good.
 BILL
 Thanks. And Chuck?
 ABBY
 Still the same.
 BILL
 Actually I didn't mean it that way.
 (pause)
 I came back to help out with the harvest.
He feels humiliated at not having a stronger excuse. But he loves her. He aches with love. He hoped their last fight was just another storm in the romance. Evidently it was more.
 BILL
 I thought about you a lot. Wrote you a letter, but it was no good, so I tore it up.
 ABBY
 How'd you come?
 BILL
 Train.
He looks her up and down.
 BILL
 Nice dress.
 ABBY
 I'm glad you like it.
He admires her garden. His familiar cockiness vanishes as little by little he sees the old feeling is not there.
 BILL
 This is new, too.
 ABBY
 The daffodils were already here,  but I put in the rest. You
really do like them?
At a shriek from Ursula, Bill turns around. She runs into his arms, and covers him with kisses.
 URSULA
 I've missed you! I thought about you every day. You should've written. Did Abby show you what she got?
Abby scowls at Ursula. With no choice but to show him, she opens the top button of her blouse and draws out a diamond necklace.
 ABBY
 (apologetically)
 For Christmas.
 URSULA
 Plus a music box. He spoils her. Why don't they spoil me, too?
 (whispering)
 You oughta be glad you didn't have to spend the winter. You
would've gone crazy.
 225	TIGHT ON ABBY
 The winter's peace is gone. Abby is sick with fear. Now that she loves Chuck, too, she can never again be honest with Bill. The truth of her feelings would crush him. Moreover, there's no telling how he might react. He could ruin everything, even get them killed.
 226	EXT. BEDROOM WINDOW
 Chuck looks on from behind the bedroom window.
 227	EXT. DINNER TABLE
 They dine in awkward silence. Benson has joined them.
Abby, for all her winter's polish, still eats with the back of her knife.
 CHUCK
 How was Chicago?
 BILL
 Great.
 ABBY
 How's everybody doing?
 BILL
 Okay.
They are silent for a moment. Bill senses that nobody except Ursula is really glad to see him back.
 ABBY
 How's Blackie?
 BILL
 Still hasn't wised up. Know what I mean? He asked how you were
doing, though.
 (pause)
 I told him. Ran into Sam, too. He'd been in a fight.
 ABBY
 Oh yeah?
Bill can see that her interest is only polite. He knows that he should turn around and leave, but he cannot. The sight of him with his confidence gone is painful to behold.
 BILL
 His nose was like this.
He pushes his nose to one side. Ursula and Abby laugh.
 228	EXT. STOCK POND
 Bill plants willow slips in the soft earth by the stock pond. Ursula orders a dog around.
 URSULA
 Look at this dog mind me. Sit! You've got to say it like hitting a nail.
 BILL
 Has she asked you anything about me?
 URSULA
 No.
Ursula flirts with him, running the shoots along his back.
She waits to see what he will do. He gets up and after a short chase catches her. He holds her at arm's length for a moment, then kisses her.
 URSULA
 What'd you do that for?
Bill wonders himself. To get revenge on Abby? He touches her breast.
 URSULA
 Don't.
 BILL
 Why not?
 URSULA
 Cause there's nothing there.
 BILL
 I can be the judge of that.
 URSULA
 Then ask first.
He kisses her neck.
 BILL
 Nobody has to know but us  chickens.
 (pause)
 What do I have to say to convince you? You tell me, I'll say it.
 URSULA
 What makes you think I would?
 BILL
 Nothing.
She giggles and kisses him back. But guilt has caught up with him. He cannot go ahead.
 URSULA
 What's the matter?
No reply.
 URSULA 
 Maybe it would be wrong.
 (disappointed)
 You still love her, don't you?
Bill hums a rock off toward the horizon.
 BILL
 I should've gone in the church, like my father was after me to.
 229	BILL'S POV - OUTSIDE THE BELVEDERE - NIGHT
 Chuck and Abby sit in their cozy living room playing Parcheesi. The sound of their voices is muffled. The camera draws back to reveal Bill outside the window, watching.
She is comfortable with Chuck now. Apparently, he has lost his place in her heart. He wants to rush in and drag her away.
 230	EXT. BEDROOM WINDOW - NIGHT
 Later that night he stands under the bedroom window and wonders at the meaning of the shadows that flicker across the ceiling. After a moment he withdraws into the darkness.
 231	EXT. SMALL PRAIRIE TOWN (DUCK LAKE)
 Bill has brought Abby into a nearby town to make some purchases. Dressed in a chauffeur's gown and goggles, he sits against the fender of the Overland watching her move from store to store. Ursula is with her.
The TOWNSPEOPLE all speak German. Their peasant costumes are freely mixed with Western dress. The signs are old German script. Two MEN carry a huge bulb through the street, to put atop a church.
 232	OVERLAND AUTO
 Abby walks up with Ursula.
 URSULA
 Listen, I'm going to stay and go back with the laundry wagon.
Abby looks at Bill, then nods okay. Ursula runs off. Bill opens the door, and she gets in.
 233	EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE TOWN (DUCK LAKE)
 They are stopped on the road a hundred yards outside the town.
Abby smokes as Bill checks the radiator. Something in his behavior leads us to suspect he may have staged this stop.
 BILL
 How you been doing?
 ABBY
 Me? Fine.
 BILL
 We don't talk so much these days.
 ABBY
 I know.
She knows what he wants. She cannot give it anymore.
 BILL
 I said a lot of stupid things before I went off.
 ABBY
 (politely)
 I forgot about it already.
Bill, trying his best to make peace with her, cannot help seeing that she would like to keep things as they are--and not because she harbors any grudge.
 BILL
 You've forgiven me?
 ABBY
 There was nothing to forgive.
He holds a bottle of liquor out to her.
 BILL
 What're you worried about?
She takes a swig. He laughs. She laughs back.
 BILL
 So how'm I doing with you?
 ABBY
 Fine.
He takes her hand and holds it like a trapped bird.
 BILL
 What's happened?
She shrugs, disengaging her hand to brush aside her hair. She is painfully aware of his suffering but doesn't have the heart to tell him how it all is.
 BILL
 I probably ought to leave. I will.
 ABBY
 Already? You just got here.
She hasn't really contradicted him. He leans forward as though to kiss her. She lets him. She wishes that she could give herself to him, but she doesn't know what is right. Then, a sudden impulse of panic, she gets up and backs away.
 BILL
 Where you going?
He reaches out to catch her. She breaks away and starts to run. He walks quickly after her, cutting off any escape toward the town.
 ABBY
 Why'd you have to come back?
 BILL
 I'm not going to hurt you. I only want to talk with you.
She stops and hides her face in her hands. He gently pulls them away.
 BILL
 I didn't come back to make trouble for you. I guess we were fooling
each other to think it could last. I mean, What was I offering youanyhow? A ride to the bottom. Looking at you now, in the right  clothes and everything, I see how crazy I was and--well, I understand. It's okay. I sort of cut my own throat, actually.
Her eyes close and her legs give in. Bill lets her go and backs off a step in surprise. She sinks to the ground, as though in a trance.
 234	TIGHT ON BILL
 Bill, taken by surprise, goes up and kneels down beside her. He looks to see that she is okay. He picks a fox-tail out of her hair. Her dress has worked up toward her knees. He pulls it back down. He wants to caress 
her face but hesitates.
 BILL
 How'd we let it happen, Abby? We were so happy once. Why didn't we starve? I love you so much. What have1 done? You're so beautiful. What have I done?
He touches his lips for a fraction of a second to hers, notices another car approaching down the road. He picks her up like a doll and carries her back to the Overland.
 235	EXT. BELVEDERE - CHUCK'S POV
 They have arrived back at the Belvedere.
 ABBY
 I'm sorry.
She touches his face in a surge of sympathy. What has she done to him? He kisses her neck and leads her toward the front door.
 236	CRANE TO CHUCK
 The camera rises to the uppermost story of the Belvedere. Chuck has seen them. Hot tears leap to his eyes. Before Bill left for the winter he often observed such intimacies between them. Now it all looks different.
 237	CHUCK'S POVS (HIGH ANGLES)
 He looks around at his estate--his barn, his auto, his great house and his granary. None of them is any consolation now. Far a moment it seems to him as though he lived here in some time long past.
 238	INT. BEDROOM
 Abby notices Chuck watching her outside the bedroom door.
 ABBY
 You want something from me?
 CHUCK
 No.
 ABBY
 Will you hand me that magazine?
He gives her the magazine she wants.
 ABBY
 What's the matter?
He seems for a moment to consider telling her, then shrugs and goes downstairs.
 239	INT. LIVING ROOM
 He stumbles into a bird cage but hardly notices. The jostled birds raise a fuss.
 240	EXT. FRONT PORCH
 He runs into Bill on the front porch.
 BILL
 I've been looking for you. I have to take off again, real soon here, and...
Chuck puts a hand on Bill's shoulder, stopping him. They look at each other for a moment, then he passes on. Bill seems puzzled.
 241	EXT. FIELDS
 Chuck walks out into the deep of his fields. The wheat, a warm dry gold, is almost ready to take in. He sits down and rests his head against a 
furrow, powerless to think. The wind makes a song in the infinitude of sweet clicking heads.
He puts his hands over his heart and breathes in gasps, with the dumb honesty of a wounded animal. He could not himself quite say what it is that he knows.
 242	EXT. BONANZA - SERIES OF ANGLES
 Late that afternoon disaster strikes as a swarm of locusts sweeps down on the bonanza. We do not see where they come from. They seem to appear out of nowhere, unnoticed. Ursula works in the kitchen, Bill by the barn. Chuck lies asleep in the field, Abby upstairs in bed.
 243	ANIMALS ON BONANZA
 The animals sense it first. The buffalo move off in a mass. The horses become uncontrollable. One runs around the barn in a panic. Bill watches it, puzzled.
Two peacocks have a fight.
A dog in the treadmill races in vain to escape, driving the machine to a feverish pitch. The shadow of a giant cloud licks over the hills.
 244	EXT. FIELDS
 Everything seems normal in the fields.
Then, as you listen, a strange new sound begins to rise from them, a wild sea-like singing. As the camera moves over the fields and down into the wheat it swells in a crescendo until...
 245	TIGHT ON LOCUSTS
 Suddenly we see them up close, devouring the stalks in a fever, the noise of their jaws magnified a thousand times.
They slip into the Belvedere, under the sash and wainscoting, turning up first in places it would seem they could never get into: a jewelry case, the back of a radio, the works of a music box, a bottle with a miniature ship inside, etc.
 246	EXTREME CLOSEUPS
 Their eyes are dumb and implacable. They seem to have a whole hidden life of their own.
 247	INT. KITCHEN
 Little by little they gather in numbers. Ursula first sees one on the drainboard. She swats it with a newspaper. Others sprout up. One by one she picks them up with a tongs and drops them into the stove. This method
is too slow. She begins to use her fingers. She moves with a quick, nervous energy, even as she understands this is futile. At last claustro-phobia seizes her. She spins around with a shriek, lashing out at everything in sight.
 248	INT. MASTER BEDROOM
 In the bedroom overhead, Abby wakes up from one nightmare into another. She jumps out of bed and goes to the window. The locusts pelt against the pane like shot. She throws the bolt. Suddenly a crack shoots through the glass. She jumps back and watches in horror as a sliver of the pane falls in. They are free to enter.
 249	SERIES OF ANGLES
 Suddenly they are everywhere: on the clothesline, in the pantry, in hats and shoes and the seams of clothing. Not a nook or cranny is safe from penetration.
 250	TIGHT ON CHUCK - SLOW MOTION
 Chuck, asleep in the deep of the wheat, bolts up in slow motion. His hair is seething with them.
 251	EXT. BONANZA - FURTHER ANGLES
 Panic hits the bonanza. Workers tie string around their pant cuffs to keep the insects from crawling up their legs, then rush out to the fields with gongs, rattles, pot lids, scarecrows on sticks, drums and horns and 
other noisemakers to scare them off.
Some pray. Others run around like madmen, stamping and yelling, ignored by the gathering host. A couple get into a fistfight.
A storm flag is run up the flagpole. A tractor blasts out an S.O.S. The peacocks huddle under the stoop.
 252	TIGHT ON CHUCK
 Chuck gives Benson his orders.
 CHUCK
 Offer fifty cents a bushel for them. Get out the reapers.
See what you can harvest.
 253	HIGH DOWN ANGLE
 The locusts snap through the air. Bill, swatting at them with a shovel, stops to gag. One has flown into his mouth.
 254	TIGHT ON GEARS
 They jam up the gears of the machinery with the crush of their bodies.
 255	INT. MASTER BEDROOM
 Abby throws a sheet over herself, but they get in under it. She thrashes around madly, then with a cry goes limp.
 256	CHUCK AND BENSON
 Benson reports back to Chuck. A team of horses races by, nearly bowling them over.
 BENSON
 We can't get the machines out. They're jamming up the gears.
There's a good chance they'll pass on south, though. Unless...
unless a wind comes up.
 CHUCK
 What happens then?
 BENSON
 They'll set down and walk in.
 257	SIGNS OF DAMAGE
 The locusts devour not just the crops but every organic thing: pitchfork handles, linens on the clothesline, leather traces, flowers in the window boxes, etc. Soon a large area of wheat is eaten down to stubble.
Bill looks away from a tree for a second. When he turns back it has been stripped to a wintry bareness.
 258	EXT. WIND GENERATOR, OTHER ANGLES
 The vanes of the wind generator begin gently to stir. Little by little the wind picks up. A dust devil spins across the yard. The grass lists by the well. A power line moans.
 259	EXT. FIELDS
 As the sun dips below the horizon, the locusts pour in like a living river, walking along the ground like a procession of Army ants. The roar of their wings is deafening. The air hisses and pops with their electric frenzy.
 260	STOCK AND MATTE SHOTS - SUNSET
 And these are but the advance elements of a main force which looms like a silver cloud on the horizon.
 261	EXT. BONFIRE - NIGHT
 WORKERS dump bushels of the insects into a bonfire. A MAN with an abacus keeps track of what each is owed.
 262	SAME FIELDS - NIGHT
 The wind has picked up. Chuck, Bill and Abby have come out to the fields with a dozen WORKERS to investigate the extent of the damage. The insects buzz around blindly in the light of their lanterns, which they carry Japanese-fashion at the ends of cane poles.
 263	TIGHT ON CHUCK - NIGHT
 Chuck inspects the grain.
 CHUCK
 There's nothing we can do but wait. They're either going to take it all or they're not.
He covers his face with his hands. The others shy back at this display of grief, startling in one so formal. Their jostled lanterns cast a dance of lights.
Bill, moved to real sympathy, takes him by the shoulders.
 BILL
 Come on. They might still lift. Hey, I've seen a wind like this lay
down and die. Don't give up now.
 CHUCK
 (ignoring him)
 We could at least make sure they don't get the people on south.
He breaks open the mantle of his lantern, still unsure what he should do. Some of the flaming kerosene splashes onto the crops nearby, setting them ablaze. Bill drops his rattle and swats the fire out with his coat.
 BILL
 What're you doing? Watch it! What're you, crazy? There's
still a chance, don't you see?
Chuck goes to his horse. Bill grabs him by the sleeve. Does he really mean to set the fields on fire? Chuck pushes him aside. Bill, frantic, turns to the others for support.
 BILL
 Stop him, or it's all going up.
They, however, are too uncertain of their ground to intervene. Chuck turns on Bill.
 CHUCK
 What does it matter to you?
Chuck slings fire out of the broken lantern onto the crops next to Bill -- a sudden, hostile gesture that catches them all by surprise. Independent of his will, the truth is forcing its way up, like a great blind fish from the bottom of the sea.
He slings the fire out again. A patch lands on Bill's pantleg. Bill slaps it out.
 BILL
 What's got into you?
They stare at each other. Bill backs off like a cat, sensing Chuck knows the truth, but at a loss to understand how he could.
 CHUCK
 Why do you care? I gave my life for this land.
Chuck walks towards him. Suddenly Bill turns and takes off running. Chuck swings at him with the lantern. Bill escapes behind the building wall of flame that springs up between them.
The whirr of the locusts stops for a moment--they seem at times to have a collective mind--then, just as mysteriously, resumes.
 ABBY
 Stop, Chuck!
Chuck leaps on his horse. She tries to drag him off but is thrown aside and almost trampled underfoot. Now the others join in, trying to knock away the lantern or catch his stirrup. He eludes them and rides off after Bill,  leaving a slash of flame behind him in the grain. They tear off their coats to swat it out, in vain--already it stretches a hundred yards.
 264	BILL
 Bill runs through the night, still carrying his lantern. Chuck bears down on him. Abby chases along behind him, screaming for him to stop.
Bill realizes the lantern is giving his position away He blows it out and vanishes from sight. All we can see is the thundering horseman, sowing fire.
 265	CRANE SHOT
 With a rough idea where Bill is, Chuck begins to lay a ring of fire around him, fifty yards in diameter.
 266	BILL AND ABBY INSIDE RING
 Abby spots Bill against the flames. She rushes up, gasping. They have been caught inside the ring.
 BILL
 What're you doing? This is a bad place to talk
He throws his coat over Abby's head, picks her up by the waist and crashes through the flame. They have to shout to make themselves understood. The locusts roar like a cyclone.
 BILL
 Did you see that? He was trying to burn me. What's got into him?
 ABBY
 He knows. He must.
 BILL
 A whole year's work. All wasted! These bugs, once they make up
their minds...
Bill stalls. The fire races toward them through the wheat. They appear as silhouettes against it.
 BILL
 I need to get out of here. I think you probably should, too.  
 (pause)
 Hell of a life. Damned if you do and damned if you don't.
He leaves. Abby wonders if she ought to run after him.
 ABBY  
 Bill!
But this moment's hesitation has been too long. Already he is swallowed up in the night, her voice swept away in the roar of the flame and the locusts, who seem to wail louder now, and with a great mournfulness--like keening Arab women--as if they knew the fate shortly to envelop
them.
Abby turns back. She, too, has reason to fear Chuck and must escape.
 267	NEW ANGLE
 Benson rallies the workers.
 BENSON
 There's still a chance they're going to fly.
 VOICES
 Get the tractor out! The pump wagon! Blankets!
They rush off to find equipment to fight the fire.
 268	ISOLATED ON CHUCK - NIGHT
 Chuck rides through the dark like a lone Horseman of the Apocalypse, setting his fields on fire.
 269	EXT. PLAINS ON FIRE - SERIES OF ANGLES - NIGHT
 Tractors attempt to plow a firebreak. Mad silhouettes run back and forth, slapping at the blaze with wet gunny sacks fixed to the ends of sticks. Two dormitories burn out of control.
Ursula throws open the barn and lets the horses out. They have raised thunder kicking at their stalls. The light above the barn door pulses erratically.
 270	EXPLOSIONS - NIGHT (MINIATURES)
 Oil wells explode along the horizon. Huge balls of flames roll into the heavens.
 271	EXT. BURNING PLAINS - NIGHT
 Panic spreads among the workers as the holocaust threatens to engulf them. They throw down their tools and run for their lives.
 272	ANIMALS - NIGHT
 Animals flee in all directions:  birds and deer and rabbits, pigs, buffalo and the horses from the barn. The locusts mill around crazily on the wheat stalks, backlit against the flame.
 273	BILL - NIGHT
 Bill, fleeing on his motorbike with his rabbit, holds up
for a moment to watch the fire--a Biblical inferno of spectacular sweep.
 274	EXT. BEDROOM WINDOW--TRACKING SHOT (CHUCK'S POV)--NIGHT
 A single light burns in the Belvedere.
 275	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
 Heaving with sobs, Abby throws her things into a bindle. She has lost Chuck forever. Their life is destroyed. She glances out the window. She still has time to get away, but she must hurry. She bolts for the door. Sud-
denly Chuck steps from the shadows, blocking her exit.
His face, black with soot, looks gruesome in the gas1ight. The locusts have chewed up his clothes.
Abby is like a frightened deer. Did he see her packing?
 CHUCK
 You look as though you'd seen a ghost.
 (pause)
 Where you going?
 (pause)
 Off with him?
The wind cuts gaps in the death wail of the locusts. From time to time we hear the thump of an exploding well.
 CHUCK
 He's not your brother, is he?
How much does he know? She edges toward the door.
 ABBY
 Why do you say that?
 CHUCK
 Come here a minute. Who are you?
 (no reply)
 Where'd you come from?
 ABBY
 I told you.
He shakes her. She quivers like a child in his grasp. She no longer has the audacity to lie.
 ABBY
 How long have you known?
He drops his eyes. Shamefully long -- and his anger is partly just at this.
 CHUCK
 What'd you want? He punches in the shade of a lamp, extinguishing it.
 CHUCK
 Tell me. He shoves over the chest of drawers. She does not move.
He tears down the drapes, already in shreds.
 CHUCK
 This? Show me what you wanted! I would have given it all to you.
 ABBY
 Please, Chuck.  
 CHUCK
 Please what? You're not going to tell me you're sorry, I hope..
 ABBY
 But I am.
Outside the window fires rage along half the horizon. He sits down. He wants to sob, but cannot.
 CHUCK
 You're so wonderful. How could you do this?
 ABBY
 I'm just no good. You picked me from the gutter, and this is
how -- I never deserved you.
 CHUCK
 (interrupting)
 The things you told me.
 ABBY
 I love you, though. You have to believe me. It may sound false after...
 CHUCK
 (interrupting)
 Down at the cave. Don't you remember? I believed them.
 ABBY
 All right. I'm going away. You'll never have to see me again.
 CHUCK
 Away?
He gets up, suddenly alarmed, walks to the mantel and opens a chest.
 ABBY
 What're you doing?
Chuck drapes his neck with the stole he used in slaughtering the hog. Her face goes empty. He gets his razor strop from the shaving basin. She shrinks back in the corner. He looks at her for a moment, then leaves the room. 
 276	INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT
 Abby pursues him down the stairs. He throws her aside.
 ABBY
 Where are you doing? Chuck! What are you doing? I won't  
let you! Come back!
Again he throws her aside, and again she keeps after him, desperate to prevent any harm coming to Bill. Finally he picks her up and drags her outside.
 277	EXT. PORCH - NIGHT
 He lashes her with a rope to a column of the porch. She struggles vainly to free herself. Does he intend to use the razor on her?
 ABBY
 No, Chuck! Please, darling! It wasn't his fault. It was mine.
Let him go. I love you, Chuck. Do anything, only please... 
 CHUCK
 I'm sick of hearing lies.  
He stuffs a handkerchief in her mouth and leaves.
 278	TIGHT ON CHUCK - NIGHT
 Chuck wanders through the night with a lantern, calling his mare.
 279	EXT. BURNT-OUT FIELDS - DAWN
 Dawn breaks. Chuck rides over the burnt-out fields looking for Bill. The feet of his lank white mare are wrapped to the fetlock in wet burlap, to protect them from the smouldering grass. It prances warily along, without
making a sound, wreathed in a mist of blue smoke. With him he carries a stool. The camera pans up to the smoke which is carrying his fortune off.
 280	CHUCK'S POVS
 Burnt, blind deer stand and look at him in utter terror, as though they understood his intentions. The roasted corpses of sharptail grouse, coyotes and badgers lie scattered here and there. Piles of dung burn on after the grass is out.
A peacock from the Belvedere wanders around, angry and
perplexed.
 281	BILL
 Bill is repairing his motorbike by a rock in the middle of the scorched landscape. The tires are soft as licorice from the heat. Suddenly, he looks up. Chuck has found him.
He jumps behind the handlebars and fishtails off. Chuck breaks into a gallop, rides him down, knocks him to the ground with the stool, dismounts and stamps in the spokes of the front wheel to make sure he goes no further.
 BILL
 Who do you think you are? Now you've ruined it. What's got
into you?
 CHUCK
 Where you headed?
 BILL
 Why do I have to tell you? I can come and go when I like.
This is still a free country, last I heard.
Bill stops when he sees the stool. Chuck calmly strops the razor on his stirrup flap. There are no secrets now.
 BILL
 What can I say? Too late for apologies. You've got a right
to hate me.
Chuck puts the razor away and advances on Bill with the stool.
 BILL
 I want to leave. You won't ever see me again. I already got what
I deserve.
There is nothing Bill can say to appease him. This will be a fight to the death. Chuck lashes out with the stool. Bill ducks too late.
 BILL
 Watch it!
Chuck comes at him again. Bill throws a punch, but Chuck blocks it and knocks him down again with the stool.
Bill reels back and cracks his head on the bicycle frame. This time he stays down. Satisfied the struggle is over, Chuck goes back to get some rope.
 282	NEW ANGLE
 Chuck shuts his eyes to mumble a prayer of absolution--in Russian.
Bill in a panic, snaps a spoke out of the broken wheel and lays it against his sleeve.
Chuck moves in for the kill. Bill gets to his feet. He wants to run but fear makes his knees like water. Suddenly, they are face to face. Chuck swings at Bill with the stool but misses. Bill lifts the spoke above him and
drives it deep into Chuck's heart.
Chuck gasps. Bill seems just as shocked. Chuck sits down to determine the gravity of his injury. Blood jets rhythmically out the end of the spoke, as though from a straw. Bill circles him, unbelieving.
 BILL
 Should I pull it out?
Chuck puts his finger over the end of the spoke. Blood seeps out the side of his mouth, like sap from a broken stem.
 BILL
 I better get somebody.
He tries to catch the reins of Chuck's horse, but it shies out of reach, its conscience repelled. He looks back at Chuck in anguish.  What has he done?
 BILL
 You were my friend.
 283	TIGHT ON BILL AND HIS POVS
 The Belvedere is visible on the horizon. Bill hesitates
a moment, then heads back on foot to find Abby. He gives
Chuck a wide berth.
Then, on a ridge in the distance, he spots Benson.
 BILL
 Get a doctor! Fast!
How much did he see? Bill does not stay to find out but
takes off running, though not without first collecting his
rabbit.
Benson, meanwhile, bounds down the hill to Chuck's side.
His left sleeve has been burned away. The flesh beneath
is the color of a raw steak.
 284	CHUCK'S POVS
 Chuck sees the smoke from his fields, the burnt deer,
a circling hawk.
 285	TIGHT ON CHUCK
 He breathes in gulps. His eyes are blank, like a child's
marbles. He takes Benson's hand.
 CHUCK  
 (weakly)
 Wasn't his fault. Tell her...forgive them.
The locusts can be heard no more. The prairie makes a
sound like the ocean. Chuck turns his back and dies.
 286	TIGHT ON BENSON
 Benson weeps. Whether or not he understood Chuck's last
wishes, he seems unlikely to abide by them.
 287	EXT. BELVEDERE
 Bill finds Abby bound to the house like the figurehead
of a ship. He cuts her loose. The ropes fall at her feet. She is free. 
They look at each other for a moment.
Then, in a rush of compassion for them all, she throws
her arms around him.
Bill wonders if she is taking him back. Might their
differences all have been a terrible misunderstanding?
 ABBY
 We have to hurry. Chuck's out looking right now. Oh, Bill,
what have we done? He took his razor. We need to hurry. He
might be coming back any minute.
Bill mentions nothing of his encounter. She grabs her
bindle, Bill a handful of silverware and an umbrella.
After a moment's hesitation, he puts them back.
 288	NEW ANGLE
 They run down to the barn, where the cars are stored.
The saplings in the front yard have been stripped even
of their bark. Abby stops to look back at the Belvedere
one last time. Chuck does not want her anymore. How
could she expect him to?
Bill grabs her by the hand and tugs her along.
 289	EXT. BARN
 Abby throws open the doors of the barn. Bill cranks up
the engine of the Overland.
 ABBY
 Will the cops be looking for us, too?
 BILL
 Probably.
Abby stands in the door. She is reluctant to leave, though she 
knows they must.
 BILL
 Get in.
She notices that Bill's lip is cut, his shirt soaked with
blood.
 ABBY
 What happened to you? Where's this from?
Bill looks down. He forgot.
 BILL
 Had an accident.
She looks at him for a moment, not quite trusting this
explanation. The engine catches with a noise like start-
led poultry. Bill gets behind the wheel. Just as they
are pulling out of the garage, Ursula runs up, black 
as coal from battling the fire all night.
 URSULA
 Where you going?
 BILL
 (breathless)
 We got in a jam. You'll be safer here. Say we're headed for town.
Take care of the rabbit, too. He's yours now. 
 URSULA
 What's the matter?
 BILL 
 Just do what I say. Why're you always arguing about everything?
Wait here till we get in touch.
Bill gives Ursula his wallet and a kiss. Abby gives her a hug.
 290	EXT. BURNT GRASS
 They roar off through the burnt grass of the prairie.
Abby waves goodbye.
 291	THEIR POV (MOVING)
 As they crest a ridge, Benson appears in front of them,
waving a hand to flag them down. Bill puts his foot on
the gas. Benson sees they are not going to stop and fires
at then with a pistol. Bill grabs a shotgun from a scab-
bard under the dash and fires back. Nobody is hurt.
 ABBY
 What's the matter with him?
Bill shrugs. Inside he feels a great relief. They are
free at last. At last he has her back.
 292	EXT. BONANZA GATES
 They veer off across the prairie, towards the Razumihin
gates. The music comes up full.
 293	EXT. SHACK ON RIVER
 They have come to a lone shack on the river, a drinking
house for passing boatmen. They negotiate (in pantomime)
with the PROPRIETOR for a tiny steam boat moored at the
end of the pier. When the car is not enough, Abby throws
in her necklace.
 294	ABOARD THE BOAT
 They board the boat and turn down stream. There is a phonograph 
on board.
 295	TIGHT ON NECKLACE
 The necklace sparkles on the hood of the car--a hint
they are leaving behind evidence that could betray them.
 296	EXT. BOAT ON RIVER - AND MOVING POVS
 They glide along in the hush of evening. The reeds are
full of deer. Cranes, imprudently tame, dance on the
sand bars.
Bill looks around in wonder. He knows these may be his
last days on earth. Abby throws a sounding line.
A COUPLE from a local farm seeks privacy in the willows.
Other BOATMEN glide past in silence. A CHILD plays a
fiddle on the deck of a scow. HUNTERS creep along the
shore in search of waterfowl.
 297	EXT. CAMP - DUSK
 Bill sleeps under a tarp. Abby looks out across the water
and bursts into sobs. She has wronged Chuck and thrown
her life away.
 298	THEIR POVS (MOVING) - NIGHT
 They shine a lamp into the murky depths and spear pickerel
with a hammered-out fork.
Strange rocks loom up and give way to wide moonlit fields.
They have the sense of entering places where nobody has
been since the making of the world.
 299	EXT. FARMHOUSE
 Four LAWMEN, in pursuit, interrogate some FARMERS. Have
they seen the two people standing by Chuck in his wedding
portrait? Benson holds the bulky frame. There is a funereal 
border of black crepe at the corners.
 300	EXT. ABOARD THE BOAT - DUSK
 They drift idly on the flood. The phonograph is playing
in the stern. Abby is back in trousers. Bill points to
a white house on the shore, an image of comfort and peace.
 BILL
 I used to want a set-up like that. Something like that, I thought,
and you'd really have it made. Now I don't care. I just wish
we could always live this way.
He sees that her mind is somewhere else. He wants to tell
her the truth about Chuck, for intimacy's sake, but it
would just put more of a cloud over everything. It might
even cause her to hate him.
 BILL
 Maybe you want to write him a  letter.
 ABBY
 I hadn't thought of that.
 BILL
 You really do love him, don't you?
She does not reply.
 BILL
 You want to go back?
 ABBY
 (shaking her head)
 Too late for that. I could never face him again.
They look at each other for a moment. He touches her face,
to show that he does not hold it against her. She touches
him back. They only have each other now. They must save
what moments they can.
 BILL
 Guess it's you and me again.
 301	NEW ANGLE
 On a sudden whim, Abby takes off her wedding bracelet
and holds it over the water.
 ABBY
 Watch this.
Bill is caught off guard. Before he can make a move she
throws it far out into the river. They laugh, without
knowing why, at this extravagance.
 302	EXT. SHORE .. TRACKING SHOTS
 They gather May apples and black haws. The music from
the phonograph comes up full.
They dig clams from a sand bar in a playful way. We are
reminded of their first days on the harvest.
 303	XT. UNDERGROWTH
 They make love in the undergrowth.
Abby, afterwards, lies in a naked daze. The damp greens
of the wilderness envelop her.
 304	THEIR POV - ON CITY ON RIVER - NIGHT
 Rounding a bend in the river that night, they come upon
the lights of a great city. They have doused the running
lamp. Except for a faint groaning of the trees along the
shore, the river is silent, conveying the sounds of the
city to them from across a great distance -- bells, joy-
ful voices, horns, the chirping of brakes, etc.
 305	EXT. CITY STREETS AND THEIR POVS - NIGHT
 They sneak down an alley.
There are signs of life behind a few windows, but the
city pursues its gaiety elsewhere.
Suddenly, they come upon a POLICEMAN making his rounds.
They let him pass, then cut through a vacant lot back
to the boat.
 306	EXT. RIVER FRONT - DAY
 The next morning finds them camped in a thicket on the river
front below a factory.
Bill wakes up, mysteriously happy. Their blankets are heavy
with dew. Overhead, finches tilt from branch to branch. A
light wind rushes through the leaves. Whatever his trou-
bles, they seem very small to him in the great. scheme of
things.
He looks at Abby, mouthing silent words in her sleep.
He puts on a white scarf and starts down to the boat. The
slope is strewn with sodden cartons, burnt bricks and burst
mattresses, an avalanche of urban excreta.
 307	HIS POV
 Abruptly he stops. Two POLICE OFFICERS are combing over the
boat. They have not seen him. He edges back. Suddenly, there is yelling on the hill above them. Bill looks up. Benson is calling him to the attention of a car-load of POLICEMEN pulling up beside him. The Officers at the boat now spot him, too, and open fire. Bill darts like
a rabbit into the thicket.
 308	TIGHT ON ABBY
 Abby bolts awake. Bill jumps down beside her, breathless,
and begins looking frantically for the shells to his shotgun.
 ABBY
 What's going on?
 BILL
 Keep down. Can't explain now. They're here.
 ABBY
 Who? What're you talking about?  Stop a minute.
He covers her with his body as bullets zoom through the
undergrowth. His face is close to hers. She bursts into
tears.
 BILL
 Don't get shot. Look for me under that next bridge down. 
After dark.
He empties out the contents of his pockets -- a watch, a
couple of dollars in change, a ring -- and slaps them down
in front of her.
The Police fan out along the ridge above them. He jams a
flare pistol into his belt and kisses her goodbye--after
a moment's hesitation -- on the cheek. She tries in vain
to hold him back.
 BILL
 I wish I could tell you how much
I love you.
 309	EXT. MUD FLAT
 Bill runs from the thicket down to the water. The Police
have bunched on the other side. It seems he might be able
to escape. Keeping low, he splashes across a mud flat.
Suddenly he runs into a trot line that a fisherman has
left out overnight. The hooks bite into his thigh and
shoulder, yanking a string of startled, thrashing catfish
out of the water.
He keeps running in a panic, not realizing the line is
staked to the shore. All at once, he jackknifes in the
air. The stake twangs loose. The Police now spot him 
and begin firing.
 310	TIGHT ON ABBY
 Abby runs out of hiding, thinking at first that the Police
must be looking for her.
 ABBY
 Why're you shooting? You'll kill him! Have you gone crazy? 
Stop! Oh, Bill, not you! Not you!
 311	NEW ANGLE
 Bill stumbles along, trying to rip the hooks from his
flesh, but the fish--fighting their way back to the
water--only drive them in deeper.
Ahead two MOUNTED POLICE surge into the river, blocking
his retreat.
He empties his shotgun at them and throws it away. They
hold up, astonished. He dashes across a sand bar for the
deep of the river and comparative safety. Black mud clings
to his feet, drawing him down like a fly in molasses.
Benson goes running out into the river ahead of the Police.
 BENSON
 Leave him alone. I want him. Leave him alone.
 (firing)
 There you go! There you go!
He shoots Bill down. Bill turns and looks at him in sur-
prise. Benson shoots him again, point blank.
 312	UNDERWATER SHOT
 Bill's blood fades off quickly in the gliding water of the
river. The line of frightened catfish dances out behind
him like a garland.
 313	OTHER ANGLES
 A dog trots off in alarm.
Benson wades into shore, tears streaming down his face,
his chest heaving with emotion.
Abby falls to the ground in a convulsion of grief.
A short way down the river PEOPLE come and go along the
bridge where they were to meet.
 314	ISOLATED ON ROLLER PIANO
 A roller piano sits in a corner by itself, playing a fox-
trot. The camera moves back.
 315	INT. ARBORETUM - ATTIC
 YOUNG DANCERS are learning the foxtrot in the attic of the
Arboretum, a tacky Western version of an Eastern finishing
school. The steps are painted on the floor as white footprints.
Abby is apparently enrolling Ursula here. The headmistress, 
MADAME MURPHY, boasts of the school's achievements. 
Ursula looks trapped. Abby checks her watch.
She must go.
 316	EXT. BRICK STREET
 Abby and Ursula walk down an empty street. Abby wears a
mourning band on her sleeve. She is under the false im-
pression that Ursula likes her new home. An INDIAN PORTER
carts her bags along behind them in a wheelbarrow.
 ABBY
 They'll teach you poise, too, so you can walk in any room you 
please. Pretty soon you'll know all kind of things.
 (pause)
 I never read a whole book till I was fifteen. It was by Caesar.
They laugh at her careful pronunciation of "Caesar."
 317	EXT. TRAIN STATION
 Abby's train is about to leave. The CONDUCTOR walks by
blowing a whistle. A five-piece BAND plays Sousa airs.
They are practically the only civilians on the platform.
The rest are SOLDIERS bound for Europe, where America has
just entered the War, on fire with excitement and a sense
of high adventure.
 URSULA
 I like your hat.
 ABBY
 It doesn't seem like a bird came down and landed on my head?
Abby takes the hat off and gives it to Ursula, who lately
has begun to take more trouble with her appearance, comb-
ing her hair free of its usual snarls. They laugh at their reflection
in a window of the train.
 ABBY
 I hardly ever wear it. Be sure and write every week.
Signals nod. A lamp winks. There are leave-takings up
and down the platform as the train slides away. Abby hops
on board. A SOLDIER next to her sheds bitter tears.
 URSULA
 You write me, too!
They wave goodbye.
 318	EXT. ARBORETUM - NIGHT
 Late that evening Ursula lowers herself out a third-floor
window of the Arboretum with a rope made of bedsheets.
 319	TIGHT ON GIRLS AT WINDOW
 The other GIRLS stand in their nightgowns and wave good-
bye, amazed at her boldness.
She slips off into the night.
 320	EXT. BACKSTAGE DOOR - NIGHT
 Ursula looks in a backstage door. She can see, through
the wings, a MAN dancing on stage. There is a feeling of
mad excitement about the place.
The person she is looking for is not here, however.
 321	EXT. ALLEY - URSULA'S THEME - NIGHT
 She runs down an alley. A man steps out of the shadows--
George, the pilot. She throws herself in his arms. This
is our first sight of him since he left the bonanza.
 URSULA
 You're here! Oh, hug me!
They kiss madly, with mystery. The moonlit, midsummer night thrums
 URSULA
 Aren't we happy? Oh, George, has anybody ever been this happy?
He rocks her back and forth in his arms. They laugh,
thinking what lucky exceptions they are to the world's
misery.
 URSULA
 Hurry.  They'll be looking for me.
 322	EXT. AIRPLANE - DAWN
 George bundles Ursula, giggling, into a biplane.
 URSULA
 This doesn't even belong to you. Suppose they catch us?
 323	EXT. PASTURE -- DAWN
 From a pasture outside town the plane rises into the vast dawn sky.
 324	INT. TEXTILE FACTORY
 Abby changes bobbins on a huge loom. A pall of lint and
anonymous toil hangs over the factory. Down the way a
handsome MALE WORKER smiles at her. She smiles back,
interested.
 ABBY
 It seems an age we've been apart, and truly is for those who
love each other so. Whenever shall we meet?'
 325	TIGHT ON MACHINERY
 The shuttle rockets back and forth. Off camera we hear
Abby reading what seems part of a letter to Ursula.
 ABBY (o.s.)
 Soon, I hope, for by and by we'll all be gone, Urs. Does
it really seem as though we might?'
 326	UNDERWATER SHOT
 We look from the bottom of a river up toward the light. 
In the foreground, dangling from the tip of a submerged
limb, is the bracelet Abby threw away.
 ABBY (o.s.)
 'The other day I tried to think how I'd look laid out in a solemn
white gown. Closing my eyes I could almost hear you tiptoe inlook down in my face, so deep asleep, so still.
 327	EXT. FIELDS - SERIES OF ANGLES
 The PEOPLE of the Razumihin rebuild the land -- raising
fences and sinking a well, plowing down the stubble and
putting in the seed.
 ABBY (o.s.)
 'I went to Lincoln Park Zoo the other day. It was great as usual.
I enclose a check.'
 An ANONYMOUS YOUNG MAN, standing on a carpet 
of new-sprung wheat, looks up with a start. From the 
distance comes a ghostly noise--the call of the prairie 
chickens at their spring rites. He listens for just a moment, 
then returns to work.
 THE END
Dead Poets Society: Final Script




 
INT. WELTON ACADEMY HALLWAY - DAY

A young boy, dressed in a school uniform and cap, fidgets as his mother
adjusts his tie.

				MOTHER
		Now remember, keep your shoulders back.

A student opens up a case and removes a set of bagpipes. The young
boy and his brother line up for a photograph

				PHOTOGRAPHER
		Okay, put your arm around your brother.
		That's it. And breathe in.

The young boy blinks as the flash goes off.

				PHOTOGRAPHR
		Okay, one more.

An old man lights a single candle. A teacher goes over the old
man's duties.

				TEACHER
		Now just to review, you're going to
		follow along the procession until you
		get to the headmaster. At that point
		he will indicate to you to light the
		candles of the boys.

				MAN
		All right boys, let's settle down.

The various boys, including NEIL, KNOX, and CAMERON, line up holding
banners. Ahead of them is the old man, followed by the boy with the
bagpipes with the two youngest boys at the front.

				MAN
		Banners up.

The boys hoist the banners and the bagpipes begin to play loudly. The
small group marches out of the room and down a set of stairs into a
church. The pews are filled with students and parents while the
teachers, all dressed in robes, are seated at the front of the church
behind the headmaster.

The boys break off to either side at the front of the church. The
bagpipes cease and the headmaster, MR. NOLAN, walks over to the old
man carrying the candle.

				MR NOLAN
		Ladies and gentlemen, boys, the light
		of knowledge.

An organ begins to play as the old man goes forward with shaking hands
to the young boys in the front pew. Each boy is holding a candle and
he bends over to light the first one. Each boy in turn lights the
candle of the boy next to him.

				MR NOLAN
		One hundred years ago, in 1859, 41 boys sat in this
		room and were asked the same question that greets
		you at the start of each semester. Gentlemen, what
		are the four pillars?

All throughout the pews, uniformed boys rise to their feet. TODD, who
is not wearing a uniform, is urged by his father to stand with them.

				BOYS
		Tradition, honor, discipline, excellence.

The boys quickly return to their seats.

				MR NOLAN
		In her first year, Welton Academy graduated five
		students. Last year we graduated fifty-one. And
		more than seventy-five percent of those went on to
		the Ivy League. This, this kind of accomplishment is
		the result of fervent dedication to the principles taught
		here. This is why you parents have been sending us
		your sons. This is why we are the best preparatory
		school in the United States.

Mr. Nolan soaks up the applause from the audience.

				MR NOLAN
		As you know, our beloved Mr. Portius of the English
		department retired last term. You will have the
		opportunity later to meet his replacement, Mr. John
		Keating, himself a graduate of this school. And who,
		for the past several years, has been teaching at the
		highly regarded Chester School in London.

The crowd applauds once again.

EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY

The school lawn is a filled with luggage, students, and parents mulling
about in every direction.

INT CHURCH ENTRANCE - DAY

Mr Nolan stands by the entrance, speaking with each family as they leave.

				MR NOLAN
		Glad you could come by.

				MR ANDERSON
		Thrilling ceremony as usual Dr. Nolan.

				MR NOLAN
		You've been away too long.

				MRS ANDERSON
		Hello Dr. Nolan.

				MR NOLAN
		Good to have you back.

				MRS ANDERSON
		This is our youngest, Todd.

				MR NOLAN
		Mr. Anderson.You have some big shoes to fill,
		young man. Your brother was one of our finest.

				TODD
		Thank you.

Todd and his parents leave while others file past Mr. Nolan.

				WOMAN
		Lovely ceremony.

				MR NOLAN
		Thank you. So glad you liked it.

MR PERRY approaches with his son Neil. He shakes Mr. Nolan's hand.

				MR PERRY
		Gale

				MR NOLAN
		Tom

				MR PERRY
		Good to see you again.

				NEIL
		Hello Mr. Nolan.

				MR NOLAN
		Neil. We expect great things from you this year.

				NEIL
		Thank you, sir.

				MR PERRY
		Well he won't disappoint us. Right Neil?

				NEIL
		I'll do my best sir.

EXT SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY

A bell tolls. Parents begin wishing their boys farewell.

				FATHER
		Hey, come on son.

				MOTHER
		Chin up.

				FATHER
		No tears now.

				BOY
		Okay.

				MOTHER
		Chin up.

Another boy hugs his mother.

				BOY
		I don't want to go here.

				MOTHER
		You be a good boy and do your lessons.

EXT SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY

Neil emerges from a building and sees Todd.

				NEIL
		Hey, I hear we're gonna be roommates.

He shakes Todd's hand.

				NEIL
		I'm Neil Perry.

				TODD
		Todd Anderson.

				NEIL
		Why'd you leave Balincrest?

				TODD
		My brother went here.

				NEIL
		Oh, so you're that Anderson.

INT DORMATORY - DAY

DR. HAGER is standing in his room doorway while SPAZ and his father are
going over some last minute precautions over the boy's allergies. Spaz's
father hands Hager various bottles.

				FATHER
		This is for sinuses. Oh, and if he can't swallow you
		give him one of these. And if he had trouble breathing
		you can give him some of those.

				HAGER
		All right fine.

Dr. Hager takes the bottles and quickly backs into his room, shutting
the door.

				FATHER
			    (to son)
		Did you remember your vaporizer?

				SPAZ
		Yes, I put it in my room.

Spaz's father tries to say something else to Dr. Hager but realizes he
has already gone.

INT HALLWAY - DAY

Neil pushes his way through a crowd of boys, carrying two suitcases. As
he enters his room, Knox quickly passes by.

				KNOX
		Hey, how's it going Neil?

				NEIL
		Hey Knox.

Cameron comes by and leans against the doorway.

				CAMERON
		Neil, study group tonight?

				NEIL
		Yeah, sure.

				CAMERON
		Business as usual, huh? Hey, I hear you got the new
		kid. Looks like a stiff!

He begins laughing when he notices Todd coming into the room.

				CAMERON
		Oops!

Cameron quickly leaves. Neil tries to keep from laughing as Todd enters
the room and sets his luggage down on his bed.

				NEIL
		Listen, don't mind Cameron. He was born with his
		foot in his mouth. You know what I mean?

He pulls some papers from his blazer pocket and playfully whacks Todd 
across the back with it.

CHARLIE comes to the door with a smug expression on his face. Knox and
MEEKS are close behind him. He points at Neil

				CHARLIE
		Rumor has it, you did summer school.

				NEIL
		Yep. Chemistry. My father thought I should get ahead.
		How was your summer Slick?

				CHARLIE
		Keen.

The boys enter the room. Charlie turns around and looks at Meeks who is
just entering. 

				CHARLIE
		Meeks. Door. Closed.

				MEEKS
		Yes sir.

				NEIL
		Gentlemen, what are the four pillars?

				BOYS
		Travesty. Horror. Decadence. Excrement.

Charlie makes himself comfortable on Neil's bed and lights up a cigarette.
Meanwhile, Todd is by his bed unpacking his luggage.

				CHARLIE
		Okay, study group. Meeks aced Latin. I didn't quite
		flunk English. So, if you want, we've got our study
		group.

				NEIL
		Sure. Cameron asked me too. Anyone mind
		including him?

				CHARLIE
		Hmm, what's his specialty, boot-licking?

				NEIL
		Come on, he's your roommate.

				CHARLIE
		That's not my fault.

Meeks seems to notice Todd for the first time.

				MEEKS
		Oh, I'm sorry, my name is Steven Meeks.

Neil quickly gets up from his spot by the window.

				NEIL
		Oh, this is Todd Anderson.

Todd turns around and shakes hands with Meeks.

				MEEKS
		Nice to meet you.

				TODD
		Nice to meet you.

				CHARLIE
		Charlie Dalton.

Charlie continues to lay on the bed, looking smug. Knox extends a hand.

				KNOX
		Knox Overstreet.

				NEIL
		Todd's brother was Jeffrey Anderson.

				CHARLIE
		Oh yeah, sure. Valedictorian. National merit scholar. 

				MEEKS
		Oh well, welcome to Hell-ton.

				CHARLIE
		It's every bit as tough as they say, unless you're a
		genius like Meeks.

				MEEKS
		He flatters me. That's why I help him with Latin.

				CHARLIE
		And English, and Trig.

Charlie begins coughing. There is a knock at the door. Charlie quickly
stamps out his cigarette on the floor and Neil tries to wave the smoke
from the air.

				NEIL
		It's open.

The door opens and Mr. Perry walks into the room. Neil quickly rises from
the window.

				NEIL
		Father, I thought you'd gone.

The other boys stand up when he enters.

				BOYS
		Mr. Perry.

				MR PERRY
		Keep your seats fellows, keep your seats. Neil, I've
		just spoken to Mr. Nolan. I think that you're taking
		too many extra curricular activities this semester, and
		I've decided that you should drop the school annual.

				NEIL
		But I'm the assistant editor this year.

				MR PERRY
		Well I'm sorry Neil.

				NEIL
		But Father, I can't. It wouldn't be fair.

				MR PERRY
		Fellas, would you excuse us for a moment?

Mr. Perry walks towards the door and Neil hesitantly follows. Mr. Perry
pauses by the door and smiles to the other boys.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

The smile has gone from Mr. Perry's face. He grabs a hold of Neil's arm.

				MR PERRY
		Don't you ever dispute me in public. Do you
		understand?

				NEIL
		Father, I wasn't disputing-

				MR PERRY
After you've finished medical school and you're on your own, then you
can do as you damn well please. But until then, you do as I tell you.
Is that clear?

				NEIL
		Yes sir. I'm sorry.

				MR PERRY
		You know how much this means to your mother,
		don't you?

				NEIL
		Yes sir. You know me, always taking on too much.

				MR PERRY
		Well, that's my boy. Now listen, you need anything,
		you let us know, huh?

				NEIL
		Yes sir.

Mr. Perry slaps his son on the shoulder and leaves. Neil leans his head
back against the wall as the other boys emerge from the room.

				CHARLIE
		Why doesn't he let you do what you want?

				KNOX
		Yeah Neil, tell him off. It couldn't get any worse.

				NEIL
		Oh, that's rich. Like you guys tell your parents off, Mr.
		Future Lawyer and Mr. Future Banker.

				CHARLIE
		Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.

				NEIL
		Well just don't tell me how to talk to my father. You
		guys are the same way.

				KNOX
		All right, all right, Jesus. So what are you going to do?

				NEIL
		What I have to do. Drop the annual.

				CHARLIE
		Well I wouldn't lose much sleep over it. It's just a
		bunch of jerks trying to impress Nolan.

				NEIL
		I don't care. I don't give a damn about any of it.

				MEEKS
		Well, uh, Latin, eight o' clock in my room?

				NEIL
		Yes.

				MEEKS
		Todd, you're welcome to join us.

				KNOX
		Yeah, come along pal.

Todd looks up from his desk where he is setting his alarm clock.

				TODD
		Thanks.

EXT. FIELDS - DAY

A clock bell chimes five o'clock. Enormous flocks of birds, apparently
disturbed by the noise, take to the sky.

INT. STAIRCASE - DAY

The sound of squawking birds merges into the sound of noisy boys as they
descend the stairs in a long spiralling line.

MR. MCALLISTER tries to make it upstairs against the steady stream.

				MCALLISTER
		Slow down boys, slow down you horrible
		phalanx of pubescense.

INT CHEMISTRY LAB - DAY

A teacher walks up and down the aisles, handing out books.

				TEACHER
		Pick three laboratory experiments from
		the project list and report on them every
		five weeks. The first twenty questions at
		the end of chapter one are due tomorrow.

The students let out a collective groan.

INT. LATIN CLASSROOM - DAY

Mr. McAllister paces back and forth in front of the blackboard and gets
the students to repeat everything he says.

				MCALLISTER
			    (students repeat after each word.)
		Agricolam. Agricola. Agricolae.
		Agricolarum. Agricolis. Agricolas.
		Agrilcolis.

		Again, please.
		Agricola.

INT. MATH CLASSROOM - DAY

Dr. Hager walks up the classroom aisles with his arms behind his back.

				HAGER
		Your study of trigonometry requires absolute precision.
		Anyone failing to turn in any homework assignment will
		be penalized one point off their final grade. Let me urge
		you now not to test me on this point.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Students enter Keating's classroom, talking and acting up. Keating
glances out from his room off to one side.

				KNOX
		Hey Spaz, Spaz.

Spaz turns around in time to be hit by a ball of crumpled up paper
while Cameron smacks him on the shoulder.

				CAMERON
		Brain damage.

The students quickly quiet down as Keating emerges from the other room,
whistling the 1812 Overture. He walks up the length of the classroom and
out the door without a word. The students look around at one another,
uncertain of what to do. Keating pokes his head back in the doorway.

				KEATING
		Well come on.

He gestures them to follow and the students, after some hesitation, grab
their books and follow Keating out into the main entranceway. 

INT. ENTRANCEWAY - DAY

Keating stands before the school's trophy cabinets and waits until all
the boys arrive.

				KEATING
		"Oh Captain, My Captain" who knows where
		that comes from?

Todd looks up as if he knows the answer, but says nothing. Spaz blows his
nose a little too close to Meeks for his liking.

				KEATING
		Not a clue? It's from a poem by Walt
		Whitman about Mr. Abraham Lincoln. Now in
		this class you can call me Mr. Keating. Or,
		if you're slightly more daring, Oh Captain,
		My Captain.

The students laugh slightly.

				KEATING
		Now let me dispel a few rumors so they
		don't fester into facts. Yes, I too
		attended Hell-ton and survived. And no,
		at that time I was not the mental giant
		you see before you. I was the intellectual
		equivalent of a ninety-eight pound
		weakling. I would go to the beach and
		people would kick copies of Byron in my
		face.

The boys laugh once again, while Cameron, obviously trying to write all
this down, looks around confusedly. Keating looks down at papers in his
hand.

				KEATING
		Now, Mr Pitts. That's a rather
		unfortunate name. Mr. Pitts, where are
		you?

Pitts raises his hand while everyone around him snickers.

				KEATING
Mr. Pitts, would you open your hymnal to page 542 and read the first
stanza of the poem you find there?

				PITTS
		"To the virgins, to make much of time"?

				KEATING
		Yes, that's the one. Somewhat appropriate,
		isn't it.

				PITTS
		"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old
		time is still a flying, and this same
		flower that smiles today, tomorrow will
		be dying."

				KEATING
		Thank you Mr. Pitts. "Gather ye rosebuds
		while ye may." The Latin term for that
		sentiment is Carpe Diem. Now who knows
		what that means?

Meeks immediately puts his hand up.

				MEEKS
		Carpe Diem. That's "seize the day."

				KEATING
		Very good, Mr.-

				MEEKS
		Meeks.

				KEATING
		Meeks. Another unusual name. Seize the
		day. Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.
		Why does the writer use these lines?

				CHARLIE
		Because he's in a hurry.

				KEATING
		No, ding!

Keating slams his hand down on an imaginary buzzer.

				KEATING
		Thank you for playing anyway. Because we
		are food for worms lads. Because, believe
		it or not, each and every one of us in
		this room is one day going to stop
		breathing, turn cold, and die. 

Keating turns towards the trophy cases, filled with trophies, footballs,
and team pictures.

				KEATING
		Now I would like you to step forward over
		here and peruse some of the faces from
		the past. You've walked past them many
		times. I don't think you've really looked
		at them.

The students slowly gather round the cases and Keating moves behind them.

				KEATING
		They're not that different from you, are
		they? Same haircuts. Full of hormones,
		just like you. Invincible, just like you
		feel. The world is their oyster. They
		believe they're destined for great things,
		just like many of you. Their eyes are full
		of hope, just like you. Did they wait until
		it was too late to make from their lives
		even one iota of what they were capable?
		Because you see gentlmen, these boys are
		now fertilizing daffodils. But if you listen
		real close, you can hear them whisper their
		legacy to you. Go on, lean in.

The boys lean in and Keating hovers over Cameron's shoulder.

				KEATING
			    (whispering in a gruff voice)
		Carpe.

Cameron looks over his shoulder with an aggravated expression on his face. 

				KEATING
		Hear it?
			    (whispering again)
		Carpe. Carpe Diem. Seize the day boys,
		make your lives extraordinary.

The boys stare at the faces in the cabinet in silence.

EXT. SCHOOL STEPS - DAY

The boys emerge from the school, loaded down with numerous books.

				PITTS
		That was weird.

				NEIL
		But different.

				KNOX
		Spooky if you ask me.

				CAMERON
		Think he'll test us on that stuff?

				CHARLIE
		Come on Cameron, don't you get anything?

				CAMERON
		What? What?

INT. LOCKER ROOM - EVENING

A coach sticks his head around the corner into the room.

				COACH
		Let's go boys, hustle up in here. That
		means you Dalton.

Meeks emerges from the showers, drying himself off.

				MEEKS
		Okay, who's up for a trig study group
		tonight guys?

				PITTS
		Me.

				NEIL
		Me.

				CHARLIE
			(still annoyed by what the coach said)
		What?

				KNOX
		I can't make it guys. I have to have
		dinner at the Danburry's house.

				PITTS
		The Danburry's? Who are the Danburry's?

				CAMERON
		Big alumns. How'd you swing that?

				KNOX
		Friends of my Dad's. They're probably in
		their nineties or something.

				CHARLIE
		Ooh!

				NEIL
		Anything's better than Hell-ton hash.

				CHARLIE
		I'll second that.

				KNOX
		Yeah we'll see.

Neil approaches Todd, who's been sitting by the window staring down at the
floor. Neil snaps his fingers to get Todd's attention. 

				NEIL
		Hey, you coming to the study group tonight?

				TODD
		Uh, no, no I, uh, I've got some history I
		wanna do.

				NEIL
		Suit yourself.

INT. TODD'S ROOM - EVENING

Todd is seated at his desk. He scrawls "CARPE DIEM" across a blank page
of his notebook. He looks at it for a few moments before crumpling it up
and opening up his Chemistry book.

INT. ENTRANCEWAY - NIGHT

Hager comes down the stairs. Knox is looking at one of the old class photos
on the walls.

				HAGER
		Ready Overstreet?

Knox reluctantly follows after Dr. Hager.

				KNOX
		Ready to go sir.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

The car leaves Welton and drives towards the Danburry's house.

INT / EXT DANBURRY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The doorbell rings.

				MRS DANBURRY (O.S.)
		Chet, can you get that?

				CHET (O.S.)
		I can't, Mom.

				CHRIS (O.S.)
		I'll get it.

The door opens and Knox is awe-struck by the beautiful girl (CHRIS) who
has answered the door.

				CHRIS
		Can I help you?

Knox manages to break out of his daze.

				KNOX
		Hi. Knox Overstreet. Uh, Dr. Hager.

				CHRIS
		Hi.

				KNOX
		This is the Danburry's, right?

				CHRIS
		Are you here to see Chet?

				KNOX
		Mrs. Danburry?

Chris begins to laugh as Mrs. Danburry arrives behind her.

				CHRIS
		No.

				MRS DANBURRY
		Sorry. Thank you Chris. I'm Mrs. Danburry.
		You must be Knox.

				KNOX
		Yes.

				MRS DANBURRY
			    (to Dr. Hager)
		Back by nine.
			    (to Knox)
		Please come in.

				CHET (O.S.)
		Chris, come on, what are you doing?

				CHRIS
		Chet, I'm coming.

Knox enters the house, his mind still hung up on Chris as MR DANBURRY
comes out of the living room to meet him.

				MR DANBURRY
		Knox. How are you? Joe Danburry.

				KNOX
		Nice to meet you sir.

				MR DANBURRY
		Well he's the spitting image of his father,
		isn't he. How is he? Come on in.

				CHET (O.S.)
		Chris!

				KNOX
		He's great. He just did a big case for GM.

				CHRIS (O.S.)
		I'm coming.

				MR DANBURRY
		I know where you're headed, like father
		like son, huh?

INT. STUDENT LOUNGE - NIGHT

Several students are throwing darts at a small rubber skeleton hanging
from the bulletin board. Various students are studying and playing games.
Meeks and Pitts are sitting at one table working on their "hi-fi system".
Meeks is waving an antenna around with no luck. Pitts points out to him
that he forgot to plug it in. Neil, Cameron, and Charlie are working on
their trig homework.

				CAMERON
		Just replace these numbers here with "x",
		for "x" and "y".

				NEIL
		Of course.

				CAMERON
		Of course, so what's the problem?

Charlie enters the room and closes the door behind him, leaning up
against it heavily.

				CHARLIE
		How was dinner?

				KNOX
		Huh?

				CHARLIE
		How was dinner?

				KNOX
		Terrible. Awful.

He leaves the door and sits down with the other boys.

				CHARLIE
		Why? What happened?

				KNOX
		Tonight, I met the most beautiful girl
		in my entire life.

				NEIL
		Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?

				KNOX
		She's practically engaged. To Chet Danburry.

				CHARLIE
		That guy could eat a football.

				PITTS
		That's too bad.

				KNOX
		Too bad? It's worse than too bad Pitsie,
		it's a tragedy. A girl this beautiful in
		love with such a jerk.

				PITTS
		All the good ones go for jerks, you
		know that.

				CAMERON
		Ahh, forget her. Open your trig book and
		try and figure out problem five.

				KNOX
		I can't just forget her Cameron. And I
		can't think about trig.

The radio Meeks and Pitts were working on begins letting out a high
pitched hum.

				PITTS
		We got it.

				MEEKS
		Holy cow.

Mr. Hager walks into the room.

				HAGER
		All right gentlemen, five minutes. Let's
		go.

The students quickly pack up their gear and prepare to leave. Pitts tries
to hide the radio in his lap. Charlie leans in close to Knox.

				CHARLIE
		Did you see her naked?

				KNOX
		Very funny Dalton.

				HAGER
		That wouldn't be a radio in your lap,
		would it Mr. Pitts?

				PITTS
		No sir. Science experiment, radar.

Meeks holds up the antenna as if demonstrating it.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Keating sits at his desk at the front of the classroom and opens up one
of his books.

				KEATING
		Gentlemen, open your text to page
		twenty-one of the introduction. Mr.
		Perry, will you read the opening
		paragraph of the preface, entitled
		"Understanding Poetry"?

				NEIL
		Understanding Poetry, by Dr. J. Evans
		Pritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand
		poetry, we must first be fluent with
		its meter, rhyme, and figures of speech.
		Then ask two questions: One, how artfully
		has the objective of the poem been
		rendered, and two, how important is that
		objective. Question one rates the poem's
		perfection, question two rates its
		importance. And once these questions have
		been answered, determining a poem's
		greatest becomes a relatively simple
		matter.

Keating gets up from his desk and prepares to draw on the chalk board.

				NEIL
		If the poem's score for perfection is
		plotted along the horizontal of a graph,
		and its importance is plotted on the
		vertical, then calculating the total
		area of the poem yields the measure of
		its greatness.

Keating draws a corresponding graph on the board and the students
dutifully copy it down.

				NEIL
		A sonnet by Byron may score high on the
		vertical, but only average on the
		horizontal. A Shakespearean sonnet, on
		the other hand, would score high both
		horizontally and vertically, yielding a
		massive total area, thereby revealing the
		poem to be truly great. As you proceed
		through the poetry in this book, practice
		this rating method. As your ability to
		evaluate poems in this matter grows, so
		will - so will your enjoyment and
		understanding of poetry.

Neil sets the book down and takes off his glasses. The student sitting
across from him is discretely trying to eat. Keating turns away from
the chalkboard with a smile.

				KEATING
		Excrement. That's what I think of Mr. J.
		Evans Pritchard. We're not laying pipe,
		we're talking about poetry.

Cameron looks down at the graph he copied into his notes and quickly
scribbles it out.

				KEATING
		I mean, how can you describe poetry like
		American Bandstand? I like Byron, I give
		him a 42, but I can't dance to it.

Charlie suddenly appear to become interested in the class.

				KEATING
		Now I want you to rip out that page.

The students look at Keating as if he has just gone mad.

				KEATING
		Go on, rip out the entire page. You heard
		me, rip it out. Rip it out!

Charlie looks around at the others. He then looks down at his own notes,
which consists of drawing breasts.

				KEATING
		Go on, rip it out.

Charlie rips the page out and holds it up.

				KEATING
		Thank you Mr. Dalton. Gentlemen, tell you
		what, don't just tear out that page, tear
		out the entire introduction. I want it
		gone, history. Leave nothing of it. Rip
		it out. Rip! Begone J. Evans Pritchard,
		Ph.D. Rip, shred, tear. Rip it out. I
		want to hear nothing but ripping of Mr.
		Pritchard.

Meeks looks around reluctantly and then finally begins tearing out pages.

				KEATING
		We'll perforate it, put it on a roll.

Keating sees Cameron still hesitating.

				KEATING
		It's not the bible, you're not going to
		go to hell for this. Go on, make a clean
		tear, I want nothing left of it.

Keating goes over to his room. Cameron turns around to Neil.

				CAMERON
		We shouldn't be doing this.

				NEIL
		Rip, rip, rip!

Neil makes Cameron turn back around.

				KEATING (O.S.)
		Rip it out, rip!

From outside the classroom, Mr. McAllister hears all the noise and sees
all the students ripping out the pages. He bursts into the room.

				MCALLISTER
		What the hell is going on here?

The boys all turn around in shock. Charlie stuffs a crumpled page into his
mouth. Keating emerges from his room with a waste paper basket.

				KEATING
		I don't hear enough rips.

				MCALLISTER
		Mr. Keating.

				KEATING
		Mr. McAllister.

				MCALLISTER
		I'm sorry, I- I didn't know you were
		here.

				KEATING
		I am.

				MCALLISTER
		Ahh, so you are. Excuse me.

Mr. McAllister slowly backs out of the classroom.

				KEATING
		Keep ripping gentlemen. This is a battle,
		a war. And the casualties could be your
		hearts and souls. 

Keating holds out the basket to Charlie who spits out a wad of paper.

				KEATING
		Thank you Mr. Dalton. Armies of academics
		going forward, measuring poetry. No, we
		will not have that here. No more of Mr.
		J. Evans Pritchard. Now in my class you
		will learn to think for yourselves again.
		You will learn to savor words and language.
		No matter what anybody tells you, words and
		ideas can change the world. I see that look
		in Mr. Pitt's eye, like nineteenth century
		literature has nothing to do with going to
		business school or medical school. Right?
		Maybe. Mr. Hopkins, you may agree with him, 
		thinking "Yes, we should simply study our
		Mr. Pritchard and learn our rhyme and meter
		and go quietly about the business of
		achieving other ambitions." I have a little
		secret for ya. Huddle up. Huddle up! 

The boys get up from their seats and gather around Keating in the center
of the class.

				KEATING
		We don't read and write poetry because
		it's cute. We read and write poetry
		because we are members of the human race.
		And the human race is filled with passion.
		Medicine, law, business, engineering,
		these are all noble pursuits, and necessary
		to sustain life. But poetry, beauty,
		romance, love, these are what we stay alive
		for. To quote from Whitman: "O me, o life
		of the questions of these recurring, of the
		endless trains of the faithless, of cities
		filled with the foolish. What good amid
		these, o me, o life? Answer: that you are
		here. That life exists, and identity.
		That the powerful play goes on, and you
		may contribute a verse. That the powerful
		play goes on and you may contribute a verse.

Keating looks up at Todd.

				Keating
		What will your verse be?

INT. HEAD OF CAFETERIA - DAY

The cafeteria is filled with students and teachers standing before the tables saying grace.

				ALL
		For what we are about to receive, may the
		Lord make us truly grateful. Amen.

Mr. Keating and Mr. McAllister are seated next to one another at the table.

				MCALLISTER
		Quite an interesting class you gave today,
		Mr. Keating.

				KEATING
		I'm sorry if I shocked you, Mr. McAllister.

				MCALLISTER
		Oh, there's no need to apologize. It was
		very fascinating, misguided though it was.

				KEATING
		You think so?

				MCALLISTER
		You take a big risk by encouraging them to
		be artists John. When they realize they're
		not Rembrandts, Shakespeares or Mozarts,
		they'll hate you for it.

				KEATING
		We're not talking artists George, we're
		talking free thinkers.

				MCALLISTER
		Free thinkers at seventeen?

				KEATING
		Funny, I never pegged you as a cynic.

				MCALLISTER
			  (taken aback by the comment)
		Not a cynic, a realist. Show me the heart
		unfettered by foolish dreams, and I'll
		show you a happy man.

				KEATING
		But only in their dreams can man be truly
		free. 'Twas always thus, and always thus
		will be.

				MCALLISTER
		Tennyson?

				KEATING
		No, Keating.

Keating winks and Mr. McAllister can't help but laugh.

INT. CAFETERIA TABLE - DAY

Neil joins the others at the table. He pulls out a yearbook.

				NEIL
		Hey, I found his senior annual in the
		library.

He hands the annual over to Cameron who laughs at the younger picture of Keating.

				NEIL
		Listen to this, captain of the soccer team,
		editor of the school annual, Cambridge
		bound, Thigh man, and the Dead Poets Society.

				CAMERON
			    (reading from the annual)
		Man most likely to do anything.

				CHARLIE
		Thigh man. Mr. K was a hell-raiser.

				KNOX
		What's the Dead Poets Society?

				NEIL
		I don't know.

				MEEKS
		Is there a picture in the annual?

				NEIL
		Nothing. No other mention of it.

				MR. NOLAN (O.S.)
		That boy there, see me after lunch.

Cameron quickly puts the annual away and the others all return to their meal.

EXT. WELTON GROUNDS - DAY

Keating is walking down towards the lake, whistling the same tune as before.
The boys emerge from the building and chase after him.

				NEIL
		Mr. Keating? Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain,
		My Captain?

Keating immediately turns around.

				KEATING
		Gentlemen.

				NEIL
		We were just looking in your old annual.

He hands Keating the annual and Keating looks at his old photograph.

				KEATING
		Oh my God. No, that's not me. Stanley
		"The Tool" Wilson-

Keating crouches down and continues looking through the book.

				KEATING
		God.

Neil crouches down next to Keating.

				NEIL
		What was the Dead Poets Society?

				KEATING
		I doubt the present administration would
		look too favorably upon that.

				NEIL
		Why? What was it?

				KEATING
		Gentlemen, can you keep a secret?

				NEIL
		Sure.

The other boys crouch down around Keating.

				KEATING
		The Dead Poets were dedicated to sucking
		the marrow out of life. That's a phrase
		from Thoreau that we'd invoke at the
		beginning of each meeting. You see we'd
		gather at the old Indian cave and take
		turns reading from Thoreau, Whitman,
		Shelley; the biggies. Even some of our
		own verse. And in the enchantment of the
		moment we'd let poetry work its magic.

				KNOX
		You mean it was a bunch of guys sitting
		around reading poetry?

				KEATING
		No Mr. Overstreet, it wasn't just "guys",
		we weren't a Greek organization, we were
		romantics. We didn't just read poetry,
		we let it drip from our tongues like honey.
		Spirits soared, women swooned, and gods
		were created, gentlemen, not a bad way to
		spend an evening eh? Thank you Mr. Perry
		for this trip down amnesia lane. Burn that,
		especially my picture.

Keating hands the annual back and walks away, whistling once again. Neil
remains crouched.

				NEIL
		Dead Poets Society.

				CAMERON
		What?

The school bells begin ringing and everyone heads back towards the school.
Neil stands up.

				NEIL
		I say we go tonight.

				CHARLIE
		Tonight?

				CAMERON
		Wait a minute.

				PITTS
		Where's this cave he's talking about?

				NEIL
		It's beyond the stream. I know where it
		is.

				PITTS
		That's miles.

				CAMERON
		Sounds boring to me.

				CHARLIE
		Don't go.

				CAMERON
		You know how many de-merits we're talking
		Dalton

				CHARLIE
		So don't come, please.

				CAMERON
		Look, all I'm saying is that we have to
		be careful, we can't get caught.

				CHARLIE
		No shit, Sherlock.

				HAGER
				(yelling)
		You boys there, hurry up.

Neil turns around and faces the other boys.

				NEIL
		All right, who's in?

				CAMERON
		Come on Neil, Hager's right-

				NEIL
		Forget Hager, no. Who's in?

				CHARLIE
		I'm in.

				HAGER (O.S.)
		I'm warning you, move.

				CAMERON
		Me too.

				PITTS
		I don't know Neil

				NEIL
		What? Pitts-

				CHARLIE
		Pitsie, come on.

				MEEKS
		His grades are hurting Charlie.

				NEIL
		You can help him Meeks.

				PITTS
		What is this, a midnight study group?

				NEIL
		Forget it Pitts, you're coming. Meeks,
		are your grades hurting too?

				MEEKS
		I'll try anything once.

				CHARLIE
		Except sex.

				MEEKS
		Ha ha ha.

				CAMERON
		I mean as long as we're careful.

The boys run into the building.

				CHARLIE
		What about you Knox?

				KNOX
		I don't know Charlie.

				CHARLIE
		Come on Knox, it'll help you get Chris.

				KNOX
		Yeah? How?

				CHARLIE
		Women swoon.

Charlie laughs and runs inside. Knox chases after him.

				KNOX
		But why do they swoon? Charlie, tell me
		why they swoon. Charlie!

INT LIBRARY - DAY

The boys are all gathered around one of the tables with a map laid out
on it.

				NEIL
			    (whispering)
		Okay, follow the stream to the waterfall.
		It's right there. It's got to be on the
		banks.

				CAMERON
		I don't know, it's starting to sound
		dangerous.

				CHARLIE
		Well, why don't you stay home?

				MCALLISTER
		For God's sake stop chattering and
		sit down.

The boys take their seats once again and Neil goes over and sits next to
Todd, who is sitting by himself.

				NEIL
		Todd, are you coming tonight?

				TODD
		No.

				NEIL
		Why not? God, you were there. You heard
		Keating. Don't you want to do something
		about it?

				TODD
		Yes, but-

				NEIL
		But? But what?

				TODD
		Keating said that everybody took turns
		reading and I don't want to do that.

				NEIL
		Gosh, you really have a problem with
		that, don't you?

				TODD
		N- no, I don't have a problem. Neil,
		I just- I just don't want to do it,
		okay?

				NEIL
		All right. What if you didn't have to
		read? What if you just came and
		listened?

				TODD
		That's not how it works.

				NEIL
		Forget how it works. What if - what if
		they said it was okay?

				TODD
		What? What are you gonna do, go up and
		ask them?

Neil shrugs.

				TODD
		No. No, Neil.

				NEIL
		I'll be right back.

				TODD
		Neil, Neil!

Neil gets up and rejoins the others. McAllister hears the boys whispering
again.

				MCALLISTER
		Oh shut up, will you.

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Various boys are crowded around the sinks getting ready for bed. Someone
is playing snake charmer music on a kazoo while someone else is bothering
Spaz with a red sock puppet acting like a snake.

				SPAZ
		That's my- that's for my asthma, okay.
		Could you give that back please? Could
		you give that back?

				BOY
		What's the matter? Don't you like snakes?

Neil enters and taps Todd on the shoulder.

				NEIL
		You're in.

				SPAZ
		Get away from me, okay?

				BOY
		Spaz, why don't you check your pocket,
		huh? Come on Spaz I have to brush my
		teeth

				SPAZ
		Get a- get off, 

Hager walks past the bathroom and into his room.

				HAGER
		Cut out that racket in there.

The kazoo player lets out a rude squeek before finally stopping. Hager
glares at them for a moment.

INT NEIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Neil stands in his doorway. He looks across the hall to the other room
where Cameron and Charlie are standing. Cameron gives a thumbs up. Neil
closes his room door and takes out his cloak and a flashlight. Setting
the flashlight down on the desk, he notices a worn book, "Five
Centuries of Verse", sitting there. Opening it up, he sees John Keating's
name at the top followed by "Dead Poets". Below the title of the book,
is written: "To Be Read At The Opening of D.P.S. Meetings." Along with
several lines from Thoreau, beginning with "I went to the woods because
I wanted to live deliberately"

INT STAIRWAY - NIGHT

The shadows of hooded figures can be seen moving throughout the darkened
halls.

INT HAGER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Hager hears a dog barking.

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Someone drops a number of dog biscuits by the dog's feet. He stops
barking and immediately begins gobbling them down. Hager looks out
into the hallway with his flashlight but sees nothing.

EXT SCHOOL GROUNDS - NIGHT

The boys quietly leave the building and set off running across the
fields towards the woods.

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

The boys search about the trees trying to find the cave. Meeks is
searching around when Charlie leaps up behind Meeks in the dark
shining the flashlight up at his own face and grabs Meeks by the
shoulder.

				CHARLIE
		Arrr, I'm a dead poet.

				MEEKS
		Aww, Charlie.

				CHARLIE
			    (laughing)
		Guys, over here.

				MEEKS
		You're funny. You're real funny.

INT CAVE - NIGHT

The boys are trying to start a fire. The cave is quickly filling up with
smoke.

				MEEKS
		It's too wet.

CHARLIE
		God, are you trying to smoke us out of
		here?

				MEEKS
		No, no, the smoke's going right up this
		opening.

Pitts tries to stand up and slams his head into the low rock ceiling. He
lets out a yell while the others laugh.

				NEIL
		You okay?

				PITTS
		Oh God. Clowns.

				NEIL
		All right, all right, forget the fire.
		Let's go gentlemen.

Neil stands before the others with the book in hand, and takes a drag
on a cigarette.

				NEIL
		I hereby reconvene the Dead Poets
		Society.

The boys cheer.

				NEIL
		Welton chapter. The meetings will be
		conducted by myself and the other new
		initiates now present. Todd Anderson,
		because he prefers not to read, will
		keep minutes of the meetings. I'll now
		read the traditional opening message by
		society member Henry David Thoreau. "I
		went to the woods because I wanted to
		live deliberately. I wanted to live deep
		and suck out all the marrow of life."

				CHARLIE
		I'll second that.

				NEIL
		"To put to rout all that was not life,
		and not, when I had come to die,
		discover that I had not lived.

Several boys whistle softly in reaction to the poem.

				NEIL
		And Keating's marked a bunch of other
		pages.

Neil begins flipping through the book.

				CHARLIE
		All right, intermission. Dig deep right
		here. Right here, lay it down

				CAMERON
		On the mud? We're gonna put our food on
		the mud?

				CHARLIE
		Meeks, put your coat down. Picnic blanket.

				MEEKS
		Yes sir, use Meeks' coat.

				CHARLIE
		Don't keep anything back either. You
		guys are always bumming my smokes.

Meeks lays his coat down and everyone dumps their food on it. Amongst
the pile are chocolate chip cookies, a box of raisins, a few apples, an
orange, and half a roll.

				NEIL
		Raisins?

				KNOX
		Yuck.

				CHARLIE
		Wait a minute, who gave us half a roll?

				PITTS
			  (talking with his mouth full)
		I'm eating the other half.

				CHARLIE
		Come on.

				PITTS
		You want me to put it back?

INT CAVE - NIGHT

Neil, lit up by a flashlight, begins to tell everyone a story.

				NEIL
		It was a dark and rainy night, and this
		old lady, who had a passion for jigsaw
		puzzles, sat by herself in her house at
		her table to complete a new jigsaw puzzle.
		But as she pieced the puzzle together, she
		realized, to her astonishment, that the
		image that was formed was her very own
		room. And the figure in the center of the
		puzzle, as she completed it, was herself.
		And with trembling hands, she placed the
		last four pieces and stared in horror at
		the face of a demented madman at the
		window. The last thing that this old lady
		ever heard was the sound of breaking glass.

				BOYS
		Ohhh no

				NEIL
		This is true, this is true.

				CAMERON
		I've got one that's even better than
		that.

				CHARLIE
		Ha!

				CAMERON
		I do. There's a young, married couple,
		and they're driving through the forest
		at night on a long trip. And they run
		out of gas, and there's a madman on the-

				CHARLIE
		The thing with the hand-

All the boys react, recalling the story and miming the scraping on the
roof of the car.

				CAMERON
		I love that story.

				CHARLIE
		I told you that one.

				CAMERON
		You did not. I got that in camp in
		sixth grade.

				CHARLIE
		When were you in six, last year?

As everyone's voices begin to calm down, Pitts begins reading from the
book.

				PITTS
		"In a mean abode in the shanking road,
		lived a man named William Bloat. Now,
		he had a wife, the plague of his life,
		who continually got his goat. And one
		day at dawn, with her nightshift on,
		he slit her bloody throat."

The boys laugh.

				PITTS
		Oh, and it gets worse.

				CHARLIE
		You want to hear a real poem?

Meeks hands Charlie the book but he shoves it away.

				CHARLIE
		All right? No, I don't need it. You take 
		it. 

				MEEKS
		What, did you bring one? 

				NEIL
		You memorized a poem? 

				CHARLIE
		I didn't memorize a poem. Move up.

Neil moves to the side as Charlie stands and takes his spot.

				MEEKS
		An original piece by Charlie Dalton. 

				KNOX
		An original piece. 

				PITTS
		Take center stage. 

				NEIL
		You know this is history. Right? This is 
		history.

Charlie clears his throat and pulls out a page from a magazine and 
slowly unfolds it, revealing a Playboy centerfold (Elaine Reynolds,
Miss October, 1959)

				MEEKS
		Oh, wow. 

				CAMERON
		Where did you get that? 

				CHARLIE

		Teach me to love? Go teach thyself more 
		wit.
		I, chief professor, am of it.

Neil gets up and looks over Charlie's shoulder to see what he is
reading.

				CHARLIE
		The god of love, if such a thing there 
		be, may learn to love from me.

Charlie winks at the guys and they clap and cheer.

				NEIL
		Wow! Did you write that?

Charlie turns over the centerfold to show where he had written down
the poem.

				CHARLIE
		Abraham Cowley. Okay, who's next? 

Neil sits reading from the book by flashlight.

				NEIL
		Alfred Lord Tennyson. 
		Come my friends, 
		'Tis not too late to seek a newer world 
		for my purpose holds to sail beyond the 
		sunset. 
		And though we are not now that strength 
		which in old days 
		Moved earth and heaven; that which we 
		are, we are;-- 
		One equal temper of heroic hearts, 
		Made weak by time and fate, but strong 
		in will. 
		To strive, to seek, to find, and not to 
		yield. 

Meeks takes center stage and begins reading a poem like he is 
performing a chant.

				MEEKS
		Then I had religion, then I had a 
		vision. 
		I could not turn from their revel in 
		derision. 
		Then I saw the Congo creeping through 
		the black, 
		cutting through the forest with a golden 
		track. 
		Then I saw the Congo creeping through 
		the black- 

				CHARLIE
		Meeks, Meeks. 

				MEEKS

		...cutting through the forest with a 
		golden track.
		Then I saw the Congo creeping through 
		the black, 
		cutting through the forest with a golden 
		track.

Knox picks up a metal container and begins using it as a drum. The
other boys stand and begin going in a circle, making music with
sticks of wood, combs, etc.

		Then I saw the Congo creeping through 
		the black, 
		cutting through the forest with a golden 
		track. 
		Then I saw the Congo creeping through 
		the black, 
		cutting through the forest with a golden 
		track. 

				BOYS

		Then I saw the Congo creeping through 
		the black, 
		cutting through the forest with...

The boys continue to chant the chorus as they emerge from the
cave.

EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT
The clock tolls two as the boys silently run back to their dorm.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Keating is walking to the front of the classroom filled with students.

				KEATING
		A man is not very tire, he is exhausted.
		And don't use very sad, use-

He points to the back of the classroom.

				KEATING
		Come on, Mr. Overstreet, you twerp, 
				KNOX
		Morose? 

				KEATING
		Exactly! Morose. Now, language was 
		developed for one endeavor, and that is? 
		Mr. Anderson? Come on! Are you a man or 
		an amoeba?

Keating stands before Todd's desk. Todd looks up nervously but
says nothing. Keating paused for a moment before looking away.

				KEATING
		Mr. Perry? 

				NEIL
		Uh, to communicate. 

				KEATING
		No! To woo women. Today we're going to 
		be talking about William Shakespeare. 

The class lets out a collective sigh.
				BOY
		Oh, God! 

				KEATING
		I know. A lot of you looked forward to 
		this about as much as you look forward 
		to root canal work. We're gonna talk 
		about Shakespeare as someone who writes 
		something very interesting. Now, many of 
		you have seen Shakespeare done very much 
		like this:

Keating holds out his right arm dramtically and begins to
speak in an exaggerated British accent.

		"O Titus, bring your friend hither." But
		if any of you have seen Mr. Marlon Brando,
		you know, Shakespeare can be different. 
		"Friend, Romans, countrymen, lend me your
		ears." You can also imagine, maybe, John
		Wayne as Macbeth going, "Well, is this a 
		dagger I see before me?"

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

The students are all seated together near the front of the room as
Keating reads from a book.

				KEATING
		"Dogs, sir? Oh, not just now. I do enjoy 
		a good dog once in a while, sir. You can 
		have yourself a three-course meal from 
		one dog. Start with your canine 
		crudites, go to your Fido flambe for 
		main course and for dessert, a Pekingese 
		parfait. And you can pick your teeth 
		with a little paw."

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

The students are all back in their normal seats and Keating leaps
up onto his desk.

				KEATING
		Why do I stand up here? Anybody? 

				CHARLIE
		To feel taller. 

				KEATING
		No!
Keating rings the bell on his desk with his foot

				KEATING
		Thank you for playing, Mr. Dalton. I 
		stand upon my desk to remind yourself 
		that we must constantly look at things 
		in a different way. 

Keating glances around the classroom from atop the desk.

				KEATING
		You see, the world looks very different 
		from up here. You don't believe me? Come 
		see for yourself. Come on. Come on! 

Charlie and Neil quickly rise from their seats to go to the front
of the classroom. The rest of the class follows them. While Keating
continues speaking, Neil and Charlie join him on the desk and then
Keating jumps down.


				KEATING
		Just when you think you know something, 
		you have to look at it in another way. 
		Even though it may seem silly or wrong, 
		you must try! Now, when you read, don't 
		just consider what the author thinks. 
		Consider what you think. 

				KEATING
		Boys, you must strive to find your own 
		voice. Because the longer you wait to 
		begin, the less likely you are to find 
		it at all. Thoreau said, "Most men lead 
		lives of quiet desperation." Don't be 
		resigned to that. Break out!

Keating notices Spaz and another boy leaving the desk immediately.

				KEATING
		Don't just walk off the edge like lemmings.
		Look around you. 

The school bell rings as the boys continue to climb onto the desk.
Keating begins to gather up his stuff. The clock begins to toll as
Keating walks to the back of the class.

				KEATING
		There! There you go, Mr. Priske. Thank 
		you! Yes! Dare to strike out and find 
		new ground. Now, in addition to your 
		essays, I would like you to compose a 
		poem of your own, an original work.

The students begin to groan. Keating begins flickering the lights
off and on while chanting ominously.

				KEATING
		That's right! You have to deliver it 
		aloud in front of the class on Monday. 
		Bonne chance, gentlemen. 

Keating steps out into the hall before quickly peeking back in once again.
Todd is the last one to stand on the desk and is about to jump off.

				KEATING
		Mr. Anderson? Don't think that I don't 
		know that this assignment scares the 
		hell out of you, you mole.

Keating flicks the light off, leaving Todd to jump down in the darkness
as the students laugh.

EXT. RIVER - DAY

Cameron, Charlie, and several other boys are rowing while Mr. Nolan
shouts orders from a bullhorn.

				MR. NOLAN
		Take a power train in two! Three! Keep 
		your eyes in the boat!

EXT. CAMPUS ROOFTOP - DAY

Noisy static is replaced by music as Pitts climbs down form the peak to
join Meeks at their makeshift radio.

				MEEKS
		We got it, Pittsie. We got it! Radio 
		Free America! 


EXT CAMPUS - DAY

Several students are fencing on a grassy slope.

EXT. CAMPUS ROOFTOP - DAY

Meeks and Pitts perform a goofy dance together to the music.

INT. TODD'S ROOM - DAY

Todd is on his bed trying to write a poem. The door opens and Todd
turns his writing pad over. Neil enters the room laughing. He crouches
down next to Todd's bed and plunks a sheet of paper in Todd's lap.


				NEIL
		I found it. 

				TODD
		You found what? 

				NEIL
		What I wanna do right now. What's 
		really, really inside me. 

				TODD
		"A Midsummer Night's Dream"? 

				NEIL
		This is it. 

				TODD
		What is this? 

				NEIL
		It's a play, dummy. 

				TODD
		I know that. I-- Wh-Wh-What does it have 
		to do with you? 

				NEIL
		Right. They're putting it on at Henley 
		Hall. Open tryouts. Open tryouts! 

				TODD
		Yes, so?

Neil pounds on the bed and then pulls a blanket off his bed,
wearing it like a cloak.

				NEIL
		So, I'm gonna act. Yes, yes! I'm gonna 
		be an actor! Ever since I can remember, 
		I've wanted to try this. I even tried to 
		go to summer stock auditions last year, 
		but, of course, my father wouldn't let 
		me. For the first time in my whole life 
		I know what I wanna do.

Neil grabs a handful of papers off Todd's bed and tosses them into
the air.

				NEIL
		and for the first time I'm gonna do it 
		whether my father wants me to or not!
		Carpe diem! 

				TODD
		Neil, Neil, hold on a minute. How are 
		you gonna be in a play if your father 
		won't let you? 

				NEIL
		First I gotta get the part, then I can 
		worry about that. 

				TODD
		Yeah, but won't he kill you if he finds 
		out you went to an audition and didn't 
		even tell him? 

				NEIL
		No, no, no, no. As far as I'm concerned, 
		he won't have to know about any of this. 

				TODD
		Well, that's impossible. 

				NEIL
		Bullshit! Nothing's impossible. 

				TODD
		Well, why don't you just call him and 
		ask him? And m-maybe he'll say yes. 

				NEIL
		That's a laugh!

Neil tosses the blanket back onto his bed.

				NEIL
		If I don't ask him, at least I won't
		be disobeying him. 

				TODD
		Yeah, but if he said-- 

				NEIL
			   (shouting angrily)
		Jesus, Todd! Whose side are you on?

Todd says nothing. Neil looks at him for a moment and then takes
the flyer back from Todd. He walks over to the window, his 
excitement gone.

				NEIL
		I mean, I haven't even gotten the part 
		yet. Can't I even enjoy the idea for a 
		little while? 

Once again, Todd says nothing. After a moment, Neil sits on the
heater and Todd returns to his poem.

				NEIL
		You're coming to the meeting this 
		afternoon? 

				TODD
		I don't know. Maybe.

				NEIL
		Nothing Mr. Keating has to say means 
		shit to you, does it, Todd? 

				TODD
		W-What is that supposed to mean? 

				NEIL
		You're in the club! Being in the club 
		means being stirred up by things. You 
		look about as stirred up as a cesspool. 

Neil gets up from the window and stands over Todd.

				TODD
		So- You want me out? 

				NEIL
		No! I want you in, but being in means 
		you gotta do something. Not just say 
		you're in. 

				TODD
		Well, listen, Neil. I-I appreciate this 
		concern, but I-I'm not like you. All 
		right? You, you, you say thing and 
		people listen. I'm, I'm not like that. 

				NEIL
		Don't you think you could be? 

				TODD
		No! I--I, I don't know, but that's not 
		the point. The, the, the point is that 
		there's nothing you can do about it, so 
		you can just butt out. I can take care 
		of myself just fine. All right? 

				NEIL
		No. 

				TODD
		What do you mean, "no"? 

A smile comes to Neil's face.

				NEIL
		No. 

Neil grabs Todd's notebook of poetry and runs across the room with 
it. Todd leaps up after him.

				TODD
		Give me-- Neil. Neil, give that back. 

The two begin racing in circles around the room, jumping from
bed to bed as Todd tries to grab his poem back.

				NEIL
		"We are dreaming of a--" Poetry! I'm 
		being chased by Walt Whitman! Okay, 
		okay.

Neil drops the notebook. Cameron walks into the room.

				CAMERON
		What are you guys doing? I'm sure-- You 
		see this chemistry-

Cameron tries to hold up his book and Neil snatches it from his hands and
suddenly all three of them are racing around the room.

				CAMERON
		Hey, give me-- Neil, give me-- Don't be
		immature. Come on. I need my- 

Charlie enters the room and begins waving his hands.

				CHARLIE
		Give it to me! Give it to me! 

				NEIL
		Charlie!

Neil tosses Cameron's book to Charlie.

				CAMERON
		Let me have my book, I need my- 

The four boys continue racing around the cramped quarters, tossing
Cameron's book back and forth. Neil picks up a recorder and begins
blowing erratic notes on it while Charlie starts pounding on a set of
bongo drums. Outside the room a crowd of boys watch.

EXT. CAMPUS ENTRANCE - DAY

Knox is riding his bike around in circles near the entrance. Seeing no
one nearby, he races through the open gates and down the road. He comes
to the top of a hill and then goes downhill across the grass, shouting
as he sends an immense flock of geese flying into the air.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

A number of vehicles drive up, filled with students dressed in bright red
cosyumes, playing trumpets and various other instruments as they pass.
Knox watches the growing crowd of students. They are all converging on
a bus. A football player, wearing a horned helmet, dances on the roof of
the bus. A band is playing while a group of cheerleaders are practising.
Knox spots Chris amongst the cheerleaders. He watches her until Chet
comes along and she grabs hold of his hand. Knox looks away in disgust.

				COACH
		Okay, everybody on the bus. Let's go, 
		boys. Come on, let's go. On the bus, 
		boys. Now!

Chris jumps into Chet's arms as everyone begins to board the buses. Knox
turns his bike around and leaves.

EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY

Keating walks across the field, followed by his students. He kicks a ball
ahead of him while he carries a number of other balls in a net slung over
his shoulder.

				KEATING
		Now, devotees may argue that one sport 
		or game is inherently better than 
		another. For me, sport is actually a 
		chance for us to have other human beings 
		push us to excel. I want you all to come 
		over here and take a slip of paper and 
		line up single file.

Keating reaches the stands. He tosses the balls aside and pulls sets
his briefcase down. As the boys line up he begins ripping off slips
of paper from a notepad and handing them out.

				KEATING
		Mr. Meeks, time to inherit the earth. 
		Mr. Pitts, rise above your name.

He hands the notepad to another student.

				KEATING
		I want you to hand these out to the boys,
		one apiece.

EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY

The students are all lined up in single file, each holding a slip
of paper. Keating blows his whistle.

				KEATING
		You know what to do, Pitts. 

				PITTS
		"Oh to struggle against great odds. To 
		meet enemies undaunted." 

				KEATING
		Sounds to me like you're daunted. Say it 
		again like you're undaunted. 

				PITTS
		"Oh to struggle against great odds. To 
		meet enemies undaunted." 

				KEATING
		Now go on.

Pitts gives one of the soccer balls a good kick.

				KEATING
		Yes! Next.

One of the students sets up the next ball as the line advances.

				BOY 1
		"To be a sailor of the world, bound for 
		all ports." 

				KEATING
		Next. Louder! 

				BOY 2
		"Oh, I live to be the ruler of life, not 
		a slave." 

Keating walks away and starts up a record player.

				BOY 3
		"To mount the scaffolds. To advance to 
		the muzzle of guns with perfect 
		nonchalance."

Classical music begins playing on the phonograph. Meeks goes to
read next but is confused by the music.

				KEATING
		Come on, Meeks! Listen to the music. 

				MEEKS
		"To dance, clap hands, exalt, shout, 
		skip, roll on, float on." 

				KEATING
		Yes! 

				HOPKINS
				(without energy)
		"Oh, to have life henceforth the poem of 
		new joys." 

Hopkins crumples up his paper and then barely taps the soccer
ball with his foot.

Keating puts a look of disgust on his face.

				KEATING
		Oh! Boo! Come on, Charlie, let it fill 
		your soul! 

Charlie raises his hands over his head.

				CHARLIE
		"To indeed be a god!" 

INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY

Neil is racing down the hallway, all excited.

				NEIL
		Charlie, I got the part! I'm gonna play 
		Puck! I'm gonna play Puck!

He pounds on Charlie's door.

				MEEKS
		What did he say? 

				PITTS
		Puck? 

				NEIL
		That's the main part. 

				KNOX
		Great, Neil. 

				NEIL
		Charlie, I got it! 

				CHARLIE
		Congratulations. Good for you, Neil. 
		Good for you. 

Neil enters his room with Todd and sits down at his typewriter.

				NEIL
		Okay, okay, okay, okay. 

				TODD
		Neil, how are you gonna do this? 

				NEIL
		They need a letter of permission from my 
		father and Mr. Nolan. 

				TODD
		You're not gonna write it. 

				NEIL
		Oh yes, I am. 

				TODD
		Oh, Neil. Neil, you're crazy. 

 Neil begins typing.

				    NEIL
		Okay. "I am writing to you on behalf of 
		my son Neil Perry."

Neil begins laughing and stomping his feet up and down.

				    NEIL
		This is great.

EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT

A lone bagpiper plays out on the dock.

INT. TODD'S ROOM - NIGHT

Todd is pacing circles about his room as he reads his poem. His
pacing slows and then he tears the poem up.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Knox stands at the front of the room with his poem in hand.

				KNOX
				(quietly)
		"To Chris."

Charlie looks up from his desk with a grin.

				BOY 1
		Who's Chris? 

				BOY 2
		Mmm, Chris. 

				KNOX
		I see a sweetness in her smile. 
		Blight light shines from her eyes. 
		But life is complete; contentment is 
		mine, 
		Just knowing that...

Several students begin to snicker.

				KNOX
		just knowing that she's alive.

Knox crumples his poem and walks back to his desk.

				KNOX
		Sorry, Captain. It's stupid. 

				KEATING
		No, no. It's not stupid. It's a good 
		effort. It touched on one of the major 
		themes, love. A major theme not only in 
		poetry, but life. Mr. Hopkins, you were 
		laughing. You're up.

Hopkins slowly walks to the front of the class and unfolds
his piece of paper.

				HOPKINS
		"The cat sat on the mat." 

				KEATING
		Congratulations, Mr. Hopkins. Yours is 
		the first poem to ever have a negative 
		score on the Pritchard scale. We're not 
		laughing at you, we're laughing near 
		you. I don't mind that your poem had a 
		simple theme. Sometimes the most 
		beautiful poetry can be about simple 
		things, like a cat, or a flower or rain. 
		You see, poetry can come from anything 
		with the stuff of revelation in it. Just 
		don't let your poems be ordinary. Now, 
		who's next? 

Keating approaches Todd's desk.

				KEATING
		Mr. Anderson, I see you sitting there in 
		agony. Come on, Todd, step up. Let's put 
		you out of your misery. 

				TODD
		I, I didn't do it. I didn't write a 
		poem. 

				KEATING
		Mr. Anderson thinks that everything 
		inside of him is worthless and 
		embarrassing. Isn't that right, Todd? 
		Isn't that your worst fear? Well, I 
		think you're wrong. I think you have 
		something inside of you that is worth a 
		great deal.

Keating walks up to the blackboard and begins to write.

				KEATING
		"I sound my barbaric yawp over the 
		rooftops of the world." W. W. Uncle Walt 
		again. Now, for those of you who don't 
		know, a yawp is a loud cry or yell. Now, 
		Todd, I would like you to give us a 
		demonstration of a barbaric "yawp." Come 
		on. You can't yawp sitting down. Let's 
		go. Come on. Up.

Todd reluctantly stands and follows Keating to the front.

				KEATING
		You gotta get in "yawping" stance. 

				TODD
		A yawp?

				KEATING
		No, not just a yawp. A barbaric yawp. 

				TODD
				(quietly)
		Yawp. 

				KEATING
		Come on, louder. 

				TODD
				(quietly)
		Yawp. 

				KEATING
		No, that's a mouse. Come on. Louder. 

				TODD
		Yawp. 

				KEATING
		Oh, good God, boy. Yell like a man! 

				TODD
				(shouting)
		Yawp! 

				KEATING
		There it is. You see, you have a 
		barbarian in you, after all.

Todd goes to return to his seat but Keating stops him.

				KEATING
		Now, you don't get away that easy.

Keating turns Todd around and points out a picture on the wall.

				KEATING
		The picture of Uncle Walt up there. What 
		does he remind you of? Don't think. 
		Answer. Go on.

Keating begins to circle around Todd.

				TODD
		A m-m-madman. 

				KEATING
		What kind of madman? Don't think about 
		it. Just answer again. 

				TODD
		A c-crazy madman. 

				KEATING
		No, you can do better than that. Free up 
		your mind. Use your imagination. Say the 
		first thing that pops into your head, 
		even if it's total gibberish. Go on, go 
		on. 

				TODD
		Uh, uh, a sweaty-toothed madman. 

				KEATING
		Good God, boy, there's a poet in you, 
		after all. There, close your eyes. Close 
		your eyes. Close 'em. Now, describe what 
		you see. 

Keating puts his hands over Todd's eyes and they begin to slowly
spin around.

				TODD
		Uh, I-I close my eyes. 

				KEATING
		Yes? 

				TODD
		Uh, and this image floats beside me. 

				KEATING
		A sweaty-toothed madman? 

				TODD
		A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare 
		that pounds my brain. 

				KEATING
		Oh, that's excellent. Now, give him 
		action. Make him do something. 

				TODD
		H-His hands reach out and choke me. 

				KEATING
		That's it. Wonderful. Wonderful.

Keating removes his hands from Todd but Todd keeps his eyes
closed.

				TODD
		And, and all the time he's mumbling. 

				KEATING
		What's he mumbling? 

				TODD
		M-Mumbling, "Truth. Truth is like, like 
		a blanket that always leaves your feet 
		cold." 

The students begin to laugh and Todd opens his eyes. Keating
quickly gestures for him to close them again.

				KEATING
		Forget them, forget them. Stay with the 
		blanket. Tell me about that blanket. 

				TODD
		Y-Y-Y-You push it, stretch it, it'll 
		never be enough. You kick at it, beat 
		it, it'll never cover any of us. From 
		the moment we enter crying to the moment 
		we leave dying, it will just cover your 
		face as you wail and cry and scream. 

Todd opens his eyes. The class is silent. Then they begin to clap
and cheer.

				KEATING
			   (whispering to Todd)
		Don't you forget this.

EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY

Keating's students are playing a soccer game. After they score the
winning goal they hoist Keating onto their shoulders and carry him
away.

INT. CAVE - DAY

The boys are all sitting around the cave lighting their pipes.
				CHARLIE
		Attaboy, Pittsie, inhale deeply. 

				MEEKS
		My dad collects a lot of pipes. 

				CHARLIE
		Really? Mine's got thirty. 

				PITTS
		Your parents collect pipes? Oh, that's 
		really interesting. 

				CHARLIE
		Come on, Knox. Join in. 

				MEEKS
		Yeah, Knox, we're from the government. 
		We're here to help, man. 

				CHARLIE
		What's wrong? 

				PITTS
		It's Chris. Here's a picture of Chris 
		for you.

Pitts holds up a centerfold.

				MEEKS
		Smoke that. Put that in your pipe and 
		smoke it. 

				KNOX
		That's not funny. 

				CHARLIE
		Knock it off. Smoke your pipes. 

				MEEKS
		Neil!

Neil enters the cave carrying a beat up light stand.

				NEIL
		Friend, scholar, Welton men. 

				MEEKS
		What is that, Neil? 

				PITTS
		Duh. It's a lamp, Meeks.

Neil removes the shade from the lamp, revealing the shape of a man
as the base of the lamp.

				NEIL
		No. This is the god of the cave. 

				MEEKS
		The god of the cave.

Charlie begins making loud noises with his saxophone.

				PITTS
		Charlie, what are you doing? 

				CHARLIE
		What do you say we start this meeting? 

				BOY 1
		Y-Yeah, just-- I need a light. I just 
		gotta- 

				BOY 2
		Got my earplugs?

Charlie stands up and clears his throat.

				CHARLIE
		Gentlemen, "Poetrusic" by Charles 
		Dalton.

Charlie begins playing erratic notes on the sexophone.

				MEEKS
		Oh, no. 

				CHARLIE
		Laughing, crying, tumbling, mumbling. 
		Gotta do more. Gotta be more. 

Charlie plays more erratic sounds.

				CHARLIE
		Chaos screaming, chaos dreaming. Gotta 
		do more! Gotta be more!

Charlie starts to play a real tune on the saxophone.

				MEEKS
		Wow! 

				PITTS
		That was nice. That was great. Where did 
		you learn to play like that? 

				CHARLIE
		My parents made me take the clarinet for 
		years. 

				CAMERON
		I love the clarinet. 

				CHARLIE
		I hated it. The saxophone. The saxophone 
		is more sonorous. 

				CAMERON
		Ooh. 

				MEEKS
		Vocabulary. 

Knox jumps up.
				KNOX
		I can't take it anymore. If I don't have 
		Chris, I'm gonna kill myself. 

				CHARLIE
		Knoxious, you've gotta calm down. 

				KNOX
		No, Charlie. That's just my problem. 
		I've been calm all my life. I'll do 
		something about that. 

				NEIL
		Where are you going? 

				CHARLIE
		What are you gonna do? 

				KNOX
		I'm gonna call her.

Knox begins to chuckle as he leaves the cave. The others
quickly grab their coats to follow him. Charlie goes back to
playing noise on his saxophone again.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Knox is making a call from the payphone.

				CHRIS (O.S.)
		Hello?

Knox immediately hangs up and looks at the other boys who are
all gathered around him.

				KNOX
		She's gonna hate me. The Danburrys will 
		hate me. My parents will kill me. 
		All right, goddamn it. You're right. 
		"Carpe diem." Even if it kills me. 

Knox puts in another coin and calls again.

				CHRIS (O.S.)
		Hello? 

				KNOX
		Hello, Chris? 

				CHRIS (O.S.)
		Yes. 

				KNOX
		Hi. This is Knox Overstreet. 

				CHRIS (O.S.)
		Oh, yes. Knox. Glad you called. 

				KNOX
		She's glad I called. 

				CHRIS (O.S.)
		Listen, Chet's parents are going out of 
		town this weekend, so he's having a 
		party. Would you like to come? 

				KNOX
		Would I like to come to a party? 

				CHARLIE
		Yes. Say, yes. 

				CHRIS (O.S.)
		Friday? Um- 

				KNOX
		Well, sure. 

				CHRIS (O.S.)
		About seven? 

				KNOX
		Okay, great. I-I'll be there, Chris. 

				CHRIS (O.S.)
		Okay. 

				KNOX
		Friday night at the Danburrys'. O-Okay. 
		Thank you. 

				CHRIS (O.S.)
		Okay. Bye. 

				KNOX
		Thank you. I'll see you. Bye. 

				KNOX
		Yawp! Can you believe it? She was gonna 
		call me. She invited me to a party with 
		her. 

				CHARLIE
		At Chet Danburry's house. 

				KNOX
		Yeah. 

				CHARLIE
		Well? 

				KNOX
		So? 

				CHARLIE
		So, you don't really think she means 
		you're going with her? 

				KNOX
		Well, of course not, Charlie. But that's 
		not the point. That's not the point at 
		all. 

				CHARLIE
		What is the point? 

				KNOX
		The point, Charlie, is, uh-- 

				CHARLIE
		Yeah? 

				KNOX
		that she was thinking about me. I've 
		only met her once, and already she's 
		thinking about me. Damn it. It's gonna 
		happen, guys. I feel it. She is going to 
		be mine. Carpe. Carpe!

Knox flips his scarf dramatically around his neck as he walks away
and climbs the stairs.

EXT. COURTYARD - DAY

The students are standing in a line while Cameron, Pitts, and Knox
are walking in a circle. Keating watches as they go around.

				KEATING
		No grades at stake, gentlemen. Just take 
		a stroll.

After a few moments, the three boys begin to march to the same beat.

				KEATING
		There it is. 

The other boys start clapping to the rhythm of their steps.

				KEATING
		I don't know, but I've been told-- 

				BOYS
		I don't know, but I've been told-- 

				KEATING
		Doing poetry is old-- 

				BOYS
		Doing poetry is old-- 

Mr. Nolan looks out at them from his office as Keating joins the
boys and begins marching with them.

				KEATING
		Left, left, left-right-left. Left, left, 
		left-right-left. Left, halt! 

The boys come to a halt.

				KEATING
		Thank you, gentlemen. If you noticed, 
		everyone started off with their own 
		stride, their own pace.

Keating begins walking very slowly.

				KEATING
		Mr. Pitts, taking his time. He knew he'll
		get there one day. Mr. Cameron, you could
		see him thinking, "Is this right? It might
		be right. It might be right. I know that. 
		Maybe not. I don't know."

Keating begins walking with his groin pushed forward.

				KEATING
		Mr. Overstreet, driven by deeper force.
		Yes. We know that. All right. Now, I
		didn't bring them up here to ridicule
		them. I brought them up here to illustrate
		the point of conformity: the difficulty in 
		maintaining your own beliefs in the face 
		of others. Now, those of you -- I see 
		the look in your eyes like, "I would've 
		walked differently." Well, ask 
		yourselves why you were clapping. Now, 
		we all have a great need for acceptance. 
		But you must trust that your beliefs are 
		unique, your own, even though others may 
		think them odd or unpopular, even though 
		the herd may go, "That's baaaaad." Robert 
		Frost said, "Two roads diverged in a 
		wood and I, I took the one less traveled 
		by, and that has made all the 
		difference." Now, I want you to find 
		your own walk right now. Your own way of 
		striding, pacing. Any direction. 
		Anything you want. Whether it's proud, 
		whether it's silly, anything. Gentlemen, 
		the courtyard is yours.

The students begin walking about, some walking casually, others
making up silly walks. Keating notices that Charlie is still
leaning up against one of the pillars.

				KEATING
		You don't have to perform. Just make it 
		for yourself. Mr. Dalton? You be joining 
		us? 

				CHARLIE
		Exercising the right not to walk. 

				KEATING
		Thank you, Mr. Dalton. You just 
		illustrated the point. Swim against the 
		stream.

Nolan moves away from the window where he had been watching them.

EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT

Neil is walking by with the notes for the play when he notices Todd
sitting off by himself on one of the walkways.

				NEIL
		Todd? Hey. 

				TODD
		Hey. 

				NEIL
		What's going on?

				TODD
		Nothing. Today's my birthday. 

				NEIL
		Is today your birthday? Happy birthday. 

				TODD
		Thanks. 

				NEIL
		What's you get? 

				TODD
		My parents gave me this. 

Neil looks down at a deskset sitting next to Todd, still in
its wrappings.

				NEIL
		Isn't this the same desk set- 

				TODD
		Yeah, yeah. They gave me the same thing 
		as last year. 

				NEIL
		Oh. 

				TODD
		Oh. 

				NEIL
				 (laughing)
		Maybe they thought you needed another 
		one. 

				TODD
		Maybe they weren't thinking about 
		anything at all. Uh, the funny thing is 
		about this is I, I didn't even like it 
		the first time. 

				NEIL
		Todd, I think you're underestimating the 
		value of this desk set.

Neil picks up the desk set and begins examining it more closely.

				NEIL
		I mean, who would want a football or
		a baseball, or-

				TODD
		Or a car. 

				NEIL
		Or a car if they could have a desk set 
		as wonderful as this one? I mean, if, if 
		I were ever going to buy a, a desk set 
		twice, I would probably buy this one 
		both times. In fact, its, its shape is, 
		it's rather aerodynamic, isn't it? I can 
		feel it. This desk set wants to fly.

Neil tosses the desk set lightly in the air. Todd stands up
and Neil hands him the desk set.

				NEIL
		Todd? The world's first unmanned flying 
		desk set.

Todd flings the desk set over the side of the walkway and it
falls to pieces down below.

				TODD
		Oh, my! 

				NEIL
		Well, I wouldn't worry. You'll get 
		another one next year.

INT. CAVE - NIGHT

All the boys but Knox and Charlie are gathered in the cave.

				BOYS
		"To live deep and suck out all the 
		marrow of life. To put to rout all that 
		was not life"

The boys stop as they hear the sound of female laughter outside.

				CAMERON
		Oh, my God! 

				GLORIA
		Is this it? 

				CHARLIE
		Yeah, this is it. Go ahead, go on in. 
		It's my cave. Watch your step. 

				TINA
		We're not gonna slip, are we? 

				GLORIA
		Uh-oh.

Gloria hops into the cave wearing a bright red shirt. The lights from
the boys' flashlights play conspicously over Gloria's chest. Tina
enters right behind her.

				GLORIA
		Hi.

Meeks stands up and slams his head into the low ceiling.

				MEEKS
		Hello. 

				GLORIA
		Hello. 

				CHARLIE
		Hi, you guys. Meet, uh, Gloria and-- 

				TINA
		Tina. 

				CHARLIE
		Tina. This is the pledge class of the 
		Dead Poets Society.
 
				BOYS
		Hello. How do you do? 

				NEIL
		Hello. 

				GLORIA
		Hi. Hi. 

				CHARLIE
		Guys, move. Move. Come on, folks. It's 
		Friday night. Let's get on with the 
		meeting.

The boys move aside to let the girls in.

				BOYS
		Sorry. Excuse- Excuse me. 

				CHARLIE
		Guys, I have an announcement to make. In 
		keeping with the spirit of passionate 
		experimentation of the Dead Poets, I'm 
		giving up the name Charlie Dalton. From 
		now on, call me Nuwanda. 

				PITTS
				(laughing)
		Nuwanda? 

				NEIL
		Nuwanda? 

Tina takes out a tube of red lipstick. Charlie takes it from her
and puts red marks on each of his cheeks.

INT. CHET'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Knox enters the house and looks anxiously about.

				KNOX
		Hello? Hello, Chris?

Knox stops and combs his hair in the hallway mirror. Chris comes
running out from one of the rooms.

				CHRIS
		Knox! 

				KNOX
		Hi. 

				CHRIS
		You made it. Great! Bring anybody? 

				KNOX
		No. 

Chris grabs Knox by his jackets and pulls him forward as she walks
toward the stairs.

				CHRIS
		No. Ginny Danburry's here. Wait. I have 
		to go find Chet. Why don't you go 
		downstairs where everybody is?

Chris runs up the stairs as Knox stares after her.

				CHRIS
		Make yourself at home. 

				KNOX
		But I--

INT. CHET'S BASEMENT - NIGHT

Knox stares at a couple kissing passionately. Across the room he sees
Chet and Chris dancing. He walks away.

INT. CHET'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Knox enters the kitchen, walking between several football players
to fill up a mug of beer from a keg.

				STEVE
		Hey, you Mutt Sanders' brother? Bubba, 
		this guy look like Mutt Sanders to you 
		or what? 

Bubba spits ice cubes into the sink.

				BUBBA
		You're his brother? 

				KNOX
		No relation. Never heard of him. Sorry, 
		guys. 

				BUBBA
			  (obviously drunk)
		Where's your manners Steve? Mutt Sanders' 
		brother, we don't even offer him a 
		drink. Here. Go have some whiskey, pal. 

Bubba hands Knox a glass and fills it up.

				STEVE
		Yeah. 

				KNOX
		Whoa, I, uh, I don't really drink-- 

				BUBBA
		To Mutt. 

				STEVE
		To Mutt.

The two guys raise their glasses in a toast and Knox reluctantly
joins them.

				KNOX
		To Mutt.

They each take a big drink. Knox rolls his eyes and gasps,
loosening his tie to try and breathe.

				BUBBA
		Now, how the hell is old Mutt, anyway? 

				STEVE
		Yeah. What's ol' Mutter been up to, huh? 

				KNOX
		I don't really know Mutt. 

				BUBBA
		To Mighty Mutt. 

				GUY 1
		To Mighty Mutt. 

				KNOX
		To Mighty Mutt.

They raise their glasses again for a toast and down the rest
of their glasses.

				BUBBA
		Well, listen, I gotta go find Patsy. Say 
		hello to Mutt for me, okay? 

				KNOX
		Will do.

Bubba puts on a horned football helmet and walks away.

				STEVE
		Yeah. Hell of a guy, your brother Mutt.

INT. CAVE - NIGHT

				CHARLIE
		We gonna have a meeting or what? 

				GLORIA
		Yeah. If you guys don't have a meeting, 
		how do we know if we wanna join? 

				NEIL
		Join? 

Charlie leans over to Tina.

				CHARLIE
		"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? 
		Thou art more lovely and more 
		temperate." 

				TINA
		That's so sweet. 

				CHARLIE
		I made that up just for you. 

				TINA
		You did?

The boys laugh and Cameron shakes his head. Charlie moves over
to sit next to Gloria.

				CHARLIE
		I'll write one for you too, Gloria. 
		She walks in beauty like the night. 
		She walks in beauty like the night. 
		Of cloudless climes and starry skies. 
		All that's best, dark and bright, 
		Meet in her aspect and her eyes. 

				GLORIA
		That's beautiful. 

				CHARLIE
		There's plenty more where that came 
		from.

INT. CHET'S BASEMENT - NIGHT

The room is whirling as Knox belches and staggers across the room. He
passes Chet and several of his friends. He steps over several couples
kissing on the floor and slump down on the couch, only to be crowded
in by another couple who seem oblivious to him. He is about to get up
again when he notices Chris sleeping next to him on the couch.

				KNOX
		God help me.

Knox looks about and then looks back down at Chris.

				KNOX
		Carpe diem.

Knox takes a last swig of his drink  and then begins to softly run his
fingers over Chris' hair. He then leans over and kisses her forehead.
Across the room, Bubba looks over and sees what's going on.

				BUBBA
		Chet! Chet! Look! 

				CHET
		What? 

				BUBBA
		It's Mutt Sanders' brother. 

				CHET
		Huh? 

Chris rises up from the couch and looks at Knox in surprise.

				CHRIS
		Knox, what-- 

				BUBBA
		And he's feeling up your girl! 

				CHRIS
		What are you doing? 

Chet gets up from his chair.

				CHET
		What the hell are you doing? 

				CHRIS
		Chet! Chet, don't. 

				KNOX
		Now, Chet, I know this looks bad, but 
		you've gotta-

Chet throws himself at Knox, hurling them both to the floor. He
then straddles Knox and begins to punch at him as Knox simply
tries to protect himself.

				CHRIS
		Chet, no! You'll hurt him! No! No! Stop 
		it! Leave him alone! 

				CHET
		Goddamn! 

				CHRIS
		Chet, stop it!

Chris manages to haul Chet away from Knox.

				CHET
		Bastard!

Knox takes his hands away from his face and feels at his bloody
nose. Chris tries to help him up.

				CHRIS
		Knox, are you all right? 

				CHET
		Chris, get the hell away from him! 

				CHRIS
		Chet, you hurt him! 

				CHET
		Good! 

				KNOX
		I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 

				CHRIS
		It's okay. It-It's okay.

Chet hauls Chris away from Knox and then points at him.

				CHET
		Next time I see you, you die. 

INT. CAVE - NIGHT

Tina passes a bottle of alcohol to Neil.

				TINA
		Go ahead, pass it around. 

Cameron motions for Neil not to take it but Neil takes a swig anyway.
There is a moment of awkward silence.

				MEEKS
		Me and Pitts are working on a hi-fi 
		system. It shouldn't be that hard to, 
		uh, to put together. 

				PITTS
		Yeah. Uh, I might be going to Yale. Uh, 
		uh, but, I, I might not. 

				GLORIA
		Don't you guys miss having girls around 
		here? 

				MEEKS AND PITTS
				  (smiling)
		Yeah.

				CHARLIE
		That's part of what this club is about. 
		In fact, I'd like to announce I 
		published an article in the school 
		paper, in the name of the Dead Poets. 

				CAMERON
		What? 

				CHARLIE
		Demanding girls be admitted to Welton. 

				PITTS
		You didn't. 

				CHARLIE
			    (whispering to Meeks)
		So we can all stop beating off. 

				NEIL
		How did you do that? 

				CHARLIE
		I'm one of the proofers. I slipped the 
		article in. 

				MEEKS
		Look, uh, it's, it's over now. 

				CHARLIE
		Why? Nobody knows who we are. 

				CAMERON
		Well, don't you think they're gonna 
		figure out who wrote it? They're gonna 
		come to you and ask to know what the 
		Dead Poets Society is. Charlie, you had 
		no right to do something like that. 

				CHARLIE
		It's Nuwanda, Cameron. 

				GLORIA
		That's right. It's Nuwanda. 

				CHARLIE
		Are we just playing around out here, or 
		do we mean what we say? For all we do is 
		come together and reach a bunch of poems 
		to each other. What the hell are we 
		doing? 

				NEIL
		All right, but you still shouldn't have 
		done it, Charlie. This could mean 
		trouble. You don't speak for the club. 

				CHARLIE
		Hey, would you not worry about your 
		precious little neck? If they catch me, 
		I'll tell them I made it up. 


INT. ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY

The professors hurry down the steps, lead by an obviously agitated
Mr. Nolan. Several are carrying newspapers in their hands. The
students all rise as they enter. After all the professors have
taken their places, Mr. Nolan addresses the students.

				MR. NOLAN
		Sit.

The students all sit.

				MR. NOLAN
		In this week of Welton's Honor there 
		appeared a profane and unauthorized 
		article. Rather than spend my valuable 
		time ferreting out the guilty persons -- 
		and let me assure you I will find them -
		- I'm asking any and all students who 
		knows anything about this article to 
		make themselves known here and now. 
		Whoever the guilty persons are, this is 
		your only chance to avoid expulsion from 
		this school.

The sound of a phone ringing can be heard. The professors look
about for its source. Charlie picks up a telephone receiver.

				CHARLIE
		Welton Academy. Hello. Yes, he is. Just 
		a moment.

Charlie stands up, holding a phone and bell in his hands.

				CHARLIE
		Mr. Nolan, it's for you. It's 
		God. He says we should have girls at 
		Welton.

Most of the students laugh while the boys from the cave all shake
their heads in disbelief.

INT. NOLAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Charlie stands with his back to the door as Mr. Nolan shuts it. Mr. 
Nolan then walks around to face Charlie.

				MR. NOLAN
		Wipe that smirk off your face. If you 
		think, Mr. Dalton, that you're the first 
		to try to get thrown out of this school, 
		think again. Others have had similar 
		notions and have failed just as surely 
		as you will fail. Assume the position.

Charlie sighs and bends over, resting his hands on the desk. Mr.
Nolan hefts a flat wooden paddle in his hands.

				MR. NOLAN
		Count aloud, Mr. Dalton.

Mr. Nolan begins to strike Charlie with the paddle.

				CHARLIE
		One. Two. Three. Four. Five. 

				MR. NOLAN
		What is this Dead Poets Society? I want 
		names.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

A crowd of students is gathered about as Charlie stiffly walks back to his room.

				NEIL
		You kicked out? 

				CHARLIE
		No. 

				NEIL
		So what happened? 

				CHARLIE
		I'm to turn everybody in, apologize to 
		the school and all will be forgiven. 

				NEIL
		So, what are you gonna do? Charlie! 

				CHARLIE
		Damn it, Neil. The name is Nuwanda.

Charlie smiles and then shuts his door.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Keating and McAllister are enjoying tea in the small room off the
classroom. Mr. Nolan knocks on the door and enters.

				MR. NOLAN
		Excuse me. May we have a word, Mr. 
		Keating? 

				KEATING
		Certainly.

Keating fixes his tie and follows Mr. Nolan into the classroom.

				MR. NOLAN
		This was my first classroom, John. Did 
		you know that? My first desk. 

				KEATING
		Didn't know you taught, Mr. Nolan. 

				MR. NOLAN
		English. Oh, long before your time. It 
		was hard giving it up, I can tell you. 
		I'm hearing rumors, John, about some 
		unorthodox teaching methods in your 
		classroom. I'm not saying they've 
		anything to do with the Dalton boy's 
		outburst. But I don't think I have to 
		warn you boys his age are very 
		impressionable. 

				KEATING
		Well, your reprimand made quite an 
		impression, I'm sure. 

				MR. NOLAN
		What was going on in the courtyard the 
		other day? 

				KEATING
		Courtyard? 

				MR. NOLAN
		Yeah. Boys marching, clapping in unison. 

				KEATING
		Oh, that. That was an exercise to prove 
		a point. Dangers of conformity. 

				MR. NOLAN
		Well, John, the curriculum here is set. 
		It's proven it works. If you question, 
		what's to prevent them from doing the 
		same? 

				KEATING
		I always thought the idea of educating 
		was to learn to think for yourself. 

				MR. NOLAN
		At these boys' ages? Not on your life! 
		Tradition, John. Discipline. Prepare 
		them for college, and the rest will take 
		care of itself.

INT. STUDY ROOM - DAY

Charlie sits with his bongos as the other boys are all crowded
around him. He hits the bongoes as he mimes Nolan's footsteps.

				CHARLIE
		Creak. He started walking around towards 
		my left. Creak. Creak. "Assume the 
		position, Mr. Dalton."

The door opens and Keating walks in. Many of the boys get up from
their seats.

				KEATING
		It's all right, gentlemen. 

				CHARLIE
		Mr. Keating. 

				KEATING
		Mr. Dalton. That was a pretty lame stunt 
		you pulled today. 

				CHARLIE
		You're siding with Mr. Nolan? What about 
		Carpe diem and sucking all the marrow 
		out of life and all that? 

				KEATING
		Sucking the marrow out of life doesn't 
		mean choking on the bone. Sure there's a 
		time for daring and there's a time for 
		caution, and a wise man understands 
		which is called for. 

				CHARLIE
		But I thought you'd like that. 

				KEATING
		No. You being expelled from school is 
		not daring to me. It's stupid, 'cause 
		you'll miss some golden opportunities. 

				CHARLIE
		Yeah. Like what? 

				KEATING
		Like, if nothing else, the opportunity 
		to attend my classes. Got it, Ace? 

				CHARLIE
		Aye, aye, Captain. 

				KEATING
		Keep your head about you. That goes for 
		the lot of you. 

				BOYS
		Yes, Captain. 

				KEATING
		Phone call from God. If it had been 
		collect, it wouldn't been daring.

Keating leaves and the boys gather around Charlie once again.

				CHARLIE
		All right. Go on.

EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

Neil bikes away as the clock bell tolls.

INT. THEATER - DAY

Neil walks into the back of the theater and watches various
actors rehearsing on stage. A smile fills his face.

				DIRECTOR
		We're trying to rehearse, okay? Start. 

				LYSANDER
		A good persuasion, therefore hear me, 
		Hermia. 

				DIRECTOR
		Wait, please. Excitement. I don't hear 
		any excitement about this play. And take 
		her hand. Bring her down the stage and 
		stop. And "There, gentle Hermia." Okay? 
		Try again.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

The bell rings and students rush down the hall.

				BOY
		What's for dinner? 

				PITTS
		Spaghetti and meatballs!

Neil comes up the stairs as everyone else swarms down to the cafeteria.

				NEIL
		Save some for me. "But, room, Fairy! 
		Here comes Oberon."

Neil opens the door to his room and sees his father sitting at his desk.

				NEIL
		Father. 

				MR. PERRY
		Neil. 

				NEIL
		Wait a minute. Before you say anything, 
		please let me ex-

Mr. Perry rises from the desk.

				MR. PERRY
		Don't you dare talk back to me! It's bad 
		enough that you've wasted your time with 
		this, this absurd acting business. But 
		you deliberately deceived me! How, how, 
		how did you expect to get away with 
		this? Answer me. Who put you up to it? 
		Was it this new man? This, uh, Mr. 
		Keating? 

				NEIL
		No. Nobody-- I thought I'd surprise you. 
		I've gotten all A's in every class. 

				MR. PERRY
		Did you think I wasn't going to find 
		out? "Oh, my niece is in a play with 
		your son," says Mrs. Marks. "No, no, 
		no," I say, "you must be mistaken. My 
		son's not in a play." You made me a liar 
		of me, Neil! Now, tomorrow you go to 
		them and you tell them that you're 
		quitting. 

				NEIL
		No, I can't. I have the main part. The 
		performance is tomorrow night. 

				MR. PERRY
		I don't care if the world comes to an 
		end tomorrow night. You are through with 
		that play. Is that clear? Is that clear? 

				NEIL
		Yes, sir. 

Mr. Perry goes to leave and then turns around.

				MR. PERRY
		I made a great many sacrifices to get 
		you here, Neil, and you will not let me 
		down. 

				NEIL
		No, sir. 

INT. KEATING'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Keating is seated at his desk. He is writing a letter and occasionally
looks up at the framed photo on his desk of a woman playing the cello.
There is a knock at the door.

				KEATING
		It's open.

Neil enters and closes the door behind him. He appears to be nervous.

				KEATING
		Neil, what's up? 

				NEIL
		Can I speak to you a minute? 

				KEATING
		Certainly. Sit down.

Neil goes to take a seat but notices the chair is piled up with books.
Neil picks them up and Keating gets up from his seat to help him.

				NEIL
		I'm sorry. Here. 

				KEATING
		Excuse me. Get you some tea? 

				NEIL
		Tea. Sure.

Keating goes to a table in the corner and begins pouring several cups.

				KEATING
		Like some milk or sugar in that? 

				NEIL
		No, thanks. 

				NEIL
		Gosh, they don't give you much room 
		around here. 

				KEATING
		No, it's part of the monastic oath. They 
		don't want worldly things distracting me 
		from my teaching.

Keating gives Neil a cup of tea and they return to their seats. Neil
looks at the photo on the desk.

				NEIL
		She's pretty. 

				KEATING
		She's also in London. Makes it a little 
		difficult. 

				NEIL
		How can you stand it? 

				KEATING
		Stand what? 

				NEIL
		You can go anywhere. You can do 
		anything. How can you stand being here? 

				KEATING
		'Cause I love teaching. I don't wanna be 
		anywhere else. 

				KEATING
		What's up? 

				NEIL
		I just talked to my father. He's making 
		me quit the play at Henley Hall. 
		Acting's everything to me. I-- But he 
		doesn't know. He-- I can see his point. 
		We're not a rich family like Charlie's, 
		and we-- But he's planning the rest of 
		my life for me, and I-- H-He's never 
		asked me what I want. 

				KEATING
		Have you ever told your father what you 
		just told me? About your passion for 
		acting. You ever show him that? 

				NEIL
		I can't. 

				KEATING
		Why not? 

				NEIL
		I can't talk to him this way. 

				KEATING
		Then you're acting for him, too. You're 
		playing the part of the dutiful son. I 
		know this sounds impossible, but you 
		have to talk to him. You have to show 
		him who you are, what your heart is. 

				NEIL
		I know what he'll say. He'll tell me 
		that acting's a whim, and I should 
		forget it. That how they're counting on 
		me. He'll just tell me to put it out of 
		my mind, "for my own good." 

				KEATING
		You are not an indentured servant. If 
		it's not a whim for you, you prove it to 
		him by your conviction and your passion. 
		You show him that And if he still 
		doesn't believe you, well, by then 
		you'll be out of school and you can do 
		anything you want. 

A tear falls down Neil's cheek and he wipes it away.

				NEIL
		No. What about the play? The show's 
		tomorrow night. 

				KEATING
		Well, you have to talk to him before 
		tomorrow night. 

				NEIL
		Isn't there an easier way? 

				KEATING
		No. 

				NEIL
		I'm trapped. 

				KEATING
		No, you're not.

EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

Knox exits one of the doors. The ground is covered with a thick
layer of snow. He looks around to see if anyone is about and then
hurries over to the bike rack. grabbing one of the bikes, he hurries
off.

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

A crowd of students come in from the cold. Knox pushes his way through
them, carrying a handful of wildflowers. He begins searching for Chris.

				KNOX
		Chris!

He approaches a girl with hair similar to Chris' and turns her around,
only to realize that it's not her.

				KNOX
		Chris Noel. Do you know where she is? 

				GIRL
		Um, I think she's in room 111.

The girl points down the hallway and Knox sets off in that direction.

				KNOX
		Thanks.

Chris is at her locker talking to a friend. She just closes her locker
as she notices Knox coming towards her. She turns away.

				KNOX
		Excuse me. Chris. 

				CHRIS
		Knox, what are you doing here? 

				KNOX
		I came to apologize for the other night. 
		I brought you these and a poem I wrote 
		for you.

Chris pulls him aside, out of the main hallway.

				CHRIS
		Knox, don't you know that, if Chet finds 
		you here he'll kill you? 

				KNOX
		I can't care. I love you, Chris. 

				CHRIS
		Knox, you're crazy. 

				KNOX
		Look, I acted like a jerk and I know it. 
		Please, accept these. Please. 

				CHRIS
		No. No-- I, I can't. Forget it.

Chris walks away. The school bell rings and she enters her
classroom, closing the door behind her. Undaunted, Knox follows,
opening the door and standing before her desk.

				CHRIS
		Knox, I don't believe this. 

				KNOX
		All I'm asking you to do is listen.

As Knox begins to read his poem, the classroom grows quiet as
everyone stops to listen.

				KNOX
		The heavens made a girl named Chris 
		With hair and skin of gold. 
		To touch her would be paradise.

Chris holds her head in her hands in embarrassment.

INT. CAMPUS KITCHEN - DAY

Knox sneaks in through a side door. He snatches a slice of toast
from the counter and motions to one of the staff to keep secret.
He then begins to eat the toast as he hurries away.

INT. STAIRWAY - DAY

The school bell rings and Knox pushes his way up the stairs past
the slower students. At the top he joins the other boys where they
are grabbing their books.

				CHARLIE
		Get out of here. Cameron, you fool.

Charlie notices Knox and grabs his jacket.

				CHARLIE
		Hey, how'd it go? Did you read it to
		her? 

				KNOX
		Yeah.

The boys begin to get all excited but Charlie shushes them.

				PITTS
		What'd she say? 

				KNOX
		Nothing. 

				CHARLIE
		Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? 

				KNOX
		Nothing. But I did it.

Knox walks away down the hall and the others chase after him.

				CHARLIE
		What did she say? I know she had to say 
		something. 

				PITTS
		Come here, Knox. 

				KNOX
		Seize the day!

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Keating walks from the front of the classroom to Neil's desk. Neil
is the only student remaining in the class.

				KEATING
		Did you talk to your father? 

				NEIL
		Uh, he didn't like it one bit, but at 
		least he's letting me stay in the play. 
		He won't be able to make, make it. He's 
		in Chicago. But, uh, I think he's gonna 
		let me stay with acting. 

				KEATING
		Really? You told him what you told me? 

				NEIL
		Yeah. He wasn't happy. But he'll be gone 
		at least four days. I don't think he'll 
		make the show, but I think he'll let me 
		stay with it. "Keep up the school work." 
		Thanks.

Neil picks up his books and leaves.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

		Excuse me, just a moment. Yes. You're so 
		cute.

Cameron runs a comb through his hair and Todd tries to mess it up.

				CAMERON
		Come on, Todd. I'm trying to fix 
		this. 

				TODD
		Come on, Nuwanda. You're gonna miss 
		Neil's entrance. 

				PITTS
		He said something about getting red 
		before we left. 

				CAMERON
		Getting red? What does that mean? 

				PITTS
		I, uh-- Well, you know Charlie.

One of the stalls opens and Charlie's hand emerges, holding a small
brush and a bottle of red paint.

				CAMERON
		So, Charlie, what's this "getting red" 
		bit?

Charlie opens his unbuttoned shirt to show a large red lightning bolt
painted down his chest.

				TODD
		W-What is that? 

				CHARLIE
		It's an Indian warrior symbol for 
		virility. Makes me feel potent, like it 
		can drive girls crazy.

Charlie buttons up his shirt as everyone prepares to leave.

				TODD
		Oh, come on, Charlie. The girls are 
		waiting.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

The boys are walking down the hall to leave. Cameron stops and stares.
The other boys notice and stop as well. Charlie softly whistles at Chris
standing by the door. Knox stares at her in surprise

				KNOX
		Chris.

Knox leaves the other boys to join her.

				KNOX
		What are you doing here? 

				KEATING (O.S.)
		Gentlemen, let's go. 

				KNOX
		Go ahead, guys. I'll catch up. 

				CHARLIE
		Yeah, come on, guys.

Charlie hustles the boys away. Meeks remains staring at her. Charlie
returns to drag him away.

				KNOX
		Chris, you can't be in here. I-If they 
		catch you, we're both gonna be in big 
		trouble. 

				CHRIS
		Oh, but it's fine--

Knox shushes her and leads her out the door.

EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT

Snow is lightly falling as Chris and Knox walk outside.

				CHRIS
		It's fine for you to come barging into 
		my school and make a complete fool out 
		of me? 

				KNOX
		I didn't mean to make a fool out of you. 

				CHRIS
		Well, you did. Chet found out. And it 
		took everything I could do to keep him 
		from coming here and killing you. Knox, 
		you have got to stop this stuff. 

				KNOX
		I can't, Chris. I love you. 

				CHRIS
		Knox, you say that over and over. You 
		don't, you don't even know me. 

Keating calls out from a nearby car.

				KEATING
		Will you be joining us, Mr. Overstreet?

				KNOX
		Go ahead, Captain. I'll walk. 

				CHRIS
		Knox, Knox, it just so happens that I 
		could care less about you? 

				KNOX
		Then you wouldn't be here warning me 
		about Chet. 

				CHRIS
		I have to go. I'm gonna be late for the 
		play. 

				KNOX
		Are you going with him? 

				CHRIS
				   (laughs)
		Chet? To a play? Are you kidding? 

				KNOX
		Then come with me. 

				CHRIS
		Knox, you are so infuriating. 

				KNOX
		Come on, Chris. Just give me one chance. 
		If you don't like me after tonight, I'll 
		stay away forever. 

				CHRIS
		Uh-huh. 

				KNOX
		I promise. Dead Poets Honor. You come 
		with me tonight. And then, if you don't 
		want to see me again, I swear I'll bow 
		out. 
		
				CHRIS
		You know what would happen if Chet found 
		out? 

				KNOX
		He won't know anything. We'll sit in the 
		back and sneak away as soon as it's 
		over. 

				CHRIS
		And I suppose you would promise that 
		this would be the end of it. 

				KNOX
		Dead Poets Honor. 

				CHRIS
		What is that? 

				KNOX
		My word.

Chris walks away from him and then turns to face him.

				CHRIS
		You are so infuriating.

Chris gestures for Knox to follow her. Charlie does a little 
twirl as he joins her and puts his arm around her. They walk away.

INT. THEATER - NIGHT

The audience is packed. The stage is set up to resemble a forest and
lights dance about it. From behind a bush, Neil emerges, wearing a
crown of twigs and berries and twigs on his hands. In the audience,
Charlie emerges from his seat, all excited.

				CHARLIE
		Hey, there he is! Hey, hey.

Cameron shoves him back into his seat.

				KEATING
		Shh, boys.

On stage, Neil hides behind a tree as a girl emerges, similarly clad,
but with flowers in her hair. Neil sneaks over to the girl.

				FAIRY

		Either I mistake your shape and making 
		quite, 
		Or else you are that shrewd and knavish 
		sprite 
		Call'd Robin Goodfellow: 

				PUCK

		Thou speak'st aright;

In the audience, Chris and Knox enter and are shown to seats.

				PUCK
		I am that merry wanderer of the night. 
		I jest to Oberon and make him smile 
		When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,

Puck makes horse sounds and the audience laughs.

				PUCK
		Neighing in likeness of a filly foal: 
		And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl, 
		In very likeness of a roasted crab, 
		And when she drinks, against her lips I 
		bob 
		And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale. 
		The wisest aunt, telling the saddest 
		tale,

In the audience, Charlie leans over towards Keating.

				CHARLIE
				  (whispering)
		He's good. He's really good.

Keating gives a thumbs up.

				PUCK

		Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh 
		me; 
		Then slip I from her bum, down topples 
		she, 
		And "tailor" cries, and falls into a 
		cough; 
		And then the whole quire hold their hips 
		and laugh, 
		And waxen in their mirth and neeze and 
		swear 
		A merrier hour was never wasted there. 
		But, room, Fairy! here comes Oberon. 

				FAIRY

		And here my mistress. Would that he were 
		gone!

The two actors hide behind the trees, lifting their twig covered
hands to hide themselves.

INT. THEATER - NIGHT

Two other actors are onstage. 

				LYSANDER

		Then by your side no bed-room me deny; 
		For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie 

				HERMIA

		Lysander riddles very prettily: 
		Now much beshrew my manners and my 
		pride, 
		If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied. 
		But, gentle friend, for love and 
		courtesy 
		Lie further off; in human modesty, 
		Such separation as may well be said 
		Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid, 
		and, good night, sweet friend: 
		Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life 
		end!

Neil is watching the actors from the wing. He glances out at the audience
and sees his father enter the back of the theater. Neil backs away into
the shadows.

				LYSANDER

		Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;

The director breaks Neil out of his thoughts.

				DIRECTOR
		Neil. That's your cue, Neil. Come on, 
		Neil. Here's your crown. Let's go.

Neil reluctantly replaces his crown and follows her.

INT. THEATER - NIGHT

On stage, Neil collects dew in a leaf and holds it over his head while
fairies dance about. In the audience, Knox takes Chris' hand in his.

INT. THEATER - NIGHT

The stage is dark. A spotlight comes on to reveal Neil with his back to
the audience. He slowly turns around to face the audience and his father.

				PUCK

		If we shadows have offended,

Neil directs his eyes at his father, who stills stands at the back
of the theater.

				PUCK
		Think but this, and all is mended, 
		That you have but slumber'd here 
		While these visions did appear. 
		And this weak and idle theme, 
		No more yielding but a dream, 
		Gentles, do not reprehend: 
		If you pardon, we will mend: 
		And, as I am an honest Puck, 
		If we have unearned luck 
		Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue, 
		We will make amends ere long; 
		Else the Puck a liar call; 
		So, good night unto you all. 
		Give me your hands, if we be friends, 
		And Robin shall restore amends.

Neil backs away and the curtains close as the audience begins to
applaud enthusiastically. Behind the curtain numerous people
congratulate Neil as they line up for the curtain call. The curtains
open. Charlie and the other boys rise to their feet, followed quickly
by the rest of the audience. The actors bow to continued applause. The
actors push Neil forward and he takes a second bow.

				BOYS
		Yawp! 

				KNOX
		Yeah, Neil!

The curtain closes again and Neil turns around, letting out an
excited sigh. Various actors continue to congratulate him. Neil
lets out a yell as he walks offstage. In the audience, while others
are leaving, Mr. Perry approaches a woman.

				MR. PERRY
		Excuse me, I'm Neil's father. I need to 
		see him.

Backstage, the woman approaches Neil.

				WOMAN
		Neil, Your father. He's-

Neil nods in agreement.

				ACTOR
		What did you think?

				WOMAN
		Really I thought you were all just 
		wonderful!

Neil emerges from the curtains, carrying his costume. The theater is
nearly empty now, except for Mr. Perry standing at the back. Neil
smiles at him but the smile quickly disappears.

EXT. THEATER - NIGHT

Mr. Perry pushes his way through the crowd of people, with Neil close
behind.

				MR. PERRY
		Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

The boys notice Neil and try to dtop him to talk.

				CHARLIE
		Neil, Neil, you were great. 

				NEIL
		I can't, guys. 

				TODD
		Neil! Neil!

Outside of the crowd, Keating manages to catch up to Neil. He takes
hold of Neil's coat.

				KEATING
		Neil. Neil. You have the gift. What a 
		performance You left even me speechless. 
		You have to stay with-

Mr. Perry returns from his car and shoves Neil aside.

				MR. PERRY
		Get in the car. Keating, you stay away 
		from my son. 

				CHARLIE
		Neil! Neil! Mr. Perry, come on. 

				KEATING
		Don't make it any worse than it is.

Neil and Mr. Perry get into their car and drive away. Keating
stares after them.

				CHARLIE
		Is it okay if we walk back? Captain?

Charlie motions Todd to follow.

				CHARLIE
		Knox.

The boys leave and Keating continues to stare after the car, wiping
the falling snow from his face.

INT. MR. PERRY'S STUDY - NIGHT

A photo of Neil standing stiffly with his parents sits on a table
between a glass of alcohol and a half filled ashtray. Mrs. Perry
watches through the window as her husband and son arrive and then
takes a nervous puff on her cigarette before sitting down. Mr.
Perry walks in with Neil close behind him. Neil sits down beside the
desk while Mr. Perry remains standing.

				MR. PERRY
		We're trying very hard to understand why 
		it is that you insist on defying us. 
		Whatever the reason, we're not gonna let 
		you ruin your life. Tomorrow I'm 
		withdrawing you from Welton and 
		enrolling you in Braden Military School. 
		You're going to Harvard and you're gonna 
		be a doctor. 

				NEIL
		But that's ten more years. Father, 
		that's a lifetime! 

				MR. PERRY
		Oh, stop it. Don't be so dramatic. You 
		make it sound like a prison term. You 
		don't understand, Neil. You have 
		opportunities that I never even dreamt 
		of and I am not going to let you waste 
		them.

Neil rises to his feet.

				NEIL
		I've got to tell you what I feel.

Mrs. Perry stands up.

				MRS. PERRY
		We've been so worried about-- 

				MR. PERRY
		What? What? Tell me what you feel. What 
		is it?

Neil looks to his mother and then back to his father but says
nothing.

				MR. PERRY
		Is it more of this, this acting 
		business? Because you can forget that. 
		What? 

				NEIL
		Nothing.

Neil sits back down dejectedly.

				MR. PERRY
		Nothing? Well, then, let's go to bed.

Mr. Perry leaves. Mrs. Perry pauses on her way out and kneels
behind Neil.

				NEIL
		I was good. I was really good.

Mrs. Perry nods slightly.
				MRS. PERRY
		Go on, get some sleep.

INT. MR. PERRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mrs. Perry sits on the side of the bed with her back to her
husband. Mr. Perry removes his robe and slippers before
getting in to bed. Mrs. Perry begins to cry as he turns out
the light.

				MR. PERRY
		It's all right. It's going to be all 
		right.

INT. NEIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Neil's pyjamas, bathrobe, towel, and shaving kit are all neatly
laid out on his bed. Neil touches his pyjamas lightly and then
removes his coat and shirt. He walks over to the windows and
opens them, taking several deep breaths. He places the crown of
twigs on his head and then closes his eyes, slowly letting his head
fall to his chest.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

A door opens and Neil emerges, slowly walking down the stairs as if
in a trance.

INT. MR. PERRY'S STUDY - NIGHT

Neil holds a key in his hands. He unlocks a drawer in his father's
desk and pulls out a pistol, wrapped in cloth.

INT. MR. PERRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mr. Perry jerks up out of bed, startled and breathing fast.

				MR. PERRY
		What was that? 

				MRS. PERRY
		What? 

				MR. PERRY
		That sound. 

				MRS. PERRY
		What sound? Tom?

Mr. Perry turns on the light and gets up out of bed, putting on his
robe and slippers.
				MRS. PERRY
		What is it? What's wrong? 

Mr. Perry turns on the hallway light and knocks on Neil's door. He opens
the door and goes inside.

				MR. PERRY
		Neil.

Mr. Perry notices the open window.

				MRS. PERRY
		Tom, what is it? What's wrong? Neil?

Mr. Perry continues to look through the house, continuing downstairs.

				MR. PERRY
		Neil?

Mr. Perry notices the door to his study is ajar.

				MRS. PERRY
		I'll look outside. Neil?

Mr. Perry flicks the light on but sees nothing. Then he smells
something. Looking closer, he sees a thin cloud of smoke rising from
behind his desk. As he moves around the desk he sees his gun on the
floor and Neil's outstretched hand.

				MR. PERRY
		No!

Mr. Perry crouches down by his son.

				MR. PERRY
		Oh, Neil! Oh, my God!

Mrs. Perry enters the room and sees her son.

				MRS. PERRY
		Oh! No! 

				MR. PERRY
		Oh, my son! 

				MRS. PERRY
		He's all right. 

				MR. PERRY
		My son! My poor son! 

				MRS. PERRY
			    (crying hysterically)
		He's all right! He's all right! He's all 
		right! He's all right! He's all right! 
		He's all right! 

				MR. PERRY
		Stop it! Stop it! Stop it.

Mr. Perry holds his wife and tries to comfort her.

INT. TODD'S ROOM - NIGHT

Todd is sleeping. Charlie reaches across to wake him. Tears are
running down his face.

				CHARLIE
		Todd? Todd.

Todd, still half asleep, tries to shrug him off.

				TODD
		Oh, Charlie.

Todd opens his eyes and sees Charlie's face

				TODD
		What is it?

Todd looks over to see Pitts, Meeks, and Knox by the door.

				CHARLIE
		Neil's dead.

EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

It is a snowy, overcast morning. Todd walks through the snow. He
has his coat on over his pyjamas. The other boys follow closely
behind him as he walks down towards the water. He stops and stares
out at the snow-covered surroundings.

				TODD
		It's so beautiful.

Todd begins to gag and then goes down on his knees, vomiting into
the snow. The other boys huddle around him, hugging him.

				CHARLIE
		Todd. It's okay, Todd. 

				PITTS
		Calm down. 

				CHARLIE
		It's all right, Todd. 

				PITTS
		Todd, it's okay. It's okay, Todd. 

				CHARLIE
		It's all right. It's alright.

Charlie grabs a handful of snow and wipes Todd's mouth with it. 

				TODD
		He wouldn't-- He wouldn't have done it. 

				MEEKS
		You can't explain it, Todd. 

				TODD
		It was his father! 

				CHARLIE
		No! 

				TODD
		He wouldn't have left us. It's because he-
		He wouldn't have. His dad was-- his, his 
		father did it. 

				CHARLIE
		Todd. 

				TODD
		His father killed him. He made him do it.

				MEEKS
		You can't explain it, Todd.

Todd pushes himself away from the boys and stumbles down the hill,
slipping and falling in the snow.

				MEEKS
		Todd! 

				CHARLIE
		Leave him be.

The boys watch as Todd runs down towards the dock by the river,
yelling and crying. He finally seems to regain control of himself
and walks in silence out onto the dock.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Keating sits by himself at his desk. After a moment he gets up
and walks over to Neil's desk. Opening it, he finds his copy
of "Five Centuries of Verse" and flips through the first few pages.
Sitting down at the desk, he returns to the opening page, reading
the opening verse written there. Keating begins to sob, then closes
the book.

INT. ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY

A church service is going on. The boys have joined in the other
students in a hymn. Charlie is the only one not singing. He stares
off into nothingness.

				BOYS
				 (singing)
		All my life 
		Thy light shall surely follow me 
		And in God's house forevermore 
		My dwelling place shall be 
		Amen.

Mr. Nolan stands at the pulpit, with the rest of the professors
seated behind him.

				MR. NOLAN
		The death of Neil Perry is a tragedy. He 
		was a fine student. One of Welton's 
		best. And he will be missed. We've 
		contacted each of your parents to 
		explain the situation. Naturally, 
		they're all quite concerned. At the 
		request of Neil's family, I intend to 
		conduct a thorough inquiry into this 
		matter. Your complete cooperation is 
		expected.

INT. CLOAKROOM - DAY

The boys (except Cameron) are sitting about the cluttered room
waiting. Charlie lights a cigarette.

				CHARLIE
		You told him about this meeting? 

				PITTS
		Twice. 

				CHARLIE
		That's it, guys. We're all fried. 

				PITTS
		How do you mean? 

				CHARLIE
		Cameron's a fink. He's in Nolan's office 
		right now, finking. 

				PITTS
		About what? 

				CHARLIE
		The club, Pittsie. Think about it. The 
		board of directors, the trustees and Mr. 
		Nolan. Do you think for one moment 
		they're gonna let this thing just blow 
		over? Schools go down because of things 
		like this. They need a scapegoat.

The door opens. All the boys except Charlie hurry to put
their cigarettes out and wave the smoke away. A light comes on
and Cameron enters.

				CAMERON
		What's going on, guys? 

				CHARLIE
		You finked, didn't you, Cameron?

Charlie gets up and approaches Cameron, tossing his cigarette away.

				CAMERON
		Finked? I didn't know what the hell 
		you're talking about. 

				CHARLIE
		You told Nolan everything about the club 
		is what I'm talking about. 

				CAMERON
		Look, in case you hadn't heard, Dalton, 
		there's something called an honor code 
		at this school, all right? If a teacher 
		asks you a question, you tell the truth 
		or you're expelled. 

				CHARLIE
		You little-

Charlie lunges at Cameron but Knox and Meeks hold him back.

				MEEKS
		Charlie! 

				CHARLIE
		He's a rat! He's in it up to his eyes, 
		so he rattled to save himself. 

				KNOX
		Don't touch him, Charlie. You do and 
		you're out. 

				CHARLIE
		I'm out anyway! 

				KNOX
		You don't know that, not yet. 

				CAMERON
		He's right there, Charlie. And if you 
		guys are smart, you will do exactly what 
		I did and cooperate. They're not after 
		us. We're the victims. Us and Neil. 

				CHARLIE
		What's that mean? Who are they after? 

				CAMERON
		Why, Mr. Keating, of course. The 
		"Captain" himself. I mean, you guys 
		didn't really think he could avoid 
		responsibility, did you? 

				CHARLIE
		Mr. Keating responsible for Neil? Is 
		that what they're saying? 

				CAMERON
		Well, who else do you think, dumb ass? 
		The administration? Mr. Perry? Mr. 
		Keating put us up to all this crap, 
		didn't he? If he wasn't for Mr. Keating, 
		Neil would be cozied up in his room 
		right now, studying his chemistry and 
		dreaming of being called doctor. 

				TODD
		That is not true, Cameron. You know 
		that. He didn't put us to anything. Neil 
		loved acting. 

				CAMERON
		Believe what you want, but I say let 
		Keating fry. I mean, why ruin our lives?

Charlie lunges at Cameron again and punches him in the face.
Cameron falls to the floor as the boys pull Charlie away. Cameron
lifts a hand to his bloody nose.

				CAMERON
		You just signed your expulsion papers, 
		Nuwanda.

Cameron rises to his feet.

				CAMERON
		And if the rest of you are smart, you'll 
		do exactly what I did. They know 
		everything anyway. You can't save 
		Keating, but you can save yourselves.

Cameron walks away, closing the door behind him.

INT. TODD'S ROOM - DAY

Todd looks out the window and watches as Hager escorts Meeks back
to the dorm. Inside the room, Neil's bed has been stripped of all
its bedding.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Meeks walks slowly to his room. Hager remains standing at the end of
the hallway.

				HAGER
		Knox Overstreet.

Knox emerges from his room and goes to joing Hager. He gives a thumbs
up to Todd as he passes his door. Once he leaves with Hager, Todd goes
over to Meeks' door.

				TODD
		Meeks? 

				MEEKS
		Go away. I have to study. 

				TODD
		What happened to Nuwanda? 

				MEEKS
		Expelled. 

				TODD
		What'd you tell 'em? 

				MEEKS
		Nothing they didn't already know. 

				HAGER (O.S.)
		Todd Anderson.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Todd is lead up the steps to Mr. Nolan's office by Hager.

INT. NOLAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Todd enters the room to see his mother and father seated opposite
Mr. Nolan's desk.

				MR. ANDERSON
		Hello, son. 

				MRS. ANDERSON
		Hello, darling. 

				TODD
		Mom.

THe door closes behind Todd. He remains standing, not knowing
what to do.

				MR. NOLAN
		Have a seat, Mr. Anderson.

Todd sits down next to his parents.

				MR. NOLAN
		Mr. Anderson, I think we've pretty well 
		put together what's happened here. You 
		do admit to being a part of this Dead 
		Poets Society?

Todd says nothing.

				MR. ANDERSON
		Answer him, Todd. 

				TODD
		Yes, sir.

Mr. Nolan puts his glasses on and glances at a paper before him
before removing his glasses once more.

				MR. NOLAN
		I have here a detailed description of 
		what occurred at your meetings. It 
		describes how your teacher, Mr. Keating, 
		encouraged you boys to organize this 
		club and to use it as a source of 
		inspiration for reckless and self-
		indulgent behavior. It describes how Mr. 
		Keating, both in and out of the 
		classroom, encouraged Neil Perry to 
		follow his obsession with acting when he 
		knew all along it was against the 
		explicit order of Neil's parents. It was 
		Mr. Keating's blatant abuse of his 
		position as teacher that led directly to 
		Neil Perry's death. 

Mr. Nolan motions to Todd's father, who passes along a sheet of
paper to Todd.

				MR. NOLAN
		Read that document carefully, Todd. Very 
		carefully.

Todd looks at the paper, which already contains the signatures of
the other four boys.

				MR. NOLAN
		If you've nothing to add or amend, sign 
		it. 

				TODD
		What's gonna happen to Mr. Keating? 

				MR. ANDERSON
		I've had enough. Sign the paper, Todd.

Mr. Nolan holds out a pen for Todd to take.

EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

Mr. McAllister leads his students, textbooks in hand, through the
snow outside the classrooms.

				McALLISTER
		Grass is gramen or herba. Lapis is 
		stone. The entire building is 
		aedificium.

Keating looks out from his office window. McAllister pauses and looks
up at Keating, giving him a brief wave. Keating waves back.

INT. KEATING'S OFFICE - DAY

Keating laughs slightly as he watches McAllister from the window.
Inside, all his belongings have been packed up.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

The students are all seated at their desks in silence. Everyone looks
as the door opens. They quickly stand as Mr. Nolan enters the room.

				MR. NOLAN
		Sit.

The students sit once again as Mr. Nolan walks to the front of the room.

				MR. NOLAN
		I'll be teaching this class through 
		exams. We'll find a permanent English 
		teacher during the break. Who will tell 
		me where you are in the Pritchard 
		textbook? 

				MR. NOLAN
		Mr. Anderson?

				TODD
		Uh, in the, in the Pr- 

				MR. NOLAN
		I can't hear you, Mr. Anderson. 

				TODD
		In the, in the, in the Pritchard? 

				MR. NOLAN
		Kindly inform me, Mr. Cameron. 

				CAMERON
		We skipped around a lot, sir. We covered 
		the Romantics and some of the chapters 
		on Post Civil War literature. 

				MR. NOLAN
		What about the Realists? 

				CAMERON
		I believe we skipped most of that, sir. 

				MR. NOLAN
		All right, then, we'll start over. What 
		is poetry?

There is a knock at the classroom door.

				MR. NOLAN
		Come.

The students look back as the door opens. They quickly turn
away when hey see it is Keating.

				KEATING
		Excuse me. I came for my personals. 
		Should I come back after class? 

				MR. NOLAN
		Get them now, Mr. Keating. 

				MR. NOLAN
		Gentlemen, turn to page 21 of the 
		introduction. Mr. Cameron, read aloud 
		the excellent essay by Dr. Pritchard on 
		"Understanding Poetry."

Todd slowly closes his book. Keating opens the door to the tiny
room off the classroom.

				CAMERON
		That page has been ripped out, sir. 

				MR. NOLAN
		Well, borrow somebody else's book. 

				CAMERON
		They're all ripped out, sir. 

				MR. NOLAN
		What do you mean, they're all ripped 
		out? 

				CAMERON
		Sir, we, uh- 

				MR. NOLAN
		Never mind.

Mr. Nolan takes his own book over to Cameron's desk and then
slaps the open page.

				MR. NOLAN
		Read!

As Cameron begins to read, Keating looks out at Todd as he puts
his scarf on. Todd looks at him for a moment and then glances away.

				CAMERON
		"Understanding Poetry by Dr. J Evans 
		Pritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand 
		poetry, we must first be fluent with its 
		meter, rhyme and figures of speech, then 
		ask two questions: 1) How artfully has 
		the objective of the poem been rendered 
		and 2)..."

The door squeaks as Keating shuts it behind him. Cameron pauses. 

				CAMERON
		"... How important is that objective? 
		Question 1 rates the poem's perfection; 
		question 2 rates its importance. And 
		once these questions have been answered, 
		determining the poem's greatness becomes 
		a relatively simple matter. If the 
		poem's score for perfection is plotted 
		on the horizontal of a graph--"

Keating passes by Todd and the others and gets to the back of the
classroom before Todd leaps up from his seat and turns to face him.

				TODD
		Mr. Keating! They made everybody sign 
		it. 

Mr. Nolan gets up from his desk and approaches Todd.

				MR. NOLAN
		Quiet, Mr. Anderson. 

				TODD
		You gotta believe me. It's true. 

				KEATING
		I do believe you, Todd. 

				MR. NOLAN
		Leave, Mr. Keating. 

				TODD
		But it wasn't his fault! 

				MR. NOLAN
		Sit down, Mr. Anderson!

Todd reluctantly returns to his seat.

				MR. NOLAN
		One more outburst from you or anyone
		else, and you're out of this school!
		Leave, Mr. Keating.

Keating hesitates at the back of the classroom.

				MR. NOLAN
		I said leave, Mr. Keating.

Keating slowly turns and heads to the door. As he opens
it, Todd, stands upon his desk and turns to Keating.

				TODD
		O Captain! My Captain! 

				MR. NOLAN
		Sit down, Mr. Anderson!

Keating pauses at the door and looks back at Todd on his desk.

				MR. NOLAN
		Do you hear me? Sit down! Sit down! This 
		is your final warning, Anderson. How 
		dare you? Do you hear me?

After a moment of indecision, Knox climbs up onto his desk.

				KNOX
		O Captain! My Captain! 

				MR. NOLAN
		Mr. Overstreet, I warn you! Sit down!

Pitts climbs up onto his desk, followed by several others,
including Meeks.

				MR. NOLAN
		Sit down! Sit down. All of you. I want 
		you seated. Sit down. Leave, Mr. 
		Keating.

More students stand on their desks until half the class is standing.

				MR. NOLAN
		All of you, down. I want you seated. Do 
		you hear me? 

				MR. NOLAN
		Sit down! 

Keating stands in the doorway, staring up at the boys in wonder. A
smile comes to his face.

				KEATING
		Thank you, boys. Thank you.
INT. WELTON ACADEMY HALLWAY - DAY

A young boy, dressed in a school uniform and cap, fidgets as his mother
adjusts his tie.

				MOTHER
		Now remember, keep your shoulders back.

A student opens up a case and removes a set of bagpipes. The young
boy and his brother line up for a photograph

				PHOTOGRAPHER
		Okay, put your arm around your brother.
		That's it. And breathe in.

The young boy blinks as the flash goes off.

				PHOTOGRAPHR
		Okay, one more.

An old man lights a single candle. A teacher goes over the old
man's duties.

				TEACHER
		Now just to review, you're going to
		follow along the procession until you
		get to the headmaster. At that point
		he will indicate to you to light the
		candles of the boys.

				MAN
		All right boys, let's settle down.

The various boys, including NEIL, KNOX, and CAMERON, line up holding
banners. Ahead of them is the old man, followed by the boy with the
bagpipes with the two youngest boys at the front.

				MAN
		Banners up.

The boys hoist the banners and the bagpipes begin to play loudly. The
small group marches out of the room and down a set of stairs into a
church. The pews are filled with students and parents while the
teachers, all dressed in robes, are seated at the front of the church
behind the headmaster.

The boys break off to either side at the front of the church. The
bagpipes cease and the headmaster, MR. NOLAN, walks over to the old
man carrying the candle.

				MR NOLAN
		Ladies and gentlemen, boys, the light
		of knowledge.

An organ begins to play as the old man goes forward with shaking hands
to the young boys in the front pew. Each boy is holding a candle and
he bends over to light the first one. Each boy in turn lights the
candle of the boy next to him.

				MR NOLAN
		One hundred years ago, in 1859, 41 boys sat in this
		room and were asked the same question that greets
		you at the start of each semester. Gentlemen, what
		are the four pillars?

All throughout the pews, uniformed boys rise to their feet. TODD, who
is not wearing a uniform, is urged by his father to stand with them.

				BOYS
		Tradition, honor, discipline, excellence.

The boys quickly return to their seats.

				MR NOLAN
		In her first year, Welton Academy graduated five
		students. Last year we graduated fifty-one. And
		more than seventy-five percent of those went on to
		the Ivy League. This, this kind of accomplishment is
		the result of fervent dedication to the principles taught
		here. This is why you parents have been sending us
		your sons. This is why we are the best preparatory
		school in the United States.

Mr. Nolan soaks up the applause from the audience.

				MR NOLAN
		As you know, our beloved Mr. Portius of the English
		department retired last term. You will have the
		opportunity later to meet his replacement, Mr. John
		Keating, himself a graduate of this school. And who,
		for the past several years, has been teaching at the
		highly regarded Chester School in London.

The crowd applauds once again.

EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY

The school lawn is a filled with luggage, students, and parents mulling
about in every direction.

INT CHURCH ENTRANCE - DAY

Mr Nolan stands by the entrance, speaking with each family as they leave.

				MR NOLAN
		Glad you could come by.

				MR ANDERSON
		Thrilling ceremony as usual Dr. Nolan.

				MR NOLAN
		You've been away too long.

				MRS ANDERSON
		Hello Dr. Nolan.

				MR NOLAN
		Good to have you back.

				MRS ANDERSON
		This is our youngest, Todd.

				MR NOLAN
		Mr. Anderson.You have some big shoes to fill,
		young man. Your brother was one of our finest.

				TODD
		Thank you.

Todd and his parents leave while others file past Mr. Nolan.

				WOMAN
		Lovely ceremony.

				MR NOLAN
		Thank you. So glad you liked it.

MR PERRY approaches with his son Neil. He shakes Mr. Nolan's hand.

				MR PERRY
		Gale

				MR NOLAN
		Tom

				MR PERRY
		Good to see you again.

				NEIL
		Hello Mr. Nolan.

				MR NOLAN
		Neil. We expect great things from you this year.

				NEIL
		Thank you, sir.

				MR PERRY
		Well he won't disappoint us. Right Neil?

				NEIL
		I'll do my best sir.

EXT SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY

A bell tolls. Parents begin wishing their boys farewell.

				FATHER
		Hey, come on son.

				MOTHER
		Chin up.

				FATHER
		No tears now.

				BOY
		Okay.

				MOTHER
		Chin up.

Another boy hugs his mother.

				BOY
		I don't want to go here.

				MOTHER
		You be a good boy and do your lessons.

EXT SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY

Neil emerges from a building and sees Todd.

				NEIL
		Hey, I hear we're gonna be roommates.

He shakes Todd's hand.

				NEIL
		I'm Neil Perry.

				TODD
		Todd Anderson.

				NEIL
		Why'd you leave Balincrest?

				TODD
		My brother went here.

				NEIL
		Oh, so you're that Anderson.

INT DORMATORY - DAY

DR. HAGER is standing in his room doorway while SPAZ and his father are
going over some last minute precautions over the boy's allergies. Spaz's
father hands Hager various bottles.

				FATHER
		This is for sinuses. Oh, and if he can't swallow you
		give him one of these. And if he had trouble breathing
		you can give him some of those.

				HAGER
		All right fine.

Dr. Hager takes the bottles and quickly backs into his room, shutting
the door.

				FATHER
			    (to son)
		Did you remember your vaporizer?

				SPAZ
		Yes, I put it in my room.

Spaz's father tries to say something else to Dr. Hager but realizes he
has already gone.

INT HALLWAY - DAY

Neil pushes his way through a crowd of boys, carrying two suitcases. As
he enters his room, Knox quickly passes by.

				KNOX
		Hey, how's it going Neil?

				NEIL
		Hey Knox.

Cameron comes by and leans against the doorway.

				CAMERON
		Neil, study group tonight?

				NEIL
		Yeah, sure.

				CAMERON
		Business as usual, huh? Hey, I hear you got the new
		kid. Looks like a stiff!

He begins laughing when he notices Todd coming into the room.

				CAMERON
		Oops!

Cameron quickly leaves. Neil tries to keep from laughing as Todd enters
the room and sets his luggage down on his bed.

				NEIL
		Listen, don't mind Cameron. He was born with his
		foot in his mouth. You know what I mean?

He pulls some papers from his blazer pocket and playfully whacks Todd 
across the back with it.

CHARLIE comes to the door with a smug expression on his face. Knox and
MEEKS are close behind him. He points at Neil

				CHARLIE
		Rumor has it, you did summer school.

				NEIL
		Yep. Chemistry. My father thought I should get ahead.
		How was your summer Slick?

				CHARLIE
		Keen.

The boys enter the room. Charlie turns around and looks at Meeks who is
just entering. 

				CHARLIE
		Meeks. Door. Closed.

				MEEKS
		Yes sir.

				NEIL
		Gentlemen, what are the four pillars?

				BOYS
		Travesty. Horror. Decadence. Excrement.

Charlie makes himself comfortable on Neil's bed and lights up a cigarette.
Meanwhile, Todd is by his bed unpacking his luggage.

				CHARLIE
		Okay, study group. Meeks aced Latin. I didn't quite
		flunk English. So, if you want, we've got our study
		group.

				NEIL
		Sure. Cameron asked me too. Anyone mind
		including him?

				CHARLIE
		Hmm, what's his specialty, boot-licking?

				NEIL
		Come on, he's your roommate.

				CHARLIE
		That's not my fault.

Meeks seems to notice Todd for the first time.

				MEEKS
		Oh, I'm sorry, my name is Steven Meeks.

Neil quickly gets up from his spot by the window.

				NEIL
		Oh, this is Todd Anderson.

Todd turns around and shakes hands with Meeks.

				MEEKS
		Nice to meet you.

				TODD
		Nice to meet you.

				CHARLIE
		Charlie Dalton.

Charlie continues to lay on the bed, looking smug. Knox extends a hand.

				KNOX
		Knox Overstreet.

				NEIL
		Todd's brother was Jeffrey Anderson.

				CHARLIE
		Oh yeah, sure. Valedictorian. National merit scholar. 

				MEEKS
		Oh well, welcome to Hell-ton.

				CHARLIE
		It's every bit as tough as they say, unless you're a
		genius like Meeks.

				MEEKS
		He flatters me. That's why I help him with Latin.

				CHARLIE
		And English, and Trig.

Charlie begins coughing. There is a knock at the door. Charlie quickly
stamps out his cigarette on the floor and Neil tries to wave the smoke
from the air.

				NEIL
		It's open.

The door opens and Mr. Perry walks into the room. Neil quickly rises from
the window.

				NEIL
		Father, I thought you'd gone.

The other boys stand up when he enters.

				BOYS
		Mr. Perry.

				MR PERRY
		Keep your seats fellows, keep your seats. Neil, I've
		just spoken to Mr. Nolan. I think that you're taking
		too many extra curricular activities this semester, and
		I've decided that you should drop the school annual.

				NEIL
		But I'm the assistant editor this year.

				MR PERRY
		Well I'm sorry Neil.

				NEIL
		But Father, I can't. It wouldn't be fair.

				MR PERRY
		Fellas, would you excuse us for a moment?

Mr. Perry walks towards the door and Neil hesitantly follows. Mr. Perry
pauses by the door and smiles to the other boys.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

The smile has gone from Mr. Perry's face. He grabs a hold of Neil's arm.

				MR PERRY
		Don't you ever dispute me in public. Do you
		understand?

				NEIL
		Father, I wasn't disputing-

				MR PERRY
After you've finished medical school and you're on your own, then you
can do as you damn well please. But until then, you do as I tell you.
Is that clear?

				NEIL
		Yes sir. I'm sorry.

				MR PERRY
		You know how much this means to your mother,
		don't you?

				NEIL
		Yes sir. You know me, always taking on too much.

				MR PERRY
		Well, that's my boy. Now listen, you need anything,
		you let us know, huh?

				NEIL
		Yes sir.

Mr. Perry slaps his son on the shoulder and leaves. Neil leans his head
back against the wall as the other boys emerge from the room.

				CHARLIE
		Why doesn't he let you do what you want?

				KNOX
		Yeah Neil, tell him off. It couldn't get any worse.

				NEIL
		Oh, that's rich. Like you guys tell your parents off, Mr.
		Future Lawyer and Mr. Future Banker.

				CHARLIE
		Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.

				NEIL
		Well just don't tell me how to talk to my father. You
		guys are the same way.

				KNOX
		All right, all right, Jesus. So what are you going to do?

				NEIL
		What I have to do. Drop the annual.

				CHARLIE
		Well I wouldn't lose much sleep over it. It's just a
		bunch of jerks trying to impress Nolan.

				NEIL
		I don't care. I don't give a damn about any of it.

				MEEKS
		Well, uh, Latin, eight o' clock in my room?

				NEIL
		Yes.

				MEEKS
		Todd, you're welcome to join us.

				KNOX
		Yeah, come along pal.

Todd looks up from his desk where he is setting his alarm clock.

				TODD
		Thanks.

EXT. FIELDS - DAY

A clock bell chimes five o'clock. Enormous flocks of birds, apparently
disturbed by the noise, take to the sky.

INT. STAIRCASE - DAY

The sound of squawking birds merges into the sound of noisy boys as they
descend the stairs in a long spiralling line.

MR. MCALLISTER tries to make it upstairs against the steady stream.

				MCALLISTER
		Slow down boys, slow down you horrible
		phalanx of pubescense.

INT CHEMISTRY LAB - DAY

A teacher walks up and down the aisles, handing out books.

				TEACHER
		Pick three laboratory experiments from
		the project list and report on them every
		five weeks. The first twenty questions at
		the end of chapter one are due tomorrow.

The students let out a collective groan.

INT. LATIN CLASSROOM - DAY

Mr. McAllister paces back and forth in front of the blackboard and gets
the students to repeat everything he says.

				MCALLISTER
			    (students repeat after each word.)
		Agricolam. Agricola. Agricolae.
		Agricolarum. Agricolis. Agricolas.
		Agrilcolis.

		Again, please.
		Agricola.

INT. MATH CLASSROOM - DAY

Dr. Hager walks up the classroom aisles with his arms behind his back.

				HAGER
		Your study of trigonometry requires absolute precision.
		Anyone failing to turn in any homework assignment will
		be penalized one point off their final grade. Let me urge
		you now not to test me on this point.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Students enter Keating's classroom, talking and acting up. Keating
glances out from his room off to one side.

				KNOX
		Hey Spaz, Spaz.

Spaz turns around in time to be hit by a ball of crumpled up paper
while Cameron smacks him on the shoulder.

				CAMERON
		Brain damage.

The students quickly quiet down as Keating emerges from the other room,
whistling the 1812 Overture. He walks up the length of the classroom and
out the door without a word. The students look around at one another,
uncertain of what to do. Keating pokes his head back in the doorway.

				KEATING
		Well come on.

He gestures them to follow and the students, after some hesitation, grab
their books and follow Keating out into the main entranceway. 

INT. ENTRANCEWAY - DAY

Keating stands before the school's trophy cabinets and waits until all
the boys arrive.

				KEATING
		"Oh Captain, My Captain" who knows where
		that comes from?

Todd looks up as if he knows the answer, but says nothing. Spaz blows his
nose a little too close to Meeks for his liking.

				KEATING
		Not a clue? It's from a poem by Walt
		Whitman about Mr. Abraham Lincoln. Now in
		this class you can call me Mr. Keating. Or,
		if you're slightly more daring, Oh Captain,
		My Captain.

The students laugh slightly.

				KEATING
		Now let me dispel a few rumors so they
		don't fester into facts. Yes, I too
		attended Hell-ton and survived. And no,
		at that time I was not the mental giant
		you see before you. I was the intellectual
		equivalent of a ninety-eight pound
		weakling. I would go to the beach and
		people would kick copies of Byron in my
		face.

The boys laugh once again, while Cameron, obviously trying to write all
this down, looks around confusedly. Keating looks down at papers in his
hand.

				KEATING
		Now, Mr Pitts. That's a rather
		unfortunate name. Mr. Pitts, where are
		you?

Pitts raises his hand while everyone around him snickers.

				KEATING
Mr. Pitts, would you open your hymnal to page 542 and read the first
stanza of the poem you find there?

				PITTS
		"To the virgins, to make much of time"?

				KEATING
		Yes, that's the one. Somewhat appropriate,
		isn't it.

				PITTS
		"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old
		time is still a flying, and this same
		flower that smiles today, tomorrow will
		be dying."

				KEATING
		Thank you Mr. Pitts. "Gather ye rosebuds
		while ye may." The Latin term for that
		sentiment is Carpe Diem. Now who knows
		what that means?

Meeks immediately puts his hand up.

				MEEKS
		Carpe Diem. That's "seize the day."

				KEATING
		Very good, Mr.-

				MEEKS
		Meeks.

				KEATING
		Meeks. Another unusual name. Seize the
		day. Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.
		Why does the writer use these lines?

				CHARLIE
		Because he's in a hurry.

				KEATING
		No, ding!

Keating slams his hand down on an imaginary buzzer.

				KEATING
		Thank you for playing anyway. Because we
		are food for worms lads. Because, believe
		it or not, each and every one of us in
		this room is one day going to stop
		breathing, turn cold, and die. 

Keating turns towards the trophy cases, filled with trophies, footballs,
and team pictures.

				KEATING
		Now I would like you to step forward over
		here and peruse some of the faces from
		the past. You've walked past them many
		times. I don't think you've really looked
		at them.

The students slowly gather round the cases and Keating moves behind them.

				KEATING
		They're not that different from you, are
		they? Same haircuts. Full of hormones,
		just like you. Invincible, just like you
		feel. The world is their oyster. They
		believe they're destined for great things,
		just like many of you. Their eyes are full
		of hope, just like you. Did they wait until
		it was too late to make from their lives
		even one iota of what they were capable?
		Because you see gentlmen, these boys are
		now fertilizing daffodils. But if you listen
		real close, you can hear them whisper their
		legacy to you. Go on, lean in.

The boys lean in and Keating hovers over Cameron's shoulder.

				KEATING
			    (whispering in a gruff voice)
		Carpe.

Cameron looks over his shoulder with an aggravated expression on his face. 

				KEATING
		Hear it?
			    (whispering again)
		Carpe. Carpe Diem. Seize the day boys,
		make your lives extraordinary.

The boys stare at the faces in the cabinet in silence.

EXT. SCHOOL STEPS - DAY

The boys emerge from the school, loaded down with numerous books.

				PITTS
		That was weird.

				NEIL
		But different.

				KNOX
		Spooky if you ask me.

				CAMERON
		Think he'll test us on that stuff?

				CHARLIE
		Come on Cameron, don't you get anything?

				CAMERON
		What? What?

INT. LOCKER ROOM - EVENING

A coach sticks his head around the corner into the room.

				COACH
		Let's go boys, hustle up in here. That
		means you Dalton.

Meeks emerges from the showers, drying himself off.

				MEEKS
		Okay, who's up for a trig study group
		tonight guys?

				PITTS
		Me.

				NEIL
		Me.

				CHARLIE
			(still annoyed by what the coach said)
		What?

				KNOX
		I can't make it guys. I have to have
		dinner at the Danburry's house.

				PITTS
		The Danburry's? Who are the Danburry's?

				CAMERON
		Big alumns. How'd you swing that?

				KNOX
		Friends of my Dad's. They're probably in
		their nineties or something.

				CHARLIE
		Ooh!

				NEIL
		Anything's better than Hell-ton hash.

				CHARLIE
		I'll second that.

				KNOX
		Yeah we'll see.

Neil approaches Todd, who's been sitting by the window staring down at the
floor. Neil snaps his fingers to get Todd's attention. 

				NEIL
		Hey, you coming to the study group tonight?

				TODD
		Uh, no, no I, uh, I've got some history I
		wanna do.

				NEIL
		Suit yourself.

INT. TODD'S ROOM - EVENING

Todd is seated at his desk. He scrawls "CARPE DIEM" across a blank page
of his notebook. He looks at it for a few moments before crumpling it up
and opening up his Chemistry book.

INT. ENTRANCEWAY - NIGHT

Hager comes down the stairs. Knox is looking at one of the old class photos
on the walls.

				HAGER
		Ready Overstreet?

Knox reluctantly follows after Dr. Hager.

				KNOX
		Ready to go sir.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

The car leaves Welton and drives towards the Danburry's house.

INT / EXT DANBURRY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The doorbell rings.

				MRS DANBURRY (O.S.)
		Chet, can you get that?

				CHET (O.S.)
		I can't, Mom.

				CHRIS (O.S.)
		I'll get it.

The door opens and Knox is awe-struck by the beautiful girl (CHRIS) who
has answered the door.

				CHRIS
		Can I help you?

Knox manages to break out of his daze.

				KNOX
		Hi. Knox Overstreet. Uh, Dr. Hager.

				CHRIS
		Hi.

				KNOX
		This is the Danburry's, right?

				CHRIS
		Are you here to see Chet?

				KNOX
		Mrs. Danburry?

Chris begins to laugh as Mrs. Danburry arrives behind her.

				CHRIS
		No.

				MRS DANBURRY
		Sorry. Thank you Chris. I'm Mrs. Danburry.
		You must be Knox.

				KNOX
		Yes.

				MRS DANBURRY
			    (to Dr. Hager)
		Back by nine.
			    (to Knox)
		Please come in.

				CHET (O.S.)
		Chris, come on, what are you doing?

				CHRIS
		Chet, I'm coming.

Knox enters the house, his mind still hung up on Chris as MR DANBURRY
comes out of the living room to meet him.

				MR DANBURRY
		Knox. How are you? Joe Danburry.

				KNOX
		Nice to meet you sir.

				MR DANBURRY
		Well he's the spitting image of his father,
		isn't he. How is he? Come on in.

				CHET (O.S.)
		Chris!

				KNOX
		He's great. He just did a big case for GM.

				CHRIS (O.S.)
		I'm coming.

				MR DANBURRY
		I know where you're headed, like father
		like son, huh?

INT. STUDENT LOUNGE - NIGHT

Several students are throwing darts at a small rubber skeleton hanging
from the bulletin board. Various students are studying and playing games.
Meeks and Pitts are sitting at one table working on their "hi-fi system".
Meeks is waving an antenna around with no luck. Pitts points out to him
that he forgot to plug it in. Neil, Cameron, and Charlie are working on
their trig homework.

				CAMERON
		Just replace these numbers here with "x",
		for "x" and "y".

				NEIL
		Of course.

				CAMERON
		Of course, so what's the problem?

Charlie enters the room and closes the door behind him, leaning up
against it heavily.

				CHARLIE
		How was dinner?

				KNOX
		Huh?

				CHARLIE
		How was dinner?

				KNOX
		Terrible. Awful.

He leaves the door and sits down with the other boys.

				CHARLIE
		Why? What happened?

				KNOX
		Tonight, I met the most beautiful girl
		in my entire life.

				NEIL
		Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?

				KNOX
		She's practically engaged. To Chet Danburry.

				CHARLIE
		That guy could eat a football.

				PITTS
		That's too bad.

				KNOX
		Too bad? It's worse than too bad Pitsie,
		it's a tragedy. A girl this beautiful in
		love with such a jerk.

				PITTS
		All the good ones go for jerks, you
		know that.

				CAMERON
		Ahh, forget her. Open your trig book and
		try and figure out problem five.

				KNOX
		I can't just forget her Cameron. And I
		can't think about trig.

The radio Meeks and Pitts were working on begins letting out a high
pitched hum.

				PITTS
		We got it.

				MEEKS
		Holy cow.

Mr. Hager walks into the room.

				HAGER
		All right gentlemen, five minutes. Let's
		go.

The students quickly pack up their gear and prepare to leave. Pitts tries
to hide the radio in his lap. Charlie leans in close to Knox.

				CHARLIE
		Did you see her naked?

				KNOX
		Very funny Dalton.

				HAGER
		That wouldn't be a radio in your lap,
		would it Mr. Pitts?

				PITTS
		No sir. Science experiment, radar.

Meeks holds up the antenna as if demonstrating it.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Keating sits at his desk at the front of the classroom and opens up one
of his books.

				KEATING
		Gentlemen, open your text to page
		twenty-one of the introduction. Mr.
		Perry, will you read the opening
		paragraph of the preface, entitled
		"Understanding Poetry"?

				NEIL
		Understanding Poetry, by Dr. J. Evans
		Pritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand
		poetry, we must first be fluent with
		its meter, rhyme, and figures of speech.
		Then ask two questions: One, how artfully
		has the objective of the poem been
		rendered, and two, how important is that
		objective. Question one rates the poem's
		perfection, question two rates its
		importance. And once these questions have
		been answered, determining a poem's
		greatest becomes a relatively simple
		matter.

Keating gets up from his desk and prepares to draw on the chalk board.

				NEIL
		If the poem's score for perfection is
		plotted along the horizontal of a graph,
		and its importance is plotted on the
		vertical, then calculating the total
		area of the poem yields the measure of
		its greatness.

Keating draws a corresponding graph on the board and the students
dutifully copy it down.

				NEIL
		A sonnet by Byron may score high on the
		vertical, but only average on the
		horizontal. A Shakespearean sonnet, on
		the other hand, would score high both
		horizontally and vertically, yielding a
		massive total area, thereby revealing the
		poem to be truly great. As you proceed
		through the poetry in this book, practice
		this rating method. As your ability to
		evaluate poems in this matter grows, so
		will - so will your enjoyment and
		understanding of poetry.

Neil sets the book down and takes off his glasses. The student sitting
across from him is discretely trying to eat. Keating turns away from
the chalkboard with a smile.

				KEATING
		Excrement. That's what I think of Mr. J.
		Evans Pritchard. We're not laying pipe,
		we're talking about poetry.

Cameron looks down at the graph he copied into his notes and quickly
scribbles it out.

				KEATING
		I mean, how can you describe poetry like
		American Bandstand? I like Byron, I give
		him a 42, but I can't dance to it.

Charlie suddenly appear to become interested in the class.

				KEATING
		Now I want you to rip out that page.

The students look at Keating as if he has just gone mad.

				KEATING
		Go on, rip out the entire page. You heard
		me, rip it out. Rip it out!

Charlie looks around at the others. He then looks down at his own notes,
which consists of drawing breasts.

				KEATING
		Go on, rip it out.

Charlie rips the page out and holds it up.

				KEATING
		Thank you Mr. Dalton. Gentlemen, tell you
		what, don't just tear out that page, tear
		out the entire introduction. I want it
		gone, history. Leave nothing of it. Rip
		it out. Rip! Begone J. Evans Pritchard,
		Ph.D. Rip, shred, tear. Rip it out. I
		want to hear nothing but ripping of Mr.
		Pritchard.

Meeks looks around reluctantly and then finally begins tearing out pages.

				KEATING
		We'll perforate it, put it on a roll.

Keating sees Cameron still hesitating.

				KEATING
		It's not the bible, you're not going to
		go to hell for this. Go on, make a clean
		tear, I want nothing left of it.

Keating goes over to his room. Cameron turns around to Neil.

				CAMERON
		We shouldn't be doing this.

				NEIL
		Rip, rip, rip!

Neil makes Cameron turn back around.

				KEATING (O.S.)
		Rip it out, rip!

From outside the classroom, Mr. McAllister hears all the noise and sees
all the students ripping out the pages. He bursts into the room.

				MCALLISTER
		What the hell is going on here?

The boys all turn around in shock. Charlie stuffs a crumpled page into his
mouth. Keating emerges from his room with a waste paper basket.

				KEATING
		I don't hear enough rips.

				MCALLISTER
		Mr. Keating.

				KEATING
		Mr. McAllister.

				MCALLISTER
		I'm sorry, I- I didn't know you were
		here.

				KEATING
		I am.

				MCALLISTER
		Ahh, so you are. Excuse me.

Mr. McAllister slowly backs out of the classroom.

				KEATING
		Keep ripping gentlemen. This is a battle,
		a war. And the casualties could be your
		hearts and souls. 

Keating holds out the basket to Charlie who spits out a wad of paper.

				KEATING
		Thank you Mr. Dalton. Armies of academics
		going forward, measuring poetry. No, we
		will not have that here. No more of Mr.
		J. Evans Pritchard. Now in my class you
		will learn to think for yourselves again.
		You will learn to savor words and language.
		No matter what anybody tells you, words and
		ideas can change the world. I see that look
		in Mr. Pitt's eye, like nineteenth century
		literature has nothing to do with going to
		business school or medical school. Right?
		Maybe. Mr. Hopkins, you may agree with him, 
		thinking "Yes, we should simply study our
		Mr. Pritchard and learn our rhyme and meter
		and go quietly about the business of
		achieving other ambitions." I have a little
		secret for ya. Huddle up. Huddle up! 

The boys get up from their seats and gather around Keating in the center
of the class.

				KEATING
		We don't read and write poetry because
		it's cute. We read and write poetry
		because we are members of the human race.
		And the human race is filled with passion.
		Medicine, law, business, engineering,
		these are all noble pursuits, and necessary
		to sustain life. But poetry, beauty,
		romance, love, these are what we stay alive
		for. To quote from Whitman: "O me, o life
		of the questions of these recurring, of the
		endless trains of the faithless, of cities
		filled with the foolish. What good amid
		these, o me, o life? Answer: that you are
		here. That life exists, and identity.
		That the powerful play goes on, and you
		may contribute a verse. That the powerful
		play goes on and you may contribute a verse.

Keating looks up at Todd.

				Keating
		What will your verse be?

INT. HEAD OF CAFETERIA - DAY

The cafeteria is filled with students and teachers standing before the tables saying grace.

				ALL
		For what we are about to receive, may the
		Lord make us truly grateful. Amen.

Mr. Keating and Mr. McAllister are seated next to one another at the table.

				MCALLISTER
		Quite an interesting class you gave today,
		Mr. Keating.

				KEATING
		I'm sorry if I shocked you, Mr. McAllister.

				MCALLISTER
		Oh, there's no need to apologize. It was
		very fascinating, misguided though it was.

				KEATING
		You think so?

				MCALLISTER
		You take a big risk by encouraging them to
		be artists John. When they realize they're
		not Rembrandts, Shakespeares or Mozarts,
		they'll hate you for it.

				KEATING
		We're not talking artists George, we're
		talking free thinkers.

				MCALLISTER
		Free thinkers at seventeen?

				KEATING
		Funny, I never pegged you as a cynic.

				MCALLISTER
			  (taken aback by the comment)
		Not a cynic, a realist. Show me the heart
		unfettered by foolish dreams, and I'll
		show you a happy man.

				KEATING
		But only in their dreams can man be truly
		free. 'Twas always thus, and always thus
		will be.

				MCALLISTER
		Tennyson?

				KEATING
		No, Keating.

Keating winks and Mr. McAllister can't help but laugh.

INT. CAFETERIA TABLE - DAY

Neil joins the others at the table. He pulls out a yearbook.

				NEIL
		Hey, I found his senior annual in the
		library.

He hands the annual over to Cameron who laughs at the younger picture of Keating.

				NEIL
		Listen to this, captain of the soccer team,
		editor of the school annual, Cambridge
		bound, Thigh man, and the Dead Poets Society.

				CAMERON
			    (reading from the annual)
		Man most likely to do anything.

				CHARLIE
		Thigh man. Mr. K was a hell-raiser.

				KNOX
		What's the Dead Poets Society?

				NEIL
		I don't know.

				MEEKS
		Is there a picture in the annual?

				NEIL
		Nothing. No other mention of it.

				MR. NOLAN (O.S.)
		That boy there, see me after lunch.

Cameron quickly puts the annual away and the others all return to their meal.

EXT. WELTON GROUNDS - DAY

Keating is walking down towards the lake, whistling the same tune as before.
The boys emerge from the building and chase after him.

				NEIL
		Mr. Keating? Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain,
		My Captain?

Keating immediately turns around.

				KEATING
		Gentlemen.

				NEIL
		We were just looking in your old annual.

He hands Keating the annual and Keating looks at his old photograph.

				KEATING
		Oh my God. No, that's not me. Stanley
		"The Tool" Wilson-

Keating crouches down and continues looking through the book.

				KEATING
		God.

Neil crouches down next to Keating.

				NEIL
		What was the Dead Poets Society?

				KEATING
		I doubt the present administration would
		look too favorably upon that.

				NEIL
		Why? What was it?

				KEATING
		Gentlemen, can you keep a secret?

				NEIL
		Sure.

The other boys crouch down around Keating.

				KEATING
		The Dead Poets were dedicated to sucking
		the marrow out of life. That's a phrase
		from Thoreau that we'd invoke at the
		beginning of each meeting. You see we'd
		gather at the old Indian cave and take
		turns reading from Thoreau, Whitman,
		Shelley; the biggies. Even some of our
		own verse. And in the enchantment of the
		moment we'd let poetry work its magic.

				KNOX
		You mean it was a bunch of guys sitting
		around reading poetry?

				KEATING
		No Mr. Overstreet, it wasn't just "guys",
		we weren't a Greek organization, we were
		romantics. We didn't just read poetry,
		we let it drip from our tongues like honey.
		Spirits soared, women swooned, and gods
		were created, gentlemen, not a bad way to
		spend an evening eh? Thank you Mr. Perry
		for this trip down amnesia lane. Burn that,
		especially my picture.

Keating hands the annual back and walks away, whistling once again. Neil
remains crouched.

				NEIL
		Dead Poets Society.

				CAMERON
		What?

The school bells begin ringing and everyone heads back towards the school.
Neil stands up.

				NEIL
		I say we go tonight.

				CHARLIE
		Tonight?

				CAMERON
		Wait a minute.

				PITTS
		Where's this cave he's talking about?

				NEIL
		It's beyond the stream. I know where it
		is.

				PITTS
		That's miles.

				CAMERON
		Sounds boring to me.

				CHARLIE
		Don't go.

				CAMERON
		You know how many de-merits we're talking
		Dalton

				CHARLIE
		So don't come, please.

				CAMERON
		Look, all I'm saying is that we have to
		be careful, we can't get caught.

				CHARLIE
		No shit, Sherlock.

				HAGER
				(yelling)
		You boys there, hurry up.

Neil turns around and faces the other boys.

				NEIL
		All right, who's in?

				CAMERON
		Come on Neil, Hager's right-

				NEIL
		Forget Hager, no. Who's in?

				CHARLIE
		I'm in.

				HAGER (O.S.)
		I'm warning you, move.

				CAMERON
		Me too.

				PITTS
		I don't know Neil

				NEIL
		What? Pitts-

				CHARLIE
		Pitsie, come on.

				MEEKS
		His grades are hurting Charlie.

				NEIL
		You can help him Meeks.

				PITTS
		What is this, a midnight study group?

				NEIL
		Forget it Pitts, you're coming. Meeks,
		are your grades hurting too?

				MEEKS
		I'll try anything once.

				CHARLIE
		Except sex.

				MEEKS
		Ha ha ha.

				CAMERON
		I mean as long as we're careful.

The boys run into the building.

				CHARLIE
		What about you Knox?

				KNOX
		I don't know Charlie.

				CHARLIE
		Come on Knox, it'll help you get Chris.

				KNOX
		Yeah? How?

				CHARLIE
		Women swoon.

Charlie laughs and runs inside. Knox chases after him.

				KNOX
		But why do they swoon? Charlie, tell me
		why they swoon. Charlie!

INT LIBRARY - DAY

The boys are all gathered around one of the tables with a map laid out
on it.

				NEIL
			    (whispering)
		Okay, follow the stream to the waterfall.
		It's right there. It's got to be on the
		banks.

				CAMERON
		I don't know, it's starting to sound
		dangerous.

				CHARLIE
		Well, why don't you stay home?

				MCALLISTER
		For God's sake stop chattering and
		sit down.

The boys take their seats once again and Neil goes over and sits next to
Todd, who is sitting by himself.

				NEIL
		Todd, are you coming tonight?

				TODD
		No.

				NEIL
		Why not? God, you were there. You heard
		Keating. Don't you want to do something
		about it?

				TODD
		Yes, but-

				NEIL
		But? But what?

				TODD
		Keating said that everybody took turns
		reading and I don't want to do that.

				NEIL
		Gosh, you really have a problem with
		that, don't you?

				TODD
		N- no, I don't have a problem. Neil,
		I just- I just don't want to do it,
		okay?

				NEIL
		All right. What if you didn't have to
		read? What if you just came and
		listened?

				TODD
		That's not how it works.

				NEIL
		Forget how it works. What if - what if
		they said it was okay?

				TODD
		What? What are you gonna do, go up and
		ask them?

Neil shrugs.

				TODD
		No. No, Neil.

				NEIL
		I'll be right back.

				TODD
		Neil, Neil!

Neil gets up and rejoins the others. McAllister hears the boys whispering
again.

				MCALLISTER
		Oh shut up, will you.

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Various boys are crowded around the sinks getting ready for bed. Someone
is playing snake charmer music on a kazoo while someone else is bothering
Spaz with a red sock puppet acting like a snake.

				SPAZ
		That's my- that's for my asthma, okay.
		Could you give that back please? Could
		you give that back?

				BOY
		What's the matter? Don't you like snakes?

Neil enters and taps Todd on the shoulder.

				NEIL
		You're in.

				SPAZ
		Get away from me, okay?

				BOY
		Spaz, why don't you check your pocket,
		huh? Come on Spaz I have to brush my
		teeth

				SPAZ
		Get a- get off, 

Hager walks past the bathroom and into his room.

				HAGER
		Cut out that racket in there.

The kazoo player lets out a rude squeek before finally stopping. Hager
glares at them for a moment.

INT NEIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Neil stands in his doorway. He looks across the hall to the other room
where Cameron and Charlie are standing. Cameron gives a thumbs up. Neil
closes his room door and takes out his cloak and a flashlight. Setting
the flashlight down on the desk, he notices a worn book, "Five
Centuries of Verse", sitting there. Opening it up, he sees John Keating's
name at the top followed by "Dead Poets". Below the title of the book,
is written: "To Be Read At The Opening of D.P.S. Meetings." Along with
several lines from Thoreau, beginning with "I went to the woods because
I wanted to live deliberately"

INT STAIRWAY - NIGHT

The shadows of hooded figures can be seen moving throughout the darkened
halls.

INT HAGER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Hager hears a dog barking.

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Someone drops a number of dog biscuits by the dog's feet. He stops
barking and immediately begins gobbling them down. Hager looks out
into the hallway with his flashlight but sees nothing.

EXT SCHOOL GROUNDS - NIGHT

The boys quietly leave the building and set off running across the
fields towards the woods.

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

The boys search about the trees trying to find the cave. Meeks is
searching around when Charlie leaps up behind Meeks in the dark
shining the flashlight up at his own face and grabs Meeks by the
shoulder.

				CHARLIE
		Arrr, I'm a dead poet.

				MEEKS
		Aww, Charlie.

				CHARLIE
			    (laughing)
		Guys, over here.

				MEEKS
		You're funny. You're real funny.

INT CAVE - NIGHT

The boys are trying to start a fire. The cave is quickly filling up with
smoke.

				MEEKS
		It's too wet.

CHARLIE
		God, are you trying to smoke us out of
		here?

				MEEKS
		No, no, the smoke's going right up this
		opening.

Pitts tries to stand up and slams his head into the low rock ceiling. He
lets out a yell while the others laugh.

				NEIL
		You okay?

				PITTS
		Oh God. Clowns.

				NEIL
		All right, all right, forget the fire.
		Let's go gentlemen.

Neil stands before the others with the book in hand, and takes a drag
on a cigarette.

				NEIL
		I hereby reconvene the Dead Poets
		Society.

The boys cheer.

				NEIL
		Welton chapter. The meetings will be
		conducted by myself and the other new
		initiates now present. Todd Anderson,
		because he prefers not to read, will
		keep minutes of the meetings. I'll now
		read the traditional opening message by
		society member Henry David Thoreau. "I
		went to the woods because I wanted to
		live deliberately. I wanted to live deep
		and suck out all the marrow of life."

				CHARLIE
		I'll second that.

				NEIL
		"To put to rout all that was not life,
		and not, when I had come to die,
		discover that I had not lived.

Several boys whistle softly in reaction to the poem.

				NEIL
		And Keating's marked a bunch of other
		pages.

Neil begins flipping through the book.

				CHARLIE
		All right, intermission. Dig deep right
		here. Right here, lay it down

				CAMERON
		On the mud? We're gonna put our food on
		the mud?

				CHARLIE
		Meeks, put your coat down. Picnic blanket.

				MEEKS
		Yes sir, use Meeks' coat.

				CHARLIE
		Don't keep anything back either. You
		guys are always bumming my smokes.

Meeks lays his coat down and everyone dumps their food on it. Amongst
the pile are chocolate chip cookies, a box of raisins, a few apples, an
orange, and half a roll.

				NEIL
		Raisins?

				KNOX
		Yuck.

				CHARLIE
		Wait a minute, who gave us half a roll?

				PITTS
			  (talking with his mouth full)
		I'm eating the other half.

				CHARLIE
		Come on.

				PITTS
		You want me to put it back?

INT CAVE - NIGHT

Neil, lit up by a flashlight, begins to tell everyone a story.

				NEIL
		It was a dark and rainy night, and this
		old lady, who had a passion for jigsaw
		puzzles, sat by herself in her house at
		her table to complete a new jigsaw puzzle.
		But as she pieced the puzzle together, she
		realized, to her astonishment, that the
		image that was formed was her very own
		room. And the figure in the center of the
		puzzle, as she completed it, was herself.
		And with trembling hands, she placed the
		last four pieces and stared in horror at
		the face of a demented madman at the
		window. The last thing that this old lady
		ever heard was the sound of breaking glass.

				BOYS
		Ohhh no

				NEIL
		This is true, this is true.

				CAMERON
		I've got one that's even better than
		that.

				CHARLIE
		Ha!

				CAMERON
		I do. There's a young, married couple,
		and they're driving through the forest
		at night on a long trip. And they run
		out of gas, and there's a madman on the-

				CHARLIE
		The thing with the hand-

All the boys react, recalling the story and miming the scraping on the
roof of the car.

				CAMERON
		I love that story.

				CHARLIE
		I told you that one.

				CAMERON
		You did not. I got that in camp in
		sixth grade.

				CHARLIE
		When were you in six, last year?

As everyone's voices begin to calm down, Pitts begins reading from the
book.

				PITTS
		"In a mean abode in the shanking road,
		lived a man named William Bloat. Now,
		he had a wife, the plague of his life,
		who continually got his goat. And one
		day at dawn, with her nightshift on,
		he slit her bloody throat."

The boys laugh.

				PITTS
		Oh, and it gets worse.

				CHARLIE
		You want to hear a real poem?

Meeks hands Charlie the book but he shoves it away.

				CHARLIE
		All right? No, I don't need it. You take 
		it. 

				MEEKS
		What, did you bring one? 

				NEIL
		You memorized a poem? 

				CHARLIE
		I didn't memorize a poem. Move up.

Neil moves to the side as Charlie stands and takes his spot.

				MEEKS
		An original piece by Charlie Dalton. 

				KNOX
		An original piece. 

				PITTS
		Take center stage. 

				NEIL
		You know this is history. Right? This is 
		history.

Charlie clears his throat and pulls out a page from a magazine and 
slowly unfolds it, revealing a Playboy centerfold (Elaine Reynolds,
Miss October, 1959)

				MEEKS
		Oh, wow. 

				CAMERON
		Where did you get that? 

				CHARLIE

		Teach me to love? Go teach thyself more 
		wit.
		I, chief professor, am of it.

Neil gets up and looks over Charlie's shoulder to see what he is
reading.

				CHARLIE
		The god of love, if such a thing there 
		be, may learn to love from me.

Charlie winks at the guys and they clap and cheer.

				NEIL
		Wow! Did you write that?

Charlie turns over the centerfold to show where he had written down
the poem.

				CHARLIE
		Abraham Cowley. Okay, who's next? 

Neil sits reading from the book by flashlight.

				NEIL
		Alfred Lord Tennyson. 
		Come my friends, 
		'Tis not too late to seek a newer world 
		for my purpose holds to sail beyond the 
		sunset. 
		And though we are not now that strength 
		which in old days 
		Moved earth and heaven; that which we 
		are, we are;-- 
		One equal temper of heroic hearts, 
		Made weak by time and fate, but strong 
		in will. 
		To strive, to seek, to find, and not to 
		yield. 

Meeks takes center stage and begins reading a poem like he is 
performing a chant.

				MEEKS
		Then I had religion, then I had a 
		vision. 
		I could not turn from their revel in 
		derision. 
		Then I saw the Congo creeping through 
		the black, 
		cutting through the forest with a golden 
		track. 
		Then I saw the Congo creeping through 
		the black- 

				CHARLIE
		Meeks, Meeks. 

				MEEKS

		...cutting through the forest with a 
		golden track.
		Then I saw the Congo creeping through 
		the black, 
		cutting through the forest with a golden 
		track.

Knox picks up a metal container and begins using it as a drum. The
other boys stand and begin going in a circle, making music with
sticks of wood, combs, etc.

		Then I saw the Congo creeping through 
		the black, 
		cutting through the forest with a golden 
		track. 
		Then I saw the Congo creeping through 
		the black, 
		cutting through the forest with a golden 
		track. 

				BOYS

		Then I saw the Congo creeping through 
		the black, 
		cutting through the forest with...

The boys continue to chant the chorus as they emerge from the
cave.

EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT
The clock tolls two as the boys silently run back to their dorm.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Keating is walking to the front of the classroom filled with students.

				KEATING
		A man is not very tire, he is exhausted.
		And don't use very sad, use-

He points to the back of the classroom.

				KEATING
		Come on, Mr. Overstreet, you twerp, 
				KNOX
		Morose? 

				KEATING
		Exactly! Morose. Now, language was 
		developed for one endeavor, and that is? 
		Mr. Anderson? Come on! Are you a man or 
		an amoeba?

Keating stands before Todd's desk. Todd looks up nervously but
says nothing. Keating paused for a moment before looking away.

				KEATING
		Mr. Perry? 

				NEIL
		Uh, to communicate. 

				KEATING
		No! To woo women. Today we're going to 
		be talking about William Shakespeare. 

The class lets out a collective sigh.
				BOY
		Oh, God! 

				KEATING
		I know. A lot of you looked forward to 
		this about as much as you look forward 
		to root canal work. We're gonna talk 
		about Shakespeare as someone who writes 
		something very interesting. Now, many of 
		you have seen Shakespeare done very much 
		like this:

Keating holds out his right arm dramtically and begins to
speak in an exaggerated British accent.

		"O Titus, bring your friend hither." But
		if any of you have seen Mr. Marlon Brando,
		you know, Shakespeare can be different. 
		"Friend, Romans, countrymen, lend me your
		ears." You can also imagine, maybe, John
		Wayne as Macbeth going, "Well, is this a 
		dagger I see before me?"

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

The students are all seated together near the front of the room as
Keating reads from a book.

				KEATING
		"Dogs, sir? Oh, not just now. I do enjoy 
		a good dog once in a while, sir. You can 
		have yourself a three-course meal from 
		one dog. Start with your canine 
		crudites, go to your Fido flambe for 
		main course and for dessert, a Pekingese 
		parfait. And you can pick your teeth 
		with a little paw."

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

The students are all back in their normal seats and Keating leaps
up onto his desk.

				KEATING
		Why do I stand up here? Anybody? 

				CHARLIE
		To feel taller. 

				KEATING
		No!
Keating rings the bell on his desk with his foot

				KEATING
		Thank you for playing, Mr. Dalton. I 
		stand upon my desk to remind yourself 
		that we must constantly look at things 
		in a different way. 

Keating glances around the classroom from atop the desk.

				KEATING
		You see, the world looks very different 
		from up here. You don't believe me? Come 
		see for yourself. Come on. Come on! 

Charlie and Neil quickly rise from their seats to go to the front
of the classroom. The rest of the class follows them. While Keating
continues speaking, Neil and Charlie join him on the desk and then
Keating jumps down.


				KEATING
		Just when you think you know something, 
		you have to look at it in another way. 
		Even though it may seem silly or wrong, 
		you must try! Now, when you read, don't 
		just consider what the author thinks. 
		Consider what you think. 

				KEATING
		Boys, you must strive to find your own 
		voice. Because the longer you wait to 
		begin, the less likely you are to find 
		it at all. Thoreau said, "Most men lead 
		lives of quiet desperation." Don't be 
		resigned to that. Break out!

Keating notices Spaz and another boy leaving the desk immediately.

				KEATING
		Don't just walk off the edge like lemmings.
		Look around you. 

The school bell rings as the boys continue to climb onto the desk.
Keating begins to gather up his stuff. The clock begins to toll as
Keating walks to the back of the class.

				KEATING
		There! There you go, Mr. Priske. Thank 
		you! Yes! Dare to strike out and find 
		new ground. Now, in addition to your 
		essays, I would like you to compose a 
		poem of your own, an original work.

The students begin to groan. Keating begins flickering the lights
off and on while chanting ominously.

				KEATING
		That's right! You have to deliver it 
		aloud in front of the class on Monday. 
		Bonne chance, gentlemen. 

Keating steps out into the hall before quickly peeking back in once again.
Todd is the last one to stand on the desk and is about to jump off.

				KEATING
		Mr. Anderson? Don't think that I don't 
		know that this assignment scares the 
		hell out of you, you mole.

Keating flicks the light off, leaving Todd to jump down in the darkness
as the students laugh.

EXT. RIVER - DAY

Cameron, Charlie, and several other boys are rowing while Mr. Nolan
shouts orders from a bullhorn.

				MR. NOLAN
		Take a power train in two! Three! Keep 
		your eyes in the boat!

EXT. CAMPUS ROOFTOP - DAY

Noisy static is replaced by music as Pitts climbs down form the peak to
join Meeks at their makeshift radio.

				MEEKS
		We got it, Pittsie. We got it! Radio 
		Free America! 


EXT CAMPUS - DAY

Several students are fencing on a grassy slope.

EXT. CAMPUS ROOFTOP - DAY

Meeks and Pitts perform a goofy dance together to the music.

INT. TODD'S ROOM - DAY

Todd is on his bed trying to write a poem. The door opens and Todd
turns his writing pad over. Neil enters the room laughing. He crouches
down next to Todd's bed and plunks a sheet of paper in Todd's lap.


				NEIL
		I found it. 

				TODD
		You found what? 

				NEIL
		What I wanna do right now. What's 
		really, really inside me. 

				TODD
		"A Midsummer Night's Dream"? 

				NEIL
		This is it. 

				TODD
		What is this? 

				NEIL
		It's a play, dummy. 

				TODD
		I know that. I-- Wh-Wh-What does it have 
		to do with you? 

				NEIL
		Right. They're putting it on at Henley 
		Hall. Open tryouts. Open tryouts! 

				TODD
		Yes, so?

Neil pounds on the bed and then pulls a blanket off his bed,
wearing it like a cloak.

				NEIL
		So, I'm gonna act. Yes, yes! I'm gonna 
		be an actor! Ever since I can remember, 
		I've wanted to try this. I even tried to 
		go to summer stock auditions last year, 
		but, of course, my father wouldn't let 
		me. For the first time in my whole life 
		I know what I wanna do.

Neil grabs a handful of papers off Todd's bed and tosses them into
the air.

				NEIL
		and for the first time I'm gonna do it 
		whether my father wants me to or not!
		Carpe diem! 

				TODD
		Neil, Neil, hold on a minute. How are 
		you gonna be in a play if your father 
		won't let you? 

				NEIL
		First I gotta get the part, then I can 
		worry about that. 

				TODD
		Yeah, but won't he kill you if he finds 
		out you went to an audition and didn't 
		even tell him? 

				NEIL
		No, no, no, no. As far as I'm concerned, 
		he won't have to know about any of this. 

				TODD
		Well, that's impossible. 

				NEIL
		Bullshit! Nothing's impossible. 

				TODD
		Well, why don't you just call him and 
		ask him? And m-maybe he'll say yes. 

				NEIL
		That's a laugh!

Neil tosses the blanket back onto his bed.

				NEIL
		If I don't ask him, at least I won't
		be disobeying him. 

				TODD
		Yeah, but if he said-- 

				NEIL
			   (shouting angrily)
		Jesus, Todd! Whose side are you on?

Todd says nothing. Neil looks at him for a moment and then takes
the flyer back from Todd. He walks over to the window, his 
excitement gone.

				NEIL
		I mean, I haven't even gotten the part 
		yet. Can't I even enjoy the idea for a 
		little while? 

Once again, Todd says nothing. After a moment, Neil sits on the
heater and Todd returns to his poem.

				NEIL
		You're coming to the meeting this 
		afternoon? 

				TODD
		I don't know. Maybe.

				NEIL
		Nothing Mr. Keating has to say means 
		shit to you, does it, Todd? 

				TODD
		W-What is that supposed to mean? 

				NEIL
		You're in the club! Being in the club 
		means being stirred up by things. You 
		look about as stirred up as a cesspool. 

Neil gets up from the window and stands over Todd.

				TODD
		So- You want me out? 

				NEIL
		No! I want you in, but being in means 
		you gotta do something. Not just say 
		you're in. 

				TODD
		Well, listen, Neil. I-I appreciate this 
		concern, but I-I'm not like you. All 
		right? You, you, you say thing and 
		people listen. I'm, I'm not like that. 

				NEIL
		Don't you think you could be? 

				TODD
		No! I--I, I don't know, but that's not 
		the point. The, the, the point is that 
		there's nothing you can do about it, so 
		you can just butt out. I can take care 
		of myself just fine. All right? 

				NEIL
		No. 

				TODD
		What do you mean, "no"? 

A smile comes to Neil's face.

				NEIL
		No. 

Neil grabs Todd's notebook of poetry and runs across the room with 
it. Todd leaps up after him.

				TODD
		Give me-- Neil. Neil, give that back. 

The two begin racing in circles around the room, jumping from
bed to bed as Todd tries to grab his poem back.

				NEIL
		"We are dreaming of a--" Poetry! I'm 
		being chased by Walt Whitman! Okay, 
		okay.

Neil drops the notebook. Cameron walks into the room.

				CAMERON
		What are you guys doing? I'm sure-- You 
		see this chemistry-

Cameron tries to hold up his book and Neil snatches it from his hands and
suddenly all three of them are racing around the room.

				CAMERON
		Hey, give me-- Neil, give me-- Don't be
		immature. Come on. I need my- 

Charlie enters the room and begins waving his hands.

				CHARLIE
		Give it to me! Give it to me! 

				NEIL
		Charlie!

Neil tosses Cameron's book to Charlie.

				CAMERON
		Let me have my book, I need my- 

The four boys continue racing around the cramped quarters, tossing
Cameron's book back and forth. Neil picks up a recorder and begins
blowing erratic notes on it while Charlie starts pounding on a set of
bongo drums. Outside the room a crowd of boys watch.

EXT. CAMPUS ENTRANCE - DAY

Knox is riding his bike around in circles near the entrance. Seeing no
one nearby, he races through the open gates and down the road. He comes
to the top of a hill and then goes downhill across the grass, shouting
as he sends an immense flock of geese flying into the air.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

A number of vehicles drive up, filled with students dressed in bright red
cosyumes, playing trumpets and various other instruments as they pass.
Knox watches the growing crowd of students. They are all converging on
a bus. A football player, wearing a horned helmet, dances on the roof of
the bus. A band is playing while a group of cheerleaders are practising.
Knox spots Chris amongst the cheerleaders. He watches her until Chet
comes along and she grabs hold of his hand. Knox looks away in disgust.

				COACH
		Okay, everybody on the bus. Let's go, 
		boys. Come on, let's go. On the bus, 
		boys. Now!

Chris jumps into Chet's arms as everyone begins to board the buses. Knox
turns his bike around and leaves.

EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY

Keating walks across the field, followed by his students. He kicks a ball
ahead of him while he carries a number of other balls in a net slung over
his shoulder.

				KEATING
		Now, devotees may argue that one sport 
		or game is inherently better than 
		another. For me, sport is actually a 
		chance for us to have other human beings 
		push us to excel. I want you all to come 
		over here and take a slip of paper and 
		line up single file.

Keating reaches the stands. He tosses the balls aside and pulls sets
his briefcase down. As the boys line up he begins ripping off slips
of paper from a notepad and handing them out.

				KEATING
		Mr. Meeks, time to inherit the earth. 
		Mr. Pitts, rise above your name.

He hands the notepad to another student.

				KEATING
		I want you to hand these out to the boys,
		one apiece.

EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY

The students are all lined up in single file, each holding a slip
of paper. Keating blows his whistle.

				KEATING
		You know what to do, Pitts. 

				PITTS
		"Oh to struggle against great odds. To 
		meet enemies undaunted." 

				KEATING
		Sounds to me like you're daunted. Say it 
		again like you're undaunted. 

				PITTS
		"Oh to struggle against great odds. To 
		meet enemies undaunted." 

				KEATING
		Now go on.

Pitts gives one of the soccer balls a good kick.

				KEATING
		Yes! Next.

One of the students sets up the next ball as the line advances.

				BOY 1
		"To be a sailor of the world, bound for 
		all ports." 

				KEATING
		Next. Louder! 

				BOY 2
		"Oh, I live to be the ruler of life, not 
		a slave." 

Keating walks away and starts up a record player.

				BOY 3
		"To mount the scaffolds. To advance to 
		the muzzle of guns with perfect 
		nonchalance."

Classical music begins playing on the phonograph. Meeks goes to
read next but is confused by the music.

				KEATING
		Come on, Meeks! Listen to the music. 

				MEEKS
		"To dance, clap hands, exalt, shout, 
		skip, roll on, float on." 

				KEATING
		Yes! 

				HOPKINS
				(without energy)
		"Oh, to have life henceforth the poem of 
		new joys." 

Hopkins crumples up his paper and then barely taps the soccer
ball with his foot.

Keating puts a look of disgust on his face.

				KEATING
		Oh! Boo! Come on, Charlie, let it fill 
		your soul! 

Charlie raises his hands over his head.

				CHARLIE
		"To indeed be a god!" 

INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY

Neil is racing down the hallway, all excited.

				NEIL
		Charlie, I got the part! I'm gonna play 
		Puck! I'm gonna play Puck!

He pounds on Charlie's door.

				MEEKS
		What did he say? 

				PITTS
		Puck? 

				NEIL
		That's the main part. 

				KNOX
		Great, Neil. 

				NEIL
		Charlie, I got it! 

				CHARLIE
		Congratulations. Good for you, Neil. 
		Good for you. 

Neil enters his room with Todd and sits down at his typewriter.

				NEIL
		Okay, okay, okay, okay. 

				TODD
		Neil, how are you gonna do this? 

				NEIL
		They need a letter of permission from my 
		father and Mr. Nolan. 

				TODD
		You're not gonna write it. 

				NEIL
		Oh yes, I am. 

				TODD
		Oh, Neil. Neil, you're crazy. 

 Neil begins typing.

				    NEIL
		Okay. "I am writing to you on behalf of 
		my son Neil Perry."

Neil begins laughing and stomping his feet up and down.

				    NEIL
		This is great.

EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT

A lone bagpiper plays out on the dock.

INT. TODD'S ROOM - NIGHT

Todd is pacing circles about his room as he reads his poem. His
pacing slows and then he tears the poem up.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Knox stands at the front of the room with his poem in hand.

				KNOX
				(quietly)
		"To Chris."

Charlie looks up from his desk with a grin.

				BOY 1
		Who's Chris? 

				BOY 2
		Mmm, Chris. 

				KNOX
		I see a sweetness in her smile. 
		Blight light shines from her eyes. 
		But life is complete; contentment is 
		mine, 
		Just knowing that...

Several students begin to snicker.

				KNOX
		just knowing that she's alive.

Knox crumples his poem and walks back to his desk.

				KNOX
		Sorry, Captain. It's stupid. 

				KEATING
		No, no. It's not stupid. It's a good 
		effort. It touched on one of the major 
		themes, love. A major theme not only in 
		poetry, but life. Mr. Hopkins, you were 
		laughing. You're up.

Hopkins slowly walks to the front of the class and unfolds
his piece of paper.

				HOPKINS
		"The cat sat on the mat." 

				KEATING
		Congratulations, Mr. Hopkins. Yours is 
		the first poem to ever have a negative 
		score on the Pritchard scale. We're not 
		laughing at you, we're laughing near 
		you. I don't mind that your poem had a 
		simple theme. Sometimes the most 
		beautiful poetry can be about simple 
		things, like a cat, or a flower or rain. 
		You see, poetry can come from anything 
		with the stuff of revelation in it. Just 
		don't let your poems be ordinary. Now, 
		who's next? 

Keating approaches Todd's desk.

				KEATING
		Mr. Anderson, I see you sitting there in 
		agony. Come on, Todd, step up. Let's put 
		you out of your misery. 

				TODD
		I, I didn't do it. I didn't write a 
		poem. 

				KEATING
		Mr. Anderson thinks that everything 
		inside of him is worthless and 
		embarrassing. Isn't that right, Todd? 
		Isn't that your worst fear? Well, I 
		think you're wrong. I think you have 
		something inside of you that is worth a 
		great deal.

Keating walks up to the blackboard and begins to write.

				KEATING
		"I sound my barbaric yawp over the 
		rooftops of the world." W. W. Uncle Walt 
		again. Now, for those of you who don't 
		know, a yawp is a loud cry or yell. Now, 
		Todd, I would like you to give us a 
		demonstration of a barbaric "yawp." Come 
		on. You can't yawp sitting down. Let's 
		go. Come on. Up.

Todd reluctantly stands and follows Keating to the front.

				KEATING
		You gotta get in "yawping" stance. 

				TODD
		A yawp?

				KEATING
		No, not just a yawp. A barbaric yawp. 

				TODD
				(quietly)
		Yawp. 

				KEATING
		Come on, louder. 

				TODD
				(quietly)
		Yawp. 

				KEATING
		No, that's a mouse. Come on. Louder. 

				TODD
		Yawp. 

				KEATING
		Oh, good God, boy. Yell like a man! 

				TODD
				(shouting)
		Yawp! 

				KEATING
		There it is. You see, you have a 
		barbarian in you, after all.

Todd goes to return to his seat but Keating stops him.

				KEATING
		Now, you don't get away that easy.

Keating turns Todd around and points out a picture on the wall.

				KEATING
		The picture of Uncle Walt up there. What 
		does he remind you of? Don't think. 
		Answer. Go on.

Keating begins to circle around Todd.

				TODD
		A m-m-madman. 

				KEATING
		What kind of madman? Don't think about 
		it. Just answer again. 

				TODD
		A c-crazy madman. 

				KEATING
		No, you can do better than that. Free up 
		your mind. Use your imagination. Say the 
		first thing that pops into your head, 
		even if it's total gibberish. Go on, go 
		on. 

				TODD
		Uh, uh, a sweaty-toothed madman. 

				KEATING
		Good God, boy, there's a poet in you, 
		after all. There, close your eyes. Close 
		your eyes. Close 'em. Now, describe what 
		you see. 

Keating puts his hands over Todd's eyes and they begin to slowly
spin around.

				TODD
		Uh, I-I close my eyes. 

				KEATING
		Yes? 

				TODD
		Uh, and this image floats beside me. 

				KEATING
		A sweaty-toothed madman? 

				TODD
		A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare 
		that pounds my brain. 

				KEATING
		Oh, that's excellent. Now, give him 
		action. Make him do something. 

				TODD
		H-His hands reach out and choke me. 

				KEATING
		That's it. Wonderful. Wonderful.

Keating removes his hands from Todd but Todd keeps his eyes
closed.

				TODD
		And, and all the time he's mumbling. 

				KEATING
		What's he mumbling? 

				TODD
		M-Mumbling, "Truth. Truth is like, like 
		a blanket that always leaves your feet 
		cold." 

The students begin to laugh and Todd opens his eyes. Keating
quickly gestures for him to close them again.

				KEATING
		Forget them, forget them. Stay with the 
		blanket. Tell me about that blanket. 

				TODD
		Y-Y-Y-You push it, stretch it, it'll 
		never be enough. You kick at it, beat 
		it, it'll never cover any of us. From 
		the moment we enter crying to the moment 
		we leave dying, it will just cover your 
		face as you wail and cry and scream. 

Todd opens his eyes. The class is silent. Then they begin to clap
and cheer.

				KEATING
			   (whispering to Todd)
		Don't you forget this.

EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY

Keating's students are playing a soccer game. After they score the
winning goal they hoist Keating onto their shoulders and carry him
away.

INT. CAVE - DAY

The boys are all sitting around the cave lighting their pipes.
				CHARLIE
		Attaboy, Pittsie, inhale deeply. 

				MEEKS
		My dad collects a lot of pipes. 

				CHARLIE
		Really? Mine's got thirty. 

				PITTS
		Your parents collect pipes? Oh, that's 
		really interesting. 

				CHARLIE
		Come on, Knox. Join in. 

				MEEKS
		Yeah, Knox, we're from the government. 
		We're here to help, man. 

				CHARLIE
		What's wrong? 

				PITTS
		It's Chris. Here's a picture of Chris 
		for you.

Pitts holds up a centerfold.

				MEEKS
		Smoke that. Put that in your pipe and 
		smoke it. 

				KNOX
		That's not funny. 

				CHARLIE
		Knock it off. Smoke your pipes. 

				MEEKS
		Neil!

Neil enters the cave carrying a beat up light stand.

				NEIL
		Friend, scholar, Welton men. 

				MEEKS
		What is that, Neil? 

				PITTS
		Duh. It's a lamp, Meeks.

Neil removes the shade from the lamp, revealing the shape of a man
as the base of the lamp.

				NEIL
		No. This is the god of the cave. 

				MEEKS
		The god of the cave.

Charlie begins making loud noises with his saxophone.

				PITTS
		Charlie, what are you doing? 

				CHARLIE
		What do you say we start this meeting? 

				BOY 1
		Y-Yeah, just-- I need a light. I just 
		gotta- 

				BOY 2
		Got my earplugs?

Charlie stands up and clears his throat.

				CHARLIE
		Gentlemen, "Poetrusic" by Charles 
		Dalton.

Charlie begins playing erratic notes on the sexophone.

				MEEKS
		Oh, no. 

				CHARLIE
		Laughing, crying, tumbling, mumbling. 
		Gotta do more. Gotta be more. 

Charlie plays more erratic sounds.

				CHARLIE
		Chaos screaming, chaos dreaming. Gotta 
		do more! Gotta be more!

Charlie starts to play a real tune on the saxophone.

				MEEKS
		Wow! 

				PITTS
		That was nice. That was great. Where did 
		you learn to play like that? 

				CHARLIE
		My parents made me take the clarinet for 
		years. 

				CAMERON
		I love the clarinet. 

				CHARLIE
		I hated it. The saxophone. The saxophone 
		is more sonorous. 

				CAMERON
		Ooh. 

				MEEKS
		Vocabulary. 

Knox jumps up.
				KNOX
		I can't take it anymore. If I don't have 
		Chris, I'm gonna kill myself. 

				CHARLIE
		Knoxious, you've gotta calm down. 

				KNOX
		No, Charlie. That's just my problem. 
		I've been calm all my life. I'll do 
		something about that. 

				NEIL
		Where are you going? 

				CHARLIE
		What are you gonna do? 

				KNOX
		I'm gonna call her.

Knox begins to chuckle as he leaves the cave. The others
quickly grab their coats to follow him. Charlie goes back to
playing noise on his saxophone again.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Knox is making a call from the payphone.

				CHRIS (O.S.)
		Hello?

Knox immediately hangs up and looks at the other boys who are
all gathered around him.

				KNOX
		She's gonna hate me. The Danburrys will 
		hate me. My parents will kill me. 
		All right, goddamn it. You're right. 
		"Carpe diem." Even if it kills me. 

Knox puts in another coin and calls again.

				CHRIS (O.S.)
		Hello? 

				KNOX
		Hello, Chris? 

				CHRIS (O.S.)
		Yes. 

				KNOX
		Hi. This is Knox Overstreet. 

				CHRIS (O.S.)
		Oh, yes. Knox. Glad you called. 

				KNOX
		She's glad I called. 

				CHRIS (O.S.)
		Listen, Chet's parents are going out of 
		town this weekend, so he's having a 
		party. Would you like to come? 

				KNOX
		Would I like to come to a party? 

				CHARLIE
		Yes. Say, yes. 

				CHRIS (O.S.)
		Friday? Um- 

				KNOX
		Well, sure. 

				CHRIS (O.S.)
		About seven? 

				KNOX
		Okay, great. I-I'll be there, Chris. 

				CHRIS (O.S.)
		Okay. 

				KNOX
		Friday night at the Danburrys'. O-Okay. 
		Thank you. 

				CHRIS (O.S.)
		Okay. Bye. 

				KNOX
		Thank you. I'll see you. Bye. 

				KNOX
		Yawp! Can you believe it? She was gonna 
		call me. She invited me to a party with 
		her. 

				CHARLIE
		At Chet Danburry's house. 

				KNOX
		Yeah. 

				CHARLIE
		Well? 

				KNOX
		So? 

				CHARLIE
		So, you don't really think she means 
		you're going with her? 

				KNOX
		Well, of course not, Charlie. But that's 
		not the point. That's not the point at 
		all. 

				CHARLIE
		What is the point? 

				KNOX
		The point, Charlie, is, uh-- 

				CHARLIE
		Yeah? 

				KNOX
		that she was thinking about me. I've 
		only met her once, and already she's 
		thinking about me. Damn it. It's gonna 
		happen, guys. I feel it. She is going to 
		be mine. Carpe. Carpe!

Knox flips his scarf dramatically around his neck as he walks away
and climbs the stairs.

EXT. COURTYARD - DAY

The students are standing in a line while Cameron, Pitts, and Knox
are walking in a circle. Keating watches as they go around.

				KEATING
		No grades at stake, gentlemen. Just take 
		a stroll.

After a few moments, the three boys begin to march to the same beat.

				KEATING
		There it is. 

The other boys start clapping to the rhythm of their steps.

				KEATING
		I don't know, but I've been told-- 

				BOYS
		I don't know, but I've been told-- 

				KEATING
		Doing poetry is old-- 

				BOYS
		Doing poetry is old-- 

Mr. Nolan looks out at them from his office as Keating joins the
boys and begins marching with them.

				KEATING
		Left, left, left-right-left. Left, left, 
		left-right-left. Left, halt! 

The boys come to a halt.

				KEATING
		Thank you, gentlemen. If you noticed, 
		everyone started off with their own 
		stride, their own pace.

Keating begins walking very slowly.

				KEATING
		Mr. Pitts, taking his time. He knew he'll
		get there one day. Mr. Cameron, you could
		see him thinking, "Is this right? It might
		be right. It might be right. I know that. 
		Maybe not. I don't know."

Keating begins walking with his groin pushed forward.

				KEATING
		Mr. Overstreet, driven by deeper force.
		Yes. We know that. All right. Now, I
		didn't bring them up here to ridicule
		them. I brought them up here to illustrate
		the point of conformity: the difficulty in 
		maintaining your own beliefs in the face 
		of others. Now, those of you -- I see 
		the look in your eyes like, "I would've 
		walked differently." Well, ask 
		yourselves why you were clapping. Now, 
		we all have a great need for acceptance. 
		But you must trust that your beliefs are 
		unique, your own, even though others may 
		think them odd or unpopular, even though 
		the herd may go, "That's baaaaad." Robert 
		Frost said, "Two roads diverged in a 
		wood and I, I took the one less traveled 
		by, and that has made all the 
		difference." Now, I want you to find 
		your own walk right now. Your own way of 
		striding, pacing. Any direction. 
		Anything you want. Whether it's proud, 
		whether it's silly, anything. Gentlemen, 
		the courtyard is yours.

The students begin walking about, some walking casually, others
making up silly walks. Keating notices that Charlie is still
leaning up against one of the pillars.

				KEATING
		You don't have to perform. Just make it 
		for yourself. Mr. Dalton? You be joining 
		us? 

				CHARLIE
		Exercising the right not to walk. 

				KEATING
		Thank you, Mr. Dalton. You just 
		illustrated the point. Swim against the 
		stream.

Nolan moves away from the window where he had been watching them.

EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT

Neil is walking by with the notes for the play when he notices Todd
sitting off by himself on one of the walkways.

				NEIL
		Todd? Hey. 

				TODD
		Hey. 

				NEIL
		What's going on?

				TODD
		Nothing. Today's my birthday. 

				NEIL
		Is today your birthday? Happy birthday. 

				TODD
		Thanks. 

				NEIL
		What's you get? 

				TODD
		My parents gave me this. 

Neil looks down at a deskset sitting next to Todd, still in
its wrappings.

				NEIL
		Isn't this the same desk set- 

				TODD
		Yeah, yeah. They gave me the same thing 
		as last year. 

				NEIL
		Oh. 

				TODD
		Oh. 

				NEIL
				 (laughing)
		Maybe they thought you needed another 
		one. 

				TODD
		Maybe they weren't thinking about 
		anything at all. Uh, the funny thing is 
		about this is I, I didn't even like it 
		the first time. 

				NEIL
		Todd, I think you're underestimating the 
		value of this desk set.

Neil picks up the desk set and begins examining it more closely.

				NEIL
		I mean, who would want a football or
		a baseball, or-

				TODD
		Or a car. 

				NEIL
		Or a car if they could have a desk set 
		as wonderful as this one? I mean, if, if 
		I were ever going to buy a, a desk set 
		twice, I would probably buy this one 
		both times. In fact, its, its shape is, 
		it's rather aerodynamic, isn't it? I can 
		feel it. This desk set wants to fly.

Neil tosses the desk set lightly in the air. Todd stands up
and Neil hands him the desk set.

				NEIL
		Todd? The world's first unmanned flying 
		desk set.

Todd flings the desk set over the side of the walkway and it
falls to pieces down below.

				TODD
		Oh, my! 

				NEIL
		Well, I wouldn't worry. You'll get 
		another one next year.

INT. CAVE - NIGHT

All the boys but Knox and Charlie are gathered in the cave.

				BOYS
		"To live deep and suck out all the 
		marrow of life. To put to rout all that 
		was not life"

The boys stop as they hear the sound of female laughter outside.

				CAMERON
		Oh, my God! 

				GLORIA
		Is this it? 

				CHARLIE
		Yeah, this is it. Go ahead, go on in. 
		It's my cave. Watch your step. 

				TINA
		We're not gonna slip, are we? 

				GLORIA
		Uh-oh.

Gloria hops into the cave wearing a bright red shirt. The lights from
the boys' flashlights play conspicously over Gloria's chest. Tina
enters right behind her.

				GLORIA
		Hi.

Meeks stands up and slams his head into the low ceiling.

				MEEKS
		Hello. 

				GLORIA
		Hello. 

				CHARLIE
		Hi, you guys. Meet, uh, Gloria and-- 

				TINA
		Tina. 

				CHARLIE
		Tina. This is the pledge class of the 
		Dead Poets Society.
 
				BOYS
		Hello. How do you do? 

				NEIL
		Hello. 

				GLORIA
		Hi. Hi. 

				CHARLIE
		Guys, move. Move. Come on, folks. It's 
		Friday night. Let's get on with the 
		meeting.

The boys move aside to let the girls in.

				BOYS
		Sorry. Excuse- Excuse me. 

				CHARLIE
		Guys, I have an announcement to make. In 
		keeping with the spirit of passionate 
		experimentation of the Dead Poets, I'm 
		giving up the name Charlie Dalton. From 
		now on, call me Nuwanda. 

				PITTS
				(laughing)
		Nuwanda? 

				NEIL
		Nuwanda? 

Tina takes out a tube of red lipstick. Charlie takes it from her
and puts red marks on each of his cheeks.

INT. CHET'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Knox enters the house and looks anxiously about.

				KNOX
		Hello? Hello, Chris?

Knox stops and combs his hair in the hallway mirror. Chris comes
running out from one of the rooms.

				CHRIS
		Knox! 

				KNOX
		Hi. 

				CHRIS
		You made it. Great! Bring anybody? 

				KNOX
		No. 

Chris grabs Knox by his jackets and pulls him forward as she walks
toward the stairs.

				CHRIS
		No. Ginny Danburry's here. Wait. I have 
		to go find Chet. Why don't you go 
		downstairs where everybody is?

Chris runs up the stairs as Knox stares after her.

				CHRIS
		Make yourself at home. 

				KNOX
		But I--

INT. CHET'S BASEMENT - NIGHT

Knox stares at a couple kissing passionately. Across the room he sees
Chet and Chris dancing. He walks away.

INT. CHET'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Knox enters the kitchen, walking between several football players
to fill up a mug of beer from a keg.

				STEVE
		Hey, you Mutt Sanders' brother? Bubba, 
		this guy look like Mutt Sanders to you 
		or what? 

Bubba spits ice cubes into the sink.

				BUBBA
		You're his brother? 

				KNOX
		No relation. Never heard of him. Sorry, 
		guys. 

				BUBBA
			  (obviously drunk)
		Where's your manners Steve? Mutt Sanders' 
		brother, we don't even offer him a 
		drink. Here. Go have some whiskey, pal. 

Bubba hands Knox a glass and fills it up.

				STEVE
		Yeah. 

				KNOX
		Whoa, I, uh, I don't really drink-- 

				BUBBA
		To Mutt. 

				STEVE
		To Mutt.

The two guys raise their glasses in a toast and Knox reluctantly
joins them.

				KNOX
		To Mutt.

They each take a big drink. Knox rolls his eyes and gasps,
loosening his tie to try and breathe.

				BUBBA
		Now, how the hell is old Mutt, anyway? 

				STEVE
		Yeah. What's ol' Mutter been up to, huh? 

				KNOX
		I don't really know Mutt. 

				BUBBA
		To Mighty Mutt. 

				GUY 1
		To Mighty Mutt. 

				KNOX
		To Mighty Mutt.

They raise their glasses again for a toast and down the rest
of their glasses.

				BUBBA
		Well, listen, I gotta go find Patsy. Say 
		hello to Mutt for me, okay? 

				KNOX
		Will do.

Bubba puts on a horned football helmet and walks away.

				STEVE
		Yeah. Hell of a guy, your brother Mutt.

INT. CAVE - NIGHT

				CHARLIE
		We gonna have a meeting or what? 

				GLORIA
		Yeah. If you guys don't have a meeting, 
		how do we know if we wanna join? 

				NEIL
		Join? 

Charlie leans over to Tina.

				CHARLIE
		"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? 
		Thou art more lovely and more 
		temperate." 

				TINA
		That's so sweet. 

				CHARLIE
		I made that up just for you. 

				TINA
		You did?

The boys laugh and Cameron shakes his head. Charlie moves over
to sit next to Gloria.

				CHARLIE
		I'll write one for you too, Gloria. 
		She walks in beauty like the night. 
		She walks in beauty like the night. 
		Of cloudless climes and starry skies. 
		All that's best, dark and bright, 
		Meet in her aspect and her eyes. 

				GLORIA
		That's beautiful. 

				CHARLIE
		There's plenty more where that came 
		from.

INT. CHET'S BASEMENT - NIGHT

The room is whirling as Knox belches and staggers across the room. He
passes Chet and several of his friends. He steps over several couples
kissing on the floor and slump down on the couch, only to be crowded
in by another couple who seem oblivious to him. He is about to get up
again when he notices Chris sleeping next to him on the couch.

				KNOX
		God help me.

Knox looks about and then looks back down at Chris.

				KNOX
		Carpe diem.

Knox takes a last swig of his drink  and then begins to softly run his
fingers over Chris' hair. He then leans over and kisses her forehead.
Across the room, Bubba looks over and sees what's going on.

				BUBBA
		Chet! Chet! Look! 

				CHET
		What? 

				BUBBA
		It's Mutt Sanders' brother. 

				CHET
		Huh? 

Chris rises up from the couch and looks at Knox in surprise.

				CHRIS
		Knox, what-- 

				BUBBA
		And he's feeling up your girl! 

				CHRIS
		What are you doing? 

Chet gets up from his chair.

				CHET
		What the hell are you doing? 

				CHRIS
		Chet! Chet, don't. 

				KNOX
		Now, Chet, I know this looks bad, but 
		you've gotta-

Chet throws himself at Knox, hurling them both to the floor. He
then straddles Knox and begins to punch at him as Knox simply
tries to protect himself.

				CHRIS
		Chet, no! You'll hurt him! No! No! Stop 
		it! Leave him alone! 

				CHET
		Goddamn! 

				CHRIS
		Chet, stop it!

Chris manages to haul Chet away from Knox.

				CHET
		Bastard!

Knox takes his hands away from his face and feels at his bloody
nose. Chris tries to help him up.

				CHRIS
		Knox, are you all right? 

				CHET
		Chris, get the hell away from him! 

				CHRIS
		Chet, you hurt him! 

				CHET
		Good! 

				KNOX
		I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 

				CHRIS
		It's okay. It-It's okay.

Chet hauls Chris away from Knox and then points at him.

				CHET
		Next time I see you, you die. 

INT. CAVE - NIGHT

Tina passes a bottle of alcohol to Neil.

				TINA
		Go ahead, pass it around. 

Cameron motions for Neil not to take it but Neil takes a swig anyway.
There is a moment of awkward silence.

				MEEKS
		Me and Pitts are working on a hi-fi 
		system. It shouldn't be that hard to, 
		uh, to put together. 

				PITTS
		Yeah. Uh, I might be going to Yale. Uh, 
		uh, but, I, I might not. 

				GLORIA
		Don't you guys miss having girls around 
		here? 

				MEEKS AND PITTS
				  (smiling)
		Yeah.

				CHARLIE
		That's part of what this club is about. 
		In fact, I'd like to announce I 
		published an article in the school 
		paper, in the name of the Dead Poets. 

				CAMERON
		What? 

				CHARLIE
		Demanding girls be admitted to Welton. 

				PITTS
		You didn't. 

				CHARLIE
			    (whispering to Meeks)
		So we can all stop beating off. 

				NEIL
		How did you do that? 

				CHARLIE
		I'm one of the proofers. I slipped the 
		article in. 

				MEEKS
		Look, uh, it's, it's over now. 

				CHARLIE
		Why? Nobody knows who we are. 

				CAMERON
		Well, don't you think they're gonna 
		figure out who wrote it? They're gonna 
		come to you and ask to know what the 
		Dead Poets Society is. Charlie, you had 
		no right to do something like that. 

				CHARLIE
		It's Nuwanda, Cameron. 

				GLORIA
		That's right. It's Nuwanda. 

				CHARLIE
		Are we just playing around out here, or 
		do we mean what we say? For all we do is 
		come together and reach a bunch of poems 
		to each other. What the hell are we 
		doing? 

				NEIL
		All right, but you still shouldn't have 
		done it, Charlie. This could mean 
		trouble. You don't speak for the club. 

				CHARLIE
		Hey, would you not worry about your 
		precious little neck? If they catch me, 
		I'll tell them I made it up. 


INT. ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY

The professors hurry down the steps, lead by an obviously agitated
Mr. Nolan. Several are carrying newspapers in their hands. The
students all rise as they enter. After all the professors have
taken their places, Mr. Nolan addresses the students.

				MR. NOLAN
		Sit.

The students all sit.

				MR. NOLAN
		In this week of Welton's Honor there 
		appeared a profane and unauthorized 
		article. Rather than spend my valuable 
		time ferreting out the guilty persons -- 
		and let me assure you I will find them -
		- I'm asking any and all students who 
		knows anything about this article to 
		make themselves known here and now. 
		Whoever the guilty persons are, this is 
		your only chance to avoid expulsion from 
		this school.

The sound of a phone ringing can be heard. The professors look
about for its source. Charlie picks up a telephone receiver.

				CHARLIE
		Welton Academy. Hello. Yes, he is. Just 
		a moment.

Charlie stands up, holding a phone and bell in his hands.

				CHARLIE
		Mr. Nolan, it's for you. It's 
		God. He says we should have girls at 
		Welton.

Most of the students laugh while the boys from the cave all shake
their heads in disbelief.

INT. NOLAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Charlie stands with his back to the door as Mr. Nolan shuts it. Mr. 
Nolan then walks around to face Charlie.

				MR. NOLAN
		Wipe that smirk off your face. If you 
		think, Mr. Dalton, that you're the first 
		to try to get thrown out of this school, 
		think again. Others have had similar 
		notions and have failed just as surely 
		as you will fail. Assume the position.

Charlie sighs and bends over, resting his hands on the desk. Mr.
Nolan hefts a flat wooden paddle in his hands.

				MR. NOLAN
		Count aloud, Mr. Dalton.

Mr. Nolan begins to strike Charlie with the paddle.

				CHARLIE
		One. Two. Three. Four. Five. 

				MR. NOLAN
		What is this Dead Poets Society? I want 
		names.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

A crowd of students is gathered about as Charlie stiffly walks back to his room.

				NEIL
		You kicked out? 

				CHARLIE
		No. 

				NEIL
		So what happened? 

				CHARLIE
		I'm to turn everybody in, apologize to 
		the school and all will be forgiven. 

				NEIL
		So, what are you gonna do? Charlie! 

				CHARLIE
		Damn it, Neil. The name is Nuwanda.

Charlie smiles and then shuts his door.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Keating and McAllister are enjoying tea in the small room off the
classroom. Mr. Nolan knocks on the door and enters.

				MR. NOLAN
		Excuse me. May we have a word, Mr. 
		Keating? 

				KEATING
		Certainly.

Keating fixes his tie and follows Mr. Nolan into the classroom.

				MR. NOLAN
		This was my first classroom, John. Did 
		you know that? My first desk. 

				KEATING
		Didn't know you taught, Mr. Nolan. 

				MR. NOLAN
		English. Oh, long before your time. It 
		was hard giving it up, I can tell you. 
		I'm hearing rumors, John, about some 
		unorthodox teaching methods in your 
		classroom. I'm not saying they've 
		anything to do with the Dalton boy's 
		outburst. But I don't think I have to 
		warn you boys his age are very 
		impressionable. 

				KEATING
		Well, your reprimand made quite an 
		impression, I'm sure. 

				MR. NOLAN
		What was going on in the courtyard the 
		other day? 

				KEATING
		Courtyard? 

				MR. NOLAN
		Yeah. Boys marching, clapping in unison. 

				KEATING
		Oh, that. That was an exercise to prove 
		a point. Dangers of conformity. 

				MR. NOLAN
		Well, John, the curriculum here is set. 
		It's proven it works. If you question, 
		what's to prevent them from doing the 
		same? 

				KEATING
		I always thought the idea of educating 
		was to learn to think for yourself. 

				MR. NOLAN
		At these boys' ages? Not on your life! 
		Tradition, John. Discipline. Prepare 
		them for college, and the rest will take 
		care of itself.

INT. STUDY ROOM - DAY

Charlie sits with his bongos as the other boys are all crowded
around him. He hits the bongoes as he mimes Nolan's footsteps.

				CHARLIE
		Creak. He started walking around towards 
		my left. Creak. Creak. "Assume the 
		position, Mr. Dalton."

The door opens and Keating walks in. Many of the boys get up from
their seats.

				KEATING
		It's all right, gentlemen. 

				CHARLIE
		Mr. Keating. 

				KEATING
		Mr. Dalton. That was a pretty lame stunt 
		you pulled today. 

				CHARLIE
		You're siding with Mr. Nolan? What about 
		Carpe diem and sucking all the marrow 
		out of life and all that? 

				KEATING
		Sucking the marrow out of life doesn't 
		mean choking on the bone. Sure there's a 
		time for daring and there's a time for 
		caution, and a wise man understands 
		which is called for. 

				CHARLIE
		But I thought you'd like that. 

				KEATING
		No. You being expelled from school is 
		not daring to me. It's stupid, 'cause 
		you'll miss some golden opportunities. 

				CHARLIE
		Yeah. Like what? 

				KEATING
		Like, if nothing else, the opportunity 
		to attend my classes. Got it, Ace? 

				CHARLIE
		Aye, aye, Captain. 

				KEATING
		Keep your head about you. That goes for 
		the lot of you. 

				BOYS
		Yes, Captain. 

				KEATING
		Phone call from God. If it had been 
		collect, it wouldn't been daring.

Keating leaves and the boys gather around Charlie once again.

				CHARLIE
		All right. Go on.

EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

Neil bikes away as the clock bell tolls.

INT. THEATER - DAY

Neil walks into the back of the theater and watches various
actors rehearsing on stage. A smile fills his face.

				DIRECTOR
		We're trying to rehearse, okay? Start. 

				LYSANDER
		A good persuasion, therefore hear me, 
		Hermia. 

				DIRECTOR
		Wait, please. Excitement. I don't hear 
		any excitement about this play. And take 
		her hand. Bring her down the stage and 
		stop. And "There, gentle Hermia." Okay? 
		Try again.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

The bell rings and students rush down the hall.

				BOY
		What's for dinner? 

				PITTS
		Spaghetti and meatballs!

Neil comes up the stairs as everyone else swarms down to the cafeteria.

				NEIL
		Save some for me. "But, room, Fairy! 
		Here comes Oberon."

Neil opens the door to his room and sees his father sitting at his desk.

				NEIL
		Father. 

				MR. PERRY
		Neil. 

				NEIL
		Wait a minute. Before you say anything, 
		please let me ex-

Mr. Perry rises from the desk.

				MR. PERRY
		Don't you dare talk back to me! It's bad 
		enough that you've wasted your time with 
		this, this absurd acting business. But 
		you deliberately deceived me! How, how, 
		how did you expect to get away with 
		this? Answer me. Who put you up to it? 
		Was it this new man? This, uh, Mr. 
		Keating? 

				NEIL
		No. Nobody-- I thought I'd surprise you. 
		I've gotten all A's in every class. 

				MR. PERRY
		Did you think I wasn't going to find 
		out? "Oh, my niece is in a play with 
		your son," says Mrs. Marks. "No, no, 
		no," I say, "you must be mistaken. My 
		son's not in a play." You made me a liar 
		of me, Neil! Now, tomorrow you go to 
		them and you tell them that you're 
		quitting. 

				NEIL
		No, I can't. I have the main part. The 
		performance is tomorrow night. 

				MR. PERRY
		I don't care if the world comes to an 
		end tomorrow night. You are through with 
		that play. Is that clear? Is that clear? 

				NEIL
		Yes, sir. 

Mr. Perry goes to leave and then turns around.

				MR. PERRY
		I made a great many sacrifices to get 
		you here, Neil, and you will not let me 
		down. 

				NEIL
		No, sir. 

INT. KEATING'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Keating is seated at his desk. He is writing a letter and occasionally
looks up at the framed photo on his desk of a woman playing the cello.
There is a knock at the door.

				KEATING
		It's open.

Neil enters and closes the door behind him. He appears to be nervous.

				KEATING
		Neil, what's up? 

				NEIL
		Can I speak to you a minute? 

				KEATING
		Certainly. Sit down.

Neil goes to take a seat but notices the chair is piled up with books.
Neil picks them up and Keating gets up from his seat to help him.

				NEIL
		I'm sorry. Here. 

				KEATING
		Excuse me. Get you some tea? 

				NEIL
		Tea. Sure.

Keating goes to a table in the corner and begins pouring several cups.

				KEATING
		Like some milk or sugar in that? 

				NEIL
		No, thanks. 

				NEIL
		Gosh, they don't give you much room 
		around here. 

				KEATING
		No, it's part of the monastic oath. They 
		don't want worldly things distracting me 
		from my teaching.

Keating gives Neil a cup of tea and they return to their seats. Neil
looks at the photo on the desk.

				NEIL
		She's pretty. 

				KEATING
		She's also in London. Makes it a little 
		difficult. 

				NEIL
		How can you stand it? 

				KEATING
		Stand what? 

				NEIL
		You can go anywhere. You can do 
		anything. How can you stand being here? 

				KEATING
		'Cause I love teaching. I don't wanna be 
		anywhere else. 

				KEATING
		What's up? 

				NEIL
		I just talked to my father. He's making 
		me quit the play at Henley Hall. 
		Acting's everything to me. I-- But he 
		doesn't know. He-- I can see his point. 
		We're not a rich family like Charlie's, 
		and we-- But he's planning the rest of 
		my life for me, and I-- H-He's never 
		asked me what I want. 

				KEATING
		Have you ever told your father what you 
		just told me? About your passion for 
		acting. You ever show him that? 

				NEIL
		I can't. 

				KEATING
		Why not? 

				NEIL
		I can't talk to him this way. 

				KEATING
		Then you're acting for him, too. You're 
		playing the part of the dutiful son. I 
		know this sounds impossible, but you 
		have to talk to him. You have to show 
		him who you are, what your heart is. 

				NEIL
		I know what he'll say. He'll tell me 
		that acting's a whim, and I should 
		forget it. That how they're counting on 
		me. He'll just tell me to put it out of 
		my mind, "for my own good." 

				KEATING
		You are not an indentured servant. If 
		it's not a whim for you, you prove it to 
		him by your conviction and your passion. 
		You show him that And if he still 
		doesn't believe you, well, by then 
		you'll be out of school and you can do 
		anything you want. 

A tear falls down Neil's cheek and he wipes it away.

				NEIL
		No. What about the play? The show's 
		tomorrow night. 

				KEATING
		Well, you have to talk to him before 
		tomorrow night. 

				NEIL
		Isn't there an easier way? 

				KEATING
		No. 

				NEIL
		I'm trapped. 

				KEATING
		No, you're not.

EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

Knox exits one of the doors. The ground is covered with a thick
layer of snow. He looks around to see if anyone is about and then
hurries over to the bike rack. grabbing one of the bikes, he hurries
off.

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

A crowd of students come in from the cold. Knox pushes his way through
them, carrying a handful of wildflowers. He begins searching for Chris.

				KNOX
		Chris!

He approaches a girl with hair similar to Chris' and turns her around,
only to realize that it's not her.

				KNOX
		Chris Noel. Do you know where she is? 

				GIRL
		Um, I think she's in room 111.

The girl points down the hallway and Knox sets off in that direction.

				KNOX
		Thanks.

Chris is at her locker talking to a friend. She just closes her locker
as she notices Knox coming towards her. She turns away.

				KNOX
		Excuse me. Chris. 

				CHRIS
		Knox, what are you doing here? 

				KNOX
		I came to apologize for the other night. 
		I brought you these and a poem I wrote 
		for you.

Chris pulls him aside, out of the main hallway.

				CHRIS
		Knox, don't you know that, if Chet finds 
		you here he'll kill you? 

				KNOX
		I can't care. I love you, Chris. 

				CHRIS
		Knox, you're crazy. 

				KNOX
		Look, I acted like a jerk and I know it. 
		Please, accept these. Please. 

				CHRIS
		No. No-- I, I can't. Forget it.

Chris walks away. The school bell rings and she enters her
classroom, closing the door behind her. Undaunted, Knox follows,
opening the door and standing before her desk.

				CHRIS
		Knox, I don't believe this. 

				KNOX
		All I'm asking you to do is listen.

As Knox begins to read his poem, the classroom grows quiet as
everyone stops to listen.

				KNOX
		The heavens made a girl named Chris 
		With hair and skin of gold. 
		To touch her would be paradise.

Chris holds her head in her hands in embarrassment.

INT. CAMPUS KITCHEN - DAY

Knox sneaks in through a side door. He snatches a slice of toast
from the counter and motions to one of the staff to keep secret.
He then begins to eat the toast as he hurries away.

INT. STAIRWAY - DAY

The school bell rings and Knox pushes his way up the stairs past
the slower students. At the top he joins the other boys where they
are grabbing their books.

				CHARLIE
		Get out of here. Cameron, you fool.

Charlie notices Knox and grabs his jacket.

				CHARLIE
		Hey, how'd it go? Did you read it to
		her? 

				KNOX
		Yeah.

The boys begin to get all excited but Charlie shushes them.

				PITTS
		What'd she say? 

				KNOX
		Nothing. 

				CHARLIE
		Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? 

				KNOX
		Nothing. But I did it.

Knox walks away down the hall and the others chase after him.

				CHARLIE
		What did she say? I know she had to say 
		something. 

				PITTS
		Come here, Knox. 

				KNOX
		Seize the day!

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Keating walks from the front of the classroom to Neil's desk. Neil
is the only student remaining in the class.

				KEATING
		Did you talk to your father? 

				NEIL
		Uh, he didn't like it one bit, but at 
		least he's letting me stay in the play. 
		He won't be able to make, make it. He's 
		in Chicago. But, uh, I think he's gonna 
		let me stay with acting. 

				KEATING
		Really? You told him what you told me? 

				NEIL
		Yeah. He wasn't happy. But he'll be gone 
		at least four days. I don't think he'll 
		make the show, but I think he'll let me 
		stay with it. "Keep up the school work." 
		Thanks.

Neil picks up his books and leaves.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

The boys are grooming themselves in front of the mirrors.

				PITTS
		Beautiful baby. 

				MEEKS
		Beautiful baby. Henley Hall, here I 
		come. 

				CAMERON
		Excuse me, just a moment. Yes. You're so 
		cute.

Cameron runs a comb through his hair and Todd tries to mess it up.

				CAMERON
		Come on, Todd. I'm trying to fix 
		this. 

				TODD
		Come on, Nuwanda. You're gonna miss 
		Neil's entrance. 

				PITTS
		He said something about getting red 
		before we left. 

				CAMERON
		Getting red? What does that mean? 

				PITTS
		I, uh-- Well, you know Charlie.

One of the stalls opens and Charlie's hand emerges, holding a small
brush and a bottle of red paint.

				CAMERON
		So, Charlie, what's this "getting red" 
		bit?

Charlie opens his unbuttoned shirt to show a large red lightning bolt
painted down his chest.

				TODD
		W-What is that? 

				CHARLIE
		It's an Indian warrior symbol for 
		virility. Makes me feel potent, like it 
		can drive girls crazy.

Charlie buttons up his shirt as everyone prepares to leave.

				TODD
		Oh, come on, Charlie. The girls are 
		waiting.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

The boys are walking down the hall to leave. Cameron stops and stares.
The other boys notice and stop as well. Charlie softly whistles at Chris

Knox leaves the other boys to join her.

				KNOX
		What are you doing here? 

				KEATING (O.S.)
		Gentlemen, let's go. 

				KNOX
		Go ahead, guys. I'll catch up. 

				CHARLIE
		Yeah, come on, guys.

Charlie hustles the boys away. Meeks remains staring at her. Charlie
returns to drag him away.

				KNOX
		Chris, you can't be in here. I-If they 
		catch you, we're both gonna be in big 
		trouble. 

				CHRIS
		Oh, but it's fine--

Knox shushes her and leads her out the door.

EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT

Snow is lightly falling as Chris and Knox walk outside.

				CHRIS
		It's fine for you to come barging into 
		my school and make a complete fool out 
		of me? 

				KNOX
		I didn't mean to make a fool out of you. 

				CHRIS
		Well, you did. Chet found out. And it 
		took everything I could do to keep him 
		from coming here and killing you. Knox, 
		you have got to stop this stuff. 

				KNOX
		I can't, Chris. I love you. 

				CHRIS
		Knox, you say that over and over. You 
		don't, you don't even know me. 

Keating calls out from a nearby car.

				KEATING
		Will you be joining us, Mr. Overstreet?

				KNOX
		Go ahead, Captain. I'll walk. 

				CHRIS
		Knox, Knox, it just so happens that I 
		could care less about you? 

				KNOX
		Then you wouldn't be here warning me 
		about Chet. 

				CHRIS
		I have to go. I'm gonna be late for the 
		play. 

				KNOX
		Are you going with him? 

				CHRIS
				   (laughs)
		Chet? To a play? Are you kidding? 

				KNOX
		Then come with me. 

				CHRIS
		Knox, you are so infuriating. 

				KNOX
		Come on, Chris. Just give me one chance. 
		If you don't like me after tonight, I'll 
		stay away forever. 

				CHRIS
		Uh-huh. 

				KNOX
		I promise. Dead Poets Honor. You come 
		with me tonight. And then, if you don't 
		want to see me again, I swear I'll bow 
		out. 
		
				CHRIS
		You know what would happen if Chet found 
		out? 

				KNOX
		He won't know anything. We'll sit in the 
		back and sneak away as soon as it's 
		over. 

				CHRIS
		And I suppose you would promise that 
		this would be the end of it. 

				KNOX
		Dead Poets Honor. 

				CHRIS
		What is that? 

				KNOX
		My word.

Chris walks away from him and then turns to face him.

				CHRIS
		You are so infuriating.

Chris gestures for Knox to follow her. Charlie does a little 
twirl as he joins her and puts his arm around her. They walk away.

INT. THEATER - NIGHT

The audience is packed. The stage is set up to resemble a forest and
lights dance about it. From behind a bush, Neil emerges, wearing a
crown of twigs and berries and twigs on his hands. In the audience,
Charlie emerges from his seat, all excited.

				CHARLIE
		Hey, there he is! Hey, hey.

Cameron shoves him back into his seat.

				KEATING
		Shh, boys.

On stage, Neil hides behind a tree as a girl emerges, similarly clad,
but with flowers in her hair. Neil sneaks over to the girl.

				FAIRY

		Either I mistake your shape and making 
		quite, 
		Or else you are that shrewd and knavish 
		sprite 
		Call'd Robin Goodfellow: 

				PUCK

		Thou speak'st aright;

In the audience, Chris and Knox enter and are shown to seats.

				PUCK
		I am that merry wanderer of the night. 
		I jest to Oberon and make him smile 
		When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,

Puck makes horse sounds and the audience laughs.

				PUCK
		Neighing in likeness of a filly foal: 
		And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl, 
		In very likeness of a roasted crab, 
		And when she drinks, against her lips I 
		bob 
		And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale. 
		The wisest aunt, telling the saddest 
		tale,

In the audience, Charlie leans over towards Keating.

				CHARLIE
				  (whispering)
		He's good. He's really good.

Keating gives a thumbs up.

				PUCK

		Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh 
		me; 
		Then slip I from her bum, down topples 
		she, 
		And "tailor" cries, and falls into a 
		cough; 
		And then the whole quire hold their hips 
		and laugh, 
		And waxen in their mirth and neeze and 
		swear 
		A merrier hour was never wasted there. 
		But, room, Fairy! here comes Oberon. 

				FAIRY

		And here my mistress. Would that he were 
		gone!

The two actors hide behind the trees, lifting their twig covered
hands to hide themselves.

INT. THEATER - NIGHT

Two other actors are onstage. 

				LYSANDER

		Then by your side no bed-room me deny; 
		For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie 

				HERMIA

		Lysander riddles very prettily: 
		Now much beshrew my manners and my 
		pride, 
		If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied. 
		But, gentle friend, for love and 
		courtesy 
		Lie further off; in human modesty, 
		Such separation as may well be said 
		Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid, 
		and, good night, sweet friend: 
		Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life 
		end!

Neil is watching the actors from the wing. He glances out at the audience
and sees his father enter the back of the theater. Neil backs away into
the shadows.

				LYSANDER

		Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;

The director breaks Neil out of his thoughts.

				DIRECTOR
		Neil. That's your cue, Neil. Come on, 
		Neil. Here's your crown. Let's go.

Neil reluctantly replaces his crown and follows her.

INT. THEATER - NIGHT

On stage, Neil collects dew in a leaf and holds it over his head while
fairies dance about. In the audience, Knox takes Chris' hand in his.

INT. THEATER - NIGHT

The stage is dark. A spotlight comes on to reveal Neil with his back to
the audience. He slowly turns around to face the audience and his father.

				PUCK

		If we shadows have offended,

Neil directs his eyes at his father, who stills stands at the back
of the theater.

				PUCK
		Think but this, and all is mended, 
		That you have but slumber'd here 
		While these visions did appear. 
		And this weak and idle theme, 
		No more yielding but a dream, 
		Gentles, do not reprehend: 
		If you pardon, we will mend: 
		And, as I am an honest Puck, 
		If we have unearned luck 
		Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue, 
		We will make amends ere long; 
		Else the Puck a liar call; 
		So, good night unto you all. 
		Give me your hands, if we be friends, 
		And Robin shall restore amends.

Neil backs away and the curtains close as the audience begins to
applaud enthusiastically. Behind the curtain numerous people
congratulate Neil as they line up for the curtain call. The curtains
open. Charlie and the other boys rise to their feet, followed quickly
by the rest of the audience. The actors bow to continued applause. The
actors push Neil forward and he takes a second bow.

				BOYS
		Yawp! 

				KNOX
		Yeah, Neil!

The curtain closes again and Neil turns around, letting out an
excited sigh. Various actors continue to congratulate him. Neil
lets out a yell as he walks offstage. In the audience, while others
are leaving, Mr. Perry approaches a woman.

				MR. PERRY
		Excuse me, I'm Neil's father. I need to 
		see him.

Backstage, the woman approaches Neil.

				WOMAN
		Neil, Your father. He's-

Neil nods in agreement.

				ACTOR
		What did you think?

				WOMAN
		Really I thought you were all just 
		wonderful!

Neil emerges from the curtains, carrying his costume. The theater is
nearly empty now, except for Mr. Perry standing at the back. Neil
smiles at him but the smile quickly disappears.

EXT. THEATER - NIGHT

Mr. Perry pushes his way through the crowd of people, with Neil close
behind.

				MR. PERRY
		Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

The boys notice Neil and try to dtop him to talk.

				CHARLIE
		Neil, Neil, you were great. 

				NEIL
		I can't, guys. 

				TODD
		Neil! Neil!

Outside of the crowd, Keating manages to catch up to Neil. He takes
hold of Neil's coat.

				KEATING
		Neil. Neil. You have the gift. What a 
		performance You left even me speechless. 
		You have to stay with-

Mr. Perry returns from his car and shoves Neil aside.

				MR. PERRY
		Get in the car. Keating, you stay away 
		from my son. 

				CHARLIE
		Neil! Neil! Mr. Perry, come on. 

				KEATING
		Don't make it any worse than it is.

Neil and Mr. Perry get into their car and drive away. Keating
stares after them.

				CHARLIE
		Is it okay if we walk back? Captain?

Charlie motions Todd to follow.

				CHARLIE
		Knox.

The boys leave and Keating continues to stare after the car, wiping
the falling snow from his face.

INT. MR. PERRY'S STUDY - NIGHT

A photo of Neil standing stiffly with his parents sits on a table
between a glass of alcohol and a half filled ashtray. Mrs. Perry
watches through the window as her husband and son arrive and then
takes a nervous puff on her cigarette before sitting down. Mr.
Perry walks in with Neil close behind him. Neil sits down beside the
desk while Mr. Perry remains standing.

				MR. PERRY
		We're trying very hard to understand why 
		it is that you insist on defying us. 
		Whatever the reason, we're not gonna let 
		you ruin your life. Tomorrow I'm 
		withdrawing you from Welton and 
		enrolling you in Braden Military School. 
		You're going to Harvard and you're gonna 
		be a doctor. 

				NEIL
		But that's ten more years. Father, 
		that's a lifetime! 

				MR. PERRY
		Oh, stop it. Don't be so dramatic. You 
		make it sound like a prison term. You 
		don't understand, Neil. You have 
		opportunities that I never even dreamt 
		of and I am not going to let you waste 
		them.

Neil rises to his feet.

				NEIL
		I've got to tell you what I feel.

Mrs. Perry stands up.

				MRS. PERRY
		We've been so worried about-- 

				MR. PERRY
		What? What? Tell me what you feel. What 
		is it?

Neil looks to his mother and then back to his father but says
nothing.

				MR. PERRY
		Is it more of this, this acting 
		business? Because you can forget that. 
		What? 

				NEIL
		Nothing.

Neil sits back down dejectedly.

				MR. PERRY
		Nothing? Well, then, let's go to bed.

Mr. Perry leaves. Mrs. Perry pauses on her way out and kneels
behind Neil.

				NEIL
		I was good. I was really good.

Mrs. Perry nods slightly.
				MRS. PERRY
		Go on, get some sleep.

INT. MR. PERRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mrs. Perry sits on the side of the bed with her back to her
husband. Mr. Perry removes his robe and slippers before
getting in to bed. Mrs. Perry begins to cry as he turns out
the light.

				MR. PERRY
		It's all right. It's going to be all 
		right.

INT. NEIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Neil's pyjamas, bathrobe, towel, and shaving kit are all neatly
laid out on his bed. Neil touches his pyjamas lightly and then
removes his coat and shirt. He walks over to the windows and
opens them, taking several deep breaths. He places the crown of
twigs on his head and then closes his eyes, slowly letting his head
fall to his chest.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

A door opens and Neil emerges, slowly walking down the stairs as if
in a trance.

INT. MR. PERRY'S STUDY - NIGHT

Neil holds a key in his hands. He unlocks a drawer in his father's
desk and pulls out a pistol, wrapped in cloth.

INT. MR. PERRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mr. Perry jerks up out of bed, startled and breathing fast.

				MR. PERRY
		What was that? 

				MRS. PERRY
		What? 

				MR. PERRY
		That sound. 

				MRS. PERRY
		What sound? Tom?

Mr. Perry turns on the light and gets up out of bed, putting on his
robe and slippers.
				MRS. PERRY
		What is it? What's wrong? 

Mr. Perry turns on the hallway light and knocks on Neil's door. He opens
the door and goes inside.

				MR. PERRY
		Neil.

Mr. Perry notices the open window.

				MRS. PERRY
		Tom, what is it? What's wrong? Neil?

Mr. Perry continues to look through the house, continuing downstairs.

				MR. PERRY
		Neil?

Mr. Perry notices the door to his study is ajar.

				MRS. PERRY
		I'll look outside. Neil?

Mr. Perry flicks the light on but sees nothing. Then he smells
something. Looking closer, he sees a thin cloud of smoke rising from
behind his desk. As he moves around the desk he sees his gun on the
floor and Neil's outstretched hand.

				MR. PERRY
		No!

Mr. Perry crouches down by his son.

				MR. PERRY
		Oh, Neil! Oh, my God!

Mrs. Perry enters the room and sees her son.

				MRS. PERRY
		Oh! No! 

				MR. PERRY
		Oh, my son! 

				MRS. PERRY
		He's all right. 

				MR. PERRY
		My son! My poor son! 

				MRS. PERRY
			    (crying hysterically)
		He's all right! He's all right! He's all 
		right! He's all right! He's all right! 
		He's all right! 

				MR. PERRY
		Stop it! Stop it! Stop it.

Mr. Perry holds his wife and tries to comfort her.

INT. TODD'S ROOM - NIGHT

Todd is sleeping. Charlie reaches across to wake him. Tears are
running down his face.

				CHARLIE
		Todd? Todd.

Todd, still half asleep, tries to shrug him off.

				TODD
		Oh, Charlie.

Todd opens his eyes and sees Charlie's face

				TODD
		What is it?

Todd looks over to see Pitts, Meeks, and Knox by the door.

				CHARLIE
		Neil's dead.

EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

It is a snowy, overcast morning. Todd walks through the snow. He
has his coat on over his pyjamas. The other boys follow closely
behind him as he walks down towards the water. He stops and stares
out at the snow-covered surroundings.

				TODD
		It's so beautiful.

Todd begins to gag and then goes down on his knees, vomiting into
the snow. The other boys huddle around him, hugging him.

				CHARLIE
		Todd. It's okay, Todd. 

				PITTS
		Calm down. 

				CHARLIE
		It's all right, Todd. 

				PITTS
		Todd, it's okay. It's okay, Todd. 

				CHARLIE
		It's all right. It's alright.

Charlie grabs a handful of snow and wipes Todd's mouth with it. 

				TODD
		He wouldn't-- He wouldn't have done it. 

				MEEKS
		You can't explain it, Todd. 

				TODD
		It was his father! 

				CHARLIE
		No! 

				TODD
		He wouldn't have left us. It's because he-
		He wouldn't have. His dad was-- his, his 
		father did it. 

				CHARLIE
		Todd. 

				TODD
		His father killed him. He made him do it.

				MEEKS
		You can't explain it, Todd.

Todd pushes himself away from the boys and stumbles down the hill,
slipping and falling in the snow.

				MEEKS
		Todd! 

				CHARLIE
		Leave him be.

The boys watch as Todd runs down towards the dock by the river,
yelling and crying. He finally seems to regain control of himself
and walks in silence out onto the dock.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Keating sits by himself at his desk. After a moment he gets up
and walks over to Neil's desk. Opening it, he finds his copy
of "Five Centuries of Verse" and flips through the first few pages.
Sitting down at the desk, he returns to the opening page, reading
the opening verse written there. Keating begins to sob, then closes
the book.

INT. ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY

A church service is going on. The boys have joined in the other
students in a hymn. Charlie is the only one not singing. He stares
off into nothingness.

				BOYS
				 (singing)
		All my life 
		Thy light shall surely follow me 
		And in God's house forevermore 
		My dwelling place shall be 
		Amen.

Mr. Nolan stands at the pulpit, with the rest of the professors
seated behind him.

				MR. NOLAN
		The death of Neil Perry is a tragedy. He 
		was a fine student. One of Welton's 
		best. And he will be missed. We've 
		contacted each of your parents to 
		explain the situation. Naturally, 
		they're all quite concerned. At the 
		request of Neil's family, I intend to 
		conduct a thorough inquiry into this 
		matter. Your complete cooperation is 
		expected.

INT. CLOAKROOM - DAY

The boys (except Cameron) are sitting about the cluttered room
waiting. Charlie lights a cigarette.

				CHARLIE
		You told him about this meeting? 

				PITTS
		Twice. 

				CHARLIE
		That's it, guys. We're all fried. 

				PITTS
		How do you mean? 

				CHARLIE
		Cameron's a fink. He's in Nolan's office 
		right now, finking. 

				PITTS
		About what? 

				CHARLIE
		The club, Pittsie. Think about it. The 
		board of directors, the trustees and Mr. 
		Nolan. Do you think for one moment 
		they're gonna let this thing just blow 
		over? Schools go down because of things 
		like this. They need a scapegoat.

The door opens. All the boys except Charlie hurry to put
their cigarettes out and wave the smoke away. A light comes on
and Cameron enters.

				CAMERON
		What's going on, guys? 

				CHARLIE
		You finked, didn't you, Cameron?

Charlie gets up and approaches Cameron, tossing his cigarette away.

				CAMERON
		Finked? I didn't know what the hell 
		you're talking about. 

				CHARLIE
		You told Nolan everything about the club 
		is what I'm talking about. 

				CAMERON
		Look, in case you hadn't heard, Dalton, 
		there's something called an honor code 
		at this school, all right? If a teacher 
		asks you a question, you tell the truth 
		or you're expelled. 

				CHARLIE
		You little-

Charlie lunges at Cameron but Knox and Meeks hold him back.

				MEEKS
		Charlie! 

				CHARLIE
		He's a rat! He's in it up to his eyes, 
		so he rattled to save himself. 

				KNOX
		Don't touch him, Charlie. You do and 
		you're out. 

				CHARLIE
		I'm out anyway! 

				KNOX
		You don't know that, not yet. 

				CAMERON
		He's right there, Charlie. And if you 
		guys are smart, you will do exactly what 
		I did and cooperate. They're not after 
		us. We're the victims. Us and Neil. 

				CHARLIE
		What's that mean? Who are they after? 

				CAMERON
		Why, Mr. Keating, of course. The 
		"Captain" himself. I mean, you guys 
		didn't really think he could avoid 
		responsibility, did you? 

				CHARLIE
		Mr. Keating responsible for Neil? Is 
		that what they're saying? 

				CAMERON
		Well, who else do you think, dumb ass? 
		The administration? Mr. Perry? Mr. 
		Keating put us up to all this crap, 
		didn't he? If he wasn't for Mr. Keating, 
		Neil would be cozied up in his room 
		right now, studying his chemistry and 
		dreaming of being called doctor. 

				TODD
		That is not true, Cameron. You know 
		that. He didn't put us to anything. Neil 
		loved acting. 

				CAMERON
		Believe what you want, but I say let 
		Keating fry. I mean, why ruin our lives?

Charlie lunges at Cameron again and punches him in the face.
Cameron falls to the floor as the boys pull Charlie away. Cameron
lifts a hand to his bloody nose.

				CAMERON
		You just signed your expulsion papers, 
		Nuwanda.

Cameron rises to his feet.

				CAMERON
		And if the rest of you are smart, you'll 
		do exactly what I did. They know 
		everything anyway. You can't save 
		Keating, but you can save yourselves.

Cameron walks away, closing the door behind him.

INT. TODD'S ROOM - DAY

Todd looks out the window and watches as Hager escorts Meeks back
to the dorm. Inside the room, Neil's bed has been stripped of all
its bedding.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Meeks walks slowly to his room. Hager remains standing at the end of
the hallway.

				HAGER
		Knox Overstreet.

Knox emerges from his room and goes to joing Hager. He gives a thumbs
up to Todd as he passes his door. Once he leaves with Hager, Todd goes
over to Meeks' door.

				TODD
		Meeks? 

				MEEKS
		Go away. I have to study. 

				TODD
		What happened to Nuwanda? 

				MEEKS
		Expelled. 

				TODD
		What'd you tell 'em? 

				MEEKS
		Nothing they didn't already know. 

				HAGER (O.S.)
		Todd Anderson.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Todd is lead up the steps to Mr. Nolan's office by Hager.

INT. NOLAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Todd enters the room to see his mother and father seated opposite
Mr. Nolan's desk.

				MR. ANDERSON
		Hello, son. 

				MRS. ANDERSON
		Hello, darling. 

				TODD
		Mom.

THe door closes behind Todd. He remains standing, not knowing
what to do.

				MR. NOLAN
		Have a seat, Mr. Anderson.

Todd sits down next to his parents.

				MR. NOLAN
		Mr. Anderson, I think we've pretty well 
		put together what's happened here. You 
		do admit to being a part of this Dead 
		Poets Society?

Todd says nothing.

				MR. ANDERSON
		Answer him, Todd. 

				TODD
		Yes, sir.

Mr. Nolan puts his glasses on and glances at a paper before him
before removing his glasses once more.

				MR. NOLAN
		I have here a detailed description of 
		what occurred at your meetings. It 
		describes how your teacher, Mr. Keating, 
		encouraged you boys to organize this 
		club and to use it as a source of 
		inspiration for reckless and self-
		indulgent behavior. It describes how Mr. 
		Keating, both in and out of the 
		classroom, encouraged Neil Perry to 
		follow his obsession with acting when he 
		knew all along it was against the 
		explicit order of Neil's parents. It was 
		Mr. Keating's blatant abuse of his 
		position as teacher that led directly to 
		Neil Perry's death. 

Mr. Nolan motions to Todd's father, who passes along a sheet of
paper to Todd.

				MR. NOLAN
		Read that document carefully, Todd. Very 
		carefully.

Todd looks at the paper, which already contains the signatures of
the other four boys.

				MR. NOLAN
		If you've nothing to add or amend, sign 
		it. 

				TODD
		What's gonna happen to Mr. Keating? 

				MR. ANDERSON
		I've had enough. Sign the paper, Todd.

Mr. Nolan holds out a pen for Todd to take.

EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

Mr. McAllister leads his students, textbooks in hand, through the
snow outside the classrooms.

				McALLISTER
		Grass is gramen or herba. Lapis is 
		stone. The entire building is 
		aedificium.

Keating looks out from his office window. McAllister pauses and looks
up at Keating, giving him a brief wave. Keating waves back.

INT. KEATING'S OFFICE - DAY

Keating laughs slightly as he watches McAllister from the window.
Inside, all his belongings have been packed up.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

The students are all seated at their desks in silence. Everyone looks
as the door opens. They quickly stand as Mr. Nolan enters the room.

				MR. NOLAN
		Sit.

The students sit once again as Mr. Nolan walks to the front of the room.

				MR. NOLAN
		I'll be teaching this class through 
		exams. We'll find a permanent English 
		teacher during the break. Who will tell 
		me where you are in the Pritchard 
		textbook? 

				MR. NOLAN
		Mr. Anderson?

				TODD
		Uh, in the, in the Pr- 

				MR. NOLAN
		I can't hear you, Mr. Anderson. 

				TODD
		In the, in the, in the Pritchard? 

				MR. NOLAN
		Kindly inform me, Mr. Cameron. 

				CAMERON
		We skipped around a lot, sir. We covered 
		the Romantics and some of the chapters 
		on Post Civil War literature. 

				MR. NOLAN
		What about the Realists? 

				CAMERON
		I believe we skipped most of that, sir. 

				MR. NOLAN
		All right, then, we'll start over. What 
		is poetry?

There is a knock at the classroom door.

				MR. NOLAN
		Come.

The students look back as the door opens. They quickly turn
away when hey see it is Keating.

				KEATING
		Excuse me. I came for my personals. 
		Should I come back after class? 

				MR. NOLAN
		Get them now, Mr. Keating. 

				MR. NOLAN
		Gentlemen, turn to page 21 of the 
		introduction. Mr. Cameron, read aloud 
		the excellent essay by Dr. Pritchard on 
		"Understanding Poetry."

Todd slowly closes his book. Keating opens the door to the tiny
room off the classroom.

				CAMERON
		That page has been ripped out, sir. 

				MR. NOLAN
		Well, borrow somebody else's book. 

				CAMERON
		They're all ripped out, sir. 

				MR. NOLAN
		What do you mean, they're all ripped 
		out? 

				CAMERON
		Sir, we, uh- 

				MR. NOLAN
		Never mind.

Mr. Nolan takes his own book over to Cameron's desk and then
slaps the open page.

				MR. NOLAN
		Read!

As Cameron begins to read, Keating looks out at Todd as he puts
his scarf on. Todd looks at him for a moment and then glances away.

				CAMERON
		"Understanding Poetry by Dr. J Evans 
		Pritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand 
		poetry, we must first be fluent with its 
		meter, rhyme and figures of speech, then 
		ask two questions: 1) How artfully has 
		the objective of the poem been rendered 
		and 2)..."

The door squeaks as Keating shuts it behind him. Cameron pauses. 

				CAMERON
		"... How important is that objective? 
		Question 1 rates the poem's perfection; 
		question 2 rates its importance. And 
		once these questions have been answered, 
		determining the poem's greatness becomes 
		a relatively simple matter. If the 
		poem's score for perfection is plotted 
		on the horizontal of a graph--"

Keating passes by Todd and the others and gets to the back of the
classroom before Todd leaps up from his seat and turns to face him.

				TODD
		Mr. Keating! They made everybody sign 
		it. 

Mr. Nolan gets up from his desk and approaches Todd.

				MR. NOLAN
		Quiet, Mr. Anderson. 

				TODD
		You gotta believe me. It's true. 

				KEATING
		I do believe you, Todd. 

				MR. NOLAN
		Leave, Mr. Keating. 

				TODD
		But it wasn't his fault! 

				MR. NOLAN
		Sit down, Mr. Anderson!

Todd reluctantly returns to his seat.

				MR. NOLAN
		One more outburst from you or anyone
		else, and you're out of this school!
		Leave, Mr. Keating.

Keating hesitates at the back of the classroom.

				MR. NOLAN
		I said leave, Mr. Keating.

Keating slowly turns and heads to the door. As he opens
it, Todd, stands upon his desk and turns to Keating.

				TODD
		O Captain! My Captain! 

				MR. NOLAN
		Sit down, Mr. Anderson!

Keating pauses at the door and looks back at Todd on his desk.

				MR. NOLAN
		Do you hear me? Sit down! Sit down! This 
		is your final warning, Anderson. How 
		dare you? Do you hear me?

After a moment of indecision, Knox climbs up onto his desk.

				KNOX
		O Captain! My Captain! 

				MR. NOLAN
		Mr. Overstreet, I warn you! Sit down!

Pitts climbs up onto his desk, followed by several others,
including Meeks.

				MR. NOLAN
		Sit down! Sit down. All of you. I want 
		you seated. Sit down. Leave, Mr. 
		Keating.

More students stand on their desks until half the class is standing.

				MR. NOLAN

		Sit down! 

Keating stands in the doorway, staring up at the boys in wonder. A
smile comes to his face.

		Thank you, boys. Thank you.

1   INT. CARGO PLANE. MILITARY AIRBASE. ISRAEL - DAY              1

    A strange ROARING sound...


    CLOSE ON A YOUNG WOMAN

    ...in darkness. Light begins to spill on her from the right
    - revealing her face, lost in thought. This is RACHEL
    SINGER - pretty, painfully young looking. A surgical
    dressing covers half her face.

    As we pull back a little we see that two YOUNG MEN sit
    either side of her. They are STEPHAN GOLD (thirties) thick-
    set, capable, and DAVID PERETZ (late twenties), dark-haired
    and pale-faced.

    The three faces in the darkness, each looking straight
    ahead - something from a Caravaggio painting.

    The roaring, which we realise is the sound of ENGINES,
    gradually runs down into silence.

    The light from the bay door which is opening off-screen
    begins to flood the scene with HARSH DAYLIGHT, revealing
    the inside of a CARGO PLANE.

    Stephan turns to look at the growing light. Then he turns
    to Rachel.

                         STEPHAN
              Breathe.

    He stands. Rachel turns to look at David but he is standing
    too, his face a mask.
    Rachel gathers herself, then stands and turns to follow the
    other two, walking towards the light.

    As the three approach the opening and descend the ramp of
    the bay door, we hear a woman's voice:

                         SARAH (V.O)
              We should never forget how young
              they were.

                        SARAH (V.O.)(CONT'D)
              My father, Stephan Gold, was the
              youngest Unit Commander in
              Mossad.

    David is next...

                        SARAH (V.O.)(CONT'D)
              David Peretz had his twenty-ninth
              birthday while on the mission.

    Then Rachel.

                        SARAH (V.O.)(CONT'D)
              My mother was even younger. Only
              twenty-five.


    RACHEL'S P.O.V

    Silhouetted against the bright light is a group of waiting
    MILITARY and MOSSAD DIGNITARIES. Their hands are raised in
    applause.

                        SARAH (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              Despite their youth they'd had
              the courage to confront an
              unimaginable evil....

    The three walk towards their welcoming party. Rachel blinks
    against the sunlight, takes out a pair of sunglasses and
    slips them on.

              annals of medicine: The Surgeon
              of Birkenau.

    She's wearing tinted glasses, staring at us, listening to
    Sarah speak.

    REVERSE

    Rachel's daughter - SARAH - stands at a podium, reading the
    Dedication to a rather large audience who have come for the
    launch of her first book.

    She's 31, and clearly her mother's daughter.

    The cover image from the book is projected on a screen
    behind Sarah - a black and white photograph of a young
    Rachel, David and Stephan. Above their faces, the title -
    In Our Hands.

                        SARAH
              Their mission had been to return
              him to Israel to stand trial.
              Instead it ended with his death
              on the streets of East Berlin...

    ...as she waits behind David and Stephan, face bleached out
    by the sunlight. She stares at the ground.

                        SARAH (V.O.)
              But this was not what was
              celebrated. It was their youth
              itself that became a symbol. Here
              were the children who had faced
              Israel's greatest nightmare, her
              greatest pain...
    David and Stephan have moved out of shot and Rachel reaches
    the DIGNITARIES. Still looking down, she manages a smile, a
    bob of her head, reaches out to shake the first hand...

              This book is dedicated to my
              inspiration. My mother, Rachel
              Singer.

    People around Rachel begin to applaud, the sound almost
    startling her. Automatically she gives the same bob of the
    head, acknowledging the applause.

    Sarah, cheeks burning with a mixture of embarrassment and
    emotion, hasn't finished yet. She locks eyes with her
    mother.

                        SARAH (CONT'D)
              Mother, I'm so very proud to be
              your daughter.

    More applause. Rachel manages to smile.


6   INT. FUNCTION ROOM. HOTEL NEAR TEL AVIV - LATER               6
    The room is now alive with the excited chatter of the
    guests.

    Rachel moves against the tide of the audience with a fixed
    social smile, murmuring thanks to well-wishers, trying to
    get out, trying not to look like she's trying to get out...


7   EXT. TEL AVIV. HOTEL NEAR TEL AVIV. PATIO - CONTINUOUS        7

    She emerges onto the empty patio, slides the glass door
    shut behind her, muffling the chatter from the room beyond.
    She lights a cigarette, inhales greedily, trying to calm
    down. She stares at the sun blazing over the Mediterranean
    ahead of her. Her glasses darken against the reflected
    glare.

    As if sensing something she turns to see a SMALL BOY - her
    GRANDSON - watching her from behind the glass of the patio
    door, something UNNERVING in his direct gaze.

    Rachel stares back at him in silence.

    Sarah appears behind the boy, her son, and scoops him up
    into a hug. Still the boy stares at his grandmother, who
    gives a tight smile and turns back to the sea.

    Another guest walks up to Sarah and she nods, smiling, at
    what he is saying to her but her eyes slide back to her
    mother, standing on the other side of the glass.

8   1NT/EXT. APARTMENT BLOCK. TEL AVIV SUBURB - DAY               8

    A shabby, dimly-lit stairwell in a run-down section of the
    city.

    A YOUNG MOSSAD AGENT knocks at one of the apartment doors.
    After a moment it is answered by OLDER DAVID, now 62.

                        YOUNG AGENT
              David Peretz?

                          DAVID
              Yes.

                        YOUNG AGENT
              You were expecting me?

    David looks at this young version of himself.

                        DAVID
              Yes. I was expecting you.
                        YOUNG AGENT
              Would you come with me sir?

    David stares at him, then walks back into the apartment.
    The door almost swings shut and the Agent catches it,
    considering walking in after him. But before he can, David
    re-emerges carrying his jacket.

                          DAVID
              Let's go.



    TITLES BEGIN -


    We TRACK with David, CLOSE on his face as the two men begin
    the long walk down the staircase.

    He doesn't say anything to his companion, doesn't look
    around him, and we HOLD on that face as his mind tries to
    catch up, tries to work something out, to decide...


9   EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS                                      9

    The apartment block stands on stilts. Abandoned furniture
    is piled around the columns supporting the building.

    Still on David as the two men walk out from the darkness
    into the street that services the run-down estate. David
    follows as the agent moves ahead towards a larger road.
     FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   6.


     They cross a busy carriageway, and wait for a moment on the
     central reservation for a break in the traffic.

     Parked on the far side of the road, two identical cars,
     their windows tinted.

     The Agent moves to the leading car, opens the driver's door
     and gets in. David stops in the road, opens the rear
     passenger door and throws his jacket inside.

     He pauses for a moment and turns to look back at the second
     car.


10   INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS                                        10

     A MAN sits in the back of the car, silhouetted against the
     brightness outside. This is OLDER Stephan, now 63.

     He watches as David straightens up, hands on hips,
     squinting up at the sun.

11   EXT. STREET. TEL AVIV SUBURB - CONTINUOUS                    11

                         DAVID
                   (Indistinctly)
               Sorry.

     The Agent turns.

                            YOUNG AGENT
               What, sir?

                          DAVID
                   (Beat)
               I - I think I...

     He stands like that for a moment and then suddenly STEPS
     OUT INTO THE ROAD in front of an on-coming TRUCK. The
     impact sweeps him out of the frame.

     The shocked Agent scrambles out of the vehicle as other
     cars screech to a halt in front of David's lifeless body.

FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   7.


Rachel is re-joining the table, taking her place beside her
daughter amidst the dinner party chatter. Sarah watches
her.

                    SARAH
          When are you going to stop?

                       RACHEL
          Stop what?

                    SARAH
          The smoking.

                       RACHEL
          Soon.

                    SARAH
          I hope so. Do it for your
          grandson.

                    SARAH
          Are you sure you have to go back
          home tomorrow?

                    RACHEL
          It's all arranged, I'm afraid...

                    SARAH
          But we'll have breakfast before
          you go? I thought maybe we could
          take a walk on the beach? (Trying
          to sound casual) I'd like you to
          see more of him.

A WAITER leans over with WINE for Rachel. She covers her
glass.
                    RACHEL
              (To Sarah, ill-at-ease)
          Well, I'll be back. We
          can...maybe in the holidays or...

MIRIAM, a PUBLISHER appears at her shoulder with a copy of
Sarah's book.

                    MIRIAM
          I've marked the place. I thought
          perhaps from chapter eleven...?

                    RACHEL
          ...Yes, thank you.

Rachel nods absently, flicking through the pages of the
book. Sarah realizes, with a small stab of pain, that she
has no idea what that means.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   8.


                    SARAH
          If you'd rather read something
          else, mother.....

                    RACHEL
          No, that's fine.

Rachel is barely listening. She is staring at a black and
white photograph in the book.

We see that the photograph is of a YOUNG MAN in NAZI
UNIFORM. It's titled: DIETER VOGEL, "The Surgeon of
Birkenau."


                    MIRIAM
          You must be very proud.

Rachel looks up at her, realizes what Miriam is talking
about.
                    RACHEL
              (A little automatic)
          ...It's a wonderful achievement.
          I'm very proud of her.

                    MIRIAM
          And I'm sure you were invaluable
          in the research.

                    SARAH
              (Keeping it light)
          Actually, my mother withstood all
          interrogation. My father was the
          talker. (Trying a joke) I'm the
          only journalist in Israel she
          won't speak to.

Miriam laughs obligingly but Sarah instantly regrets the
remark.

There is a sudden excited MURMUR from the table. The women
look over to where Stephan approaches the table. He is in a
motorised WHEELCHAIR. The Mossad Agent attends discreetly
in the background.

Rachel's face hardens.

                    RACHEL
          I thought he couldn't come.

                    SARAH
              (Standing up, surprised)
          So did I.

Several of the local POLITICOS have stood up to greet
Stephan, who is all smiles and handshakes.

                    STEPHAN
              (To the politicos)
          Please, sit, sit. My God, it must
          be election season.

There's good-natured laughter from the table. Sarah joins
her father, kissing his cheek.

                      SARAH
          You came.

                    STEPHAN
          I came. So you're the famous
          author I've heard so much about?

Rachel watches as he takes a place at the table, picks up a
copy of the book and examines the cover photograph, holding
his glasses a little from his eyes to focus.

                    STEPHAN (CONT'D)
              (Without looking)
          Rachel.

                      RACHEL
          Stephan.

                    STEPHAN
              (To Sarah)
          Now you're the expert, maybe you
          could tell me something.
          (Pointing to himself) Who's this
          handsome devil on the cover?

More polite laughter from the table.

                    STEPHAN (CONT'D)
          It went well?

                    SARAH'S HUSBAND
          She was wonderful.

                     STEPHAN
          That's good. Good, good. That's
          very good.

Rachel takes a sip of water and notices Stephen's hands,
crumbling some bread - they're SHAKING.

She looks up at his face, reads the hidden STRAIN there.

He senses her gaze and meets it, and for a second his smile
falters and SOMETHING LIKE PANIC flickers in his eyes.

Rachel stares back at him, disturbed. Miriam stands,
tapping her glass with her fork.

                I just want thank you all for
                coming to help us celebrate the
                launch of this wonderful book.
                I'm sure we're all particularly
                thrilled to have two of the
                heroes of this story at the
                table. And even more thrilled
                that one of them has agreed to
                read for us...

      Applause. She gestures to Rachel who stands, still looking
      at Stephan. The table quietens down. Rachel opens the book
      at the marked place and hesitates, only now realising what
      she is about to read. Then...

                          RACHEL
                    (reading)
                "On the evening of the 31st of
                December, it began to rain more
                heavily. So isolated had they
                become from the outside world
                that it was only when she looked
                out of the window that Rachel
                remembered it was New Year's
                Eve...


13    INT. KITCHEN. BERLIN SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT - THE PAST           13

      Young Rachel stands in the small kitchen. Rain lashes on
      the window. She stares out at some FIREWORKS exploding
      nearby, then turns away and begins to gather three METAL
      SAUCEPANS from the shelves.

      We TRACK with her as she walks into the...

14    LIVING ROOM                                                  14

      And begins to place the pots on the floor to catch the
      rainwater which is dripping through various points in the
      ceiling.

      As she positions the last pot we REVOLVE around her to get
      our first view of the far wall. And there, tied to a
      radiator, is DIETER VOGEL, now 50. He's bound, his mouth
      taped, apparently asleep.

      Rachel doesn't, of course, react to this sight. Instead
      she begins to clear away some pieces of BROKEN GLASS BOWL
      from the floor. We TRACK with her as she walks back down
      the short hallway into the kitchen, drops the pieces of
      bowl into the bin. From the living room comes the three
      distinct PINGS of rainwater dripping in the pots.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   11.


 She stops suddenly, puzzled. It's a moment before she works
 out what she's noticed - something has changed in the sound
 of the rainwater next door.

 There are only two drips instead of three.

 She walks back towards the living room...

 RACHEL'S P.O.V - through the living room door we can see
 that one of the pots has been overturned. Rachel slows to a
 stop. A sudden wave of adrenalin causes her to turn
 but...it's too late. Vogel steps out of the alcove he's
 been standing in so that he is directly in front of her.
 Before she can even cry out he has slashed her face open
 with a SHARD OF GLASS.

 Instinctively she cups her hands to her ripped face. Vogel
 grabs her by the hair and stepping behind her, tries to
 worm his other hand underneath her raised arms to reach her
 throat with the glass.
 Her training kicking in, Rachel uses a krav magah move to
 grab and twist Vogel's forearm, breaking his hold on her
 and turning the arm until, with a yell of pain, Vogel drops
 the shard. He swings wildly at her, but Rachel ducks the
 fist and drives the palm of her hand up into his face.

 Vogel stumbles back, surprised by her speed and the sudden
 pain of the blow.

 Rachel is about to press home the attack but is blinded by
 blood from her wound washing into her eyes.

 As she wipes her eyes clear, Vogel grabs a LAMP from a
 small chest of drawers in the hall and smashes it into her
 face. She falls.
 Vogel begins to run, but, driven by adrenaline and
 desperation, Rachel scrambles onto all fours and lunges at
 him, catching hold of his trouser leg as he moves towards
 the front door.

 Vogel stumbles, manages to pull a leg free and stamps down
 on Rachel who lets go with a moan. He stamps again, steps
 free and kicks her hard in the head.

 Rachel rolls with the force of the kick and comes to a

 RACHEL'S P.O.V - LOW ANGLE - Fluttering in and out of
 darkness - Vogel's feet as he stands beside us, breathing
 hard. Then he turns and hurries to the front door...and
 out.

15    EXT. WALKWAY. BERLIN SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT.                      15

      Vogel hurries along the walkway and sets off DOWN THE
      SPIRAL STAIRCASE of the apartment building.


16    INT. BERLIN SAFE HOUSE. NIGHT.                                16

      Rachel lies motionless. Then a cough. And another. And
      finally she rolls over, holding her gaping cheek with one
      hand, and drags herself towards the CHEST OF DRAWERS.


17    EXT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT                                        17

      Vogel runs down the spiral staircase.


18    INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                          18

      With difficulty, Rachel pulls out a GUN fitted with a
      silencer... and pulls herself towards the door.


19    EXT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT                                        19

      Vogel's dwindling figure as he nears the bottom of the
      stairs.


20    EXT. WALKWAY - NIGHT                                          20

      Streaming blood from her face, Rachel heaves herself out of
      the apartment towards the railings guarding the walkway. We
      hear the clatter of Vogel's feet on the stairs below. She
      raises the gun to the railings, to take aim....

21    EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT                                        21

      Bursting from the stairwell, Vogel starts to run across the
      courtyard towards the street.


22    EXT. WALKWAY/COURTYARD - NIGHT                                22

      Rachel's aim follows Vogel's lunge for the gateway...


      RACHEL'S P.O.V

      There is a lurid flash of fireworks from nearby and for a
      moment we see Vogel lit, about to make it to the gate and
      disappear forever...

      Rachel FIRES. A single shot. And, improbably, incredibly,
      the tiny figure of Vogel drops.

      Rachel hangs over the banisters far above us, gun in hand,
      staring at us with disbelief.


23    EXT. TERRACE. HOTEL NEAR TEL AVIV - NIGHT                     23

      Rachel finishes reading and puts the book down.

      Nobody   moves. The air of bonhomie has been replaced by an
      uneasy   silence. Not knowing what else to do, one of the
      guests   begins to clap and the others hurriedly join in.
      Rachel   doesn't acknowledge the applause.

      Stephan is staring at her with a STRANGE INTENSITY.


24    INT/EXT. STEPHEN'S CAR. TEL AVIV - NIGHT                      24
      Stephan and Rachel sit in the back of the car. Behind a
      screen the young Mossad Agent we saw earlier sits in the
      front next to the Driver. Tel Aviv races by in neon smears.

      The air is charged with tension.

                            RACHEL
                      (Of the driver)
                  He's driving too fast.

      Stephan ignores her. She turns to the window, watches as
      they streak past another car.

                            RACHEL (CONT'D)
                  This is ridiculous. What's so
                  important? Tell me where we're
                  going?

                            STEPHAN
                  We're going to David's apartment.

      Rachel turns to him, startled.

                              RACHEL
                  David...?

                            STEPHAN
                  I keep track of people Rachel.
                  It's my job. (Beat) I know he
                  came to see you yesterday.

                      (contemptuous)
                  What's this? The jealous ex-
                  husband or the intelligence
                  officer?

                           STEPHAN
                 A little of both. What did he
                 want?

                             RACHEL
                 Fuck you.

                           STEPHAN
                 What did he tell you?

      Something about his intensity unnerves her.

                           RACHEL
                 He didn't tell me anything. (Off
                 his look) He didn't! He told me
                 where he'd been travelling, that
                 he'd been teaching... We spoke
                 for a few minutes and then I had
                 to go.

      Stephan is still staring at her, reading her.
                           RACHEL (CONT'D)
                     (Bristling)
                 If you don't believe me ask him
                 yourself.

      And then he can't keep it from his face - and she knows.
      Something terrible has happened.


25    INT. LIVING ROOM. DAVID'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                   25

      Stephan sits in the middle of the squalid living room, lost
      in thought.

26    BEDROOM                                                       26

      Rachel walks slowly though the room, taking it all in - the
      little islands of occupation, the places where David sat,
      read, slept. Piles of newspapers. Used cups. A mound of
      laundry...

      ON Rachel as she looks about her, looking for something,
      some sign from the man she knew. But there's nothing
      personal here. These are the rooms of a man who had no real
      home.


27    BATHROOM                                                      27

      Rachel walks in and switches on the light. She stares
      around the dirty bathroom.

30    LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                      30

      Stephan sits listening to her breaking down.


31    LIVING ROOM - LATER                                           31

      Rachel sits on the couch.
                          RACHEL
                Why did he do it?

      Stephan looks at her, considering.

      He takes out a sheet of PRINTED PAPER, hands it to her. She
      reads some of the first page, then looks up at him.

      And now we see it on her face too. Fear.


32    EXT. STAIRWELL OUTSIDE DAVID'S APARTMENT - NIGHT              32

      The Mossad Agent sits on the stairs, smoking.
      As the door behind him opens he stands aside and watches
      Rachel SWEEP past him down the stairs, without giving him a
      glance.


33    INT. RACHEL'S HOTEL - NIGHT                                   33

      Rachel is packing, folding clothes neatly, precisely,
      silently - all the time a terrible tension in her
      movements.

      She tries to close a drawer but it sticks, She keeps
      trying, then in a sudden rush of fury yanks the drawer free
      and hurls it across the room.

      She stands breathing hard.

34    EXT. PATIO TERRACE/BEACH. HOTEL NEAR TEL AVIV - DAY           34

      The next day. Tables under umbrellas are ranged along the
      terrace.

      Sarah and her husband are on the beach below, playing with
      their son, laughing. As if feeling our gaze, she looks up
      at us, shielding her eyes against the sun.

      REVERSE

      Rachel sits at a table with Stephan, watching her daughter.

      Stephan takes out an ENVELOPE and passes it to her.

      She opens it and examines the contents - an AIR-PLANE
      TICKET and TWO PASSPORTS.

      Stephan takes out a small BLACK CASE and slides it across
      the table towards her.
      She turns to look at it with disgust, KNOWING WHAT IT IS.
      Then she takes it and puts it in her handbag.

                          STEPHAN
                My car's waiting outside. It can
                take you to the airport.

      Rachel turns back to stare at her daughter.


35    ON THE BEACH                                                  35

      Sarah, playing with her son, glances up once more at her
      mother on the patio.

      Rachel stands, an elegant woman at breakfast, her dark
      glasses, her suit...She raises a hand and waves.

      Puzzled, Sarah waves back, then watches as her mother
      begins to walk away from her.

      face set, steely.

      We TRACK with her as she emerges from the shadow of the
      hotel back into the bright sunshine of the street and
      starts to walk along the sidewalk.

      After a moment a CAR purrs alongside. She ignores it for a
      moment, keeps on walking, the car cruising beside her.
      Finally, almost angrily, she stops and gets in. The YOUNG
      AGENT sits in the back seat next to her. The car pulls
      smoothly away.


38    EXT. TEL AVIV AIRPORT - DAY                                  38

      Rachel climbs from the car and walks towards the building,
      pulling her wheeled suitcase.

      The young agent has climbed out and moves swiftly ahead of
      her, waiting as she passes into the departure building.


39    INT. AIRPORT PASSPORT CONTROL - DAY                          39
      Rachel looks down at her passport. We see her PHOTOGRAPH
      and name - RACHEL SINGER. She hardly reacts as the agent
      ushers her to the front of the queue.

      An Officer takes her passport, and as he checks it, we
      see...

      PAST

      ...the passport again. We're now looking at the black and

      ROGET.
      The passport is slid back across the counter and we find
      ourselves in...

      Rachel takes her passport back from the BORDER GUARD and
      walks forward, past the barrier into EAST GERMANY.

      RACHEL'S P.O.V

      A CROWD of people are waiting beyond the check-point for
      their loved ones. They're all looking eagerly at us. Only
      one YOUNG MAN has his back to us, turning away to light a
      cigarette.

      Then he turns - Young David - a fine, sensitive face,
      darkly shadowed eyes. This is the SHOT we saw earlier. A
      moment when we see how anxious he is to play his part
      right. Then he smiles his beautiful smile...

      Supered TITLES read "East Berlin, 1965."

      Rachel walks up to him and after a fractional hesitation
      they embrace.

      David takes her suitcase, and they begin to walk away, hand
      in hand, along the BERLIN WALL.
      Finally...

                                DAVID
                   I'm David.

      They have turned into another, quieter street.
      David lets go of her hand, and they walk on.


43    EXT. COURTYARD/BALCONY. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY             43

      A figure leans over the railing on the crumbling balcony at
      the top of the building, smoking a cigarette, watching.
      This is YOUNG STEPHAN.


      HIGH SHOT - POV

      David and Rachel are coming through the iron gate into the
      run-down looking courtyard.

      A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN - the building's only other occupant -
      watches the couple as the pass, David murmuring a greeting.

      a view we have seen before.


45    INT. EAST BERLIN - SAFE HOUSE. DAY                            45

      The place looks like a squat.

      YOUNG Stephan sits playing idly at a battered old upright
      piano, a cigarette in his mouth. He looks up as David and
      Rachel walk in and stand framed in the doorway, looking
      every inch the young married couple. Stephan looks at them
      for a beat, then starts to play the first few bars of
      Mendelssohn's wedding march.

      The other two blush furiously, not amused. Rachel takes her
      case from David.

                          RACHEL
                Where do I sleep?

                          STEPHAN
                You're in my room.

      He waits just long enough to enjoy her reaction.

                          STEPHAN (CONT'D)
                I'm moving in with him. (Beat)
                You're at the end there.

46    INT. KITCHEN - LATER                                          46
      Stephan is smoking. David sits at the table. He is using a
      file to create a notch at the bottom of a thin strip of
      sprung steel.

      Both men can hear the BATH RUNNING in the bathroom, both
      very aware of this new female presence in the house they've
      been sharing together for the last month.

                          STEPHAN
                What do you think of your new
                wife?

      David frowns at the steel strip, seeming preoccupied.

                Too young.

      Stephan watches him, amused.

      David shrugs.

                          STEPHAN (CONT'D)
                You didn't notice.

      He begins to sort his possessions out.

                          STEPHAN (CONT'D)
                You know what I've noticed? You
                don't notice women. I've noticed
                that. How long have I known you?

                          DAVID
                    (examining the steel)
                I don't know.

                          STEPHAN
                Two years. All the places we've
                been to. You don't look at women.
                Before I get into that bed, is
                there anything you have to tell
                me?

      David sighs, blows on the steel strip and holds it up for
      Stephan to examine.

      We hear the bathroom door open and there is a quick glimpse
      of Rachel wrapped in a towel as she slips past the door
      heading for her room. The two men watch her pass. Stephan
      turns and catches David's expression.

                          STEPHAN
                Well, well...I think he just
                noticed.

      Rachel sits on her bed drying her hair. She stops,
      listening to the indistinct murmur of the men's voices from
      the room next door. Rachel leans towards the wall, trying
      to hear more but the voices fall silent.


48    INT. SAFEHOUSE - MORNING                                     48

      David, holding a kitchen knife, MOVES TO STAB Stephan.

      Stephan uses a krav magah move to disarm him. The knife
      clatters to the floor as he twists David's arm behind his
      back.

 There's an element of showing off and Stephan uses a
 little more force than is necessary. David winces but
 doesn't say anything.

 Stephan turns to Rachel who has been watching.

                        STEPHAN
           Yes?

 Rachel nods and they change places. David picks up the
 knife and repeats the "attack" move on her. She disarms him
 easily.

                     STEPHAN (CONT'D)
           Now an attack from behind.

 David takes his position, grabbing Rachel from behind, but
 he's so awkward with her the attack seems a little
 tentative.

 Stephan talks as Rachel practises breaking free from the
 hold.

           What were you doing there?

                     RACHEL
           My husband is an Industrial
           Chemist.

 Stephan glances at David, amused.

                     STEPHAN
           He does look like a chemist.

 David grabs Rachel again, once more holding back a little.

                     STEPHAN (CONT'D)
           She's not going to fucking break,
           David. Move.

 He takes David's place.

                     STEPHAN (CONT'D)
           What were you doing before this?

                           RACHEL
                Before Argentina we lived in
                Hungary where my husband
                studied...

      Stephan is smiling. She realizes he's talking about Mossad.

                          RACHEL (CONT'D)
                Oh...Liaison.

                          STEPHAN
                And what did you do in Liaison?

                           RACHEL
                    (Beat)
                Translator.

      Stephan looks even more amused.

                          STEPHAN
                So, first time in the field.
      Rachel feels herself blush a little angrily. Stephan grabs
      her from behind and Rachel executes a perfect break,
      twisting Stephen's arm. Stephan winces, surprised.

                          STEPHAN (CONT'D)
                Good. That's...good.

      David gives the slightest of smiles.

                          DAVID
                Welcome to Metsada.

50    INT. BERLIN SAFE HOUSE - RACHEL'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.            50

      Rachel lies in bed, restlessly playing with a locket around
      her neck.

      Giving up on trying to sleep, Rachel rises from the bed,
      throws on a robe and pads out of the room...


51    INT. BERLIN SAFE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM. CONTINUOUS.            51

      ...and into the living room. She sits down at the table,
      stares at a FILE before her. She hesitates then opens it,
      forces herself to look at the terrible PHOTOGRAPHS inside -
      a pile of severed legs, bodies covered in mustard gas
      wounds, phosphorus burns, a naked woman, barely a skeleton,
      held up by two Nazi nurses, a row of DEAD BABIES, rulers
      laid beside them to indicate dimensions...

      Rachel stares at this last image, overwhelmed.

      David stands watching her through the half open door. He
      makes a small move - perhaps to go to her - then stops
      himself and slips back into the darkness.


53    EXT. STREET - MORNING                                        53

      A tram trundles down the wide Berlin street.

      Rachel and David are walking to Vogel's surgery, holding
      hands. She's pale, very frightened. David walks, trying,
      and failing, to think of anything to say to her.

      He suddenly notices an odd sound. It's Rachel, humming
      tunelessly to herself, very low. Something about this
      pierces him. He gives her hand a squeeze.

54    EXT. CLINIC - DAY                                            54

      The two stand in the doorway, at the foot of the stairs
      leading into the clinic, their husband and wife routine.

                          DAVID
                    (In German)
                I'll be waiting for you.

      She nods, trying to smile.

                          RACHEL
                    (her throat is tight)
                I won't...be long.

      They kiss. She turns to go, looking so young and lost...
      David hesitates, staring after her, then walks quickly
      away. Rachel walks up the steps towards the entrance.

      A large NOTICE BOARD covered with photographs of grateful
      smiling MOTHERS holding their NEWBORN BABIES - row upon row
      of new life.

      Rachel sits staring at the board. She turns her attention
      to the frosted glass door to the doctor's surgery.
      Indistinct shadows move on the other side.

      She turns to look at the other two women sitting looking
      through magazines, then back to the door. A shadow darkens
      as it approaches the glass, then the door opens and a NURSE
      leans out.

                          NURSE
                Frau Roget?

      With a smile, the Nurse gestures for Rachel to enter.


56    INT. EXAMINATION ROOM. DAY.                                   56

      Rachel stands behind a SCREEN, trying to control her
      nerves. All we can hear is the sound of RUNNING WATER and
      Rachel's tense breathing. Finally she takes off her skirt
      and unbuttons her blouse with trembling fingers. She puts
      on the gown, and slips out of her underpants, stumbling as
      she steps out of them.

      We TRACK with her as she walks out from behind the screen
      into the large brightly lit room. She walks towards the
      GYNAECOLOGICAL CHAIR at the centre of the room. On the far
      wall, behind a screen, someone stands washing their hands
      at a basin.

      As she walks, Rachel passes a tray of MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS,
      her glance lingering on it.

      She reaches the chair and climbs onto it. A pause and then,
      tentatively, she lifts her feet into the stirrups, tugging
      the gown to cover herself as best she can.

      She tries to steady her breathing, focussing on the
      ceiling. A bright LIGHT shines down on her.

      We hear footsteps approach.

      Rachel closes her eyes.
                          VOGEL
                Good morning, Frau Roget. I'm
                Doctor Bernhardt.

      Rachel opens her eyes. Vogel is sitting on a small stool,
      taking a speculum from the tray of instruments, his back to
      us.

                          RACHEL
                Good morning, doctor.

      He turns and smiles at us - and he has a wonderful, warm
      smile, the air of a gruff but kindly Uncle.

                          VOGEL
                Alright now, just relax. We're
                going to do a little examination.
                If you feel at all uncomfortable,
                you just say. Alright?
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   25.


 She manages to nod.

                     VOGEL (CONT'D)
           Alright, this is my hand... and
           this is the speculum. It's going
           to feel cold.

 Rachel reacts as Vogel pushes the speculum into place,
 opens it and begins the examination. She stares up into the
 light.

                     VOGEL (CONT'D)
           Can I ask how old you are?

                     RACHEL
           Twenty five.

                     VOGEL
           And how long have you and your
           husband been trying for a baby?
                     RACHEL
           Nearly two years.

                     VOGEL
           Uhuh. Well, the ovaries look
           fine. Alright, let's see... your
           cervix is slightly retroverted.
           Tilted backwards?

 Rachel raises her hand to her LOCKET NECKLACE and begins to
 fiddle with it.

                       RACHEL
           Really?
 The angle from which we next see VOGEL, and the way the
 image of his face freezes in black and white, tells us
 clearly that this locket conceals a CAMERA DEVICE.

                     VOGEL
           Mmm. But that generally shouldn't
           affect fertility.

                       RACHEL
           Oh, good.

                     VOGEL
           You have a slight accent, Frau
           Roget. Where are you from?

                     RACHEL
           Argentina. We just moved here...

                Whereabouts in Argentina? Buenos
                Aires?

      He looks up at her and Rachel instinctively moves her hand
      away from the locket. She finds herself nodding.

      Vogel looks away again. Rachel bites down on a wave of
      panic.

                          VOGEL (CONT'D)
                Oh, Buenos Aires. Beautiful. I
                went once, when I was young. We
                went to the Opera house I
                remember. What's it called again?

      Rachel stares at the light. Beat.

                          RACHEL
                Teatro Colon.
      He turns back to her, holding a swab, the warm smile.

                          VOGEL
                That's right. Beautiful. This
                might sting a little, dear.

      Rachel winces.

                          VOGEL (CONT'D)
                I'm sorry. Now, there's a couple
                of tests we need to run, make
                sure there are no problems. Is
                that alright?

      Rachel nods. He pats her hand.

      Rachel walks out and finds David waiting, smoking. He takes
      her hand and they walk off without speaking.


58    EXT. QUIET STREET - DAY                                       58

      The two turn the corner, out of sight of the clinic. David
      glances at her. She looks pale, shaken. He feels a wave of
      sudden tenderness for her, opens his mouth to say something
      then catches himself.

      CLOSE on their hands. After a moment David LETS GO. They
      walk on.

      Stephan sits at a table. Rachel and David appear beside him
      and join him. There is an awkward silence for a moment.
      Stephan sips his coffee.

                          STEPHAN
                    (in German)

                Next appointment is on Wednesday.

      She looks at David but he is staring at the table. Like
      Stephan he is uncomfortable with the thought of what Rachel
      has been through.

      She takes his hand. He looks up, surprised, searches her
      face...
      But then Rachel lets go and walks off towards the toilets.

      David looks down at the SILVER LOCKET lying in his palm.


60    EXT. STREET - DAY                                            60

      Stephan walks down the street. A SMARTLY DRESSED MAN walks
      towards him, absently jingling his CAR KEYS in his hand.

      As he nears Stephan, the man fumbles the keys and they
      drop. Stephan dips down to pick them up and hands them back
      to the man with a smile.

                          SMARTLY DRESSED MAN
                Vielen dank!

                          STEPHAN
                Bitte sehr.

      The two continue on their way, and we follow the smartly
      dressed man, closing in on his hand, in which he now holds
      his keys AND THE LOCKET.

      We see him tuck it into his jacket pocket as he walks on.

      David and Stephan appear, walking over the bridge towards
      us. David's eyes flick to the tracks ahead and below as a
      TRAIN begins to thunder by.

      Stephan begins to COUNT softly to himself as the train runs
      below his feet.

      David indicates the tracks on the plan.

                West Berlin trains pass through

      light his cigarette. Beside him David's eyes flick to the
      STATION PLATFORM in between the tracks below, eerily lit in
      the gathering dusk.

      DAVID'S P.O.V - several BORDER GUARDS patrol the abandoned
      platform.

                times...

      We're TRACKING PAST the entrance to stairs leading down
      from the bridge onto the platform below. We see it's been
      sealed off with a locked gate. Another BORDER GUARD stands
      on the stairs below, staring up at us as we pass...

      The two men have walked on past the mid-point of the
      bridge. David glances at the far track.

      DAVID'S P.O.V - the track runs along the far side of the
      platform. On the other side of the track is a barbed-wire
      topped WIRE FENCE.

                ...here. And they will be empty.
                Once that train has stopped, the
                guards won't be able to see this
                fence. And on the other side of
                the fence is...

67    EXT. THE RAILWAY BRIDGE - EVENING                            67

      The two men are at the top of the stairs on the other side
      of the bridge now. Stephan glances to his right...

      STEPHEN'S P.O.V - TRACKING as we descend the stairs. We can
      see that on the other side of that high wire fence is a CAR
      PARK and a long, low building...

                          STEPHAN (V.O.)
                ...a postal depot.

      We see that car park is lined with the yellow VANS of
      Deutsche Post. Several FEMALE POSTAL WORKERS in dark skirts
      and white blouses stand around the car park on their
      breaks, smoking and chatting. As we watch one of the vans
      trundles out of the OPEN FACTORY GATE.

                We're just one more parcel. Once
                we're in West Berlin there'll be
                transport to Templehof airbase
                and a private charter.

      Rachel runs the hem of a partially-made WHITE GARMENT
      through a SEWING MACHINE. She finishes and takes it over to
      where Stephan stands waiting. It's unfinished, but a fairly

                Try this on.

      Stephan puts it on. She tugs at the coat, straightens the
      unfinished collar, runs her hands down the front to smooth
      it out.

                Nice.

      Rachel ignores this, begins to pin the cuff of one of the
      sleeves.

                          STEPHAN (CONT'D)
                Here you are, Mossad agent, all

      Rachel and Stephan sit as David serves the dinner. Rachel
      examines her dish.

      something. Finally...

      Tinny music plays.

      The place is almost empty. In the back of the bar the three
      sit in a corner drinking beer - just young people,
      laughing, a little drunk. They could be students.

      Rachel is reciting something from memory.

                          RACHEL
                Uh, at ten - study the Mishnah,
                at fifteen - study the Talmud. By

                We're too late for all of those.

      They laugh.

                          RACHEL
                Uh...twenty. In your twenties you
                are to "pursue your life's

                I don't know. I'm waiting to find

           What about you David. What "life

 David smiles, stares at his drink.

                     DAVID
           This is it.

 Rachel laughs, looks around at their less than glamorous
 surroundings.
                     RACHEL
           This is it? This is all you want?

 David laughs. He would obviously rather change the subject
 but Rachel is a little drunk, a little curious.

                     RACHEL
           Seriously, what do you want out
           of life?

                     DAVID
               (Beat, shrugs)
           I want this. I want to get Vogel.
           I want him to be put on trial and
           I want the world to watch so
           everyone knows what he did. I
           want them all to know the truth.

 He looks up at their faces, embarrassed at having darkened
 the atmosphere.

                     DAVID
           And...I want another drink.

 He gets up and walks off to the bar. Rachel stares after
 him. Stephan watches her.

                 knows him. He's alone.

       Rachel thinks this over.

                 What about family?

       A tram passes, revealing Stephan walking across the
       scrubby, desolate park, jingling car keys in his hand.

       Suddenly he drops them. He's about to pick them up when a
       man dips down and hands them back to him.

           Are your periods irregular?

           Yes.

                     VOGEL
           Yes. I think we've found the
           problem.

 Rachel stares at him - she didn't know there was a problem.

           It's very common. Your ovarian

                   proceed?

       Rachel nods, dumbly. Vogel nods, turns back to his tray of
       instruments, begins preparing an injection.

       Vogel turns back to her with the HYPODERMIC NEEDLE.
       Instinctively Rachel stiffens. He injects her.

       Rachel nods. Vogel smiles, not unkindly.

                             VOGEL (CONT'D)
                   And yet you say there's no family

                   I lost my mother in the war.

       Vogel stares at her. Then, to her dismay, he TAKES HER
       HAND, and pats it with such a sad, sympathetic look, that
       she feels her eyes prick with tears. Then he lets go and
       turns back to the examination.

       hand. Rachel stops. She looks shaken. David watches her.

                   Are you alright?

       She nods.

       Suddenly Rachel takes his hand again. David stares straight
       ahead but he DOESN'T PULL FREE and they walk on like that.

       We are looking at a yellow DEUTSCHE POST van.

       Stephan and David are walking towards it.

       Stephan stops by the van, shielding David as he drops the
       length of thin steel we saw him working on earlier, from
       his sleeve - an improvised SLIM JIM. With professional ease
       he slips the Jim between the window and the weather shield.
       In seconds he has the door open and the two climb in...

       Rachel comes out of the bathroom in her nightclothes, with
       her hair wet around her. She looks into the kitchen. David
       is sitting smoking. Rachel pauses in the doorway and then
       walks in. A small two bar electric fire provides the only
       light in the room. Rachel kneels down in front of it to dry
       her hair.
       David looks at her as Rachel spreads her hair around her
       shoulders. She looks very beautiful. She starts to comb her
       hair. On impulse, Rachel HOLDS OUT the comb to David.

       David takes it. He starts to comb, pulling it slowly
       through her hair. Then stops. The atmosphere is suddenly
       charged.

                           DAVID
                 It's a brave thing you're doing.

      Rachel turns round and stares at him, overcome with
      longing. She leans in to KISS HIM. For a moment David
      hesitates, but then it's as if something inside him closes
      and he pulls back from Rachel, his face cold.

      Without a word he gets up and walks out. Rachel sits,
      crushed...

      She's been crying. Stephan stands watching her from the
      doorway, holding a drink - something slightly predatory
      about him.

      He crosses to her, sits down beside her and starts to match
      her notes. They work out a nonsense tune between them.

      Defiantly Rachel drains the glass, grimaces a little.
      Stephan watches her. He continues to play, moving the
      melody up in octaves until his hand is beside hers, then
      covering hers. Rachel brushes him away. He puts his hand
      back and starts to caress her wrist.

                You're so beautiful...

      He begins to kiss her neck. Rachel stares ahead, pretending
      it isn't happening. Then she gives in, turning to him.

                stage of your cycle. This is very
                good timing.

      He turns to his tray of implements.

                          VOGEL (CONT'D)
                I think we are going to see
                results.

           All you have to do is have faith.
           Ask any of my patients.

                     RACHEL
           What about your patients in
           Birkenau...?

 Vogel looks up in shock.

 Rachel grabs a fistful of his hair and pulls his head to
 one side. With her other hand she jams the needle into the
 side of his neck, and begins to depress the syringe.

 Vogel gives a grunt of surprise, opens his mouth to speak
 but no sound comes. He grabs vaguely for Rachel's throat
 with one hand, struggles with the needle with his other,
 eyes dull with fury, fighting the drug racing through him.

 Rachel fights to hold him, bucking on the chair, pinned
 beneath his weight, struggling for breath...
 Weakening, VOGEL manages to pull the needle free and it
 drops to the floor...

 INSERT OF SYRINGE

 ...which we see still contains some FLUID.

 A rope of spittle drools from Vogel's contorted mouth onto
 her face. Then his eyelids flutter and close and he
 collapses onto her.

 Rachel pulls his hand from her throat, gasps for air.

 Finally she pushes him to the ground. She leaps up and
 deliberately knocks the tray of medical instruments to the
 floor.

                     RACHEL (CONT'D)
           Help!

 The Nurse runs in, reacts at the sight of the prone VOGEL.

                     RACHEL (CONT'D)
           He collapsed!

                     NURSE

           I don't know! I don't know! He
           just clutched his chest and

 The Nurse grabs for the phone and dials.

      Stephan kneels in a recess of the building, by the open
      NETWORK JUNCTION BOX of the clinic. He's wearing
      HEADPHONES, alligator-clipped to two cables in the box.

                  way, madam.

      Stephan un-clips the phones and pockets them. He
      straightens up, closes the junction box and walks calmly
      away, through a gate in the wall, into the next courtyard.

      opposite the entrance.

      Rachel finishing dressing, looks anxiously at the nurse as
      she crouches by her unconscious husband, monitoring his
      breathing.

      Stephan pulls back some rusty doors.

      Parked in the small courtyard beyond is the van we saw
      before, now decorated with AMBULANCE DECALS and LIGHTS.
      David drives the car forward as Stephan climbs into the
      passenger side...

      Rachel paces outside the door, looking down the corridor.
      The nurse wipes away a tear, tense and frightened.

       Rachel runs past the concerned patients in the waiting area
       to see... David and Stephan, coming up the stairs, holding
       a stretcher.


99     INT. EXAMINATION ROOM. MOMENTS LATER                          99

       Rachel leads them in. Stephan crouches down beside Vogel
       and takes his pulse.

                           STEPHAN
                 We need to take him to the
                 hospital.
       He and David open up the stretcher and transfer Vogel to it
       with some efficiency.

                           NURSE
                 Oh God!

                           STEPHAN
                 He's going to be alright.

       Rachel and the nurse follow David and Stephan as they carry
       the stretcher out through the waiting room.


100    INT. LOBBY. CLINIC - CONTINUOUS                              100
       We hear the siren of the real ambulance starting up not-so-
       very-far-away down the street as David and Stephan push the
       stretcher towards the doors.

       The nurse follows, but David stops her.

                           DAVID
                 I'm sorry, Madam, but you'll need
                 to meet us at the hospital.

                 But... I want to travel with him.

                 Not possible I'm afraid. New

       We begin to register that the siren is growing louder with
       every second.

       As Stephan and David carry the stretcher down the stairs,
       Rachel takes the nurse's hand to detain her.

                           RACHEL
                 Don't worry, he's in good hands
                 now. He's going to be fine.

                           NURSE
                 Thank you...thank you.

                           RACHEL
                 You should get your things, go to
                 the hospital to meet him.

       The Nurse nods tearfully, starts to back towards her
       office, watching as they disappear.


101    EXT. CLINIC - LATE AFTERNOON.                                101

       David closes the rear door of the van and the two jump in
       and drive off as Rachel comes out of the building.

       She begins to walk briskly away. Behind her, the real
       ambulance is pulling up at the clinic. She doesn't turn
       back.


102    EXT. COURTYARD/STREET NEAR CLINIC - LATE AFTERNOON           102

       The DEUTSCHE POST VAN that David and Stephan stole earlier
       pulls out into the street. Behind it we catch a glimpse of
       the now abandoned ambulance. David quickly closes the gate
       and climbs in.

103    EXT. STREET NEAR CLINIC - MOMENTS LATER                      103

       Stephan draws up alongside Rachel and she climbs in as the
       door is opened for her.

       The winter evening is gathering outside. David and Rachel
       are in the back of the van. David has taken off the white
       coat. David checks his watch.

                           STEPHAN
                     (Tense)
                 I know, I know.

       He accelerates.

       Rachel grabs hold of the back of the seat to avoid falling.
       She looks down at the stretcher - Vogel lies unconscious.

       One of his hands jolts free and drops onto her foot.
       Gingerly she steps free.

       HIGH ANGLE

       The depot car park is dark - rows of postal vans parked up.
       An eerie silence.

       Through the high fence behind the vans we can make out the
       tracks and dimly lit STATION PLATFORM beyond - GUARDS
       patrolling in the little pools of light.

       As we watch a POSTAL WORKER comes out of the depot and
       walks through the carpark and out of the gate, his shift
       finished.


106    INSIDE THE VAN                                               106

       P.O.V - THROUGH VAN WINDSCREEN

       We're watching the WORKER walk in front of us and leave the
       car park.

       In the dark of the back of the van, Rachel crouches,
       watching him leave. She turns back to where Stephan and
       David wait by the van doors, bolt cutters in their hands.

       On the floor of the van lies Vogel's unconscious form.

       They wait in absolute silence, listening to the fading
       footsteps of the worker.
       David checks his watch, holds up a single finger to
       Stephan. Moments later we hear the sound of an approaching
       TRAIN.

       Stephan raises a hand and counts them down - five, four,
       three, two, one...

       The two men open the van doors and run at a crouch to the
       base of the foot-bridge stanchion, as the train roars from
       the darkness and begins to pass them, screening the two men
       from the GUARDS ON THE PLATFORM.

       Rachel closes the rear door behind them and runs along the
       line of the fence to the other end of the yard and crouches
       down by a junction box, screened from the platform,
       standing watch.

       She looks over to Stephen and David in the shadows of the
       bridge stanchion.
      FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09    46.


       Again silence falls. Then faintly we hear another engine
       approach. Moments later another train begins to roar past.

       Instantly the two men rise from the shadows and begin to
       CUT through the wire fence, working with fierce
       concentration.

                              STEPHAN

       Rachel checks the car park behind for workers.

       The train is almost past. The two men work feverishly,
       snipping through the remaining links, working their way
       towards each other - forming a four foot long split in the
       fence. They sprint for the stanchion again...

                              STEPHAN
                        (As he runs)
                    Twenty, twenty one, twenty two...

       As they dive for cover the last carriages of the train
       pass.

       A guard on the platform glances over but sees nothing but
       darkness and the vague outline of the postal vans beyond
       the fence. He continues walking down the platform.

109    AT THE VAN                                                    109

       Rachel holds her breath, but nothing disturbs the new
       silence.

       Along the fence she can just make out the two men crouched
       in the shadows. Stephan raises his hand in an OK,
       signalling they're ready.

       Rachel suddenly hears FOOTSTEPS echoing in the car park.

       Through the window of a van, she can see a POSTAL WORKER
       emerging from the depot and crossing the car park.

       As she watches he takes out a cigarette, starts to light it
       but then stops. He is staring over at the footbridge, as if
       he can faintly make out those dark shapes at the base...

       He takes a few steps forward, puzzled. A little closer and
       he might really see something...
      FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09    47.


       Rachel looks to the PLATFORM - the two guards visible there
       are talking to each other, looking the other way.

       She takes her chance - moves up behind the parked vans...




       ON THE WORKER

       ..as he takes a few steps closer to where Stephan and David
       are crouched...

                       (calling)
                   Do you have a light?

       The man turns and takes in this pretty postal worker, who
       has emerged BEHIND HIM.

       He smiles and walks back towards her.
       He lights her cigarette, studies her face.

       David and Stephan lie listening to the murmured
       conversation.

                             WORKER
                   Yeah, it's okay. Are you working

                  should come along.

        She glances through the fence and down the track to where
        the train's LIGHT can be seen approaching in the gloom.
        This is it.

        As it passes them, the train screens Stephan and David from
        the platform. The two men rise and swiftly begin to cut the
        remaining section of fence.

        As the train comes to a halt the last carriages stop
        directly opposite them, empty and dark.
        They're almost there.

        In the distance, at the head of the train, the driver can
        be seen stepping down and gesturing to the guards, pointing
        up ahead.

                  There's something on the tracks
                  up here!

        Suddenly the VAN HORN BLARES, shattering the silence of the
        car park.

        Vogel, hands still tied has wormed his way over the seats
        and is pressing frantically on the HORN. He claws at the
        tape over his mouth, manages to pull it free.
        Stephan leaps into the van and is upon him in seconds.
        Vogel manages to give a HOARSE YELL, then Stephan uses a
        krav magah move to silence him.

        The remaining Border Guard is staring over at the darkened
        car park, trying to work out what he just heard.

        David watches in dismay as a Guard comes into view at the
        far end of the platform, entering a GUARD HUT. He lifts a
        TELEPHONE inside.

        He steps past her, peering at the shadowy vans ahead.
        Rachel stares at him wondering if she can take him down

        choking, she twists the gun free.

        at her.

        Other Guards open FIRE, jumping down onto the tracks and
        advancing towards the cut fence.

       The camera continues into the room to find Vogel's body
       slumped on the floor, bound to the radiator, mouth taped,
       slumped, unconscious.

       Rachel walks in and finds a flushed David wiping oatmeal
       off his trousers, the empty bowl on the bench beside him.

       Rachel sits in the armchair near the end of her shift,
       watching Vogel who is slumped asleep. He looks dishevelled,
       the oatmeal he refused to eat smeared down his chin. She
       can't delay the moment anymore.

       She takes a bowl of prepared oatmeal from the table beside
       her and walks towards Vogel, stirring the bowl with an
       unsteady hand.

       She kneels down in front of him.

       In the silence, we hear rain falling heavily outside.

       Vogel wakes, stays slumped, staring at her with dull eyes.
       She takes the napkin that was covering the bowl and wipes
       the food from his chin. Finally she removes the tape from
       his mouth. Vogel watches her without moving. She offers him
       a spoon of oatmeal, waiting for the sudden yelling and
       abuse. He says nothing, just opens his mouth obediently.

       Rachel feeds him a spoonful of oatmeal. He speaks to Rachel
       in German, subtitled.

       An ALARM CLOCK on the table, rings - the end of her shift.
       She wipes his mouth, tears some tape from the roll. Vogel
       closes his eyes, a look of such genuine suffering it stops
       Rachel.

                           VOGEL (CONT'D)
                 Please? Tell me she's alright.

       Rachel puts the tape over his mouth and stands. David walks
       in and takes his place in the ARMCHAIR facing Vogel.

       Rachel begins to leave. She looks back at Vogel who is
       staring after her, eyes pleading. She hesitates then gives
       a small nod and turns to walk out of the room, passing
       Stephan who has been standing in the doorway, watching her.


135    KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS                                         135
       Rachel starts to wash the oatmeal bowl. Stephan follows her
       in.

                           STEPHAN
                 You can't talk to him.

                           RACHEL
                 I didn't say anything.

                           STEPHAN
                 You can't listen to him.

                           RACHEL
                 I know. I just...
                           STEPHAN
                     (overlapping)
                 I'm not angry -

       He rubs her back. Rachel stiffens a little.

                           STEPHAN (CONT'D)
                 - I'm just telling you - we don't
                 talk to him. We don't listen to
                 him. He isn't there. He isn't a
                 human being. He...

       He stops himself.

                           STEPHAN (CONT'D)
                 We have a date. Ten days time.
                 The Americans are going to help.

       Rachel looks at him, relieved.

                           RACHEL
                 Good.


       He smiles, stares at her, moves a little closer but Rachel
       has already side-stepped him and walked away.


       MONTAGE


136    LIVING ROOM - DAY                                            136

       Stephan sits on the armchair in front of Vogel, taking the
       GUN apart, cleaning it.


137    LIVING ROOM - DAY                                            137

       Vogel thrashes around on the floor as best he can, David
       holding him down. Stephan tries to force oatmeal into him.
       He spits it back out.


138    KITCHEN - DAY                                                138

       Rachel is cleaning, trying to keep busy, trying to keep the
       encroaching decay of the kitchen at bay, scrubbing and
       scrubbing.


139    HALLWAY - MORNING                                            139

       An exhausted David, finishing his shift, walks out of the
       living room as Stephan walks out of his bedroom to take his
       place.
       Rachel walks out of the bathroom and into her bedroom, for
       a moment the three criss-crossing each other's paths.
       Rachel's bedroom door closes. Both men avoid looking at
       each other as they pass it.


140    HALLWAY - MORNING                                            140

       Stephan and David are carrying a struggling, cursing Vogel
       towards the bathroom.

       Before they can get there Vogel pisses himself, the urine
       puddling on the floor at their feet.

                           STEPHAN
                 Fuck!

       Stephan drops Vogel in disgust jumping back out of the way.
       Vogel lies in the pool, staring up at him, eyes triumphant.

143    INT. SAFEHOUSE. LIVING ROOM - DAY                            143

       Vogel leans against the wall, staring blankly at the
       window, sunk into a profound depression. He looks filthy,
       jaw dark with beard growth.

       Rachel watches him from the doorway.


144    LATER                                                        144

       Rachel is washing Vogel's face with a towel. He pays no
       attention, continuing to stare out of the window.

       Rachel picks up a bowl of shaving cream, strips the tape
       off VOGEL's mouth, and begins to brush the cream over his
       face. She produces a RAZOR and carefully begins to shave
       his cheeks.

       She stops suddenly, a TEAR is running down Vogel's cheek,
       cutting a line through the soap. He turns his eyes to her.

                           VOGEL
                 Why don't you just kill me now?

       Rachel pauses for a moment.

                           VOGEL (CONT'D)
                 How can you keep me waiting to
                 die like this!

       Rachel keeps on shaving.

                           VOGEL
                 I know what you want. You want to
                 hand me over to the others, let
                 there be some fucking sham of a
                 trial. Then, when they kill me,
                 you can tell yourself that there
                 was no blood on your hands.

       Rachel switches to the other cheek. Vogel's getting more
       animated, tears in his eyes, a kind of bizarre
       indignation...

                           VOGEL (CONT'D)
                 But that isn't true. There will
                 be blood on your hands.

                 You will be my murderer! You
                 fucking hypocrite. You fucking...

       Rachel tilts his chin up a little and puts the razor to his
       throat. He falls silent, tenses, waiting. Then...

                           VOGEL (CONT'D)
                     (Softly)
                 Yes. Do it. You want to do it...

       Rachel finishes with a trembling hand.

       Vogel slumps back against the wall, the tension in his body
       easing away. He gives her a long, calculating look.

       And as we watch some CHANGE seems to come over him, some
       new fire beginning to kindle in him - a sense of cold
       contempt for Rachel and with it, perhaps, a fresh
       determination to survive this.

                           VOGEL (CONT'D)
                 That's right. I'd forgotten. You
                 Jews never knew how to kill. Only
                 how to die.

       Rachel wipes the razor clean on the towel, SLAPS fresh tape
       onto Vogel's mouth and gets up.


145    INT. KITCHEN - MORNING                                        145

       Rachel is cleaning the kitchen again, clearing some of the
       mess of dishes into the sink.

       She moves a dirty pan which has been left overnight and
       stops, staring at the COCKROACH which is crawling inside.
       A sudden wave of NAUSEA hits her.


146    BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER                                      146

       Rachel crouches at the toilet, vomiting.

       She finishes, rinses her mouth, looks at her pale
       reflection.

       She opens the door and steps out...

       Vogel stands DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HER.

       Rachel stands frozen - a split second of total panic.

       Then Stephan steps into sight behind Vogel, gun in hand -
       the morning bathroom visit.
      FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09    62.


       Rachel flattens herself against the hall wall, quickly
       wiping her mouth dry, as Stephan pushes Vogel past her
       towards the bathroom.


147    EXT. STREET - EVENING                                         147

       Stephan is walking back home. A POLICE CAR SIREN wails
       somewhere nearby and Stephan hurriedly cuts into an alley,
       waiting in the shadows until the siren has faded away. Then
       he hurries on his way.


148    LIVING ROOM - EVENING                                         148

       Rachel uncovers the dish of prepared oatmeal and kneels
       down beside a sleeping Vogel.

       She removes the tape. Vogel wakes, breathes out, watches
       her. After a moment...
                           VOGEL
                 I was dreaming about my wife.

       She feeds him some more.

                           VOGEL (CONT'D)
                 One of the great regrets of my
                 life is that we were unable to
                 have children. My wife would have
                 made a wonderful mother.

       Vogel watches her, then suddenly SPEAKS IN ENGLISH...

                           VOGEL (CONT'D)
                 It's a great blessing.
       Rachel stares at him.

                           VOGEL (CONT'D)
                 You should try lemons. For the
                 morning sickness.

       Rachel can't move.

                           VOGEL (CONT'D)
                 They say it helps.

       Rachel struggles to hold it together, feeds him another
       spoonful.

                           VOGEL (CONT'D)
                 What's your name? (Beat) Sarah?
                 Hannah?...Rachel? Esther? (Beat)
                 You Jews stay close to your
                 roots, don't you? It's a good
                 thing. Very good.

       Rachel spoons in another mouthful.

                           VOGEL (CONT'D)
                 I loved the bible as a child.
                 Retribution. Higher justice.

       Rachel shovels in another mouthful. He chews it
       thoughtfully, examines her face.

                           VOGEL (CONT'D)
                 Yes. I understand you perfectly.
                 (Beat) You weren't lying at the
                 clinic when you told me about
                 your mother were you? About her
                 death?

       Rachel loads the spoon with more oatmeal, determined not to
       show any emotion.

                           VOGEL (CONT'D)
                 I'm very sorry for your loss.
       It almost takes her breath away. She tears the tape and
       puts it over his mouth, gets up and walks away, determined
       not to show him any emotion.

       Vogel watches her go.


149    HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER                                      149

       Rachel makes it out into the hallway before she feels the
       tears running down her face. She gives in to them, turns
       and finds David behind her.

                           DAVID
                 What happened? What's the matter?

       She can't speak at first.

                           RACHEL
                 Nothing. He...nothing.

       She wipes her face.

                           RACHEL (CONT'D)
                 He can understand us.

                             DAVID
                 What?

                           RACHEL
                 He can understand every word
                 we're saying. He just spoke to
                 me.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   64.


 Her face contorts as she tries to compose herself. David
 reaches out to hold her.

                     DAVID
           It's alright. It's alright. It's
           nearly over.

 He pulls her close, holds her, rests his forehead against
 hers. They stand like that, eyes closed. The moment hangs.

                     RACHEL
               (Suddenly)
           Why didn't you go? At the
           station. You could have got away.
           Why didn't you?

 She looks up at him. He stares into her eyes. Beat. Then,
 suddenly he kisses her. It's what she's waited so long for
 and she's stunned for a moment, then puts her arms around
 his neck, returning the kiss hungrily. They are helpless
 with desire for one another.
 There is a sudden scratch of a key at the front door and,
 instinctively, the two break apart.

 Stephan enters, hair wet from the rain. He stops, seeing
 them, sensing the atmosphere. They stare back at him.
 Rachel steps away a little, wiping her face.

                     RACHEL (CONT'D)
           What did they say?

 Stephan stares at them in silence. He unbuttons his coat.

                       DAVID
           Stephan?
                     STEPHAN
           It's not happening.

 They stare at him aghast - this is the last thing they
 wanted to hear.

                     DAVID
           What the fuck does that mean?

                     STEPHAN

           (To Rachel) Has he been fed?

                     STEPHAN
           Did you feed him?

                     DAVID
           What does that mean? What's the
           plan now?

                     RACHEL
               (rising panic)
           We just need to get him to the
           airfield, there must be some
           other way, some...

 Stephan starts down the hallway towards her, angry.

                     STEPHAN
           I said has he...?

 David instinctively steps in front of Rachel, raises a
 hand.
                     DAVID
               (overlapping)
           I'm asking you...

                      STEPHAN
                (overlapping)
           I'm talking to her! Supposedly
           it's her shift now, but instead
           of doing what she's supposed to
           be doing she's out here with you!
           (To Rachel) Now answer the
           fucking question: Did you feed
           him?

                     RACHEL
           YES! I fed him!

 Stephan stands glaring at her, then turns abruptly away.

                      STEPHAN
               (Beat)
           There's no plan. There's no
           fucking plan. They said the
           operation is being "re-
           evaluated."

 He turns to David.

                     STEPHAN
           You know what that means? They're
           going to cut us loose.

 They stare at him shocked.

                     STEPHAN
           It's a fucking mess and they're
           backing away from it quickly as
           they can.

                          RACHEL (CONT'D)
                 (Beat)
           No.

                     STEPHAN
           It's happening. I can feel it.

                     RACHEL
           They can't just leave us!

                     STEPHAN
           Yes they can! Because we fucked
           it all up! We fucked it all up
           and now we're on our own!

 Suddenly we hear someone KNOCKING on the front door. The
 three FREEZE, staring at each other. Silence.

                     DAVID
           Were you followed?

 Stephan stares at the door, thrown.

                     DAVID (CONT'D)
           Could you have been...?

 There is another KNOCK at the door. Stephan turns to the
 chest of drawers and takes out the GUN.

                          RACHEL
           Stephan?
 Stephan is hurriedly screwing the SILENCER onto the GUN.
 There's another KNOCK at the door.

 Stephan walks into the living room and aims the gun at
 Vogel. Vogel instinctively squirms away, falling to one
 side, wriggling back as far as he can.

                     RACHEL (CONT'D)
           What are you doing?

                     STEPHAN
           If it's them, he dies.

 Vogel lies, breathing hard through his nose, eyes on the
 gun aimed at him.

 David suddenly steps in between the two, the gun now
 pointing at his chest.

                     STEPHAN (CONT'D)
           Move.

                     DAVID
           You're not doing this.

                     STEPHAN
           He's not getting away from me.

                     DAVID
           This isn't the mission.

                     STEPHAN
           I decide what the mission is! If
           I say he dies, he dies.

                     DAVID
           We're finishing this mission.
           We're taking him back.

                     STEPHAN
           Get out of the way!

 There is another KNOCK at the door. David and Stephan stare
 at each other, the tension building. Abruptly Rachel turns
 and walks down the hallway towards the door. Stephan calls
 after her.

                     STEPHAN
           Rachel. Rachel!

 From the hallway we hear the sound of the door being opened
 - the murmur of conversation.
 The two men stand frozen, listening. Vogel lies, breathing
 hard through his nose.

 We hear the door close. The three listen as footsteps
 approach down the hall...

 Rachel walks back in. A long beat.

                     RACHEL
               (Dully)
           It was the lady from the bottom
           apartment. She invited us to her
           New Year's Eve party.

 She turns and walks back out. The others stay where they
 are, frozen.

 We hear a PIANO PLAYING as we...

                                                 CUT TO:
      FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   68.


150    KITCHEN - DAY                                                150

       As the piano music plays we see David and Stephan practise
       krav magah moves - careful, controlled, but under it all an
       edge of real tension between them.


151    LIVING ROOM                                                  151

       Vogel is tied in his usual place. Stephan sits in a
       dangerous mood. He's playing the piano. A lyrical rendering
       of Deutschland Uber Alles. Vogel is watching him.


152    KITCHEN                                                      152

       As the music continues the two men's workout grows more
       intense - the punches and blocks build in speed, faster and
       faster, both men breathing hard with the exertion, neither
       willing to stop, a real violence simmering under the
       surface.

153    INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                       153

       Stephan knows he's watched and avoids Vogel's gaze until he
       can stand it no longer and looks...


154    KITCHEN                                                      154

       David is the first to break through the blocks - his fist
       stopping inches from Stephen's face. The two men freeze,
       staring at each other, breathing hard. The music crashes to
       a halt.

155    LIVING ROOM                                                  155

       Stephan is staring at Vogel. He begins to play the anthem
       more discordantly, hitting the keys more violently, as if
       the music is possessing him.

       Then suddenly he stops, stands up and walks away from the
       keyboard. Stares at Vogel.

       Vogel is very aware of the sudden change in atmosphere, a
       sense of impending violence.

       Stephan doesn't move. The moment hangs.


156    LATER                                                        156

       David is taking over the shift from Stephan. They pass each
       other in the doorway without a word.
      FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   69.


       David stops, staring...

       Vogel lies in his usual place. A SACK has been placed over
       his head, hooding him.

       The effect is deeply sinister.


157    KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER                                      157

       Stephan sits eating with Rachel. David walks in and throws
       the SACK on the table. Stephan glances at it, continues
       eating.

                           DAVID
                 What are you doing?

                           STEPHAN
                 It's your shift.

                           DAVID
                     (To Rachel)
                 Did you know about this?

                           RACHEL
                 About what?

                           DAVID
                     (To Stephan)
                 His mouth's taped. You want him
                 to suffocate?

                           STEPHAN
                 I was sick of seeing his face. Go
                 back in.
                           DAVID
                 Don't do that again.

       Stephan gets up and walks calmly towards David as if
       shooing him back out the room.

                           STEPHAN
                 You don't give orders David. It's
                 your shift now so you can go back
                 in there...

       He has his hands on David's chest, gently pushing him back.
       David takes his hold of the hands, pulling them free and
       suddenly there's a flurry of violent movement as Stephan
       yanks his arms free of David and the two men shove at each
       other.

                            RACHEL
                 Stop it!

       They stop, breathing hard.

                           DAVID
                 We're not animals. Just remember
                 what we are. Remember what we're
                 not.

       He walks back out. Stephan sits back at the table, starts
       eating again. He glances at Rachel, but she won't look at
       him. After a moment she gets up and walks out.


158    INT. SITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                158

       David looks up from his chair to see in the hallway.
       Something purposeful in her manner alerts him.


159    HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                          159

       David appears in time to see Rachel is putting on her
       overcoat.
                           DAVID
                 What are you doing?

       Rachel doesn't look at him.

                           RACHEL
                 I have to get out.

                           DAVID
                     (Gently)
                 Rachel...

       Rachel tries to unbolt the door. David bars her. Rachel
       tries to talk calmly but she's fighting panic.
                           RACHEL
                 Get out of my way, please.
                 I'm just going to go out for a
                 few minutes. That's all I want to
                 do.

       Stephan walks out of the kitchen, taking in the scene.

                           DAVID
                 She wants to go out.

                           RACHEL
                     (appealing)
                 No one will see me. Tell him,
                 David. I just want to walk. I
                 just want to get some...air.
                 Please.

       Stephan shakes his head.

       Rachel tries to unlock the door, but David has hold of it.
       She struggles against him.

                           STEPHAN
                 Don't be stupid.

       He takes her arm. Rachel jerks free.

                           RACHEL
                 GET OFF ME!

       Then she slumps against the door, her back to them. She's
       crying brokenly.

       A beat as the two men stand over her, not attempting to
       comfort her any further.

       Stephan turns and walks away.

       David leans his head against the door, waiting for her to
       stop.

160    INT. SAFEHOUSE - LIVING ROOM. EVENING.                        160

       It's raining heavily outside and water is dripping through
       the cracks in the ceiling.

       David kneels next to VOGEL with a bowl of oatmeal and
       strips the tape from his mouth.

                           VOGEL
                 Thank you. David.

       David doesn't react.
       Vogel hums a tune to himself in between spoonfuls, watching
       David, his mood strange.

                           VOGEL (CONT'D)
                 David and Stephan and Rachel...

       He gives a soft laugh, finding something amusing in the
       sound of the names.

                           VOGEL (CONT'D)
                 If I had a choice I'd prefer
                 Rachel to feed me. So gentle...in
                 another life, the makings of a
                 Nurse, I think...in another
                 life...

       David continues to feed, careful to appear immune to Vogel.

                           VOGEL (CONT'D)
                 How is she today?
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   72.


                     VOGEL (CONT'D)
           You should let her get more rest.
           It's a dangerous time, the first
           month or two of the pregnancy.

 David stares at him, unable to hide his shock.

                      VOGEL (CONT'D)
               (Beat)
           You didn't know?

 Vogel absorbs this thoughtfully.

                     VOGEL (CONT'D)
           You're not the father then?
           (Beat)I thought it would be you.
           I thought...I don't know. The way
           you look at her. The way she
           looks at you...

 David stirs the oatmeal, trying to think about what he's
 just discovered. Vogel doesn't take his eyes off him...

                     VOGEL (CONT'D)
           Women can be like that, they like
           to make you dance first, I
           remember. (As though to himself)
           So, she chose the other one...?

 He shakes his head, shrugs.

                     VOGEL (CONT'D)
           That must be hard, watching them
           together, right in front of you.
           And you not saying a word. Like
           the Poet says - "Great souls
           suffer in silence." I wouldn't
           have taken Stephan as a family
           man. Too ambitious, too...?
           Whereas you? David, I see you
           with children...

                     DAVID
               (Quietly)
           Shut up.

 Vogel stares at him. This is the first time someone has
 spoken to him in weeks. He's quick to hide his sense of
 triumph.

                     VOGEL
           I am expressing my sympathy. For
           your suffering.

                     DAVID
           What does a monster like you know
           about suffering?
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   73.


                     VOGEL
           I'm a doctor, David.

 David stares at him.

                     DAVID
           A doctor. (beat)You blind
           children trying to change the
           colour of their eyes. You inject
           people with petrol. You...you
           replace people's hands and legs
           and you watch as they...

 He stops himself.

                     DAVID (CONT'D)
           This isn't medicine. This is
           disease. This is sickness.

 Vogel seems to consider this.
                     VOGEL
           So we were all insane? Is that
           the answer?

                      DAVID
               (Beat)
           There's no answer. I'm not
           looking for an answer. I'm not
           looking for...

 He forces himself to be silent, tries to regain control of
 himself. He offers Vogel another spoonful, but his hand
 trembles a little with the violence of his emotions.

                     VOGEL
           You're trembling.

 David pushes the spoon into Vogel's mouth, starts to load
 another spoonful.

                     VOGEL (CONT'D)
           It's strange. Here I am - the
           victim, kidnapped, bound, soon to
           be murdered, but I think you are
           the one that is afraid, David.
           (Beat) Afraid of the monster.

 He leans closer to David.

                        VOGEL (CONT'D)
                  (Softly)
           Boo.

 They stare at each other, eye to eye. Vogel senses a new
 brittleness in David. His tone becomes more assured.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09    74.


                     VOGEL (CONT'D)
           Yes. Do you know why it was easy
           to exterminate you people?
           Your weakness. I saw it. Every
           day I saw it. Every one of them,
           thinking only of how to avoid
           being flogged, or kicked, or
           killed. Only thinking of
           themselves.

 David looks up at him with a strange, crooked smile, eyes
 glittering.

                     VOGEL (CONT'D)
           Why do you think it only took
           four soldiers to lead a thousand
           people to the gas chambers?
           Entire families? Because not one,
           out of thousands, had the courage
           to resist, the courage to be the
           first to fall. Not one would
           sacrifice himself. Even when we
           took their children from them. I
           knew then that you people had no
           right to live, no right to...

 He may have begun his speech hoping to get a reaction from
 David but he has lost himself in his rant and so rather
 than triumph we see only a moment of startled fear in his
 eyes as David suddenly swings the bowl violently at his
 head, SHATTERING IT on the pipe to which he is tied.

 He grabs Vogel by the collar and begins to punch him, hard,
 again and again.

 Vogel slides sideways, limp. And still David punches him in
 a murderous rage, possessed, wanting to break his skull
 open, to kill him.

 Rachel and Stephan run in, with Rachel reaching him first.
 She throws her arms around him, trying to stop him, but -
 instinctively - he throws a punch behind him. It connects,
 splitting her lip and sending her flying to the ground.

 Stephan runs at him, knocking him to the floor, and remains
 lying on him, the two of them breathing hard, the assault
 finally over.

 VOGEL slumps forward, held up only by the rope at his
 wrists binding him to the pipe on the wall.

 Stephan is still struggling with David, who's panting,
 adrenalised, staring wildly at Vogel's slumped body.

                     STEPHAN
           Out. We're going out.

       He begins to drag him out. Stephan nods in the direction of
       VOGEL.

                           STEPHAN (CONT'D)
                     (to Rachel)
                 Are you going to be alright?

       Rachel nods.

       As she hears the door close, she turns to stare at Vogel.
       He's barely conscious, his face smeared with blood.


161    INT. SAFEHOUSE - BATHROOM. NIGHT.                            161

       Rachel drenches a cloth under the tap.


162    INT. SAFEHOUSE - LIVING ROOM. MOMENTS LATER                  162

       Rachel cleans the blood from VOGEL's face. He has his eyes
       closed.

                           VOGEL
                     (Mumbling, in German)
                 Thank you...

       She tears off a new strip of tape and places it over
       VOGEL's mouth, gently.

       She notices the rain leaking in through the ceiling and
       walks off towards the kitchen. We hold on Vogel, apparently
       sleeping. Then his tied hand reaches out, straining and
       manages to reach one of the SHARDS of broken bowl.

163    KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS                                         163

       Rachel gathers three METAL SAUCEPANS.

       She stops for a moment looking at FIREWORKS flashing in the
       sky. She remembers - it's New Years Eve.

       We TRACK with her as she walks into the living room and
       begins to place the pots on the floor to catch the
       rainwater which is dripping through various points in the
       ceiling.


       CLOSE ON VOGEL'S HANDS

       As he uses the shard to saw through his ropes.

 ON RACHEL

 ...as she finishes with the pots and notices the pieces of
 shattered bowl scattered around Vogel. She kneels down in
 front of him and collects up the pieces. She glances up at
 Vogel, checking him. He is still slumped, eyes closed.

 We TRACK with her as she walks back into the kitchen. From
 the living room comes the three distinct PINGS of rainwater
 dripping in the pots.

 She drops the pieces of bowl into the bin and stops,
 puzzled. It's a moment before she works out what she's
 noticed - something has changed in the sound of the
 rainwater next door. There only two drips instead of three.

 She walks back towards the living room...

 RACHEL'S P.O.V - through the living room door we can see
 that one of the pots has been overturned. Rachel slows to a
 stop. A sudden wave of adrenalin causes her to turn
 but...it's too late. Vogel steps out of the alcove he's
 been standing in so that he is directly in front of her.
 Before she can even cry out he has slashed her face open
 with a SHARD OF GLASS.

 Instinctively she cups her hands to her ripped face. Vogel
 grabs her by the hair and stepping behind her, tries to
 worm his other hand underneath her raised arms to reach her
 throat with the glass.

 Her training kicking in, Rachel uses a krav magah move to
 grab and twist Vogel's forearm, breaking his hold on her
 and turning the arm until, with a yell of pain, Vogel drops
 the shard. He swings wildly at her, but Rachel ducks the
 fist and drives the palm of her hand up into his face.
 Vogel stumbles back, surprised by her speed and the sudden
 pain of the blow.

 Rachel is about to press home the attack but is blinded by
 blood from her wound washing into her eyes.

 As she wipes her eyes clear, Vogel grabs a LAMP from a
 small chest of drawers in the hall and smashes it into her
 face. She falls.

 Vogel begins to run, but, driven by adrenaline and
 desperation, Rachel scrambles onto all fours and lunges at
 him, catching hold of his trouser leg as he moves towards
 the front door.

 Vogel stumbles, manages to pull a leg free and stamps down
 on Rachel who lets go with a moan. He stamps again, steps
 free and kicks her hard in the head.
      FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09    77.


       Rachel rolls with the force of the kick and comes to a
       rest, losing consciousness.

       RACHEL'S P.O.V - LOW ANGLE - Fluttering in and out of
       darkness - Vogel's feet as he stands beside us, breathing
       hard. Then he turns and hurries to the front door...and
       out.


164    EXT. WALKWAY. BERLIN SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT.                      164

       Vogel hurries along the walkway and sets off down the
       spiral staircase of the apartment building.


165    INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT.                                         165

       Rachel lies motionless. We wait for her to cough as we saw
       her do before. But she doesn't. She just continues to lie
       still.

166    EXT. STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS                                   166

       Below us Vogel clatters on down the stairs, flight after
       flight.


167    INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                     167

       No movement from Rachel.


168    EXT. STAIRWELL/COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS                         168

       Vogel clears the stairs and bursts into the courtyard.
       There is a lurid flash of fireworks from nearby and for a
       moment we see Vogel lit, as he passes the point where
       earlier we saw him drop to the ground.

       He reaches the gate and goes through, his shadow
       disappearing on the pavement.

       He's gone.


169    INT. BERLIN SAFEHOUSE - LIVING ROOM. NIGHT                    169

       Rachel holds a blood-soaked tea towel to her cheek, trying
       to staunch the flow. David sits, staring ahead, in shock.

       Stephan bursts in, out of breath.

                              STEPHAN
                    Nothing. Not a trace. Nothing at
                    all.

 He hurries to the drawers and takes out the gun, puts it
 into his waistband.

                     STEPHAN (CONT'D)
           He might go to the house, might
           try and get a message to the
           wife...

                     DAVID
               (Without looking up)
           He's not going back to the house.
           He's gone. Fifteen years, it took
           them to find him. And he's gone.
           And no-one's going to find him
           again.

                     STEPHAN
           So we what? We...are you going to
           make the phone call? Are you
           going to tell them how he got a
           fucking piece of broken bowl?
           Wonderful. But don't try and take
           me down with you. I've done
           nothing wrong. Remember that!

 Stephan kicks at the chair, at the drawers.

                     STEPHAN (CONT'D)
               (muttering tensely)
           This can't happen! This is never
           going to go away.

                     RACHEL
           I take responsibility. It was my
           shift.
                     DAVID
               (Quietly)
           This happened because of me. I
           let him go. And no-one's ever
           going to find him again.

 He closes his eyes, struggling with the enormity of his
 guilt.

 Stephan drops the gun onto the table, sits down. Outside we
 hear more fireworks. Suddenly...

                     STEPHAN
           No-one's ever going to find him
           again.

 Something in his voice causes Rachel to look up at him.

                      STEPHAN (CONT'D)
               (Beat)
           What if he didn't escape?
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   79.


                     RACHEL
           What are you talking about?

                     STEPHAN
           Only four people know what
           happened in this room. Us, and
           him. And he's not talking. No one
           will ever hear from him again.

                       RACHEL
                 (Realizing what he
                  means)
           No.

                     STEPHAN
           Nobody needs to know what
           happened here.

                     RACHEL
           He escaped.
                     STEPHAN
           That's the truth. But that
           doesn't have to be the truth we
           take home. The truth can be
           anything we want it to be. The
           truth is Vogel tried to escape,
           you struggled with him and got
           hurt. The truth is, seconds
           before he got away, Rachel got
           the gun and shot him. The truth
           is we got rid of him.... got rid
           of the body... got rid of every
           trace of the Surgeon of Birkenau.

                     RACHEL
           We can't lie about this!

                     STEPHAN
           No, you know what? We have to. We
           have to! This is...this isn't
           about us. This is about Israel.
           This is a national humiliation!
           We can't be seen to fail. And in
           the end, Vogel rots away his life
           in some jungle, looking over his
           shoulder, waiting for the
           bullet...? Who's to say...?

 He looks at them both, trying to convince them, trying to
 convince himself.

                     STEPHAN (CONT'D)
           Maybe that's a worse fate. Maybe
           that's...The important thing is
           justice... justice is seen to be
           done!

 Rachel turns to David, waiting, expecting him to say
 something. But David looks like he's been barely listening,
 lost in his own thoughts. He notices Rachel staring at him.

                     DAVID
           He's gone. What does it
           matter?(Beat) He's gone.

 Stephan seizes on this, sensing he's close to convincing
 them.

                     STEPHAN
               (Seizing )
           He's right. It makes no
           difference. No difference. All we
           have to agree is that we never
           talk about this. No matter what
           happens, we never tell anyone.
           The truth stays in this room.
           Between us. Agreed?
 Rachel looks at David again, wanting some kind of sign.

                     STEPHAN (CONT'D)
               (To Rachel)
           Agreed? Say it. (Silence) I need
           to hear you say it!

 She's still staring at David. He's still avoiding her gaze.

                     STEPHAN (CONT'D)
               (To Rachel)
           Say it. Say...

                       DAVID
           Agreed.
 Silence. Rachel closes her eyes. Instead of relief she
 feels a kind of immense disappointment.

                       RACHEL
           David...?

                     STEPHAN
           Rachel? Say it. It's an oath. Say
           it.

 We CLOSE on Rachel. The moment that will change her life
 forever.

 From outside comes the sound of some REVELLERS on the
 street cheering, more fireworks. We hear some people
 chanting a countdown to the New Year...

                     REVELLERS (O.S.)
               (From outside)

       But just before the expected barrage of fireworks we...

                                                       CUT TO:


170    EXT. DAVID'S APARTMENT - 1997 - NIGHT.                       170

       The young Mossad Agent stands smoking outside David's door.
       This is the scene we saw earlier. From within we can hear
       indistinct shouting.


171    INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS.           171

       Rachel is holding the PRINTED SHEET - the point at which we
       left this scene earlier.

                           RACHEL
                     (crying out)
                 How could this happen? You said
                 he would never speak! You said
                 he'd never...

                           STEPHAN
                 We don't know it's him.

                           RACHEL
                 Oh God! Oh God!

                           STEPHAN
                 If you read it...

                           RACHEL
                 He's alive! He's in the Ukraine!
                 What else is there to read?
                           STEPHAN
                 This is a little internet story.
                 (Grabbing the paper,
                 reading)..."a psychiatric patient
                 claiming to be the Surgeon of
                 Birkenau..." Some crazy old man.
                 No-one is paying this any
                 attention. Yet.

                           RACHEL
                     (as if her mind was
                      elsewhere)
                 How did you find it?

                           STEPHAN
                 David comes back after all this
                 time, I want to know why. I had
                 his apartment searched. This was
                 on his computer...

       Rachel stares at him.

            He didn't say anything to you
            last night..?

  Rachel doesn't answer.

                     RACHEL (CONT'D)
               (quietly)
           Why would he do this..?

                     STEPHAN
           Because he couldn't handle it. I
           told him we had to deal with it
           and he couldn't handle it. He
           thought it was all going to come
           out and he panicked...

 He trails off, thinking about what happened down on the
 road. Rachel stares at him. His previous words have just
 sunk in.

                     RACHEL
               (Suddenly)
           Deal with it? (Beat) What does
           that mean? Deal with it?

 Stephan stares at her.
                     RACHEL (CONT'D)
           What did you tell him to do?

                     STEPHAN
               (Simply)
           I told him to find Vogel. I told
           him to finish it.

 Rachel stares at him. She stands up, starts to walk away,
 comes back, slaps him hard across the face.

                     RACHEL
               (quiet rage)
           Did you know he'd been ill? Did
           you...? You knew, didn't you? You
           killed him. YOU killed him! You
           knew he wasn't strong enough...

           FUCK DAVID! I don't want to hear
           about David! David took the
           coward's way out!

                     RACHEL
           You could have left it alone!
           It's an old man in a hospital!
           You said - nobody will believe
           it! No-one will notice!

 This stops her.

                 and he's going to interview
                 Vogel. (Beat) Then it all comes
                 apart. (Beat) We don't have the
                 name of the hospital. You have to
                 find out where he is.

       Rachel stares at him.

                           RACHEL
                 What are you talking about?

                           STEPHAN
                 David's taken himself out of the

                 I can't do it. You're the only
                 one left.

                     (Beat. Simply)
                 You have to, Rachel. Because for
                 thirty years you've been taking
                 the credit for it. (Beat,
                 carefully) And there's Sarah.
       It's as if he's struck her. Beat.

                           RACHEL
                 I won't do this.

       She walks out.


172    EXT. STAIRWELL OUTSIDE DAVID'S APARTMENT - NIGHT             172

       And into the stairwell. As before, the Mossad agent stands
       to let her pass, and watches as she sweeps down the stairs.


173    INT. RACHEL'S HOTEL - MORNING                                173

       The scene we saw earlier.
      FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   84.


       Rachel is packing, folding clothes neatly, precisely,
       silently - but all the time there's a terrible tension
       about her movements.

       She tries to close a drawer but it sticks, She keeps
       trying, then in a sudden rush of fury yanks the drawer free
       and hurls it across the room.

       She stands breathing hard.

       Then something we didn't see - her gaze settles on a
       photograph beside her table - SARAH holding her son,
       smiling at us.

       Rachel stares at the photograph, her breathing slowing.


174    EXT. PATIO TERRACE. HOTEL NEAR TEL AVIV - DAY                174

       Stephan sits amongst the remains of a meal.
       Sarah and her husband are on the beach below, playing with
       their son.

       Stephan watches them. He senses a presence and turns to
       find Rachel behind him. She sits down, stares down at the
       beach through her dark glasses.

       Stephan watches, almost holding his breath, working through
       lightning calculations of how to handle her. But Rachel is
       the first to speak.

                            RACHEL
                     (Beat)
                 I always knew this would happen.
                 I knew we'd be punished. I knew
                 we'd have to pay.

                           STEPHAN
                     (Quietly)
                 I thought I'd already been

 He stops. She is staring back at him coldly, unmoved. He
 shrugs, letting that go.

                     STEPHAN (CONT'D)
           But there's one thing I would
           never change.

 She looks over to where Sarah is playing with her son,
 laughing.

                     RACHEL
               (Instantly)
           She isn't going to find out.

 She shakes her head, as if the idea itself were impossible.

                     RACHEL (CONT'D)
           She can never find out.

 Stephan stares at her, KNOWING THAT HE HAS HER, that it's
 already decided.
 He takes out the envelope and slides it across the table
 towards her. She examines the ticket and passports inside.
 Then he slides her the BLACK CASE. We've seen this part of
 the scene before.

 She stares at it with disgust, knowing what it is. Then she
 takes it and puts it in her handbag.

                     STEPHAN
           My car's waiting outside. It can
           take you to the airport.

 She stands up, an elegant woman at lunch, her dark glasses,
 her suit...
 She looks down to Sarah, raises a hand in farewell.

 Sarah, not understanding, waves a hand in response, calls
 something which is lost under the sound of the sea.

                     STEPHAN (CONT'D)
           Go down to her. Say goodbye to
           her.

 Rachel stands stock still, staring down at her daughter.

                     RACHEL
           How can I? (Beat.) How can I?

 She turns and walks away.

        Sarah stands, shading her eyes, watching the small figure

        A tram wipes through the frame to reveal Rachel walking
        across a busy street towards the stark facade of an
        imposing 1960's building.
        A TITLE reads:   Kiev, Ukraine


180     INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY                                   180

        The public area of the building - a main reception desk, a
        little cafe, a sweeping staircase leading up to the floor
        above...

        Rachel is at the reception desk...


180A    NEWSPAPER BUILDING - MEZZANINE LEVEL - CONTINUOUS         180A

        Rachel crosses to a TABAC KIOSK, glancing back to some
        glass doors behind her.

        A sign indicates the offices of the UKRAINIAN EVENING NEWS.

        We can see a RECEPTIONIST at her desk. A young man walks
        through the entrance, and she throws a knowing glance up at
        him as he passes.

        Rachel takes in the ALARM PAD beside the receptionist.

                            RACHEL
                      (turning to the Kiosk
                       Owner)
                  Cigarettes please.

180B    GROUND FLOOR CAFE. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY                   180B

        Rachel sits, silhouetted against the large window. Rachel
        opens her pack and lights a cigarette.

        A WAITER approaches.

                            WAITER
                      (In Russian)
                  What can I get you?

                            RACHEL
                  Just a coffee.

        She stares out at the stream of people passing in and out
        of the building...

181     INT. HANGAR - DAY - THE PAST                                 181

        Late sixties. Young Rachel, Stephan and David are giving a
        talk to a group of young Israeli soldiers. This is a well-
        rehearsed routine, something they have probably done many
        times.

                            RACHEL
                  At that moment, I don't think I
                  was thinking about myself at all.
                  I was thinking about my mother. I
                  was thinking about how she had
                  suffered in Europe.
        The FACES of the soldiers, moved by this. One raises a
        hand.

                            SOLDIER
                  The same question to Mr. Peretz.

        The others look at David, waiting for him to make his usual
        response.

        But David doesn't move.

        Stephan looks along the row. David sits staring straight
        ahead. The silence GROWS.

        And we realize he's NOT GOING TO ANSWER.

182    INT. RACHEL AND STEPHEN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - EVENING           182

       The house is cold, white, aggressively modern. Rachel sits
       in her underwear, drunk, a bottle and glass of wine on her
       dressing table. Stephan is dressing behind her.

                            STEPHAN
                      (Calmly)
                  Fuck him.

       He examines his reflection in the mirror.

                              STEPHAN
                  Fuck him.

       A DOORBELL rings downstairs. He walks out to answer it,
       taking the wine bottle from her as he goes.

                              STEPHAN (CONT'D)
                  Hurry up.
       Rachel finishes her glass, starts to apply some eye makeup.
       She senses something and turns to find YOUNG SARAH (four)
       watching her from the doorway. She stares back at her
       dully.

                            RACHEL
                  Go to bed, Sarah.


183    LIVING ROOM - EVENING                                         183   *

       A cocktail party in progress - Stephan is mingling with the
       guests - Mossad high-fliers, Military, politicians. She             *
       watches him handle them - just the right mix of deference
       and charm.
       Rachel stands against a wall, drunk, watching him as he
       laughs sycophantically at something one of the politicians
       has said.

       He crosses over to an attractive BLONDE WOMAN and greets
       her. As Rachel watches he runs a hand down the woman's back
       - an unmistakably INTIMATE gesture.

       Rachel watches - depressed by how little this makes her
       feel. She begins to mix herself another drink, sees someone
       across the room, and her face changes...


       ON DAVID

       He's standing alone drinking, nervous. Rachel appears               *
       beside him.                                                         *

           friend I have...                                    *

 She turns, leans against the wall, scans the party, watches   *
 Stephan working the room.                                     *

                     RACHEL (CONT'D)                           *

           Stephen's girlfriends.

 She turns to see what David's reaction to this is, but he
 continues to watch Stephan.                                   *

                     RACHEL (CONT'D)                           *

           I thought the silence was for the                   *
           audience, I didn't know you'd                       *
           really lost your voice.                             *

 David suddenly takes her hand and pulls her round the         *
 corner.                                                       *

 haven't seen before - fear or excitement?                     *

       He leads her back towards the party.                               *


184    INT. NEWSPAPER BUILDING - GROUND FL. CAFE - EARLY EVENING 184
       Rachel sits, still smoking, though it's dark outside now.
       There is a sound of chatter from above her and she looks up
       to see JOURNALISTS spilling out from the offices above,
       coming down the stairs towards her.

       Rachel eases a PHOTOCOPIED SHEET from her bag and examines
       it...

       INSERT SHEET

       A photocopy of a JOURNALIST'S BY-LINE - a long, rather
       mournful face, the name YURI TITOV.

       She checks the face, slips the sheet back in the bag, looks
       up, studying the men descending towards her. Moments later
       she has found him - chatting to a colleague.

       He reaches the ground floor and walking past her, goes to
       the bar for a coffee.

       Rachel finds herself staring at him -   the man WHO COULD
       DESTROY HER LIFE.

       Yuri seems to sense someone watching him and looks to where
       Rachel was sitting.

       But there's no-one there.


185    INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE LOBBY. CONTINUOUS.                     185

       The PRETTY RECEPTIONIST stands chatting to her BOYFRIEND, a
       young journalist. He is holding her coat for.
       FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   92.


        She starts to put it on and the Boyfriend gives a brief
        bark and play-bites at her neck. She laughs, pushing him
        away. Rachel hurries in.

                            RACHEL
                      (Russian)
                  Am I late? I'm sorry.... Can I
                  place an advertisement?

                            RECEPTIONIST
                      (gathering her things)
                  100 grivna for twenty words. 5
                  grivna a word after that.

        Rachel proffers an envelope.

                               RACHEL (CONT'D)
                  Here...

        The girl takes it.
                               RECEPTIONIST
                  Thanks.

        Rachel fishes in her bag and hands over a 100 GRIVNA NOTE.

                            RACHEL
                  This should cover it.

        The girl drops the envelope onto her desk, and slips the
        money into a small DESKTOP DRAWER UNIT, as Rachel leaves.


186     INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE - MEZZANINE LEVEL. CONTINUOUS.         186

        Rachel pauses outside the doors, zipping her bag, watching
        the receptionist tap a code into the alarm key-pad before
        letting herself and the Boyfriend out. She locks the door
        after them and the two walk past Rachel who smiles a
        goodbye.

        She watches them go.


186A    INT. NEWSPAPER BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR CAFE - NIGHT        186A

        The place is dark now, eerily lit by the street lights
        outside. An ELDERLY SECURITY GUARD trudges past, whistling
        softly.

189    INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE - LOBBY. CONTINUOUS.                   189

       We're looking through the glass doors to the shadowy
       mezzanine level beyond. A DARK FIGURE stands silhouetted at
       the door. We hear the scrape of tools working on the lock.
       There is a click, the doors open and Rachel slips inside.

       The alarm begins to BEEP. Rachel takes out a TORCH. A quick
       twist and the beam becomes ULTRAVIOLET.

       As Rachel moves swiftly towards the alarm box, the beam
       from the torch sweeps across the girl's desk, and we see
       Rachel's envelope glowing a deep PURPLE. We may also notice
       that the desktop drawer unit where the girl placed the
       money is smudged with purple FINGERPRINTS.

       Rachel opens the alarm box and shines her beam onto the
       keypad. We see four PURPLE FINGERPRINTS, one deeply
       pigmented, the other three progressively less so.

       Rachel takes a deep breath and punches the four marked keys
       in what she hopes is the correct order. The alarm falls
       silent.

       She moves quickly out of the lobby, down the corridor...


190    INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE - MAIN ROOM. CONTINUOUS.               190

       ...and into the main press room.

       Using her torch on its regular setting, Rachel scours the
       desks for information.

       On one desk is a photograph of the journalist we just met -
       YURI - HOLDING A LARGE FISH in triumph. Rachel dives into
       the desk's FILING UNIT and begins to rifle through the
       files.

       Presently, she finds an OLD PICTURE OF VOGEL. He wears SS
       uniform, the same shot we have seen before.

       Behind it, a stack of SCRIBBLED NOTES. She begins to scan
       them.


191    INT. NEWSPAPER BUILDING - MEZZANINE LEVEL - CONTINUOUS       191

       The Receptionist and her drunk BOYFRIEND stand at the doors
       to the newspaper office, trying to open them. It takes them
       a moment, as - unaware that it was unlocked - the girl has
       accidentally locked it. Her boyfriend tussles with her
       playfully, keen for her to let him try instead, but she
       swats him away, turns the key again and finally they're in.

192    INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE - MAIN ROOM. NIGHT.                    192

       Rachel, unaware, is still reading through the notes. She
       takes out paper and pen and copies down the information she
       needs.


193    INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE - LOBBY. NIGHT.                        193

       The receptionist stands by the alarm box, drunk and
       confused, as the Boyfriend, impatient and equally drunk,
       comes up close behind her and reaches round to clumsily
       unbutton her coat.

                           RECEPTIONIST
                     (Whispering)
                 That's weird.

       The coat undone, the Boyfriend reaches round and snakes his
       hands up inside her sweater. She ignores him.
                           RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
                 I set the alarm.

                           BOYFRIEND
                 What?

                           RECEPTIONIST
                 The alarm's not on.

                           BOYFRIEND
                 Who gives a shit?

       He moves his hands from her breasts to grab her around the
       waist and pull her away from the alarm box.

194    INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE - MAIN ROOM. CONTINUOUS.               194

       Rachel is still at the desk reading. Suddenly the main
       LIGHTS are switched on and the Receptionist and the
       Boyfriend stagger into sight.

       Rachel stands frozen, COMPLETELY VISIBLE.

       The girl and boyfriend stand kissing, too engrossed in each
       other to see the woman standing only ten feet from them.

       The Receptionist pulls free, laughing, makes it back to the
       entrance and switches the lights off, plunging the room
       into darkness.

       Rachel moves behind a column.
      FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   95.


       Laughing softly, the Boyfriend leads the girl over to a
       desk. He opens a drawer, searches through it, triumphantly
       produces a PETTY CASH TIN.

                             BOYFRIEND
                 The loot!

       He starts to take some cash from the box.

                            RECEPTIONIST
                     (Laughing)
                 You can't!

                           BOYFRIEND
                 I'll put in an i-o-u...

       He scribbles on a piece of paper.

                           BOYFRIEND (CONT'D)
                 "Andrei borrowed money to take
                 Katia to Club Oxygen."
       He drops the note in the tin.

                           RECEPTIONIST
                 You're going to get fired.

       He kisses her.

                           BOYFRIEND
                 You're worth it.

                           RECEPTIONIST
                 You're going to get me fired!

                           BOYFRIEND
                     (Kissing her)
                 I'm worth it.

       They kiss again, slowly backing up against the desk Rachel
       was searching. The two struggle with their clothes.


195    BEHIND THE COLUMN                                            195

       Rachel has no way of reaching the door.

       She closes her eyes as the young couple begin to have sex
       on the desk.

       Then she opens her eyes and notices something...

       RACHEL'S P.O.V - CLOSE on her TORCH which is still on the
       desk.

       The Boyfriend seems to be staring RIGHT AT IT.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   96.


 Rachel watches, holding her breath.


 ON BOYFRIEND

 ...as we realise he is staring STRAIGHT THROUGH the torch,
 lost in the moment.

 Next moment the couple change positions and some books and
 the torch are swept from the desk and clatter to the floor.
 The TORCH ROLLS across the carpet to the shadowy entrance
 of the cubicle.


 BEHIND THE COLUMN

 Rachel stares at the torch, wondering if she can reach it
 before they can see her. But at the moment the desktop
 tryst reaches its noisy conclusion.

 AT THE DESK

 The Boyfriend does up his trousers and pulls on his coat.

 The Receptionist adjusts her dress. She notices the fallen
 items and begins to pick them up, following the trail to
 the torch.


 BEHIND THE COLUMN

 Rachel stands frozen as the Receptionist stoops down
 directly IN FRONT OF HER and picks up the torch.

 The Boyfriend notices.
                     BOYFRIEND
           What are you doing?

                     RECEPTIONIST
           I'm tidying up.

                     BOYFRIEND
           Are you working? Are you at work
           now?

                     RECEPTIONIST
               (Laughing)
           No, I'm not working.

                     BOYFRIEND
           So leave them.

 She drops the objects and follows her Boyfriend out.

        Shaking, Rachel picks up her torch and replaces the items
        she is still holding from Yuri's file into the filing
        cabinet.

        From OS, we hear the BEEP BEEP BEEP of the alarm being
        reset.

        Rachel's heart sinks.

        OS, we hear office doors close, and the KEY TURNING in the
        lock.

        Rachel's eyes alight on A MOTION SENSOR, blinking in the
        corner of the room.

        She waits. And eventually - no choice - she runs for the
        door.

        The motion sensor lights up and the alarm strikes up loudly
        with a warning BEEP-BEEP-BEEP.

196     INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE - LOBBY. CONTINUOUS.                   196

        Frantic, Rachel dashes to the alarm box, the insistent beep-
        beep-beep even louder here. Rachel runs for the door, yanks
        it open and bolts out.

        Moments later, the alarm CLANGS into action.

       There's silence from the other end. Both know what this
       means.

                 This will be over soon. And when
                 it is...

       The car drifts to the wrong side, then swerves as she
       corrects.

      FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09    99.


       RACHEL is being interviewed by a FEMALE FACULTY MEMBER.
       Projected on a screen behind is an image of the young
       Rachel, Stephan and David.

       The audience consists of mainly female students, hands
       raised.


                           STUDENT
                 Did you think you were going to
                 die?

       Rachel seems to consider this carefully, although we know
       by now that this is a question she's been asked thousands
       of times and has a carefully rehearsed answer to.

                           RACHEL
                 I'll tell you something. At that
                 moment, when I was on the floor,
                 I wasn't thinking about myself at
                 all. I was thinking about my
                 mother. And what she had suffered
                 in Europe. I think that was what
                 gave me the strength to get up
                 again.

       The audience listen, moved. Rachel looks out and then
       FREEZES - Older David sits near the back of the room.

                           LECTURER
                 Well, I'm sure you'll all join me
                 in thanking Ms Singer...

       As the audience applaud enthusiastically Rachel smiles,
       trying to regain her composure but her eyes are drawn back
       to David, standing in the shadows, watching her intently.

               Have you met anyone else?                        *

  Rachel stares at him.      How can he even ask this?          *
                         RACHEL
               No. Thank you for asking. There                  *
               was someone...but he left. And I                 *
               never heard from him again.                      *

                         DAVID                                  *
               I wrote you letters.                             *

            Different jobs. Some teaching.                     *
            Whatever I could get.                              *

            I travelled a lot. The States.                     *

            Who..?                                             *

  He doesn't answer and she looks up, suddenly realising who   *
  he means. She feels a sudden, instinctive rush of fear.      *

                      RACHEL (CONT'D)                          *
            Why?                                               *

            What would you have done if you                    *
            had found him..?                                   *

  He's watching her intently                                   *

                      DAVID                                    *
            I would have told the truth. I                     *
            would have gone to the newspaper,                  *
            and said "this is the Surgeon of                   *
            Birkenau." I could have finally                    *
            seen him face trial.                               *

  Rachel listens to this, mesmerised.                          *

          We'd be free. Whatever happened                   *
          to us, it seemed to me we'd be                    *
          free.                                             *

          Don't you agree? Aren't you tired                 *
          of lying? Isn't that what you                     *
          would have done - if you'd found                  *
          him?                                              *

away. He sits slowly back                                   *

                    RACHEL (CONT'D)                         *

          If the truth had come out she                     *
          would be destroyed. (Beat)                        *
          So...no, I wouldn't have told the                 *
          truth.                                            *

          But you never found him                           *

She looks at him, waiting for him to contradict this.       *

          Yes. Thank you...                                 *

         watches the line of shadow moving towards him.                     *

         A car roars past and is gone, revealing Rachel standing
         amongst the trees beside her car, a cigarette forgotten in
         her hand, absorbing what it was David was asking her.

         Finally she drops the cigarette and climbs back into her
         car.

         ...driving, lost in thought. She drives into some

         The BABENKO HOSPITAL - a huge, imposing building stands in
         wintry grounds. A long drive leads up to the car park and
         the entrance.

        The large lobby area, vast pillars. A few stairs lead up
        from this to a waiting area, separated from the corridors
        beyond by BARS AND LOCKED GATES.

        Rachel approaches a young male REGISTRAR at RECEPTION.

                            RACHEL
                      (Russian)
                  Good morning. I'm here to visit
                  Mr. Schevchuk?
        The man squints at her, checks his register an squints at
        her again.

                            REGISTRAR
                  You're from the newspaper?
                  Because I have a man's name
                  here...

                            RACHEL
                  Oh, no, no. I'm Mr Schevchuk's
                  niece. Anna Barova. I've been
                  before, do you remember?

        A moment's scrutiny, then a shrug.
                            REGISTRAR
                  Well, our visiting hours haven't
                  changed, I'm afraid. Eleven till
                  one.

        He points to a PLAQUE that reads:

        VISITING HOURS: 11:00am - 1:00am, 5:00pm - 8:00pm

        Sarah glances at her watch. It's 10.25.

                            REGISTRAR (CONT'D)
                  Take a seat?

        He points to a waiting area.

        Rachel walks up the few stairs past a large PILLAR and
        takes a seat, trying to think of her next step.

        She glances to her left, through the bars, and sees an OLD
        WOMAN in a patient's gown staring blankly at her from the
        far end of the corridor. A DOCTOR appears and leads the Old
        Woman away, still staring.

        Rachel looks away, unnerved.

        Someone has just walked in and is talking to the
        Receptionist. Rachel's view is obscured by the pillar and
        she leans slightly to see who it is.

        RACHEL'S P.O.V - YURI stands showing his press card to the
        Registrar.

        AT RECEPTION

        The Registrar passes the press card back.

                            REGISTRAR
                  Mr. Schevchuk is in room 414.
                  Visiting time starts at eleven
                  o'clock. You can take a seat over
                  there.

        Yuri walks across the lobby, towards where Rachel is
        waiting, but as he clears the pillar we see her seat is
        EMPTY.

        ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PILLAR

        ...Rachel waits for Yuri to pass and then slips back out of
        the lobby.


209     EXT. BABENKO HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS.                          209
        Rachel emerges - panicking. Time is almost up. What can she
        do?


210     EXT/INT. CAR. REAR OF HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER               210

        Rachel's car is speeding down a narrow road that runs
        behind the hospital. Two stone arches frame the road, where
        the building meets the hillside.

        RACHEL'S P.O.V - high fences - the forbidding facade of the
        hospital - rows of barred windows.

        Rachel is scanning the building, looking for some way in.


211     EXT/INT. CAR/REAR ENTRANCE - MOMENTS LATER                   211

        Suddenly we pass a central arched entrance. A man is
        opening large double METAL DOORS for A LAUNDRY VAN to leave
        the hospital.

        It takes Rachel a few moments to register it. Then she
        BRAKES.


212     EXT. BACK OF HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER                        212

        The LAUNDRY VAN is driving through the doors. It stops,
        engine idling, and the DRIVER begins to climb down to close
        the doors after him.

        Before he clears the side of the truck, Rachel slips into
        the darkness.

        The DRIVER, oblivious, reaches the doors and begins to
        swing them shut...


213     INT. BABENKO HOSPITAL - DAY                                  213

        Rachel runs up the staircase from the service area of the
        hospital.

214     INT. CORRIDOR. BABENKO HOSPITAL - DAY                        214

        Long and bleak with rows of BARRED DOORS. Rachel runs on.


215     INT. WAITING AREA. BABENKO HOSPITAL -DAY.                    215

        Yuri is writing in a notebook. The clock says: 10:50.


216     INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR. BABENKO HOSPITAL - DAY                216

        Rachel reaches a junction - the vast, white corridors
        stretching away from her in different directions, like a
        nightmarish maze.

        She stares about her, picks a corridor and begins to run
        again.


217     INT. CORRIDOR/CENTRAL STAIRWELL - DAY                        217

        Rachel reaches a MAP on the wall and scans it, frantically
        trying to locate the room she needs.

        She hurries on to an ancient looking ELEVATOR and gets in,
        jabs at the fourth floor button.

        With a groan of its motor the elevator begins to rise.


218     CORRIDOR                                                     218

      FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   106.


        Finally we reach it - ROOM 414.

        Rachel stares at the door.


219     INT. TOILETS. BABENKO HOSPITAL - DAY                         219

        Rachel sits in a CUBICLE. She takes the BLACK CASE from her
        handbag and opens it. Inside is a pen. She lifts this and
        the false bottom of the case away to reveal a HYPODERMIC
        NEEDLE and an AMPULE of a clear liquid. With trembling
        hands she begins to prepare the injection.

        She can't quite believe what she is about to do.


220     INT. ROOM 414 - CONTINUOUS                                   220

        Rachel enters the room. The curtains are drawn and Rachel
        hesitates for a moment, her eyes adjusting to the gloom.
        A MAN sits in a chair, angled towards the window, his back
        to us. An IV drip hangs on a stand, its tube running into a
        cannula on the back of a withered hand which hangs from the
        chair.

        The only sound is the faint, rasping breath of the man.

        Rachel moves a little closer. On the bottom of the bed
        hangs a medical chart. The name reads Ivan Schevchuk.

        Rachel moves closer, carefully taking the HYPODERMIC NEEDLE
        from her pocket.


221     INT. BABENKO HOSPITAL - RECEPTION. DAY.                      221
        A NURSE is unlocking the gate at the waiting area for Yuri.
        He walks through them and over to the ELEVATOR.


222     INT. ROOM 414 - DAY                                          222

        Rachel stands by the IV drip and tube. She can inject
        directly into the tube - and it will be over. She holds the
        tube, rests the tip of the needle against it. She struggles
        with herself. Just one tiny push...

        She can't do it.

        She stands frozen for a moment then slowly lowers the
        needle.

        Beside her, the steady breathing alters. The Man stirs and
        a cadaverous face half turns towards us.
      FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   107.


        Rachel and Schevchuk stare at each other. The face is
        ancient, lined...but IT ISN'T THE FACE OF VOGEL.

                  No. No, I don't.

                            RACHEL
                  Yes. I've heard of you.

        Schevchuk looks at his withered hands.

                  Birkenau?

        He struggles to raise his arm in the Nazi salute, a
        pathetic sick man.

        Rachel sits down at Schevchuk's desk, feeling suddenly
        exhausted.

223     INT. ELEVATOR - DAY                                          223

        Yuri stands in the elevator waiting for the doors to close.

                            NURSE
                  Hold the doors please.

        Yuri holds the doors, as the Nurse approaches, escorting an
        ELDERLY WOMAN with a walker - the two moving at a snails
        pace.

        Yuri watches, amused.


224     INT. ROOM 414 - DAY                                          224

        rambles on.

                  ...It comes down to blood. We

        He dissolves into a fit of weak coughing.

        Rachel stares at a NOTEPAD AND PEN on the desk beside her.


225     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY                                          225

        Yuri walks towards Schevchuk's room. He pays no attention
        to Rachel as he passes her, sitting on a bench, dialling
        her cell phone. She listens to the other end ring.

        Stephan is talking to a couple of OFFICIALS. His cell phone
        rings.

                  It isn't him.
        Stephan nods, a fixed smile on his face, covers the
        mouthpiece.

        The two OFFICIALS leave the office, closing the door behind
        them. Stephan takes a a beat to calm his breathing.

                     was afraid the story would come

        amongst this ordinary world?

        She feels her pace quicken as she's drawn on through the
        room. It's as if she's back at that terrible night. Vogel's
        ahead of her somewhere, escaping all over again.

        She FLASHES through DOUBLE DOORS into a junction area - a
        long, empty corridor leading away from her on the right,
        ahead another set of double doors...

        She bursts through these doors and finds herself in...

241     INT. LOCKER ROOM/BATHROOM - DAY                              241

        A long, white tiled corridor of a room. A row of windows
        down the right, under which sit WASHBASINS. There's a row
        of LOCKERS and DOORS along the left.

        Rachel walks on, feeling increasingly as if she's in a
        dream.

        She's deep into the room before she realises it's a dead-
        end - there's no exit ahead of her.

                            VOGEL
                      (a dull rasp)
                  Why did you come...?

        She turns and freezes.

        Vogel has emerged from one of the doorways on the left. Now
        he's between her and the doors on the far side of the room.

                      VOGEL (CONT'D)
            Why did you have to come? You
            didn't have to follow me.

  He begins to advance slowly towards her.

                      VOGEL (CONT'D)
            Was it Schevchuk? Did he talk?

  Rachel stands frozen as he creeps closer. He reaches out a
  hand as if to reassure her, a ghastly attempt at
  reasonableness.

                      VOGEL
            I can stop him. I won't tell him
            anymore. (Almost pleading) Nobody
            needs to know.

  As if the spell has broken Rachel makes a sudden dart for
  the doors. But before she can pass him, Vogel has moved
  with surprising speed and, almost before Rachel has seen
  the SCISSORS in his other hand, he has stabbed them into
  her shoulder.

  She reels over against the opposite wall, dislodging a
  GLASS SHELF which shatters into a WASHBASIN behind her.

  Vogel goes after her, pinning her against the basin, one
  hand on her throat, the other hand trying to stab her
  again. Rachel manages to grab the scissor hand and the two
  struggle frantically.

  The scissors inch closer to her FACE, to her EYE.

  Her other hand emerges from the basin behind her holding a
  piece of the broken glass shelf, which she whips across
  Vogel's face.

  He gives a horrible shriek and lets her go, clutching at
  his cheek.

  Rachel collapses gasping to the floor.

  Moaning, Vogel stumbles to a basin, blood dripping down
  onto the white porcelain from his slashed face.

  He suddenly notices Rachel has made it to her knees and is
  trying to crawl towards the door,

  He walks after her, pulls back her head, gets ready to stab
  the scissors into her throat.

                      VOGEL
            You Jews never knew how to kill.
            Only how to die.
      FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   114.


        Then he gives a gasp of pain, eyes closed, his whole body
        doubling with the pain, hands weakly scrabbling at the
        PIECE OF GLASS Rachel has stabbed into his thigh.

        He falls, almost on top of Rachel, and she finds herself
        pressed against his contorted face as he hisses and spits
        in agony.

        His hand searches blindly for the dropped scissors.

        Rachel grapples with him, almost embracing him, apparently
        trying to prevent him for reaching it.

        His searching hand locates the scissors and his eyes open
        in triumph, staring straight into Rachel's. He raises the
        scissors above his head.

        Then he stabs Rachel in the stomach.

        Rachel jack-knifes, as if she's been punched.
        Then...nothing. Both lie still. The only sound is Vogel's
        rasping breathing.

        Slowly Vogel gathers himself, drops the scissors, gets onto
        his knees - the victor.

        He climbs to his feet and begins to limp towards the door.

        PULLING VOGEL

        ...as he walks down the corridor, breathing hard, trying to
        make it back to his room, back to safety.

        Suddenly he staggers against the wall.

        Something's wrong, something in his back. He twists around
        trying to locate the source of the strange sensation. And
        there it is - the HYPODERMIC NEEDLE Rachel has stuck
        between his shoulders.

        He touches it with his fingertips, eyes wide with horror,
        feeling the rush of lethal chemicals through his blood. He
        twists again trying to pull the needle free but his legs
        are already giving way and he collapses to the floor.

        Moments later he's dead.

        MUSIC begins.


244     INT. ROOM 414 - DAY                                          244

        As the music continues we see Yuri putting his coat on.
        He's evidently finished his fruitless interview with
        Schevchuk, who is sitting slumped by the window. Yuri
        turns, about to leave, when he suddenly notices a NOTE upon
        the desk, ADDRESSED TO HIM.

        Surprised, he picks up the note and begins to read it.


        INSERT

        We see the first line - "My name is Rachel Singer."

        The road at the back of the hospital.

        The music continues as we TRACK with Rachel, staring
        steadily ahead, walking slowly down the long road, her coat
        pulled around her.

        In the distance, framed between the arches, her abandoned
        car.

        Blood begins to spot the ground behind her.

        We are in darkness. Then a DOOR opens ahead of us and
        slides to one side revealing an oval of brilliant white
        light.

        Slowly we TRACK FORWARD towards the harsh light.

          resting face up on a black surface. A beat of silence           -- is
          broken by its abrupt RING... RING... RING... Move in tighter
          on the phone's LCD DISPLAY. A number comes up:                  555-3827
          RING... RING... RING... A hand enters frame. We follow it to
          a pad and pen we now discover to the left of the phone. The
          hand picks up the pen, brings it to the pad, on which we find
          a list of handwritten numbers. At least fifty. To this series
          is now added 555-3827. RING... RING... RING...

          EXT. MANHATTAN - LATE NIGHT

          We pan across the city skyline, a beautiful sight -- over
          which we hear the CLACKING of computer keys.

          INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM (RUTHERFORD STERN)                       - LATE NIGHT

          A wall of glass offers a letter-boxed view of a sleek
          conference room. Amber sconces illuminate an enormous table,
          empty save for & YOUNG MAN at the far end - a lonely figure
          hunched over a laptop.
          Steadily tighten on JONATHAN MESSER (late 20s), trim build
          not entirely at ease in a suit. Likeable features suggest a
          gentle, intelligent demeanor.
          Grids of numbers from the laptop screen reflect off his
          glasses. Tired, he rubs his eyes, continues typing.

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN LAW OFFICES - LATE NIGHT

          Briefcase in hand, Jonathan walks a vacant corridor of empty
          cubicles. In a few offices lights are still on; the figures
          of YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN at work are blurred like photos out of
          focus behind the frosted-glass of closed doors.

          INT. TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY STATION - LATE NIGHT

          Waiting for his train, Jonathan pauses at a news kiosk.

          JONATHAN
          Do-you have tomorrow's Times yet?
          The grizzled OLD MAN behind the counter doesn't look up.

          OLD MAN
          It is tomorrow.

          JONATHAN
          Right. I forgot.
          The Old man grudgingly bends to cut the plastic on a fresh
          stack of newspapers. As he does, Jonathan glances at numerous
          porn magazines on display. Naked women smile back at him --

          OLD MAN
          Anything else?

          JONATHAN
          Uh - no. No that's it, thanks.

          EXT. BROOKLYN - LATE NIGHT

          Jonathan descends an above-ground subway stop. Neighborhood
          streets are vacant, the clopping of his shoes the only sound.
          Jonathan turns a corner, heads for a humble duplex, the first
          floor marked by unlit neon: "FLEURS DE SOLANGE." He ascends
          the steps, his keys out --

          WOMAN'S VOICE                                                   (O.S.)
          Jonathan!
          The voice from nowhere startles him - he spins to find
          SOLANGE                                                         (50), a vibrant Haitian woman with a thick accent,
          standing in the doorway below, bundled in a ski jacket.

          JONATHAN
          Solange, you're up so late?

          SOLANGE
          So early, Jonathan. We open in one hour.

          (GRINS)
          So tell me, you have been out with a lady
          friend, oui?

          JONATHAN

          (SMILES)
          Je suis desole, madame, mais no.

          SOLANGE
          But why else does a young man come home at
          such an hour?

          JONATHAN
          Just working late, that's all.

          SOLANGE
          Every night working late, working late.

          later and pick out something for your lady
          friend, oui?

          INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

          Very modest. Furnishings are nice, but sparse. Jonathan hangs
          his suit jacket in a closet of empty hangers.

          INT. JONATHAN'S BEDROOM

          Not much decoration other than a dated Jimmy Connors poster
          and an old tennis trophy. Jonathan lies in bed, flipping
          channels on a small TV. Typical late night stuff:
          infommercials; CNN; a Brazilian soccer match; "Channel J"
          (public access) on which X-rated clips advertise phone sex.
          Jonathan lingers a moment on these explicit ads                  - then clicks
          back to, the roaring soccer crowd. He closes his eyes and
          drifts off to the frenetic Portuguese of an unseen announcer..

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN LAW OFFICES - COFFEE LOUNGE - MORNING

          TWO CORPORATE LAWYERS are talking shop while pouring coffee.

          JONATHAN                                                         (0.S.)
          Excuse me.
          Fixing his coffee, Jonathan reaches past them. They barely
          give him a glance as they continue their conversation.

          LAWYER 1
          So, the Knicks win last night?

          LAWYER 2
          I'm pretty sure, yeah.

          JONATHAN
          Actually, they lost by 4.
          Both pause, turn to Jonathan. Jonathan smiles awkwardly.

          JONATHAN
          It was supposed to be a good game though.

          LAWYER 1
          Oh.
          (back to Lawyer 2)
          Hey, so. did you get a chance to look over
          that memo from Watkins?

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN CORRIDORS - MORNING

          Bustling - yet here too Jonathan is ignored as he carries his
          coffee past ASSISTANTS and LAWYERS talking shop. He smiles

          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          politely at those he passes; few bother to smile in return.

          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING .

          Again Jonathan works alone at one end of the long table,
          rapidly typing, eyes ping-ponging from files to laptop,
          beside him a meticulous arrangement of pastel-colored post-
          its on which are scribbled various calculations. He strikes
          us as extremely good at his job, tackling the overwhelming
          array of numbers and data with methodical assurance.
          Taking a break, he pauses to peer out the glass wall before
          him. Behind the glass, employees pass like fish in a tank.

          INT. MEN'S WASHROOM -- DAY

          In a stall, Jonathan is staring sleepily at patterns in the
          stall's marble door -- when a sudden KNOCK-KNOCK on the
          divider to his right startles him. He peers down and over, to
          expensive black wingtip shoes, a Wall St. Journal spread on
          the floor. Another KNOCK-KNOCK. Confused, Jonathan turns to
          address the divider:

          JONATHAN
          Yes?

          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)
          Take a look at this.
          The voice sounds youthful, energetic. Its owner slides his
          Journal along the floor halfway between the marble division.

          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)
          The Japanese are developing a toilet that
          can analyze your urine for glucose levels,
          kidney disease, even cancer. They're
          referring to it as the "super bowl."

          JONATHAN
          That certainly is                                               - something.

          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Of course if you've ever been to Japan,
          you know they're nuts about their toilets.
          I'm talking web sites, symposiums...
          Jonathan chuckles.

          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)
          You think I'm kidding. They have bowls
          over there that cost more than a piano.
          What I want to know is how you're supposed
          to retrieve this analysis - you know, from
          your super bowl.

          Maybe they're developing a fly with a

          Who's in there anyway?

          JONATHAN
          Uh, Jonathan Messer.

          Messer... What department?

          JONATHAN
          None. I'm from Worth and Berman. I've been
          over here a few wee--
          A FLUSH from the next stall cuts him off. The sound of
          zipping up, of a belt buckled, then of a stall door opening.

          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)
          So you're an accountant?
          Jonathan follows the FOOTSTEPS, now addresses his stall door.

          JONATHAN
          Audit manager, yeah.

          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          So how's it work, Rutherford Stern hires
          Worth and Berman to give their blessing to
          our books, and they send you?

          JONATHAN
          Have laptop, will travel. What about you?

          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          What about me?

          JONATHAN
          Well, I didn't get your name for one.th--
          The SOUND OF A FAUCET RUNNING drowns him out.

          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)
          .ose.

          JONATHAN
          Sorry - I didn't catch that?
          (gets no response)
          Hello...?

          I said it's Wyatt. Wyatt Bose.
          Jonathan FLUSHES, buckles his belt, opens his stall door -
          - only the men's room is now empty.

          COMPUVOICE                                                       (SOUND ADVANCE)

          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Alone again, Jonathan listens to voice-mail on his cell
          phone. We..find two more batteries sitting ready in a charger.

          PETERSON                                                         (O.S.)
          Jonathan? Chet Peterson. Just wanted to-
          confirm you're wrapping up over there at
          Rutherford Stern because the controller at
          Clancey has been on me to get someone in
          there by Thursday. I told him how
          brilliant you are, said you're the best
          auditor we've got. Anyway, I forwarded you
          some documentation...
          Jonathan clicks his mouse - to find 27                           a-mails ending in
          worth&berman.com. He reaches for his palm pilot, clicks on a
          day planner, stylus writes "Clancey" into next week. Other
          than places he'll be working, days-are-all entirely blank.

          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

          Jonathan still working. Only a few of the post-its now remain
          on the tabletop. Yawning, he glances at his watch -

                                                                                               MALE VOICE   (O.S.)

          Startled, Jonathan turns to a well-dressed young man in the'
          doorway - penetrating eyes, playful smile, familiar voice:

          WYATT
          Sorry if I scared you. I was heading home
          and saw the lights. We met before, in the
          can...

          JONATHAN
          Sure. It's Wyatt, right?
          WYATT BOSE nods as he steps into the room. There's something
          very likeably "on" about him.

          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:

          WYATT
          So do you normally work this late?

          JONATHAN
          Pretty much. I'm supposed to be out of
          here by tomorrow so I'm just trying to
          finish up. What about you?

          WYATT
          You kidding? This is an early night. Hard
          to believe that once upona time a man's
          success was measured by how little he had
          to work. You know in Sweden the average
          worker gets 7 weeks a year vacation?
          (regards his stacked files)
          Do-you like accounting?

          JONATHAN
          It's all right, if you enjoy working with
          numbers. Do you like being a lawyer?

          WYATT
          It's all right. If you enjoy working with
          assholes.
          Jonathan laughs, glances at his monitor screen.

          WYATT
          Well, I'm probably disturbing you -

          JONATHAN
          No - it's okay. Really.

          WYATT
          So Worth and Berman, huh? Don't you have
          to like be in Mensa to work there?
          Jonathan smiles, shrugs modestly.

          WYATT
          Been with them long?

          JONATHAN
          Since my senior year of college. They
          subsidized my graduate degree.

          WYATT
          Really. So you were poor?
          Jonathan is given pause by the bluntness of the question.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          S.

          CONTINUED:

          JONATHAN
          Well - I guess you could say that. I was
          raised by a single mother, and she died
          when I was nineteen, so... yeah. It wasn't
          so bad though. I'm sure a lot of people
          have had it worse.

          WYATT
          Not around here. Practically every suit I
          know is Harvard by way of Andover.

          JONATHAN
          Are you?

          WYATT
          Me? Hell no... I'm Princeton. By way of
          Exeter.
          Jonathan laughs. Wyatt smiles, takes a few idle paces.

          WYATT
          So. Jonathan.

          (GRINS)
          What do you say to a break?

          CUT TO:
          CLOSE ON A SCREENSAVER OF SWIMMING FISH. Tilt up from
          Jonathan's laptop screen to Wyatt and Jonathan, sitting on
          top of the expensive conference-table, passinga joint,
          staring out at the rain hammering the far windows.

          JONATHAN

          (STONED)
          .It's just sometimes I feel so - I don't
          know - removed. I mean, I work for one of
          the biggest accounting firms in the world,
          and.there's not so much as a desk there to
          prove it? They've decided all we need are
          cell phones and laptops. Messages are
          voice-mailed, documents e-mailed, salary's
          deposited online. Chet Peterson, my senior
          manager? I swear he wouldn't recognize me
          if I was sitting in his chair.
          Jonathan pauses, takes another drag, train of thought drifts:

          JONATHAN
          I don't know... I used to have friends.
          But it's like I've spent so much time
          trying to prove myself, working these
          hours                                                           - you can only do it so long before
          you look up and realize you've lost

          JONATHAN                                                        (CONT'D)
          everyone. Just - fell out of touch. With
          everyone... And I try to meet people at
          work. I do. But it's always the same. To
          the accounting staff I'm a pain because
          for two weeks they have to hold their
          breath and hope I don't pick up on any of
          their screw ups. And to everyone else, I'm
          just a temporary fixture, so why bother?
          The truth is, this is the first meaningful
          conversation I've had in I don't know how
          long. It's like if I disappeared tomorrow,
          I'm not .sure anyone other than Solange
          would even notice - she's my neighbor. I
          live on what must be the only block in
          Brooklyn that still isn't hip.

          (EXHALES)
          I guess I just never counted-on the
          isolation. It's like sometimes I look
          through that glass, and I see life
          literally passing me by.
          Jonathan stares out the glass wall in stoned silence.

          WYATT
          Jonathan?

                                                                          JONATHAN
          Yeah?

                                                                          WYATT
                                                                          By the clock on the wall there? You've
          just talked for                                                 37                                       minutes straight.
          Wyatt looks at Jonathan -- and cracks up. Jonathan hesitates,
          then he too starts to laugh so now they can't stop, their
          laughter filling the expansive room -- until it's drowned by
          the SOUND ADVANCE OF POURING RAIN...

          EXT. MIDTOWN - STREET - LATE NIGHT

          Jonathan hurries in the cold. rain for the Times Square
          subway. He's just about to descend - when across                7th Avenue
          he spots a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN in a camel hair coat,
          clutching a slim briefcase, waiting to cross the street.
          Jonathan gazes at her, almost gasping. She's surrounded by
          pedestrians with umbrellas., she's the only one without one
          and she's DRENCHED. But she seems content to entertain
          herself drawing a pattern in the drops collecting on the
          umbrella in front of her.
          Jonathan watches, intrigued - and then the rumble of the
          subway below reminds him he'd better move.

          

          

          

          

          10.

          INT. TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY STATION - LATE NIGHT

          Jonathan stands in a long line to buy a Metrocard, his
          glasses steamed up. He takes them off to wipe the lenses.
          JONATHAN'S POV: the entire station is a blur, all unfocused,
          muted colors, no object discernible from another -
          - until his glasses return his POV to immediate focus, and he
          sees the same Young Woman in'the camel.hair coat, a pair of
          dollar bills in her hand, entering the station.
          Jonathan can't help but stare again. Despite her business
          attire, there's an almost childlike lightness. to her step.
          Jonathan notices her slim briefcase. Beneath her hand, he can
          make out the first letter of a monogram: "S."
          She checks out the long line for Metrocards, considers
          waiting, then decides life's too short. She continues past,
          headed for the turnstiles.
          Jonathan continues to observe as she raises her briefcase,
          then proceeds to wriggle her slender frame through the narrow
          gap in the turnstile.
          A PANHANDLER on the other side watches her with amusement.
          Glancing up, she catches his eye, and blushes a mischievous
          smile. Once she's through, she drops her money into his
          collection - and slips out of view.
          ANGLE ON JONATHAN, still stuck on line, staring at the space
          she vacated.

          INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM -- SHORT TIME LATER

          Jonathan arrives as an N train pulls away, the platform now
          practically. empty.
          Weary and still a bit stoned, Jonathan peers sleepily into
          the dark expanse of tunnel, yawns -
          And then he sees "S" is waiting on the same platform. Ten
          yards away. He gazes at her. She's unwrapping some GUM. He
          watches as she puts a piece in her mouth.
          The sound of an ARRIVING N TRAIN. "S" heads for it, Jonathan
          follows...
          The train halts. The door before him is the last of its car,
          the door before her the first of the next.
          The doors open.

          CONTINUED:

          II S â¢ II
          (turns to Jonathan)
          Excuse me, is this the train for canal
          Street?
          It takes Jonathan a second just to find his voice. She's even
          more arresting up close.

          JONATHAN
          Uh,.either one is                                               -- I mean the N and the
          R both stop there so, you know, either
          way, I mean, this is the right train. Yes.
          SOS Of
          Thanks.
          "S" enters her car. Jonathan wavers, wants to follow into her
          car but doesn't have the nerve. He enters a different car.

          INT. SUBWAY CAR - LATER

          Jonathan's slumped against a window, annoyed. at himself for
          not getting in her car.
          He can see 'S'. She sits in the other car chewing her gum. He
          studies her, he's absolutely knocked out by her.

          CONDUCTOR (O.S.)
          Next stop Canal Street. Canal is next.
          He sees "S" rising to join the small crowd gathering by a
          door.
          Jonathan stands up - his last chance. Determined, he braces
          himself and rises, grasping his briefcase.
          The screeching of brakes as the train grinds into "CANAL ST.

          STATION."
          A sudden JOLT of the braking train.causes Jonathan to stumble
          slightly and his briefcase BANGS against a seat and SNAPS
          OPEN - contents tumbling out. His cell phone hits the floor.
          Jonathan quickly bends for his phone - when the train lurches
          to a halt, nearly knocking him over, and sliding his cell
          phone a few feet along the grimy floor.
          O.S. we hear the hiss of the doors opening as Jonathan grabs
          for his phone a second before it's stepped on. He hurriedly
          stuffs it in his pocket, shoves his files and papers and
          paraphernalia back into his briefcase and rises to his feet -
          - to find the doors closing, and "S" gone.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          12.

          CONTINUED:
          Devastated, he hurries to a window, searching the platform as
          the train begins to depart... He can just glimpse the back of
          her camel hair coat as his car is sucked back into a tunnel.
          He stands helpless, just shuts his eyes and lowers his head.

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN - COFFEE LOUNGE - MORNING

          Jonathan is pouring coffee when he brightens on hearing Wyatt
          enter, talking animatedly with Lawyers                          1   and 2. Caught up in
          telling his joke, Wyatt doesn't seem to notice Jonathan.
          Only when the lawyers burst out laughing does Wyatt glance
          up. His eyes meet Jonathan's. Jonathan smiles in greeting -
          but Wyatt just nods coolly, returns to his fellow lawyers.
          Jonathan's smile falters. He exits wordlessly.

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN - DAY

          Jonathan hands over files and CD-Roms to a less than sociable

          ASSISTANT CONTROLLER.

          JONATHAN
          I guess that's it. then. Nice meeting you.

          ASSISTANT CONTROLLER
          Uh huh.
          Jonathan turns to go, takes two paces - then turns back.

          JONATHAN
          Listen - could you point me toward Wyatt
          Bose's office?
          The Assistant Controller looks up in mild annoyance.

          JONATHAN
          Wyatt Bose. He's an attorney here.
          She sighs, put upon, then slides out a desk drawer in which a
          laminated page of names and extensions is taped. Jonathan's
          eyes follow her lazy finger down the list --

          A GRUFF VOICE (O.S.)
          Hey, quit looking down her shirt!
          Jonathan instinctively leaps back from her desk, turns to
          find Wyatt grinning at him from down the corridor.

          WYATT
          Leaving, huh? So where to next?

          (CONTINUED)

          JONATHAN
          Clancey Funds on Thursday. Clute Nichols
          after that.
          Wyatt's about to reply - when ANOTHER LAWYER passes him in
          the hall. Wyatt taps the lawyer's shoulder.

          WYATT
          Hey, wait up a sec.
          (smiles back)
          Well, good meeting you, Jonathan.
          ,Wyatt turns and starts to walk off with the other lawyer.
          Jonathan bends for his briefcase -

          WYATT                                                           (O.S.)
          Wait, so you have off tomorrow?
          Jonathan looks up to Wyatt smiling at him from down the hall.

          WYATT
          You don't happen to have .a. decent
          backhand, do you?

          INT. MANHATTAN RACKET CLUB - DAY

          Beneath an enormous bubble dome, Jonathan and Wyatt play
          mixed doubles with two attractive YOUNG WOMEN (early 20's).
          Between points, we observe from Jonathan's side of the net
          Wyatt chatting up his partner. The rapport between Jonathan
          and his partner is markedly less comfortable; he wipes his
          brow, smiles at her, she forces a polite smile in return.

          SAME SCENE - LATER
          A good rally underway. Jonathan fires a backhand. Wyatt
          returns it with an audible grunt. Jonathan snaps the ball
          back to Wyatt's partner - only Wyatt intercepts, nailing it
          back. Jonathan returns it with equal force.
          A grin on Wyatt's face as he savors the battle, blasting back
          each ball. The women step aside. Jonathan lunges, barely
          managing to lob a return. Sensing victory, Wyatt raises his
          racket and with a guttural bark mercilessly smashes the ball.
          Jonathan dives, racket over-extended - and returns a
          near perfect shot just over Wyatt's head... but it lands two
          inches outside the opposite baseline.

          WYATT
          Out!

          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          Jonathan curls forward, gasping for air. Silence - then
          Wyatt's SOLITARY APPLAUSE echoes in the humid space.

          WYATT
          Commiserations, Messer. Good game.
          They shake hands at the net. Jonathan is exhausted.

          WYATT

          (WARMLY)
          Develop akiller instinct and you'll beat
          the crap out of me.
          Jonathan turns to commiserate with his partner - but she's
          already gone to join her friend. Jonathan crashes out on the
          court. From his low angle he watches as Wyatt goes over to
          the girls and says something that causes a burst of laughter.
          The girls finally wave goodbye. Wyatt hops over the net.

          WYATT
          They asked if we'd fancy a post-game
          cocktail. Don't worry, I got us out of it.
          Jonathan is barely able to speak.

          JONATHAN
          Oh? I would've been happy to.

          WYATT
          Are you kidding? They're a couple of first
          years at Merrill. Screw that, we can do
          better. Hey, you OK?
          Jonathan nods as an amused Wyatt helps him to his feet.

          INT. RACKET CLUB LOUNGE

          Soft jazz plays as Wyatt leads Jonathan past the bar area.
          Wyatt is admiring Jonathan's weathered tennis racket.

          WYATT
          Man, I remember when these first came out.
          I think I was a frosh at boarding school.
          (chuckles; fingers a string)
          Jeez, are these strings natural gut?

          JONATHAN
          Actually, it's a hybrid weave: natural gut
          and Kevlar. They're pretty obscure now. I
          should replace them, they're all frayed...

          15.

          CONTINUED:
          Looking up, Jonathan abruptly slows his pace, his eyes
          suddenly fixed on a woman sitting at the far end of the bar.
          From behind, it looks remarkably like "S"...
          Only, as she turns, her profile proves otherwise.

          INT. LOCKER ROOK!

          Wyatt and Jonathan in towels, heading for the showers.
          Jonathan still deep in the 'S' moment -

          WYATT
          Have you ever considered contacts?
          Jonathan halts, confused to find Wyatt studying his face       -
          his eyeglasses in particular.

          JONATHAN
          Huh? Oh - yeah, I tried once, but I was
          allergic to something in the solution.

          WYATT
          Too bad. You have an attractive face. Your
          eyes especially.
          Jonathan looks self-conscious in his towel.

          WYATT
          It's not a come on, just an observation.
          (considers him a beat)
          You don't get much, do you.

          JONATHAN
          What - you mean sex?

          WYATT
          No, flood insurance. How many women have
          you slept with?

          JONATHAN
          Oh, I don't know, not a whole-

          WYATT
          Of course you know. Everyone knows.

          JONATHAN
          Maybe - four.

          WYATT
          Maybe four?

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          16

          CONTINUED:

          JONATHAN
          Okay fine, just four. What about you?

          WYATT
          Me? I have no idea.

          JONATHAN
          What? You just said everyone -

          WYATT
          I meant everyone like you.
          Confused, Jonathan looks up -- as Wyatt disappears into a
          shower stall.

          SAME - MOMENTS LATER
          Jonathan emerges freshly showered, a towel around his waist
          as he walks toward the rows of lockers.

          WYATT                                                          (O.S.)
          Tonight?... Fine. I'm on the list?
          Jonathan finds Wyatt half-dressed, seated on a bench by a
          locker and talking on his cell phone.

          WYATT
          There better be.
          Wyatt hangs up, looks up to find Jonathan staring, puzzled.

          WYATT
          Something wrong?
          Jonathan reaches into his locker for his hanging jacket, and
          pulls out his own cell phone. It's identical to Wyatt's.

          JONATHAN
          We have the same phone.

          WYATT
          Oh - and you thought I was using yours?
          I can afford my own phone calls, you know.

          JONATHAN
          No, I wasn't                                                   -- of course you can-

          WYATT
          I'm pulling your dick, Jonathan.
          (grins, slams his locker)
          Actually, I was just firming up some plans
          for tonight. Are you free?

          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:

          JONATHAN

          (SURPRISED)
          Me? Sure, I guess                                               - but I don't want to

          INTRUDE-

          WYATT
          You're not. What do you say, are you in?

          JONATHAN
          I guess I could go home and change.

          WYATT
          To Brooklyn? Forget it, you can borrow
          something of mine.

          INT. WYATT'S BUILDING - EARLY EVENING

          A three-story brownstone in an expensive West Village
          neighborhood. As Wyatt leads Jonathan to the staircase, they
          pass a papery-faced GENTLEMAN                                   (50s) in a fine suit.

          WYATT
          t                                                               a                       uten Abend, Herr Kleiner.
          (glances back)
          This way, Jonathan.

          INT. WYATT'S APARTMENT

          Urban chic to a serious degree. Big terrace, funky furniture,
          framed snapshots of Wyatt with similarly hip and attractive
          young friends - and great art, including an entrancing image
          of a burning candle just slightly out of focus.

          WYATT
          Like it? It's a Gerhard Richter. Kleiner
          downstairs is a hot shot art dealer - he
          hooked me up with the gallery in Munich.
          Wyatt disappears into the next room. Alone, Jonathan wanders,
          pauses by the framed snapshots. The young people in them are
          like Wyatt -- beautiful, strong, wealthy. Jonathan pauses by
          one photo in which Wyatt looks a bit younger, his hair
          bleached blonde and loosely spiked.

          WYATT (O.S.)
          Talk about a bad look.
          Startled, Jonathan quickly turns to find Wyatt standing right
          behind him,. a slick, expensive SUIT draped over his arm.

          CONTINUED:

          WYATT
          Here, try this one.
          (off Jonathan's hesitation)
          What?

          JONATHAN
          Nothing, I just hope I can pull it off.

          WYATT
          You hope you can pull it off. You know who
          you remind me of? James Getz.

          JONATHAN
          Who?

          WYATT
          A guy I roomed with freshman year at
          Princeton.. Real smart                                 - witty too, when
          you loosened him up. Only from day one, he
          just didn't fit in. For starters, he was
          dirt poor. But it wasn't that. See, there
          was always this boundary - this wall -
          between Getz and everyone else. You could
          argue we laid the foundation, but he built
          it. Built it by believing the lie.

          JONATHAN
          What lie?

          WYATT
          That he was any different. The clothes,
          the money, the wry anecdotes - it's all
          one big masquerade. Anyone can get in,
          you've just got to wear a costume. But
          Getz never got that. He assumed he could
          never scale the wall, when the truth is he
          was the only one guarding it. It never
          occurred to him his anonymity could be an
          asset. No one gets over like the guy who's
          just a face, an impression. We are - all
          of us                                                  - only who we're perceived to be.

          JONATHAN
          So what happened to him?

          WYATT
          Who, James Getz? Oh - he killed himself.

          JONATHAN
          (hesitates a beat)
          You're pulling my dick, aren't you.
          Wyatt turns to him with a grave look... then smirks.

          CONTINUED:

          WYATT
          With both hands.
          Jonathan can't help but laugh as Wyatt hands him the suit.

          CUT TO:
          CLOSE ON A BUFF YOUNG MAN                                       (EMCEE) in a vintage bowler hat.
          He struts up to us, thumbs in his suspenders:

          EMCEE
          And now, straight from the Cafe Germaine,
          the Velvet Rope is proud to introduce you
          to the lovely Miss Lu Lu Lamour!

          INT. THE VELVET ROPE - NIGHT

          An ultra-elite "new burlesque" nightclub in Manhattan,          1920s
          Parisian decor. Strictly UPSCALE PATRONS, male and female,
          sip from crystal barware, while on stage a BETTY PAGE TYPE
          performs an elegantly choreographed strip tease.
          Wyatt and Jonathan sit at a small table; each table is fitted
          with. an old-fashioned black rotary telephone, as well as a
          small monitor recessed into the tabletop on which old stag
          films play silently. All part of the wink-wink ambience.

          WYATT
          It's a little self-conscious, but I
          thought you'd get a kick out of it. How's
          that suit working out?

          JONATHAN
          Oh - great, actually.

          WYATT
          Keep it then. I've got two just like it.
          Jonathan's about to protest, when a WAITRESS arrives.

          WAITRESS
          Two Macallan 25 year. Enjoy, gentlemen.

          JONATHAN
          Isn't this like fifty bucks a glass?

          WYATT
          We'll try not to spill any.
          (regards the floor show)
          So what's the wildest thing you've ever
          done? Sexually, I mean.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          20.

          CONTINUED:

          JONATHAN
          The wildest thing? Oh I don't know, I've
          never been too adventuresome.

          WYATT
          All right, what's the lamest thing then?

          JONATHAN
          The lamest...
          Wyatt's focused on him, amused, eager to hear it.

          JONATHAN
          Actually, that was probably a few months
          ago. I was flipping through money magazine
          and saw this small ad in the back. It read
          something like "Are. you feeling all alone?
          Looking to meet women but have forgotten
          how?" And-there was this number.

          WYATT
          And you called it? So what happened?

          JONATHAN
          Nothing actually. The phone just kept
          ringing. And that's it.
          Wyatt stares at Jonathan a beat, then starts to crack up.

          JONATHAN
          Lame enough for you?

          WYATT
          You called a sex ad - from Money Magazine.
          That is beyond lame.
          Jonathan too starts laughing - when the phone at their table
          lights'up. Wyatt looks to Jonathan, raises a brow - then
          picks up. He listens a moment, smiles, hands it to Jonathan.

          JONATHAN
          .Hello?
          Wyatt taps his shoulder, directs his gaze to a SEXY BRUNETTE
          at a distant table, receiver to her ear, eyeing Jonathan.

          JONATHAN
          .All right... Goodbye.
          Jonathan hangs up, turns to Wyatt.

          JONATHAN
          She wants to dance.

          

          

          

          

          21.

          ON THE DANCE FLOOR - LATER
          Jonathan is slow dancing with the sexy Brunette to an old
          Edith Piaf ballad. He looks over her shoulder to his table,
          where Wyatt is sitting, talking on his cell phone.
          Glancing up, Wyatt's eyes meet Jonathan's; he flashes a proud
          smile. Jonathan continues dancing, truly enjoying himself.
          The Brunette leans in, whispers something in his ear...

          BACK TO WYATT AND JONATHAN'S TABLE
          Wyatt clicks off his cell phone, looks up to find Jonathan
          returning alone, looking deflated.

          JONATHAN
          She's a hooker.
          Wyatt shrugs, grinning.

          JONATHAN
          Hold on - you knew? What - are all the
          women here prostitutes?

          WYATT
          That depends on what you mean by that
          word. Stretch the definition and you could
          incorporate most of the men as well.
          (sips his drink)
          You know in Amsterdam prostitutes not only
          belong to a union, they have to pay taxes.

          JONATHAN
          You seem to possess quite a store of
          international trivia.

          WYATT
          Not really. I just get around... Jonathan,
          relax. It's not like she just shot your
          dog. I was only trying to help. Besides,
          what are you looking for - a relationship?
          As if you have time for one? This was your
          first day off in how long?

          JONATHAN
          Three weeks.

          WYATT
          Four for me. Face it, we've mortgaged our
          youth. Pimped out our twenties. But we
          still have needs. And there's nothing
          shameful about wanting them met.

          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:

          JONATHAN
          So you sleep with hookers?

          WYATT

          (LAUGHING)
          Me? Never.

          JONATHAN
          So how do you - meet your needs?
          Wyatt studies him a beat, another French love song drifting
          in the background as the Emcee introduces a new girl.

          WYATT
          What if I told you...
          (breaks off, laughs)
          Christ, I sound like an infommercial.

          JONATHAN
          What were you going to say?

          WYATT
          Listen. You don't think that women have
          these same urges? Young women, just like
          ourselves, successful and working their
          asses off to stay that way? You better
          believe they do.

          JONATHAN
          And?

          WYATT
          And - well - let's just say, there's a
          way...a way it can be taken care of.

          JONATHAN
          You make it sound like a mob hit.
          Wyatt smiles, and turns his attention back to the floor show.

          INT. TAXI CAB - LATE NIGHT

          Wyatt and Jonathan are in the back seat. A quiet beat.

          JONATHAN
          What you were talking about, before.
          Peoples' needs...
          Wyatt turns to Jonathan with a grin:

          WYATT
          Some other time.

          At the corner, please. The Rhiga Royal.
          (to Jonathan)
          Listen, I have to meet someone..

          JONATHAN

          (SURPRISED)
          Oh... okay.
          The cab pulls up before the RHIGA ROYAL HOTEL.

          WYATT
          Hey. You had a good time tonight?

          JONATHAN
          Yeah. Yeah I did. Thanks.

          WYATT
          I'm glad. Listen, that thing with the
          hooker, I'm really sorry if I                                   -

          JONATHAN
          Forget it. It was funny.
          Wyatt smiles warmly, pats Jonathan's shoulder.

          WYATT
          I'll give you a call tomorrow.
          Wyatt                                                           climbs out. Jonathan watches through the cab window as
          Wyatt disappears into the golden glow of the lobby.
          LATER: Driving in the cab, Jonathan catches his reflection in
          the glass. He smiles, liking how he looks in Wyatt's suit.
          Outside, rainy Manhattan passes by ina hypnotic blur.

          JONATHAN
          (To driver)
          Hey. Could you let me out at the next
          corner over there, on 7th Avenue?

          EXT. TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY - LATER

          Jonathan stands in the exact spot where he first saw "S".
          He buys a New York Times and a hot-dog.
          Pedestrians and theatre crowds pass by as he remains rooted
          to the spot,.hoping he'll see that face in the crowd.
          After a while he shakes his head at the ridiculousness of it
          and heads down into the-subway.

          INT. CLANCEY INVESTMENTS - A CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING

          Clancey's stiff CONTROLLER                                      (50s) hovers nervously over
          Jonathan as he unloads files onto the huge conference table.

          CONTINUED:
          Beside him we see he's set up his laptop, phone charger,
          pencils and a fresh, unopened pack of pastel post-its.

          CLANCEY CONTROLLER
          Any problems, you'll want to see Julie
          Levinson, she's our assistant controller                       -
          or if she's busy, Scott Werner, our senior
          accountant. If Werner's unavailable, we
          have two staff accountants                                     - but like I
          said, I don't anticipate any problems. I
          mean we've never had any before, so...

          JONATHAN
          Right.I just need the access codes for
          the accounts and sub-accounts?
          The Controller suddenly looks uneasy.

          JONATHAN
          You've got account numbers, but no access
          codes. Without those I can't get the banks
          to authorize statement verification.
          (beat; smiles)
          Besides, how else can I steal the money?

          CLANCEY CONTROLLER
          What?

          JONATHAN
          Nothing, I was just pulling your-- leg. I
          do need those codes though, when you get a
          chance.

          INT. CLANCEY CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Other than Jonathan's suit and tie, the reduced number of
          post-its and the lighter stack of files                        - little has changed.
          Jonathan is hunched over his laptop. Like Rutherford Stern's
          conference room, this one too is designed with a glass wall.
          Jonathan peers out at workers passing in utter indifference
          to him. Slightly different tank, slightly different fish.
          CLOSE ON A BUSINESS CARD: a Rutherford Stern masthead,
          beneath it Wyatt's name and office number. Jonathan picks up
          his cell phone and dials it. RING... RING -

          WYATT (O.S.)
          Hey, Jonathan.

          JONATHAN
          How'd you know it was-

          WYATT (O.S.)
          You really ought to block your caller ID.
          So - same place as yesterday?

          EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER - DAY

          Along the entire square of ledge, throngs of SUITED BUSINESS
          TYPES bundled in scarves eating street vendor fare. It's here
          we find Wyatt and Jonathan, having a quick bite.

          WYATT
          I wonder what the Founding Fathers would
          make of this scene.
          Wyatt regards face after face of young men and women wearing
          expensive suits, wolfing down lunch so they can get back to
          work - a good 2/3 of them talking on cell phones as they eat.

          JONATHAN
          I'm just glad to be outside.
          (awkwardly heartfelt)
          I've got to tell you, this has been great,
          meeting up for lunch. I used to just-
          A cell phone RINGS. They both instinctively reach in their
          jackets, take out their identical phones. It's Wyatt's that's
          ringing. Jonathan rests his down on the ledge.

          WYATT
          Yes?... Shit. Okay, see if you can.gettme
          on the 6:15                                                     out of JFK tonight... Fine.
          Wyatt rests his phone on the ledge next to Jonathan's.

          WYATT
          Rutherford needs me to join him asap in
          London to paper some financing with
          Lloyds. I tell you about this?

          JONATHAN
          No - no you didn't.

          WYATT
          Yeah, I should be gone a few weeks.
          Jonathan tries to mask the wave of loneliness setting in.

          JONATHAN
          Sounds exciting.

          WYATT
          Nah, it'll be boring as sin.

          Wyatt studies him a moment, grabs his cell phone and rises
          from the ledge.

          WYATT
          Shit, I'd better get back. You ready?

          INT. CLANCEY INVESTMENTS - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

          Sitting before his laptop, Jonathan takes out his cell phone
          and punches in some numbers.

          COMPUVOICE                                                     (O.S.)

          I'RN-SORRY-THE-VOICE-MAIL-PASSWORD-YOU-

          ENTERED-IS-NOT-VALID-PLEASE-TRY-YOUR-
          He enters the numbers again, receives the same prerecorded
          message. He hangs up -- when it abruptly RINGS, surprising
          him. He stares at the phone a curious beat, then answers it.

          JONATHAN
          Jonathan Mess-
          CLICK. Dead air. More puzzled, Jonathan frowns a beat          - then
          replaces the battery with one fresh off the charger.

          INT. CLANCEY BUILDING - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

          As ignored as ever, Jonathan is squeezed among EMPLOYEES on
          their way home. TWO SECRETARIES speak in hushed tones:

          SECRETARY 1
          .That's just it. You caught him in a
          lie, so now everything he says you have to-
          RING of a cell phone. RING... RING... It's Jonathan's.
          Surprised, he takes out the phone, presses talk.

          JONATHAN
          Hello?
          A soft, electronic rustle from the other end... then:

          WOMAN'S VOICE                                                  (O.S.)
          Are you free tonight?

          JONATHAN
          Excuse me?

          I asked if you're free tonight.

          Jonathan trudging home. He descends into the subway.

          INT. SUBWAY STATION

          Jonathan is heading for the DOWNTOWN N/R when:. RING...
          RING... His cell phone again. He steps aside and answers:

          JONATHAN
          Hello?
          The CRACKLE OF STATIC on the other end. Then:

          WOMAN'S VOICE                                                   (O.S.)
          Are you free tonight?

          JONATHAN
          Actually I am, but I don't think I'm who
          The static on the other end worsens.

          WOMAN'S VOICE                                                   (O.S.)
          I'm sorry, I didn't get that?

          JONATHAN
          I said I am free, but I                                         -

          Could you be at the Plaza in one hour?

          JONATHAN
          The hotel? I - I guess, but -

          Beneath the Eloise portrait.
          THE ROAR OF A TRAIN pulling in. Only when the train passes
          can he hear the other end. But now there's no one there.
          Jonathan stares at his cell phone - and frowns.
          Close on the phone's display as Jonathan scrolls down its
          list of stored numbers. His expression says none are
          familiar. And NOW he gets it.

          INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT

          A heavy-set CABBIE glances in his mirror at Jonathan in back,
          cell phone to his ear.

          (into phone)
          Hi, it's Jonathan, I've got your cell! I
          guess you must have mine. I imagine you're
          in the air now, but call when you get
          this. if you do. Oh, and you got a call
          from someone who I'm...forget it, just
          call me.
          Jonathan hangs up.

          CABBIE
          So where ya visiting from?

          JONATHAN
          Excuse me?

          CABBIE
          You're from out of town, right?

          JONATHAN

          (PUZZLED)
          Me? No.

          CABBIE
          Huh. I can usually tell. You seem like a
          tourist.

          JONATHAN
          I've lived here all my life!

          CABBIE
          No offence, pal.
          The cabbie pulls over on Central Park South. Jonathan leans
          forward, peers up at the gorgeous French Renaissance facade.

          CABBIE
          Well, here ya are. The Plaza.

          INT. PLAZA HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT

          Sheer elegance. Wealthy GUESTS stroll, chat, lounge. Hotel
          STAFF in immaculate uniforms greet, assist, etc..
          Jonathan anxiously wanders the perimeter, then slows as he
          spies a PORTRAIT OF A PRECOCIOUS LITTLE GIRL grinning at him.

          SAME SCENE - SHORT TIME LATER
          Jonathan is standing awkwardly beneath the Eloise portrait,
          glancing at his watch, growing restless, unsure --

          Pardon me, but may I ask you something -
          personal?
          Jonathan quickly looks.up, to find standing before him an
          attractive BLONDE WOMAN. She's. around his age, slender to the
          point of stark, dressed in a chic grey business suit.

          THE BLONDE
          Are you waiting for me?

          JONATHAN
          I                                                                - think so, yes. You're here for Wyatt,
          right?

          THE BLONDE
          Excuse me?
          (hesitates, appraising him)
          I'm sorry, did we speak earlier?

          JONATHAN
          Yes. Yes we did -

          THE BLONDE
          Good. Let's go then.

          INT. PLAZA - ELEVATOR

          Jonathan and the Blonde stand in an elevator alongside an
          ELDERLY COUPLE. The couple smile at the handsome pair.
          Jonathan fidgets uncomfortably. The Woman is staring at the
          lit numbers. He notices a ROOM KEY in her hand.

          JONATHAN
          (whispers aside)
          Look, I don't think I'm -- I mean; you and
          I., we don't know each other...?
          She turns to him, the slightest smile on her thin lips.

          THE BLONDE
          No fooling.
          DING. The doors open. She steps out. A beat. He follows.

          THE HALLWAY
          Walls, carpeting - details all classically gorgeous. The
          Blonde keeps a quick pace, headed toward a room.

          JONATHAN
          What I mean to say is, I'm fairly certain
          there's been some kind of mistake.

          She stops dead in her tracks, her back to him.

          THE BLONDE
          You're not who I spoke with on the phone?

          JONATHAN
          No - I mean, yes, but -

          THE BLONDE
          You're not attracted to me?

          JONATHAN
          Oh no, it's not that at all, it's just                          -

          THE BLONDE
          It's just what... exactly?
          She turns, steps toward him. Jonathan opens his mouth to
          explain -- when she covers it with hers. It takes him a
          moment to succumb to her kiss... but not too long.

          INT. PLAZA -- A ROOM - LATER

          A smooth plane of pressed sheets creases as two bare bodies
          lower to them. The Blonde hovering over him, Jonathan's
          tentativeness is all but gone.
          Jonathan cradles her to him, her features softening under
          waves of pleasure as she gasps, and whispers in soft, slow
          annunciation as if it were the sweetest word in our language:

          THE BLONDE
          Fuck.
          LATER: Jonathan lies post-coital. A smile. And then a look of
          mild anxiety, 'what's going on'? He turns to the Blonde but
          she's fast asleep.

          INT. PLAZA - THE', ROOM - EARLY MORNING

          On the sound of a DOOR SHUTTING, Jonathan's eyes squint open.
          Still naked, he props himself up, leans over to find he's all
          alone. A clock radio reveals itself as the source of the
          FAINT CLASSICAL MUSIC we hear. The time reads:                  6:18   am.
          He rises, glances around the room. No sign of her.

          INT. PLAZA - RECEPTION DESK - MORNING

          Showered and dressed, Jonathan is talking with a DESK CLERK.

          Well could you tell me the name of the
          guest who was staying there?

          DESK CLERK
          I'm afraid we're not allowed to disclose
          information regarding our guests. If you
          give me her name, I can confirm if she was
          registered here.

          Actually, the thing is... it's okay.
          Forget it.

          EXT. CENTRAL PARK SOUTH - MORNING

          Jonathan exits to good tidings from the BELL STAFF. Lost in
          his thoughts, it takes him a moment to respond.
          He starts to walk. His cell RINGS. He answers.

          JONATHAN
          Hello?

          WYATT'S VOICE
          Hey, you're up early!

          JONATHAN
          Hi! How's London?

          Raining. So you've got mine-and I've.got
          yours?

          JONATHAN
          Yeah. Listen, last night...um...I met this-

          WYATT'S VOICE
          Damn! Sorry, I'm gonna have to call you
          back, they want me in a meeting. Hey, no
          long distance calls, okay!
          Wyatt hangs up. Jonathan shakes his head, amused. He hails a
          cab, glances back at the hotel. His lips curl into a vaguely
          proud, if still dazed, smile.

          distracted. He pauses, eyes Wyatt's cell phone sitting there.

          INSERT - EXTREME CLOSE ON THE CELL PHONE'S DISPLAY WINDOW
          The numbers stored have no names associated with them. It's
          just a series of undesignated seven-digit sequences, a list
          of phone numbers that seems to go on and on.
          Jonathan clicks on a number at random. It highlights itself.
          Jonathan hesitates, then clicks again. The number is dialled.
          RING...RING - a woman with an elegant BRITISH ACCENT answers:

          if you'll excuse me                                             -

          JONATHAN
          wait -
          Jonathan fumbles for what else to say before she hangs up.

          BRITISH ACCENT                                                  (V.O.)
          Yes?
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN. What to say? And then:

          JONATHAN
          (braces himself, swallows)
          Are you free tonight?
          He shuts his eyes, ready for a hang up. A long silence.

          BRITISH ACCENT (V.0.)
          I can be.
          Jonathan opens his eyes half in disbelief.

          Where?

          JONATHAN
          Where. Right... The Plaza?

          BRITISH ACCENT (V.0.)
          I'm afraid that's a bit uptown for me.
          Perhaps the Mercer? Say by the
          Shakespeare, half past eleven?

          JONATHAN
          The Shakespeare?

          BRITISH ACCENT                                                 (V.0.)
          It should be fairly evident.

          INT. THE MERCER HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT

          The SoHo industrial motif is the antithesis of the Plaza. By
          a vintage book library we find a sleekly dressed YOUNG BLACK
          WOMAN perusing spines of Salinger, Scott, Sheherazade -

          JONATHAN                                                       (O.S.)
          Excuse me, um - I'm sorry to disturb you -
          She turns, regards him a moment, curiously - a copy of
          Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" in her hand.

          JONATHAN
          I'm - supposed to meet someone here and-

          BRITISH ACCENT
          You're rather new to this, aren't you?
          Jonathan falters. She smiles.

          BRITISH ACCENT
          That's okay. I like that.

          LOBBY ELEVATOR
          She enters first, then Jonathan. He waits for her.to push a
          button - only it seems she's waiting for him to do the same.

          JONATHAN
          I'm sorry, what floor?
          She rolls her eyes.

          BACK TO THE HOTEL LOBBY
          Jonathan and British Accent cross the lobby once more.

          BRITISH ACCENT
          Frankly I'm surprised that whoever gave
          you access didn't explain more.

          (SIGHS)
          Right then, the rules: One,.no names, no
          jobs                                                           - no nothing. Two, latex is mandatory
                                                                         and non-negotiable.. Three, no rough stuff   -
          the only rule that's even remotely
          malleable provided there's mutual consent,
          although I say if that's your thing, take
          it elsewhere. And finally...
          She halts a few feet from the registration desk.

          BRITISH ACCENT
          The initiator is responsible for the room.

          JONATHAN
          (takes him a second)
          Oh - so I should...?

          BRITISH ACCENT
          Precisely.

          BACK IN THE ELEVATOR
          Jonathan is holding a key card. British Accent is leaning
          against the opposite wall, eyeing him with a slight grin. A
          moment. DING. The elevator doors open.

          INT. MERCER HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          They are headed for a room as he ventures another question:

          JONATHAN
          So are there a lot of - people - who do
          this?
          She turns to him with a look of growing impatience -- when
          the CREAK OF A CART causes them to glance up: a ROOM SERVICE
          WAITER is crossing past the far end of the hall. Jonathan
          turns back to find her staring at him uneasily.

          BRITISH ACCENT
          How did you get into this?

          JONATHAN
          Well, a friend of mine -

          BRITISH ACCENT
          He uploaded your numbers but failed to
          explain the basics?

          (off her frown)
          I'm doing something wrong, aren't I?

          BRITISH ACCENT
          It's not that, it's just... well, you
          strike me as something of a stowaway. In
          fact if I were more suspicious, I'd say
          you didn't belong here at all.
          Flustered, Jonathan's about to offer some explanation ---

          BRITISH ACCENT
          But obviously somebody felt you did.
          The notion suddenly registers with Jonathan -- Wyatt!

          BRITISH ACCENT
          And I'm a sucker for bashful boys...
          She takes his wrist, traces a finger over his palm... and
          removes the key card from his hand.

          INT. MERCER HOTEL - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Jonathan and British Accent having sex. She has his arms
          pinned back, writhing on top of him, clearly enjoying the
          control - Jonathan remains awed, just enjoying the ride.

          INT. MERCER HOTEL - BEDROOM- LATE NIGHT

          Jonathan lies in bed-beside British Accent.

          JONATHAN
          Can I ask you something? Why do you do
          this?

          BRITISH ACCENT
          Why are any of us doing this? For the
          economics of the arrangement.
          (rolls over, away from him)
          It's intimacy without intricacy.
          Jonathan's about to reply --

          BRITISH ACCENT
          Look, I've got a 7                                            a.m. breakfast, so...
          She says no more. Jonathan stares up at the ceiling a beat.

          Well - good night.

          Jonathan.alone at his laptop, the stack of files down to a
          bare few. He dials a number on 'his' cell:

          JONATHAN
          (into phone)
          Hey, I never heard back from you. I guess
          you're busy.with stuff over there.
          (smiles to himself)
          I've been kinda busy too! I've been
          wondering - did you mean for me to take
          your phone?

          EXT. RHIGA ROYAL HOTEL - NIGHT

          Jonathan walks the carpet-draped sidewalk toward the entrance
          - then pauses, looks around in recognition of this same spot
          where Wyatt had gotten out of the cab that night.

          JONATHAN (V.0.)
          I've got a feeling you did. You dog! I can
          see you grinning right now.
          Jonathan returns the BELL STAFF's chipper greetings and steps
          inside --

          JONATHAN                                                        (V.0.)
          Anyway, I just wanted to say... thank you.
          SOUNDTRACK MUSIC SWELLING: to herald a MONTAGE:

          INT. THE BENJAMIN - LOBBY - NIGHT

          Jonathan seems somewhat more relaxed as he lingers in the
          lobby. A woman with a BOYISH HAIRCUT taps his shoulder.

          INT. THE REGENCY - A ROOM - NIGHT

          Jonathan and an ASIAN WOMAN having sex on a plush celadon
          carpet, two briefcases resting side by side a few feet away.

          INT. CLANCEY INVESTMENT SERVICES - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Alone as usual, Jonathan now seems strangely contented in
          this isolated state. WORKERS pass in the wall of glass, but
          now he doesn't bother looking up.
          In his briefcase, we note the inclusion of a toiletries bag.

          At a registration desk, Jonathan hands his credit card to a
          DESK CLERK. A BELLHOP gestures to a luggage cart. Jonathan
          shakes his head, looking confidently past him to a TALL WOMAN
          seated inconspicuously among the various out-of-towners.

          INT. THE DRAKE - ROOM - MORNING

          Jonathan wakes up alone, his necktie knotted around a
          bedpost. He reaches for the phone, presses "Room Service."

          INT. WEISS MURPHY INSURANCE - COPY ROOM - DAY

          Jonathan is waiting to make some copies when the SECRETARY at
          the copier hands him a stack of paper...

          WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Can you hold these?

          INT. THE MARK - ROOM -- LATE NIGHT

          .only the voice belongs to the woman Jonathan is having sex
          with - referring to her legs that she wraps around him.

          INT. THE FITZPATRICK - SUNDRY SHOP                              - MORNING

          Jonathan buys a bottle of O.J. and a 36-count box of condoms.

          INT. WEISS MURPHY INSURANCE - CORRIDOR DAY

          Carrying his coffee mug, Jonathan suddenly slows, his eyes
          locked on The Blonde with whom he'd first been at the Plaza.
          Her eyes fix on his as he.nears                                 - a flash of mutual
          recognition... then nothing as they pass without a word.
          Jonathan can't help but allow himself the slightest grin.

          INT. HOTEL ELYSEE - THE "CLUB ROOM"                             - NIGHT

          Jonathan wades confidently through a sea of YOUNG EXECUTIVES.
          He approaches a REDHEADED BUSINESSWOMAN. He asks her
          something. She looks up, confused ---
          -- when ANOTHER REDHEAD taps his shoulder. Her free hand
          slips into his,. their fingers interlocking...

          INT. THE PARAMOUNT - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          . PULL BACK from interlocked fingers to find Jonathan's

          to Jonathan and YET ANOTHER WOMAN having sex. The bed
          keeps banging against the night stand - a glass of water,
          moving closer to the edge with every bang. There's something
          almost rote about it, a numbness in the repetition... the
          glass FALLS, HITS the ground and BREAKS.
          MATCH CUT TO: Jonathan PLUNGES into water.

          INT. THE PENINSULA - HEALTH CLUB - MORNING

          Jonathan doing laps. He emerges from the pool, strides with
          confidence past the tourists flanking him on either side:
          OLDER COUPLES snoozing, PARENTS adjusting floaties on kids,
          BUSINESS TRAVELLERS with airport novels.
          He continues toward us, hair slicked back, like Wyatt's.

          MONTAGE ENDS/ CUT TO :

          EXT. BROOKLYN - JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Jonathan arrives at his building's steps to find Solange
          hurrying out of her flower shop. She embraces him warmly.

          SOLANGE
          Jonathan, for so long I don't see you!

          JONATHAN
          J'ai ete tres occupe. with work.
          He's exhausted. And no longer so exhilarated by his nightly
          activities.

          SOLANGE
          Work? No, no. You believe you can trick
          me, Mr. Mischief Maker! I want to meet
          this lady friend of yours.
          Jonathan is about to protest -

          SOLANGE
          Ah., ah                                                        - ecoutez, I have beautiful winter-
          roses, just. arrived. She.will swoon...
          Jonathan smiles, but there's a reticence to it.

          JONATHAN
          Maybe later, okay?

          SOLANGE
          There is no later when it comes to love!
          If you find it, you must not let it go.

          Jonathan nods absently, continues up the steps                  - when she
          tugs his sleeve. He turns to her; she searches his eyes.

          SOLANGE
          There really is no one?
          Jonathan evasively shakes his head.

          SOLANGE
          There should be, Jonathan. It is not good
          for a young man to be too much alone.
          He gives her an uncomfortable smile. She smiles back, but as
          she heads inside, she looks both-sad and worried for him.
          Jonathan continues up the steps, opens the front door and
          disappears inside. We remain on the vacant street, hear his
          FOOTSTEPS climbing the steps - and then the muted RING of his
          cell phone. A beat, then another...
          .and the front door opens again as Jonathan steps back out
          into the night.

          INT. THE HUDSON HOTEL - LOBBY -- LATE NIGHT

          Checking his reflection in a mirror while he waits, Jonathan
          faintly hears what sounds like WYATT'S LAUGH. He quickly
          turns to the sound: a bar off the lobby. Through slotted
          glass he scans the backs of heads: a group of business men.
          Reflected in the mirror, a WOMAN appears behind him. Jonathan
          freezes, his eyes grow wide -

          WOMAN
          Excuse me...
                                                                          He doesn't breathe. Utterly stunned, he turns to confirm...
          It's her.                                                       -It's "S".

          INT. THE HUDSON - ELEVATOR

          Jonathan stares at her in sheer disbelief but she's
          oblivious, smiling casually back at him.

          INT. HOTEL ROOM

          "S" enters first, flips on the light, proceeds inside.
          Jonathan enters tentatively behind her, eyes still glued.
          "S" takes off her coat, drapes it over a chair. Jonathan
          remains still and silent, just watching. She undoes the
          wrists of her blouse, then the collar button.

          next button. We can glimpse a bra. She undoes the next --

          JONATHAN
          Before we...um, the thing is                                   - I know you.
          She glances up, curious                                        - her hand lingering by the front
          clasp of her bra.

          JONATHAN
          Not 'know' exactly, but we sort of met
          before. In the Times Square subway
          station. It was raining...

          â S â

          (GRINS)
          In the subway?

          JONATHAN
          You had no umbrella. You were soaked.

          âC,.
          It's true, I don't have an umbrella.

          JONATHAN
          Then you asked me if the N train stops at
          Canal.
          She squints back at him, vaguely recalling him. She smiles
          warmly and continues to unbutton her blouse.

          JONATHAN
          Wait.

          âSÂ»
          Is something the matter?

          JONATHAN
          This just seems strange, that's all.

          SÂ
          Because you've seen me before?

          JONATHAN
          Maybe. I don't know, it's just                                 -

          (EXHALES)
          Ever since that night on the train, I've
          thought about how nice it would be to see
          you again. And now suddenly, here you are,
          taking off your clothes.

          Well, maybe some other time.
          Jonathan is thrown as she reaches for her coat -

          Wait - don't go.
          She glances back curiously.

          JONATHAN
          What I mean is, by any chance... are you
          hungry?

          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - PRE-DAWN

          A BELLMAN rolls a cart noiselessly down the carpet, placing
          early editions of the New York Times before each room.
          He pauses by a door, quietly leaves anewspaper. We can hear
          the sound of JONATHAN AND "S" TALKING AND LAUGHING...

          INT. HOTEL ROOM

          They sit across from each other Indian-style on the bed. The
          radio is tuned to a pop music station. They're finishing a
          meal of burgers and fries, getting along famously.
          You have some ketchup on your chin.

          JONATHAN
          sorry, I'm a messy eater.
          âsâ
          Me too.
          Jonathan rubs at his chin with a napkin, misses. she takes
          the napkin, dabs it in water and cleans him up.

          JONATHAN
          Thanks.

          bites.

          She laughs and flicks it.off.

          By the way, my name's-

          âS,.
          Don't!
          She puts her finger to his lips. A first touch. An
          electricity between them.

          (a playful smile)
          You know the rules. No names.

          JONATHAN
          The 'rules' seem to specify no
          conversation either.
          as.,
          They are a little rigid, aren't they? But
          I think we should obey the 'no names'.
          It'll be fun!

          JONATHAN
          Ah, but I know.yours begins with an 'S'.
          âSir

          Her face is an inch from his, the moment mysterious   and           sexy.

          Hmrn...what do we know of her? She sports a
          camel coat, a briefcase and possesses no
          umbrella. I deduce...her name is 'Sybil'.
          'S' laughs.

          She makes a little sound of encouragement.

          JONATHAN
          Hmmm. Hmmm. The mysterious 'S' alighted
          from the train at Canal Street. She may
          well be from 'downtown'...hmm...ah! Of

          Then so be it.
          Jonathan considers this a moment, and concedes.

          JONATHAN
          Can I ask what you do for a living?
          You first.

          JONATHAN
          I sit behind glass and watch people pass

          'The ball was good,'Mr McEnroe.'

          JONATHAN
          I can see it.
          An 80's new wave love song comes on the radio. She beams,

          "S" stands up on the bed, starts to dance. She reaches her
          hand out to Jonathan. He smiles, shakes his head.

          JONATHAN
          Trust me, it's not a pretty sight.

          "S:,
          I'll be the judge of that.
          He hesitates, then takes her hand, rises to his feet, and
          starts to dance with her. He's self-conscious at first, but
          she's agile enough to guide him, and soon he's into it.

          See? You just need the right partner.
          She closes her eyes, swaying with the music. They dance
          together. He's falling even harder for her.
          As the song ends she holds his gaze -- when a small yawn
          escapes her. She covers her mouth.

          She curls up next to him, rests her head on his arm, closes
          her eyes and drifts off. Jonathan gazes over at her. The
          perfect line of her jaw. The petite divot above her lip. The
          tiny pierced comma in a presently unadorned earlobe.
          And then he notices, in the far corner: her purse. He stares
          at it; her name and personal details less than 20               feet away.
          He hesitates, then tries to silently slide his arm out from
          under her -- when she stirs and nuzzles closer. He looks over

          INT. THE HUDSON - HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

          CLOSE ON JONATHAN'S SLEEPING FACE. His eyes slowly open.
          JONATHAN'S POV: her purse is no longer on the chair.
          He raises his head, sees that she's gone. He stares at her
          pillow. The indentation where she slept. Smiles to himself.
          He gets out of bed and heads for the bathroom. There's a NOTE
          on the desk on hotel note paper:
          Frank - you snore like a tractor. Will
          call u later. Sunbeam xxx
          He stares at the note, beaming - when his cell phone rings.

          A bea- - and then Wyatt's familiar laughter.

          Hey! Are you back in town?

          WYATT (V.0.)
          I wish. It's friggin' anarchy in the U.K..
          I'm stuck here at least another week.

          JONATHAN
          Oh. Because I thought I saw you last night
          - at the Hudson.

          WYATT (V.0.)
          The Hudson, huh? Sounds like you've been
          enjoying my little gift.

          JONATHAN
          Yeah. I mean, I was. Only now - well, I
          met a girl. Not just any girl. The girl.

          WYATT (V.0.)
          That's fantastic! Who is the lucky gal?

          JONATHAN
          She's a member of your naughty little sex

          I'd like to say it's a long story but it's
          not. When you are coming back, you gotta
          meet her.

          WYATT (V.0.)
          So she's, what, a lawyer or something?

          JONATHAN
          I-have no idea, I don't know all that much
          about her. All I know is I can't wait to
          see her again.

          WYATT (V.0.)
          Listen, I don't want to dampen your
          spirits, but - be careful, okay?

          JONATHAN
          What do you mean by that?

          WYATT (V.0.)
          Nothing. I'm just saying, this club                         - who
          knows who anybody is, right?

          JONATHAN
          Yeah, yeah, yeah but - sometimes you just
          have to go with what you feel, don't you?

          WYATT (V.0.)
          True enough. Hold on a sec.
          Muffled sounds of Wyatt talking to someone else.

          WYATT (V.0.)
          It's non stop back-to-back bullshit here.
          Listen, I'll call you later. And hey -
          congratulations!
          Wyatt hangs up. Jonathan smiles. And then reads the note
          again - grinning.

          The morning crush of executives filing toward elevators.
          Among them we spot Jonathan, just slightly out of step, a
          sleepy smile lingering on his face.

          Jonathan is working on his laptop, clearly distracted. He
          looks at his cell phone, hoping it will ring, but it doesn't.
          He calls up the list of "Recent Calls: Incoming," scrolls up
          to the top number. It reads: "Number Unavailable."
          Jonathan looks worried, wondering how he can get a hold of
          her - when his cell phone rings. He immediately picks up.

          EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

          Jonathan arrives at the subway station. He's a little anxious
          now, still hasn't heard from her. He lingers at the top of
          the stairs, not wanting to descend. Below him he can hear the
          lonely roar of a train pulling in below.
          only when the train quiets down does Jonathan realize his
          cell phone is ringing. He picks up.

          JONATHAN
          Hello?
          Intermittent static on the other end. And then what sounds
          like a WOMAN GASPING; it's unclear if it's a sound of
          pleasure or pain.

          JONATHAN
          .Hello?
          The Gasping comes faster; Jonathan debates hanging up - when
          the gasps halt,--replaced by the faintest whisp__of_ a female
          voice: "No... No please..." There's no mistaking the tone now
          it's fear - then. suddenly a shrill, terrified SCREAM...
          - and the line goes dead. Jonathan stares breathlessly at the
          phone in his hand, like he's just witnessed something awful.
          He quickly checks the display: "Number Unavailable."
          Jonathan looks panicked with the possibility that it was "S"-
          - when the phone rings again. He hesitates, then picks up.

          Jonathan exhales in relief on hearing her voice.

          EXT. CHINATOWN - CANAL STREET - NIGHT

          Jonathan stands on a corner, looking out of place amidst the
          glistening neon and bustle of Asian faces. He peers anxiously
          down the.street, checks his watch, all anticipation             -
          - when something is wrapped around his eyes. He's startled,
          tugs it off and spins to find "S" smiling back at him.

          I bought you a present.

          bright colors                                                   - all the more funky against his dark suit.

          "S" seems instantly on edge. Something about this scares her.

          EXT. CHINATOWN -- AN ALLEY -- NIGHT

          A makeshift street market, everything from fish and meat to
          cheap electronics for sale in cramped stands. Jonathan and
          "S" walk arm in arm through the packed crowd, like a couple.
          Jonathan looks like we've never seen him before: a
          fascination with everything around him, especially her.
          They pause at a stall selling cheap trinkets, including a
          small metallic wind-up toy of a duck riding a bicycle.

          Â«S"
          He's so cute! What's his name?

          VENDOR

          (DEADPAN)
          Duck On Bike.
          "S" beams like it's the greatest name ever.

          INT. A RESTAURANT - CHINATOWN - LATE NIGHT

          An intimate place, Jonathan and "S" are the only patrons at
          this late hour. They sit across from each other, grinning at
          "Duck On Bike" as it totters across the table, trips over a
          chopstick and flails on its side.
          /t S â
          Oh, poor Duck On Bike!
          She uprights the toy and it keeps on moving across the table.

          JONATHAN
          You gotta respect him; he just keeps at
          it.
          A WAITER arrives and sets down a laminated menu - entirely in
          Chinese. "S" points to the characters like an expert.
          J! $ Ft
          We'll have this... and this... oh, and
          let's try one of these. Thank you.
          The Waiter nods, walks off.

          JONATHAN

          Jonathan gazes at her a beat.

          This is so...not my life.

          â$â
          Is that a good thing?

          More than you know.

          JONATHAN
          Ever since that night on the subway - I
          haven't stopped thinking about you.
          She lowers.her eyes.

          JONATHAN
          Sorry, I didn't mean to freak you out.
          She slowly looks up again, touched.

          âSâ
          Are you always so honest?

          JONATHAN
          No.

          Even so, I'm not sure I believe you.
          Jonathan's look, 'why not?'

          "S.â
          You're in the sex club! Another anonymous
          guy looking for anonymous action. I'm not

          In between the mindless shtupping?

          JONATHAN
          And sometimes during.
          She laughs. The waiter brings them their drinks.

          JONATHAN
          So how come you got involved in the club?
          She frowns slightly, thinks.

          Wouldn't it be great if you could just
          meet someone and not have to do the 'work/

          Isn't who we are right now so much more
          interesting than where we've come from?

          JONATHAN
          Sure... but that didn't really answer my
          question.
          She reaches over and takes his hand, holds it tenderly.
          â S of
          I know it seems like I'm holding out on
          you, but I'm not. It's just                                  - I turned
          thirty this year, and I made this vow to
          live only in the present. And it's good,
          you know? And yes, maybe it's because
          there are things in my past I don't care
          to think about - but that's the same for
          everyone, isn't it?
          He nods, still holding hands, loving every moment of this.

          I like you. I hope you like me. Can't that
          be enough?
          Jonathan smiles, completely disarmed by her. The waiter
          brings their food and goes.

          JONATHAN
          I wasn't asking for an autobiography, you
          know. I was just curious.

          You mean the intimacy without intricacy.

          It has its merits. At least I thought it
          did... until you came along.
          He beams, gazing at her. Blushing, she starts in on the food.
          Outside we can hear rain starting to fall...

          EXT. CHINATOWN RESTAURANT - LATER

          Jonathan and "S" step out into pouring rain, pause under the
          shabby awning. Waiters inside are putting chairs on tables.
          She fishes in her coat and pulls out a PACK OF GUM. The
          wrapper is entirely in Chinese. She offers him a piece.

          JONATHAN
          Oh - no thanks.

          JIS.11
          Don't let the wrapper intimidate you. I
          buy it at a store nearby. It has ginseng
          in it, you know, for energy. It's not bad,
          though it sort of tastes like hairspray.
          She chews her gum. He watches her; the jaw line, her lips.
          She looks at him and smiles, but there's something behind it:
          a sadness. Almost an uneasiness.

          JONATHAN
          Hey, are you all right?

          "SÂ
          I don't want to complicate your life.

          JONATHAN
          Too late.                                                       -- I want all the complication
          you've got.
          She gazes at him, blinks back her emotions.
          it Sc,
          Your glasses. They're fogging up.
          She reaches out and gently removes his glasses.

          CONTINUED:
          She wipes the lenses, then peering into his eyes, slowly
          leans in to return them to his face... only she presses her
          lips to his instead, the glasses still in her hand, the kiss
          itself at once tender and passionate.
          She absently lowers her hand, lost in the unexpected
          intensity of the kiss. Embraced, they accidentally step under
          the sheet of water falling off the awning. Jonathan guides
          her back beneath the awning's shelter.
          At S is
          (breathless whisper)
          Maybe you should go...

          JONATHAN
          Maybe you should stay.
          She smiles as he kisses her even more passionately. Again
          they feel the awning's drops, and Jonathan moves to shelter
          them -
          - only "S" leans into him instead, leading him out from under
          the awning, the falling rain suddenly drenching their faces
          as they continue to kiss, the moment purely exhilarating.
          wiping the rain from her face, Jonathan gazes at her, soaked
          and utterly beautiful, with something akin to awe - like he's
          just breathed for the very first time.
          Rack focus on a hotel down the street, its neon sign reads:
          "Hotel Lotus."

          strokes her hair. She nuzzles up to him.
          She changes channels. Finds some tennis.

          Perfect.
          They watch together.

          So were you any good?

          JONATHAN
          Yeah. But I didn't want it enough. The
          guys who make it really need it. I played
          recently, first time in years. I've got

          Maybe you'll meet him one day. Anyway, we
          played and he creamed me. But I knew I was

          She idly flips channels, finds a romantic melodrama, an old
          black and white film. They settle back to watch.

          JONATHAN

          reaches for a glass of water on the night stand.
          She sips her water, as she turns back to Jonathan. Still,
          Jonathan picks up on her subtle shift.

          JONATHAN
          is everything okay?
          She starts to say something, then stops herself and nods

          He blows her a kiss, she blows one back. Almost in SLOW

          INT. HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT

          As Jonathan exits the room, hold on the room number:            517.
          Jonathan runs down the long corridor to the ice machine. He's
          giddy with excitement. Passionately alive.
          At the ice machine: an eccentric OLD WOMAN in her night
          attire is slowly filling a bucket. Piece by piece.
          Her weak, gnarly hands plucking at the blocks not wanting to
          break her long nails.
          Jonathan hops around in an agony of frustration.
          She turns, looks him up and down - he feels a bit self-
          conscious in his robe and bare feet.

          JONATHAN
          Would you like some help, ma'am?

          OLD WOMAN
          I can manage, thank you.
          Finally, her bucket is full and she goes on her way.
          .Jonathan quickly fills his bucket with ice.

          Returning down the empty hall, ice bucket in one hand, key
          card in the other, Jonathan hurriedly checks door numbers.
          We see Room 518                                                 has the DO NOT DISTURB sign on.
          Jonathan arrives back at room 517. He pauses and slips his
          robe from his shoulder, mock 'sexy'. He puts the card key in
          the lock, starts to open the door-- a small rectangular light
          blips RED. He tries the card again. Again red. He knocks on
          the door, calls out:

          JONATHAN
          I can't get the card to work.
          He tries the card again. Leaning in, he thinks he hears
          something behind the door. He peers down at the key panel:
          red.
          He knocks harder, waits for a response. None. Dead silence.

          JONATHAN
          Hello?... Hello?
          He jostles the door handle: it won't budge. He's getting
          anxious now, his breath quickening. He tries the key card
          again: red. He pounds harder, then slams his shoulder into
          the door. Nothing.
          Desperate, he tries the key card again -- and the light turns
          green.                                                          - A millisecond's surprised hesitation - then he jerks
          the handle, throws open the door and Jonathan tumbles into

          THE ROOM
          He peers up into the small entryway: empty. Ahead of him we
          glimpse the foot of the bed, its mussed blanket and sheets.
          Jonathan gets to his feet, starts for the bed, his breath
          quickening as he now notices a few red specks on the blanket.
          Panicked, he rushes forward to find BLOOD soaking the bed,
          splattered all over the crumpled sheets...
          Jonathan gapes, horrified, the world crashing in on him just
          as he senses something behind him and BANG!                     - something hits
          him to the back of the head -- he goes down like a sack of
          potatoes.

          Rubs the back of his head. Checks his hand for blood.
          Pain etched in his face, he manages to get to his feet,
          shaky. He looks around the room. It's EMPTY. No sign of "S."
          He runs into the bathroom. Also empty.
          Back in the room, he tries the closets: empty. The CONNECTING
          DOOR between this room and the next: LOCKED.
          He looks to where she'd draped her clothes and bag - every
          trace of her is gone. He whips back to the bed - the sheets
          are still crumpled, only there's no blood an here on them.
          He runs to the window looks down at the street. It's four in
          the morning, no one around.

          INT. HOTEL HALLWAY

          Tripping over his own legs, Jonathan runs barefoot down the
          corridor. He rounds a corner, another stretch of narrow
          corridor. O.S. we hear the muted DING of an elevator.
          Jonathan tears off in its direction...
          He stumbles into the open square in which the elevators are
          located. He crushes the down button, peers up to the floor
          indicator overhead: "4" slowly creeps to "3".

          INT. STAIRWELL

          His bare feet pounding the cement steps, Jonathan takes each
          floor faster, sweat on his brow and his palms which slip
          their grasp on the railing -- he tumbles head first, crashing
          to the 2nd floor landing. He clutches his head, gets up and
          continues to dash down...
          BANG! of the stairwell's exit as Jonathan stumbles out; he
          lurches forward, finally looking up to find he's in

          THE LOBBY
          His undershirt tugged and misshapen, boxers twisted around
          his bare thighs, robe open, Jonathan scans the lobby, wild-
          eyed and shaking. It's utterly vacant at this hour, the only
          sound a piped-in muzak rendition of the Beatles' "Yesterday."

          The Asian Clerk working there snaps his head up with a
          startled gasp. Jonathan barely manages to breathe the word:

          Two hotel SECURITY GUARDS take the lead as they near room
          517, Jonathan trailing, breathless and shaken...

          JONATHAN
          .I saw blood on the bed and then someone
          hit me. When I came to, she was gone.

          SECURITY 1
          This woman you were with. What's her name?
          Jonathan looks blank, his mind racing.

          SECURITY 2
          Sir?

          JONATHAN
          I don't know.
          (off their looks)
          It starts with an 'S'. I think.

          SECURITY 2
          Was shea prostitute?

          JONATHAN
          No! No, she's just a person. A friend.

          SECURITY 2
          A friend with no name.

          JONATHAN
          Of course she has a name! I just don't -
          we have to find her - something must have
          happened to her!

          INT. ROOM 517

          The two Security Guards are eyeing the bed.

          SECURITY 1
          I thought you said there was blood?

          JONATHAN
          I told you, whoever did this must have
          cleaned it up while I was out.

          Jonathan freezes, eyes darting to the night stand.

          JONATHAN
          My wallet and keys                                          - they're gone! They
          were right here...
          He looks over to the chair where his crumpled suit lies.    His
          SCARF is gone too.

          SECURITY 2
          Maybe she took them.

          JONATHAN
          What?!

          SECURITY 2
          It happens.

          JONATHAN
          She didn't do this, okay?! Something
          happened to her! You don't understand, we
          were... Wait!
          He sees something on the floor between the bed and night
          stand. He runs to to pick it up: a Chinese Gum Wrapper.

          JONATHAN
          This                                                        -- this was hers...
          Jonathan clutches it desperately, the lone trace of her
          existence. The Guards exchange a look like he's INSANE.

          SECURITY                                                    1
          Sir - are these your clothes?
          Jonathan nods absently.

          SECURITY 1
          How about putting them on.

          INT. LOBBY - LATER

          Jonathan arrives to find DETECTIVE RUSSO                    (female, mid-30s)
          waiting by reception with a UNIFORMED OFFICER. Seeing
          Jonathan, she sizes him up a moment, then approaches him.

          RUSSO
          Mr. Messer, I'm Detective Russo.

          INT. POLICE PRECINCT - RUSSO'S DESK - LATER

          Still shaken, Jonathan sits in a wooden chair across from
          Russo, amidst the din and traffic of the precinct.

          RUSSO

          (SCEPTICAL)
          And you don't know anything about her.
          Where she works? Where she lives?

          JONATHAN
          I told you how we met.

          RUSSO
          Through a sex group.
          Her flat words hang in the air. He guiltily avoids her eyes.

          RUSSO
          Does this group have a name?

          JONATHAN
          I don't                                                         -- it's not like that.

          RUSSO
          Mr. Messer, I spoke to the desk clerk. She
          only recalled seeing you check in.

          JONATHAN
          That's... that's the way it works.

          RUSSO
          All right. But now you're telling me that
          in addition to this mystery woman, there
          was another individual in the room?

          JONATHAN
          Not at first -- look, I know how it
          sounds, but I'm telling you, whoever hit
          me must have - I don't know -- taken her.
          Maybe even...
          He stops himself, shuddering to think of the implications.

          RUSSO
          Mr. Messer, have you had - experiences
          like this before? Taking any sort of
          medication?

          JONATHAN
          I'm not crazy, okay?! A woman vanished
          back there! There was blood all over the
          goddamn bed!
          He becomes very conscious that this sounds crazy - when A
          CELL PHONE RINGS: it's Russo's. She pauses, struck by the
          genuine desperation in Jonathan's face. She finally picks up.

          (glances at Jonathan)
          No, I don't think it's necessary... Right.
          She hangs up and turns to Jonathan. He looks away, barely
          able to contain his devastation.

          JONATHAN
          What am I supposed to do?
          An awkward silence, then:

          RUSSO
          If you want to file a report regarding the
          items she -
          (corrects herself)
          - the items you claim were stolen...
          Jonathan shakes his head, crushed and exasperated.

          JONATHAN
                                                                          I'd like to go now. Is that all right? Can
          I just                                                          - can I go?

          EXT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - FIRE ESCAPE - MIDDLE OF NIGHT

          Jonathan climbs up to the landing, fishes in the dark for a
          boot. He tips it, a SPARE KEY falls out. As he starts back
          down, he feels something in his coat pocket. He reaches in,
          finds "Duck On Bike" where he'd pocketed it.

          INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - MIDDLE OF NIGHT

          Jonathan stands motionless beneath the shower, face buried in
          his elbow, completely overwhelmed by his loss and longing.

          INT. JONATHAN'S BEDROOM

          Jonathan enters, wanders for his bed -- when he pauses,
          staring at his dresser. He approaches, peering down at
          something that's caught his eye...
          HIS HIGH SCHOOL TENNIS TROPHY. Nothing unusual - except for a
          small square outlined in dust three inches from the trophy
          base, the wood around its perimeter far more faded than the
          exposed area                                                    - as if the trophy had recently been moved.
          Jonathan swallows tensely, staring at the cryptic dust mark -
          (SOUND ADVANCE) BANG! of a file cabinet drawer yanked open in

          

          

          

          

          65.

          A SPARE BEDROOM
          Used for storage, including an old, gun-metal grey filing
          cabinet. Phone to his ear, Jonathan rapidly sifts through
          faded file folders crammed with papers and documents.

          JONATHAN                                                          (INTO PHONE)

          how soon could you-... Fine.
          He opens a file: it's where he keeps his passport. He stuffs
          it in his back pocket, keeps searching, pulls a folder marked
          "CREDIT CARDS." Sorting through old statements, he finds the
          line: "To report a card lost or stolen..."

          INT. JONATHAN'S BATHROOM - PRE-DAWN

          CLOSE ON JONATHAN'S HAGGARD FACE in the mirror of a medicine
          cabinet as he pulls it open. Be fishes around, finds what
          he's looking for: a SMALL BLACK CANNISTER for film. He pops
          the cap to reveal a fat roll of emergency money.
          Jonathan exits the bathroom, crosses the living room to the
          foyer, where we find a LOCKSMITH finishing changing the lock.

          INT. JONATHAN'S BEDROOM - DAWN

          Jonathan lies awake, staring at his muted TV, his face tear-
          stained, his eyes clouded.

          JONATHAN (V.O.)
          This is Jonathan Messer. I won't be able
          to come in today. I'm - pretty ill...
          'Duck on Bike' sits on his nightstand next to his glasses.

          Jonathan seated, resting against the window, drifting off
          into.restless sleep. We MOVE IN TIGHTER ON HIS FACE, tighter --

          Next stop Canal Street. Canal is next.

          :
          Jonathan jerks awake. A few stares from nearby passengers.

          EXT. CANAL STREET - DAY

          Jonathan emerges from underground to hectic Chinatown. What
          once felt romantic now feels cold and exclusionary, a
          bustling mix of ASIANS and map-clutching TOURISTS. He surveys
          the area,-overwhelmed, eyes searching for anything resembling
          a clue. Foreign faces return only cold, blank stares.

          GUM WRAPPER he found in the hotel, shows it to the vendor...

          INT. CHINESE MARKET - DAY

          Cramped and dingy. Jonathan makes his way to the counter,
          where an OLD WOMAN sits smoking. He holds up the wrapper.

          JONATHAN
          I was told you sell this gum here?
          The Old Woman studies him a wary beat, then gestures to a
          candy display. In one box is the same gum.

          JONATHAN
          A woman - a white woman - buys this brand
          of gum. I need to find-
          The Old Woman interrupts him in raspy Chinese.

          JONATHAN
          I'm sorry, I don't                                              -- Do you know the
          woman I'm talking about? A white woman...?
          Please, it's very important that I                              --

          My grandmother doesn't speak English.
          Jonathan spins around to find a CHINESE GIRL.(13) in a smock.

          JONATHAN
          Can you ask if she knows the name of the
          white woman who buys this gum?
          The Girl questions the old woman in rapid Chinese. She takes.
          a dragon her smoke, then gives a lengthy answer. The girl
          nods, finally turns to an anxiously waiting Jonathan.

          GIRL
          She says they sell that gum in practically
          every store in Chinatown.

          Jonathan is struggling with his stiff new key, hearing his
          PHONE RINGING inside.

          Creepy and drab. Jonathan enters, approaches a RECEPTIONIST.
          The Receptionist nods, points across the lobby to Detective
          Russo. Jonathan looks very worried.

          The elevator descends with an unnerving rattle as Jonathan
          rides down with Russo.

          RUSSO
          The body came in late last night, although
          time of death's still unclear. She was
          found in a taxi: driver was in a .coffee
          shop on his break, came back to his cab
          and there she was in the back seat.
          The elevator shudders to a metallic stop.

          RUSSO
          Her purse was recovered from a dumpster
          about a block away, so we've got a name.
          Jonathan tenses as the elevator doors BANG OPEN.

          Simone Forester.
          Jonathan looks sick with fear.

          INT. MORGUE

          Russo leads Jonathan into the harsh fluorescent lights of the
          morgue. A MEDICAL EXAMINER                                      (50s) looks up from a deli
          sandwich, takes one last bite and waves them over.
          As they approach, Jonathan notices the TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS
          stationed down here. They recognize Russo, nod in recognition
          - and eye Jonathan with hard, careful stares.

          SAME -"'MOMENTS LATER
          The M.E. stands over agurney, casually lifts the sheet
          that's been draped over the body. We glimpse a slender foot.
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN beside Russo. He turns instantly pale, lip

          It's the Blonde: the first woman he'd been with, the one he'd
          passed without a word in an office some days later.
          She looks the same, only death-pale and naked - and her neck
          marred by a thin, discolored line where she's been strangled.

          RUSSO
          Mr Messer...?
          He tries to speak, but can hardly breathe, let alone answer.

          RUSSO
          Was this the woman you were with last
          night?
          She frowns, suspicious of Jonathan's hesitation. His tense
          eyes whip across the morgue: the two cops still idling there.
          They're out of earshot, but their mere presence amps tension.
          Angle on the guns in their holsters. The handcuffs dangling --

          RUSSO
          Mr. Messer?

          JONATHAN
          No - she's not. Not last night... no.
          Russo studies his strained expression a suspicious beat.

          Jonathan exits behind Russo as they step onto the sidewalk.

          RUSSO
          I figured it was a long shot. The only
          reason I called you down is she was last
          seen with a man in the bar of the Hudson
          hotel.

          The Hudson?

          RUSSO
          You mentioned this group of yours meets up
          at various hotels. I thought it was worth
          a shot.

          his reaction not sitting right with her.

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN LLP - LOBBY - MORNING

          A pleasant RECEPTIONIST smiles up from her expansive desk.

          RECEPTIONIST
          May I help you?
          Jonathan is standing across from her.

          JONATHAN
          Yes, I need to get in contact with one of
          your attorneys, Wyatt Bose - it's
          extremely important. He's working out of
          the London office right now. If I could
          speak to his assistant or someone who'd
          know how-to reach him immediately...

          RECEPTIONIST
          Of course. Just a minute.
          The Receptionist types into her PHONE SYSTEM. She shakes her
          head, confused.

          JONATHAN
          B-o-s-e. First name Wyatt.

          RECEPTIONIST
          Wyatt with a 'Y'?

          JONATHAN
          Yes...
          The. receptionist frowns.

          RECEPTIONIST
          Oh -- Ms. Pomerantz?
          Angle on a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN walking past.

          MS. POMERANTZ
          What can I do for you, Mr,

          JONATHAN
          Messer. Jonathan Messer. I'm an auditor
          from worth and Berman.

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN - CORRIDOR

          Jonathan walks alongside Ms. Pomerantz.

          POMERANTZ
          Are you sure you have the right firm?

          JONATHAN
          Yes                                                             -- yes, I'm                         --- He works here. I've seen
                                                                          him working here. I net him here.

          POMERANTZ
          When was this?

          JONATHAN
          A few weeks ago. Wyatt Bose. Wait... here.
          He hands her Wyatt's business card with the Rutherford Stern
          masthead on it. She studies it with a look of confusion.

          POMERANTZ
          I don't know what's going on, but I can
          assure you, there is nobody here named-

          JONATHAN
          I've seen him in the halls                                      - for Chrissake
          we smoked pot in the conference room!
          Ms. Pomerantz abruptly frowns, when Jonathan spots a LAWYER -

          FLASH INSERT -= COFFEE LOUNGE
          This Lawyer and another laughing at Wyatt's punch line.
          Jonathan runs over to the Lawyer, grabs the man's arm.

          JONATHAN
          Thank God. Look, I'm trying to find Wyatt.

          LAWYER
          Who?

          Wyatt Bose. I saw you talking with him,
          cracking jokes in the coffee lounge.
          FLASH ON SAME SCENE: Wyatt looks up, eyes meet Jonathan's.
          Jonathan smiles in greeting... but Wyatt just nods coolly.

          LAWYER
          I crack jokes with a lot of people.

          JONATHAN
          Hold on, you're telling me you don't--

          LAWYER
          Hey - easy with the hands, okay?
          Jonathan realizes he's got the man's sleeve in his fist. He
          lets go, spins back to Ms. Pomerantz.

          JONATHAN
          He said he was in London with Mr.
          Rutherford, paperinga -

          MS. POMERANTZ                                                   (O.S.)
          Mister Messer.
          Jonathan spins to find Ms. Pomerantz scowling at him. A beat.

          MS. POMERANTZ
          Mr. Rutherford is presently recovering
          from hip surgery. In New Jersey.
          Jonathan glances around, to find everyone - lawyers,
          assistants, mail clerks                                         - all staring at him.

          INT. WYATT'S BROWNSTONE - DAY

          Breathless, Jonathan bolts up a set of stairs, knocks on a
          door. No answer. He knocks harder. From within we hear a set
          of FOOTSTEPS. Sound of a lock turning, the door is opened...

          JONATHAN
          Wyatt -
          .by a MAN in his early 60's, his WIFE behind him; both
          strike us as wealthy, downtown patron-of-the-arts types.

          JONATHAN
          Sorry, I                                                        -- I need to speak to Wyatt.

          Wyatt Bose. He lives here.

          WOMAN
          In this building? He must be new. See,
          we've been out of town the past2 months -

          JONATHAN
          Not in this building - in this apartment.

          MAN

          (FROWNS)
          Young man, we've owned this apartment
          going on thirty years now.

          JONATHAN
          But... I was right-here-with him...
          The Man takes a step back, catching his wife's equally wary
          expression, his hand making for the chain lock.

          JONATHAN

          (DESPERATE)
          Wait!! That painting there, it's                              a Gerhard
          Richter, right?

          WOMAN
          (even more uneasy)
          Yes?

          JONATHAN
          From a gallery! In Munich - the one that
          Herr Kleiner handles? The art dealer
          downstairs?

          MAN
          Downstairs? You must mean Mr. Moretti, but
          he's in the carpet business                                   -

          JONATHAN
          But Wyatt smoke to him.

          MAN
          Unless it was in Italian I doubt he got
          very far.
          Jonathan steps back, looking like he's losing his mind.

          WOMAN
          Young man... are you all right?

          

          

          

          

          73.

          EXT. WYATT'S BUILDING -- DAY

          Jonathan stumbles out, breathing hard as he tries to grapple
          with this                                                      - when he slams up against a man's shirtfront. Two
          hands grasp his arms, we glimpse a pair of black wingtips      -
          - and whip tilt up to the papery face of "Herr Kleiner"        (aka
          Mr. Moretti).

          "HERR KLEINER"
          Sono spiacente.

          INT. SUBWAY CAR - EVENING

          Jonathan sits slumped against a window, the world around him
          is ceasing to make sense. Across the aisle, a YOUNG BOHEMIAN
          COUPLE sit side by side, her headon his shoulder. On
          Jonathan's face there's a sense of loss that is almost
          overwhelming.
          Jonathan takes the crinkled Chinese gum wrapper from his
          pocket, smoothes it in his hands, stares down at it with a
          look of longing...
          . when his eyes suddenly widen. He sees something inside,
          something he hadn't noticed. He unfolds it to reveal two
          words written in a feminine hand on the white underside:
          I'm sorry
          Jonathan quickly looks up, as if expecting someone else to
          share in this haunting discovery. of course, no one does.
          He stares back. down at it, bewildered, stunned - chilled.

          EXT. SUBWAY STATION - CANAL ST., CHINATOWN - LATER

          Jonathan runs out from the subway station. Determined, he
          walks down Canal street, his eyes suddenly land on a COPY
          SHOP across.
          TIGHT ON JONATHAN as we see something click in his head -

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN - LOBBY - LATE DAY

          Jonathan steps off the elevator, heads straight for the
          Receptionist. She immediately looks nervous.

          RECEPTIONIST
          Sir, we asked around, nobody knows the guy

          YOU'RE-

          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:

          JONATHAN
          When I was working over here, you made a
          photocopy of my I.D..'

          RECEPTIONIST
          We do all freelancers, it's policy.

          (REALIZES)
          Oh - I'm not sure I'm allowed to-

          JONATHAN
          You have to.
          She looks at him', sees his desperation.

          SAME - MOMENTS LATER
          Jonathan is flipping through the stack of photocopies, then
          halts on one. He stares at it. The Receptionist peers over.

          RECEPTIONIST
          That's him? He was real cute. Only he
          wasn't a lawyer. He was a systems analyst,
          I think. He was here for a few days to
          work on the computers.
          RECEPTIONIST'S POV: of the photocopy in Jonathan's hand. It's
          of a Massachusetts Driver's License. Staring back up at us is
          Wyatt's smiling face.

          RECEPTIONIST
          I thought you said his name was Wyatt?
          PAN TO THE NAME beside the photo: Sansky. WilliamR.
          Jonathan is already running for the EXIT.

          INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT -- HIS BEDROOM - EVENING

          CLOSE ON JONATHAN'S LAPTOP SCREEN as an internet search
          engine runs the name: "Bansky, William." A page of some 200+
          matches is returned. Jonathan readies himself, then dives in.
          Beside the keyboard rests the receptionist's photocopy of
          William Bansky's Massachusetts driver's license. We see
          Detective Russo's business card resting a few inches away.

          ON JONATHAN - MOMENTS LATER
          Checking URLs site by site. He finally pauses on one. It's an
          article from the Boston Herald. The headline: "POLICE HAVE
          FEW CLUES TO YOUNG EXECUTIVE'S DISAPPEARANCE." As Jonathan
          scans the article, we glimpse some lines of text:

          Tilt up to Jonathan, scribbling on a Post-it pad:

          WYATT BOSE = WILLIAM BANSKY, SOFTWARE CONSULTANT, BOSTON

          ORIG. FROM CHICAGO -- $$ TROUBLE
          He sticks the post-it to the photocopy of Bansky's ID. He
          steps back, stares at it a beat - when he notices something
          on his desk,,resting under the phone: a manila file folder.
                                                                          He frowns at it - clearly out of place here. He picks the
          file up, opens it... to a series of                             8X10                                                        photographs?
          Heart racing nervously, he takes one out: it's of Jonathan
          standing in the Plaza lobby by the Eloise portrait. Confused,
          he quickly flips to the next one: in it, a Blonde now stands
          there with him -- the Blonde found murdered. Simone Forester.
          Jonathan's rapidly breathing as he shuffles through more
          photos. They're in sequence, taken by telephoto lens.
          Jonathan and Simone Forester getting in the elevator. Opening
          the room door. Undressing. Screwing. In one, Jonathan has his
          hands on her neck...
          He's sweating with anxiety- when suddenly the phone rings,
          startling him. He eyes it warily, then slowly picks up.

          JONATHAN
          Hello?

          Mr. Messer, it's Detective Russo returning
          your call.
          Jonathan freezes, tries not to sound panicked, his eyes fixed
          on the damning photos of himself and Simone Forester.

          JONATHAN
          Oh - right, I was just - checking in, to

          Turns out among credit card charges made
          that night, there was one with your name.
          The card was declined.

          JONATHAN
          I cancelled them all, the day they got
          stolen.

          RUSSO (O.S.)
          I see. I figured it didn't mean much -
          cards move quickly. It just struck me, you
          know.. The coincidence.
          Jonathan can hear the suspicion in her pause.

          RUSSO                                                      (O.S.)
          By the way, the morgue confirmed
          strangulation as cause of death. He found
          trace fibres of Kevlar in her neck wound.

          JONATHAN
          Kevlar?

          RUSSO (O.S.)
          It's used in certain kinds of rope and
          string.
          Jonathan's eyes suddenly go wide; whip pan with his gaze   to

          night.
          Jonathan slowly hangs up, his panicked gaze returning to the
          hall closet as he paces toward it, throws open the door.
          In the far corner rests his racket bag. He grabs it, yanks
          open the zipper... his face draining of all remaining color
          as he peers into his empty racket ba                           . His racket is gone.

          SAME - MOMENTS LATER
          Jonathan pacing the floor, paranoid. He holds Detective
          Russo's card. Knows he should call back. He abruptly reaches
          for the phone, and dials... another number.

          JONATHAN
          I know, okay? I know your name isn't Wyatt
          Bose. I know you killed that woman. And I
          know you're trying to frame me for it, so -
          so - WHY? What the hell is going on? And
          where is she?! If you hurt her I swear to
          God I'll...
          Jonathan falters, unsure where he's going with this and
          realizing he's now talking to himself.

          Jonathan hesitates, hits the Star key. A new BEEP. Harder:

          JONATHAN
          It's me. I need to talk to you.
          He hits pound. Breathes. At least he's done something.
          Suddenly from O.S. a faint creak. Jonathan spins, scans the
          room, grabs the nearest blunt object: his tennis trophy.
          QUICKLY CUT SHOTS of Jonathan searching his apartment, his
          trophy raised as a makeshift weapon.

          He finally halts, uneasy but satisfied there's no one else
          here - when his home phone rings, startling him. RING...
          RING... RING... Jonathan hesitates. His machine picks up:

          JONATHAN'S ANSWERING MACHINE
          This is Jonathan. Please leave a message.
          BEEEEP. A moment of hiss                                       - then:

          Jonathan whips to the phone - it sounds like Wyatt ---

          I understand you were out today. I left
          messages on your cell but never heard
          back, so I thought I'd try you at home.
          He slowly lowers his trophy as he listens, staring out the
          window at the dark night and empty street below.

          PETERSON                                                       (O.S.)

          INT. SUBWAY CAR - MORNING

          Jonathan sits in a crowded car, dressed for work.

          PETERSON                                                       (V.0.)
          They're our biggest client, so needless to
          say, make them your top priority...
          Jonathan takes out the crinkled Chinese gum wrapper. He
          stares at it with a look of longing: this is his Priority-

          EXT. CHINATOWN -- DAY

          A series of shots: Jonathan asking around about "S." The
          street vendors. The receptionist at the hotel. The waiter at
          the restaurant where they ate... They all shake their heads.
          Heading back for the subway, dejected, he steps on.a
          discarded page from the newspaper's Metro section, sees a
          headline: "STILL NO SUSPECT IN MURDER OF YOUNG EXEC." The
          photo is of Simone Forester.

          INT. CLUTE NICHOLS BROKERAGE - CORRIDORS                        - LATE DAY

          Intensely preoccupied, Jonathan walks alone past assistants
          and execs. In his eyes a sense of paranoia, a mistrust of
          every strange face.

          INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

          Isolated behind yet another wall of glass, Jonathan just
          stares bleary-eyed at his laptop, unable to work.

          EXT. CLUTE NICHOLS BUILDING - NIGHT

          Jonathan exits, starts toward the sidewalk -- but hears
          something: sandpaper SHUFFLE of shoes on pavement. Be spins     --
          No one there. Just one of many large stone pillars adorning
          the building. Jonathan peers anxiously at the pillar,
          wavering. He steps closer, trying to glimpse behind it -
          RING! of his cell-phone breaks the stillness. RING... RING...
          He catches his breath, quickly picks up. A silent beat.

          A WOMAN'S VOICE                                                 (O.S.)
          Are you free tonight?... Hello?
          He hangs up, chilled. Turns again to the pillar, steps closer
          - no sound. He hesitates... then turns and walks off.

          INT. TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

          People heading home from work. Jonathan among them, utterly
          desolate. Sliding his MetroCard, he suddenly feels watched
          again. He spins, peers anxiously behind him. Only strange
          faces passing through turnstiles.

          INT. SUBWAY STATION - CORRIDOR

          A narrow, curved stretch of grimy walls of ads and graffiti.
          Jonathan keeps a quick pace, feeling vulnerable.
          We lag back, following him from an ANONYMOUS POV; glance up
          at a sign for stairs to the N & R trains.

          INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM

          Jonathan is waiting for his train, eyes nervously glancing
          around, still feeling watched -
          When he sees a young woman standing all the way across on the
          opposite platform, waiting for a train. She casually turns
          her head, and Jonathan's eyes go wide...

          It's "S."
          Jonathan just gapes across the divide of two subway tracks;
          he can't believe he's seeing her again...
          . when she starts to back away, almost as if she might run.
          Confused, Jonathan rushes to the edge of his platform.

          JONATHAN
          wait! Wait, right there!
          Jonathan stands on the edge reeling, desperate to get,to her.
          He looks around, hears the distant: .nimble of afar. off train,
          and suddenly he does something we'd have never thought him
          capable of: he jumps onto the tracks!
          He lands hard, nearly breaking his ankle, but quickly
          scrambles to his feet, splashing in the sludge between rails,
          eyes darting along the track, anxious to avoid the third
          rail, ears attuned to the sound of that distant train as he
          races for

          THE CENTER DIVIDER
          He reaches the grimy rungs and quickly climbs up.
          He gets to his feet on the center divider - now only one lane
          of track separating him from the platform she was standing on
          - only she's no longer there?
          He scans the people waiting, no sign of "S" among them - and
          then suddenly he spots her, heading for the exits.

          JONATHAN

          STOP!
          She glances back, utterly stunned to find Jonathan standing
          on the center divider, feet soaked in muck.
          Neither speaks for a moment, just staring at each other
          across the solitary track. Then:

          JONATHAN
          I thought you were dead!
          She looks like she wants to say something, but doesn't. And
          all at once he's hit with a crushing realization:

          JONATHAN
          You are in on this, aren't you?!
          She holds his eyes a moment longer, fighting back emotion -
          then she abruptly turns and starts back for the exit again.

          steal his wallet.
          Jonathan looks confused; she's struggling to stay composed
          but looks like she could break down at any moment.

          âSâ
          He asked if I wanted to make some real
          money. All I had to do was get involved
          with you, and not ask any questions.
          Jonathan just stares, devastated.

          JONATHAN
          So everything between us - was nothing?
          She fights back tears.

          ., S
          No - no... After that first night I tried
          to call it off, he said he'd kill me if I
          didn't go through with it.

          JONATHAN
          Go through with what?

          âC,.
          The plan. Get you out of the hotel room,
          slip out and meet up later for my money.
          Only I ran instead. He's been looking for
          me ever since. I have to leave the city -

          JONATHAN
          Then why didn't you?

          SÂ
          Because I needed to see you again. I
          needed to be sure you were all right.
          Despite his conflicting emotions, Jonathan is moved          by   this.
          S,f

          Did you go to the police?

          JONATHAN
          I can't. He's framing me for murder.
          What?

          JONATHAN
          He killed a woman from the club, someone
          I'd been with.
          "S" is shocked., instantly terrified. Clearly she had no idea.

          Jonathan, you have to leave! Do you
          understand? You need to get the hell out
          of here, he's going to kill you!
          The roar of the incoming train is growing LOUDER...
          Don't you understand? He's going to kill -
          - when the INCOMING TRAIN completely drowns him out... and
          swipes "S" out of Jonathan's view.
          Jonathan struggles to peer through the train windows but its
          passengers prevent him from getting a look at her. Just then
          the TRAIN DOORS OPEN WITH THE NOISE of passengers getting on
          and off. Panicked, Jonathan cranes his neck, trying to see
          her through the windows.

          JONATHAN

          STOP!
          He boards the train; using it as a bridge, he pushes through
          passengers, desperate for an open door to the other side.

          -- only she's nowhere in sight. Jonathan spins frantically as
          the doors close and he hears the TRAIN START TO PULL AWAY.
          He runs alongside the train - desperately searching for a
          glimpse of her                                                  - no sign of her in any of the windows...

          the rear observation window, her hand pressed to the pane,
          her tearful expression bidding him a heartbreaking goodbye.
          He stumbles to a devastated halt, eyes pleading vainly as he

          Jonathan is heading for the Clute Nichols building, that same
          focused tension on his face -

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Mr. Messer?
          Jonathan is too lost in thought to hear it.

          WOMAN'S VOICE                                                   (CONT'D)

          He glances up... to find Russo standing near the entryway -
          what's she doing here? He has no choice but to meet her.

          RUSSO
          I was gonna call, but I was in the area.
          Just doing some follow-up.
          Jonathan tries to mask his uneasiness.

          JONATHAN
          Follow-up?

          RUSSO
          On that missing girl of yours. The.one
          whose name began with. an "S." Have any
          luck finding her?
          Jonathan absently tightens his grasp on his briefcase.

          JONATHAN
          No. No luck.

          RUSSO
          I see. That's too bad.
          she studies him a cryptic beat, then smiles flatly.

          RUSSO
          Well, who knows, maybe she'll turn up yet.
          You have a good day, Mr. Messer.
          Jonathan nods tensely, then walks off, feeling her watching
          him from the curb as he goes.

          INT. CLUTE NICHOLS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Employees pass by the glass behind which we see Jonathan - a
          lone figure at his laptop, surrounded by files and post-its.
          Close on Jonathan as he scribbles on a post-it: "Yesterday -
          Beatles?" Widen to find the post-its organized with his usual
          fastidiousness                                                  - only scribbled with words, not numbers:
          "Wyatt Bose = William Bansky" and other random scribblings.
          He's trying to apply his mathematical mind to his crisis,
          hoping to conjure some kind of pattern or logic to it all.
          Reverse angle through the glass: to anyone passing, he looks
          like your typical overly meticulous, isolated auditor.
          Closer on Jonathan as he clutches the table, looks seconds
          away from utterly losing it -- when something suddenly occurs
          to him. He whips around, gaze fixing on

          ear, listens for the other end; then:

          JONATHAN
          Are you free tonight?

          CUT TO:

          INT. THE KITANO HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT

          Jonathan waits anxiously by a Botero sculpture of a rotund
          dog. A young woman in a BLUE PASHMINA approaches.

          INT. THE KITANO - ELEVATOR

          Blue Pashmina enters first, Jonathan follows her into an
          empty elevator. The doors close.

          JONATHAN
          Do you know Wyatt Bose?

          BLUE PASHMINA
          (immediately guarded)
          Excuse me?

          JONATHAN
          What about William Bansky? Does that name--
          She darts.for the "Door Open" button, but he blocks her path.

          BLUE PASHMINA
          I swear to God I'll scream.

          JONATHAN
          Please, I'm not trying to scare you, I
          just                                                            -- I'm looking for someone.and it's
          very important that I find him.
          she tries to push past him, again Jonathan blocks her.

          JONATHAN
          He does this too - or he did. someone had
          to give him the numbers. Someone let him
          in. If I can-'find who it was that knew
          him, they might know where he's                                 --
          she suddenly kicks him in the shin with a spiked heel.
          Jonathan grasps his leg - she presses the button and is out
          the opening doors before he's even looked up.

          CLOSE ON JONATHAN alone at the end of the conference table,
          eyes scanning files absently, fingers typing on auto-pilot.
          His gaze holds a new determination, as the CLACKING OF KEYS

          SET THE RHYTHM FOR A BRIEF MONTAGE-

          INT. HOTEL CASABLANCA - LOBBY - LATER

          Jonathan anxiously escorts ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN past the quasi-
          Moroccan motif. Asking her something, he takes out a folded
          paper from his pocket, shows it to her: it's the photocopy of
          Bansky's license with the image of Wyatt's face. She quickly
          shakes her head, her eyes searching for the exit.

          INT. THE LOMBARDY - BAR - NIGHT

          Jonathan trails a TALL WOMAN as she bee-lines for the exit.
          He grabs her arm, thrusts the photocopy into her hands. She
          halts, looks up at him... and tears it in two before handing
          it back and hurrying off, her glare full of paranoia.

          TNT. THE SHERRY-NETHERLAND - LOBBY - NIGHT
          Jonathan rises from a couch to greet YET ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN.
          He gets no more than a few seconds into his question when she
          about-faces without a word. Jonathan has a relentless look in
          his eye. Takes out his cell, calls another number...

          INT. VARIOUS HOTELS - LOBBY COUCHES - NIGHT

          Rapid jump cuts of A DOZEN DIFFERENT WOMEN'S FACES, all
          indicating twenty different kinds of "no"; with each cut the
          women occupy the exact same position in frame, only their
          faces and the hotel backgrounds behind them change.

          INT. THE MICHELANGELO - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

          Room key in hand, Jonathan rides up with a woman in a BLACK
          BUSINESS SUIT - a tall, attractive business-type. Jonathan
          stares at his shoes, trying to mask his. utter exhaustion.

          INT. THE MICHELANGELO - A ROOM - NIGHT

          Jonathan and Black Business Suit come in. She starts to

          UNDRESS:

          I need to ask you something, it's
          incredibly important...

          He pauses to unfold his now scotch-taped photocopy, shows it
          to her. She freezes, eyes fixed on the license photo.
          Jonathan braces himself for her departure                       - when she stares
          back up at him in scared but clear recognition.

          SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER
          Seated on the edge of the made bed, Black Business Suit
          shifts uncomfortably as she lights a cigarette.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          I was in Chicago on business, a little
          over a year ago. I was out.to dinner with
          one of our Chicago partners,.a man named
          Holloway. That's how I met him.
          TIGHT ON JONATHAN as we SMASH TO:

          INT. EXPENSIVE CHICAGO RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          A slightly older man                                            (HOLLOWAY) sits with his back to us.
          Across from him sits Black Business Suit. A YOUNGER MAN steps
          into frame, rests his hand on Holloway's shoulder.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT                                             (V.0.)
          At first I assumed he was a junior
          executive at their firm. But he wasn't.
          That's not to say he didn't work for
          Holloway, but clearly in a more intimate
          capacity...

          TNT. THE MICHELANGELO - ROOM - NIGHT
          Black Business Suit takes a cool drag on her cigarette.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          I wasn't shocked. Besides, obviously I'm
          no prude. Even back then, I'd been doing -
          you know, this thing -- for a while.

          INT. EXPENSIVE CHICAGO RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Wyatt is talking, entertaining his two companions - but
          clearly more focused on Black Business Suit, flirting it up.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT                                             (V.0.)
          I was simply curious. More so when he
          apologized, explaining that he'd forgotten
          about another engagement.
          Wyatt's knuckles just barely stroke Black Business Suit's
          thigh as he rises to leave. They exchange a knowing glance...

          BACK TO MICHELANGELO ROOM

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          I was intrigued. He was intelligent,
          informed about everything from law to art
          to politics. I'd never met anyone so in
          command of his own charm. He said that
          he'd come from nothing, that everything he
          learned, he learned from his tricks. He
          claimed that Holloway was even grooming
          him for a position at his company.
          She lights another cigarette with her old one.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          In a way, I felt for him. But I also
          admired him. It sounds silly,. but he had a
          way of making me feel - close to him, you
          know?
          This clearly hits home with Jonathan. He barely nods.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          So I found myself telling him things..
          Personal things. And, next thing I knew -

          JONATHAN
          You told him. About this.
          A beat, and she nods, crushing out her other cigarette.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          He seemed fascinated by it. Wanted to know
          all the details.

          (EXHALES)
          I suppose I'd had too much to drink. And I
          was distracted... I was thinking about
          what a great lay he was going to be.

          INT. FOUR SEASONS CHICAGO -.SUITE BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

          Wyatt and Black Business Suit go at it with animal
          aggression. She's on all fours, arching lustily, pleasure
          nearly unbearable, eyes clenched shut as she climaxes.
          Exhausted, her body goes limp.
          TILT UP to his face: an eerily blank, driven stare, devoid of
          real pleasure. She struggles, tries to protest - when his
          hands grip her shoulder blades, thrusting harder, violently
          pinning her down, her sudden fear stifled by the mattress --

          Only afterwards I discovered two of my
          credit cards were missing. As was my cell
          phone. Of course I couldn't say anything
          to Holloway. And Jamie must have known I'd
          never report it to the police.

          (BEAT)
          So I just put the incident out of my mind.
          I all but forgot about it, until one
          night, maybe two months ago -

          INT. THE WARWICK (NYC)                                         - LOBBY - NIGHT

          Black Business Suit is crossing the lobby for a portrait of
          Hearst and A SUITED MAN lingering beneath it... when the man
          looks up. It's Wyatt.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT                                            (V.0.)
          I almost didn't recognize him. But when I
          did, I suddenly felt very, very scared.
          She freezes -- obscured by one of the trees as Wyatt checks
          his watch, scans-the lobby with a cool, piercing look.

          BACK TO BLACK BUSINESS SUIT AND JONATHAN IN THE MICHELANGELO

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          I left before he saw me.
          She drags on her cigarette, looks off into space.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          He must have used my cell phone to get
          into the group.
          (crushes out her cigarette)
          Anyway, that's it. That's all I know.
          She looks around. At the room, the bed. She shudders, rises.

          JONATHAN
          Wait - thank you.
          (off her look)
          Have you ever run into him again?

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          Getz? No. And I don't ever want to.

          JONATHAN
          Getz?

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          That was his name. Jamie Getz.

          Bundled in her ski jacket, Solange is closing up her shop for
          the night, stacks of flowers in her arms, when she notices
          Jonathan coming down the front steps.

          SOLANGE
          Jonathan, you're home early -
          Only when he looks up, she finds the young man in the
          overcoat isn't Jonathan. It's Wyatt.

          SOLANGE
          Oh - je suis desole. My mistake.
          Wyatt flashes her an icy smile, continues down the steps.
          Solange watches him walk away, a puzzled look on her face.

          INT. MICHELANGELO - HOTEL BUSINESS CENTER - NIGHT

          Huddled over a computer, Jonathan typing, eyes red from
          exhaustion and stress as we hear his recall:

          JONATHAN (V.0.)
          who's James Getz?

          WYATT (V.0.)
          A guy I roomed with freshman year at
          Princeton.
          on Jonathan's monitor we see he's on a web site for Princeton
          University alumni. He types in: Getz, James.
          A beat - then: "No match." A long list of G names follows.
          Jonathan scrolls down the list, but there's no Getz.

          JONATHAN
          Shit.
          Jonathan exhales, about to log off - when a name among the
          H's jumps out at him: Holloway. Reed.
          Jonathan stares at it tensely - then clicks on the name.
          "Sort no contact information available."
          Jonathan thinks a moment - then tries a search engine, types:
          "Holloway Reed" then decides to add the word "missing."
          An article appears. From the Chicago Tribune: "BODY OF
          MISSING BUSINESSMAN FINALLY DISCOVERED." A head-shot style
          photograph shows a man in his early 40s whom we recognize
          from Black Business Suit's story. Beneath his photo, his
          name: "Reed Holloway."

          Porn shops and prostitutes, the streets pulsing with a
          sinister energy. Jonathan is pacing toward the subway,
          reading over the printed article.

          EXT. BROOKLYN - ELEVATED SUBWAY PLATFORM - LATE NIGHT

          Jonathan descends the steps to his presently deserted
          neighborhood. O.S. the departure of the subway train is
          joined by the distant.wail of SIRENS.
          Jonathan continues down the block, then pauses. He wrinkles
          his nose, smelling something. He looks up: two blocks away, a
          thick plume of smoke is billowing up into the sky --

          EXT. JONATHAN'S DUPLEX

          Jonathan bolts around the corner to find an ambulance and
          fire engine curbside -- a fire raging in the lower story of
          his building!
          Running toward the blaze, he speeds past a BLACK BMW parked
          across the street, engine running. It suddenly shifts into
          gear and peels out in a fast turn. Jonathan spins               - something
          about it troubling him - but the BMW is already gone. He
          continues racing toward his building...
          The neon "FLEURS DE SOLANGE" sign crackles and sparks in the
          flame. Through blown out windows, piles of burning flowers
          emit what must be an awful stench.
          Two EMS WORKERS are loading a gurney on which Solange lays,
          burned and half-aware, but alive, when Jonathan rushes over.
          She manages to open her eyes, her voice barely audible:

          SOLANGE
          Jonathan...
          He squeezes her hand as she's lifted into the ambulance.

          JONATHAN'
          (to EMS worker)
          Is she going to be okay?

          JONATHAN
          I live here.

          INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - LATER

          Thick smoke clouds the stairs and corridor. Suit jacket over
          his head, Jonathan is hurriedly escorted by the Fire Worker.
          His own door has already been kicked open, splintered at its
          hinges. The place looks like it's been turned upside down,
          furniture soaking wet, charred areas on walls.

          FIRE WORKER
          Lucky we were able to contain it somewhat.
          Better get your valuables together.

          INT. JONATHAN'S BEDROOM

          still in shock, he tosses random clothes in a gym bag - "Duck
          on Bike" too.

          JONATHAN
          (calls out)
          How did it start?

          FIRE WORKER (O.S.)
          We're not sure. Maybe a bad fuse.

          INT. JONATHAN'S BATHROOM

          Jonathan opens his medicine cabinet, takes out his small film
          cannister, uncaps it to see how much money he has left. Not
          very much. He stuffs the cannister into his pants pocket.

          INT. SPARE BEDROOM

          Jonathan opens his old gunmetal-gray filing cabinet, then
          pops open his briefcase, trying to decide what to take.
          He finds a file marked "Bank Statements," pulls it, about to
          toss it in his briefcase - when he stops, something about its
          contents ---
          CLOSE ON THE FILE. Stuffed with paper. But not bank
          statements... Copies and copies of photographs of Jonathan
          with Simone Forester. Some we've seen, some new.
          Jonathan hunts through more files, his breathless nausea
          telling us the contents of each and every file have been
          swapped out with photos.

          95.

          CONTINUED:
          He opens another at random - and freezes: it's a photo of
          Jonathan and "S" walking in Chinatown. He scans through
          others, shots of them in the restaurant, entering the Hotel
          Lotus...
          TIGHT ON JONATHAN, terrified by the horrific implication -

          FIRE WORKER                                                     (O.S.)
          Mr. Messer?
          Jonathan gasps as he looks up to find the Fire Worker in the
          doorway. He quickly shuts the file.

          JONATHAN
          Just                                                            - give me a minute.

          INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

          A paranoid-looking Jonathan returns with a briefcase stuffed
          near to bursting. The tired Fire Worker looks up impatiently.

          FIRE WORKER
          That everything?
          Jonathan regards his minimal possessions, realizes how little
          evidence there is of a life. A wrenching sense of isolation.

          JONATHAN
          I guess it is.

          FIRE WORKER
          You got someone you can stay with?

          INT. A SEEDY HOTEL LOBBY - DOWNTOWN - PRE-DAWN

          The sort of decrepit no-tell motel frequented by hookers and
          junkies. Jonathan clutches his briefcase as he stares through
          steel mesh at. the NIGHT CLERK.

          NIGHT CLERK
          It's fifty for the night.
          Jonathan fishes out his film cannister, and parts with what
          he discovers are his last three                                 $20s.

          INT. SEEDY HOTEL - ROOM - PRE-DAWN

          Even more depressing than the lobby: bars on the windows,
          stains on the thin walls through which the faint sounds of
          paid sex bleed in. Somewhere a bottle smashes.

          96.

          CONTINUED:
          Unable to sleep, Jonathan has emptied his briefcase contents
          onto the bed. He stares at one of Wyatt's photos of him and
          "S." She's smiling up at him.
          EXTREME CLOSE ON THE IMAGE OF HER FACE. The smile, frozen in
          time, at once haunting and heartbreaking.
          He gently sets the photo down beside the Chicago Tribune
          article he'd printed on the unsolved murder of Reed Holloway
          ("BODY OF MISSING BUSINESSMAN FINALLY DISCOVERED"). His eyes
          drift to the article, and something suddenly occurs to him -
          FLASH ON: THE PHOTOGRAPH IN "WYATT'S.BROWNSTONE" of Wyatt
          with bleached hair styled in a loose spike --
          IN THE ARTICLE'S PHOTO, Holloway sports an almost identical
          look.-His eyes move to the date of the article: "May 17."

          CUT TO:
          Jonathan on the phone, a business card in hand.

          OFFICE ON PHONE
          Boston Police, how can I direct your call?
          Jonathan reads off the card Detective Russo had given him:

          JONATHAN
                                                                                                      This is Detective Russo, NYPD, badge
          number 274655.                                                                                                                     1   just need some

          Jonathan sits in suspense, awaiting a response. Finally -

          OFFICER ON PHONE
          Well?

          JONATHAN
          You've got a case, a missing person named
          William Bansky. I'm wondering if you can
          tell me the date he was last seen?

          OFFICER ON PHONE
          Hold a sec.

          (PAUSE)
          Bansky, William, last seen... May                              17.
          Jonathan's eyes return to the Holloway article                 ("BODY OF
          MISSING BUSINESSMAN FINALLY DISCOVERED:), dated "May 17."

          OFFICER ON PHONE

          CONTINUED:

          JONATHAN
          That's it, thanks.
          Jonathan quickly hangs up, equally encouraged and chilled by
          the connection he's made.
          TILT DOWN to a post-it, on which he's scribbled: "BOSE =
          BANSKY = HOLLOWAY." To this he adds: "= JAMES GETZ"

          INT. CHASE MANHATTAN BANK - MORNING

          A line of customers stare mutely up at plasma tv screens
          above - except for Jonathan, unshaven, suit wrinkled, face
          all anxious tension.

          SAME - TELLER'S WINDOW - MOMENTS LATER
          Jonathan slides his passport through the window's metal tray,
          to the TELLER                                                   (40s) working behind three inches of glass. The
          Teller examines the passport, then slides it back.

          TELLER
          M'kay, if you'll just swipe your ATM card.
          She gestures to a small punch pad to Jonathan's right.

          JONATHAN
          Actually, my card was stolen.

          TELLER
          Mmm'kay... do you see those two taupe
          colored telephones over there? Just pick
          up either one and you'll be connected with
          our automated system.

          JONATHAN
          The thing is, I already used your
          automated system and...look, this
          passport's all I have left, it's the only
          thing proves who I am and now I'm down to
          like my last ten dollars here, so...
          Jonathan's cool is cracking. The Teller wrinkles her brow.

          TELLER
          Mm'kay, if you press "0" on either phone?
          A customer service representative will -

          JONATHAN
          Give me a goddamn break.

          98.

          CONTINUED:

          TELLER
          Sir, there's no need for profanity.

          JONATHAN
          (loses it)
          Oh no? In the last few days I've seen a
          woman I thought might be dead turn up
          alive and a woman I assumed was alive turn
          up dead, both at the hands of a guy about
          whom everything I know is apparently a
          lie. I've had my building set on fire, my
          neighbor nearly killed, and my apartment
          ransacked. So please forgive my language,
          but it's been one fuck of a week.
          The stunned Teller stares back at him slack-jawed.

          JONATHAN
          Look, I know I'm just another face on this
          side of the glass, I get that. But I'm
          begging you, as one human being to
          another, please let me into your life just
          long enough to help me out here. Please.
          The Teller stares back at him a beat - and nods.
          She starts quickly typing into her monitor, finally looks up.

          TELLER
          I'm showing that card as having been sent
          out four days ago. It definitely went out.
          We even heeded the change of address
          request.

          JONATHAN
          Well, like I                                                    -- wait, what request?

          TELLER
          Apparently you informed the bank of an
          address change?
          She swivels her monitor so he can see.

          TELLER
          Mr. Jonathan Messer,                                            140                      E.   91st Street -

                                                                                              finally halts on one: "140             E.   91st."

          We recognize the DOORMAN in the midst of fielding a complaint
          by an ELDERLY TENANT with a yappy dog. Jonathan hurries to
          the elevators, unnoticed.

          INT.                                                            140   E.            91ST -- HALLWAY

          Jonathan emerges from an elevator. The last door on the left.
          Jonathan tries the doorknob. It's locked. Jonathan checks
          under the mat. Sure enough, there's a key.

          INT. THE APARTMENT

          Utterly bare. Empty walls, expensive views, polished wood
          floors. Jonathan takes a wary step inside, leaning to peer
          around the corners.
          He paces cautiously through the living room. The dining area.
          The glistening chrome and granite kitchen.

          THE BEDROOM
          A room as empty as the others - with the exception of a small
          pile of envelopes beneath a window in a far corner. Jonathan
          slowly nears...to find it's a stack of mail. He picks up an
          envelope -- O.S. the CREAK of a door hinge.
          Jonathan whips around -- no one behind him. He steps out of
          the room to investigate.
          We remain alone in the empty room an excruciating beat...
          .until Jonathan finally steps back in, only slightly at
          ease. He returns to the stack of mail, picks up an envelope.
          He reads: "Mr. Jonathan Messer 140 E.                           91    St..."
          Eyes wide, he hurriedly flips through the rest of the mail -
          all addressed to him at this address.
          Jonathan still staring at this mail in disbelief, when he
          finds at the bottom of the stack: another PHOTOGRAPH. It's of
          "S" standing fearfully on the subwa latform across the
          track from Jonathan. And suddenly Jonathan is gripped with
          fear, unaware of a blurred, nearing intruder...

          WYATT
          Long time no see.

          CONTINUED:
          Jonathan spins round, Wyatt's standing there with a gun. It's
          pointing directly at Jonathan.

          WYATT
          I have some instructions. Follow them and
          I might let her live.

          JONATHAN
          Where is she?

          WYATT
          This should've been simpler. I frame you,
          you panic...

          JONATHAN
          Where is she?!
          A terrifying silence - Jonathan erupts:

          JONATHAN
          Goddamn it tell me what you did to--

          WYATT
          Press pause on the questions and listen.
          The brokerage firm you're auditing is
          Clute Nichols. As a standard part of that
          audit you're temporarily privy to all
          client accounts as well as access codes
          required for transactions. At                                   11                              p.m.
          tonight you're going to skim from those
          accounts a total of                                             $200 million and
          transfer that money to an account I've
          established overseas.

          JONATHAN
          I can't                                                         - I have no idea how to even-

          WYATT
          I know you don't. But I do. Your passport.
          (brandishes the gun)
          Now, please.
          Jonathan takes it out and tosses it to him. Wyatt catches it.
          And hands Jonathan an ENVELOPE.

          WYATT
          It's all in there.                                              11                              pm tonight. Their

          JONATHAN
          It won't work - they screen for stuff like
          this. It'll be discovered eventually.

          This account overseas                                   - it's in my name,
          isn't it?
          A moment of tense silence.
          Jonathan just stares back hard a quiet beat; then:

          JONATHAN
          Why'd you pick me?
          Wyatt raises a brow, vaguely amused the question.

          WYATT
          You answered the ad, Jonathan.
          (off Jonathan's confusion)
          "Feeling all alone out there? Have a great
          job, fine personality and good looks to
          match, but no time to.meet that special
          someone? Help is just a phone call away -"

          JONATHAN
          The ad - in Money magazine...

          WYATT

          (GRINS)
          Told you to block that Caller ID. Of
          course I had to scope out a whole lot of
          losers before I hit the jackpot. After
          all, there only so many Jonathan Messers
          out there.

          (BEAT)
          If you screw with me, well - you saw what
          I did to that Blonde? That's kindness
          compared to what I'll do to your little
          .girlfriend. You won't even recognize her
          when I'm through.

          JONATHAN
          Why should I believe you? Everything you
          told me was lies.

          WYATT
          Not lies, Jonathan. Foreplay. And now...
          now you're fucked.
          He grins his 'charming' grin and starts for the door.

          CONTINUED:

          WYATT
          Remember: be smart. I'll be watching you.
          And... feel free to take a shower, looks
          like you could do with one.
          The front door slams. Jonathan just stands there, staring
          shell-shocked at the envelope.

          EXT. STREET - MINUTES LATER

          Jonathan comes out the building putting the envelope in his
          suit pocket.
          As he crosses the street a CAR HORN BLARES - WHIP AROUND to
          find a car barrelling at us. Jonathan dives out of the way an
          instant before the car would have hit him.
          Face first in the gutter, scraped and gasping, Jonathan peers
          up to see Wyatt's BLACK BMW speeding away.

          CUT TO:

          INT. WORTH & BERMAN - AN OFFICE - LATE DAY

          A stiff guy in his late-30s is working in his office when an
          ASSISTANT enters.

          ASSISTANT
          Mr. Peterson, one of the audit managers is
          here to see you. Jonathan Messer?

          PETERSON

          (PUZZLED)
          Really? Well - okay, bring him back.
          We follow the assistant out the door, read the name
          stencilled on the glass "CHET PETERSON, SENIOR MANAGER."

          INT. WORTH & BERMAN - LOBBY

          Through a set of frosted glass doors we see Peterson's
          Assistant approach a RECEPTIONIST, who gestures across the
          lobby. The Assistant approaches the sofas, where Jonathan is
          seated. She addresses him. He rises.

          INT. WORTH & BERMAN - PETERSON'S OFFICE

          Chet Peterson looks up as his door is opened -

          PETERSON
          Jonathan, good to see you again!

          - reverse angle to find a YOUNG MAN we've never seen before.

          YOUNG MAN
          Actually, I was just looking for Fred
          Whipple's office?

          PETERSON

          (AWKWARDLY)
          Next door down.
          The Young Man ducks out, and now Peterson sees his Assistant
          approaching, Jonathan a few paces behind her, adjusting his
          glasses. Peterson reloads his greeting:

          PETERSON
          Jonathan, good to see you again!

          INT. PETERSON'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

          Close on Chet Peterson, gravely peering across his desk.

          PETERSON
          Well, I have to say, your resignation
          comes as something of a surprise. Most of
          our auditors seem to like the freedom the
          position affords.

          (CONCERNED)
          You'll stay on to finish up at Clute
          Nichols, of course?
          Track around Peterson to see Jonathan seated across from him,
          lifting his head to reply - and doing so revealing it's

          "
          Wyatt," wearing one of Jonathan's suits, hair colored and
          styled like Jonathan's, even sporting identical eyeglasses.
          He offers an awkward half-smile, just as Jonathan would.

          WYATT
          Absolutely.

          PETERSON
          So do you have any plans?

          WYATT
          Yes. I'm going to travel. I want to see
          the world.
          Peterson nods benignly.

          A SERIES OF QUICK DISSOLVES/ STOP-MOTION PHOTOGRAPHY:
          Jonathan sitting in the conference room of Clute Nichols,
          lettered-boxed by the glass wall through which he watches
          employees pass in fewer and fewer numbers. Throughout this,
          Jonathan's blank stare of harrowed tension never changes.

          LAST DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - NIGHT

          Abeautiful shot of the cityscape - accompanied by the sound
          of fingers clacking on keys...

          INT. CLUTE NICHOLS - CONFERENCE ROOM

          Jonathan seated at the far end of the empty table, typing on
          his laptop. Beside him is the envelope Wyatt gave him, and
          its sheet of paper on which instructions are typed.
          Jonathan peers at the laptop clock. It reads                            10:58   PM.
          His eyes travel in a tense triangle from instructions, to
          laptop screen, to glass wall - fingers typing all the while.
          He finally reaches a prompt: BIENVENUE. POUR ANGLAIS, CBOISEZ P2.
          We glimpse a small. logo with a SWISS FLAG.
          Jonathan presses F2. Reads some more, types some more.
          Finally we read: ENTER SUB-ACCOUNT NUMBER.
          Jonathan enters more per Wyatt's typed instructions. Reads.

          ENTER DESIGNATED ACCOUNT NUMBER:
          Jonathan copies the numbers in from the instructions. Waits.

          ENTER SENDER'S 8 DIGIT ACCESS CODE. REQUIRED TO COMPLETE TRANSACTION.
          His eyes travel to a page atop a Clute Nichols file. We can
          glimpse an 8 digit code circled in pencil. Jonathan stares at
          the cursor.on the laptop screen, the icon blinking
          petulantly. He's about to type...
          And then he halts. His eyes drifting to HIS CELL PHONE,
          resting in its charger.
          TIGHTER ON JONATHAN. His eyes fixed on the cell phone, an
          idea forming in his mind --
          RING!! of the cell phone suddenly jars us. RING... Jonathan
          hesitates, then picks up.

          WYATT (O.S.)
          What's taking you?

          CONTINUED:
          Jonathan says nothing. We can hear Wyatt getting tenser:

          WYATT (O.S.)
          I said what's taking you?

          JONATHAN
          I wondered if you were monitoring this.

          WYATT (O.S.)
          Don't worry about what I'm doing. Just
          finish the transaction. Now.

          JONATHAN
          Not until I see her.
          (off Wyatt's silence)
          The transfer's impossible without an
          access code. And there's no way I'm
          entering it until I'm sure that she's
          safe. So you tell me. How do we do that?
          Wyatt still remains unnervingly silent. We tighten on
          Jonathan, holding his breath, any plan he's concocting
          clearly hinging on this...

          WYATT (0..S.)
          (low, frustrated)
          You have a wireless connection?
          Jonathan lets out a brief exhalation.

          SAME - MOMENTS LATER
          Jonathan snaps his laptop lid shut, packs it in his gym bag,
          in which we glimpse the photo he's kept with him of "S"
          smiling up at him.
          He then turns to his cell phone once more. He picks it up,
          scrolls the menu, punches a number.

          RING... RING... RING... RING-

          EXT. THE PLAZA HOTEL - ROOFTOP - LATE NIGHT

          An elaborate and intensely packed WEDDING PARTY is being held
          up here beneath the glow of heat lamps, the music and crowd
          noise unspeakably loud. We travel through the din, past
          hundreds of well-heeled partiers, mainly young and wealthy.

          EXT. PLAZA HOTEL - LATE NIGHT

          The party noise is even slightly audible                        30   stories below,
          where we find Jonathan carrying his bag as he enters...

          INT. THE PLAZA HOTEL - LOBBY

          Jonathan surveys the busy lobby. GUESTS mulling. STAFF
          bustling. And, of course, the "ELOISE" PORTRAIT.

          WYATT (O.S.)'
          May I ask you a personal question?
          Jonathan spins around, stares frostily into Wyatt's magnetic
          smile. With Wyatt's new look, they could be brothers.
          Except Wyatt looks clean and crisp, Jonathan dishevelled and
          tense. Wyatt eyes the bag in Jonathan's hand.

          JONATHAN
          Where is she?

          WYATT
          In one of the rooms. Safe.
          (a thin smile)
          I got us a table.

          INT. LOBBY BAR - MOMENTS LATER

          A WAITRESS delivers a pair of drinks to where Jonathan and
          Wyatt are seated.

          WAITRESS
          Two Macallan 25 year. Enjoy.
          The Waitress leaves. Wyatt raises his glass.

          WYATT
          To friendship.
          Jonathan just stares back at Wyatt.

          JONATHAN
          Bansky's dead, isn't he?

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          107.

          CONTINUED:

          WYATT
          He was dead when I met him. Just like you.
          The rest was a mere formality.
          (re: the laptop)
          Of course he didn't have your bargaining
          chip. Speaking of which...

          JONATHAN
          Not until I see her. She's the only reason
          I'm here and not at the police.

          WYATT
          I told you, she's in a room. Alive.

          JONATHAN
          Give me the key then.
          Wyatt considers this, then takes out an electronic key card
          and slides it across the table. Of course there's nothing on
          the key card to indicate a room number.

          WYATT
          As soon as you're done, I'll tell you the
          room number.

          JONATHAN
          Not good enough.
          Wyatt reaches for the key card; as he does we glimpse a
          handgun concealed by his suit.

          JONATHAN
          You won't let her live. You killed all the
          others, you'll have to kill us too.

          WYATT
          Hey, I like you, okay? You'll be fine.

          JONATHAN
          (scoffs, repulsed)
          You like me.

          WYATT
          I do, Jonathan. In my way. After all,
          you're my creation. I'm the one who gave
          you life.

          JONATHAN
          Don't you get it? It was her, not you!
          She's the one. She gave me life! You can
          steal my identity, but not what's here.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          108.

          CONTINUED:
          He puts his hand on his heart. Wyatt is startled by
          Jonathan's passionate outburst.

          WYATT
          Yeah, well, I'm weeping big wet ones for
          you both. Now, let's get on with it.

          (BEAT)
          I don't have all night, Jonathan.
          Jonathan reluctantly nods his assent. Wyatt lets go of the
          key card. Jonathan opens his bag...

          SAME - MOMENTS LATER
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN'S LAPTOP SCREEN as it defuzzes from sleep.
          The screen as it was, cursor blinking by the request for an
          access code.
          Wyatt watches intensely as Jonathan starts to type -- then
          pauses, looking confused.
          Jonathan quickly reaches around. to the back of his laptop,
          feels an empty jack - and suddenly turns pale.

          WYATT
          What is it?

          JONATHAN
          My wireless modem - I must have left it in
          the conference room. I can't get back
          online.
          Wyatt glares at Jonathan, seething.

          WYATT
          You stupid fuck.

          JONATHAN
          I can go back there and-

          WYATT
          No.
          (thinks, then abruptly)
          Get up.

          INT. PLAZA HOTEL - LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

          Wyatt and Jonathan crossing the lobby; they arrive at
          HOTEL GUEST BUSINESS CENTER, partitioned by a wall of glass.
          Jonathan and Wyatt stand on the other side, peering in.

          They don't let you use your own computer.
          Wyatt takes out a hundred dollar bill, gives it to Jonathan.

          WYATT
          They will now.
          Jonathan takes the hundred, and heads into

          INT. HOTEL.BUSINESS CENTER

          Empty at this hour, with the exception of a sleepy-looking
          EMPLOYEE. As Jonathan steps toward the desk, he takes out
          the hotel key card, his eyes travelling up to a clock
          overhead:                                                       11:29.

          Wyatt eyes Jonathan on the other side of the glass.
          INSERT WYATT'S POV: Jonathan explaining himself to the clerk.
          Satisfied, Wyatt finds a comfortable chair with a direct view
          of the business center's glass.
          Across the lobby, an attractive AUBURN-HAIRED WOMAN in
          business attire glances over at him.

          INT. BUSINESS CENTER

          Jonathan is subtly slipping the                                 $100                            bill to the Employee.

          EMPLOYEE
          You forgot your. own room number?

          JONATHAN
          I just checked in and it's been a hectic
          day. Look at me!
          The Employee looks uneasy - something about the ill-concealed
          tension in Jonathan's eyes.

          EMPLOYEE
          You could just ask at the front desk. I'm
          sure they can-

          JONATHAN
          I really don't have time, okay?
          Jonathan presses the bill into the Employee's palm, peers up
          at the clock again: the big hand clicks over to 11:30.

          (CONTINUED)

          BACK TO WYATT IN THE LOBBY
          Still eyeing Jonathan. He sees the Employee hesitate, then
          accept the money.
          Wyatt looks relieved -- when his view is abruptly blocked by
          the Auburn-Haired Woman.

          AUBURN HAIR
          Pardon me, but may I ask you something -
          personal?
          Wyatt quickly looks up at her, momentarily confused.

          AUBURN HAIR
          Are you waiting for me?

          BACK TO JONATHAN IN BUSINESS CENTER
          The Employee finishes swiping his card through a scanner.

          EMPLOYEE
          Room 907.

          BACK TO WYATT IN THE LOBBY
          His view of Jonathan still obscured by Auburn Hair.

          WYATT
          What the hell are you --
          And then he sees Auburn Hair glance unsurely at the Eloise
          portrait, then at her cell phone's clock -- and now realizes:

          WYATT
          Motherfucker!
          He jumps up, shoves Auburn Hair aside - eyes darting to the
          Business Center to find Jonathan no longer behind the glass,
          just his laptop resting on the counter where he'd been
          standing.

          INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR

          Jonathan rushes into an elevator car just as it's about to
          close. He turns to find a YOUNG FAMILY riding up with him.
          They've pressed floor 6. He presses floor                       9.

          concealed gun.

          Ding as the elevator doors open and the family step out.
          Jonathan is left alone, impatiently waiting for the doors to
          close -
          - when his eyes land on something in the hallway: the fire
          alarm. He suddenly reaches out to stop the elevator door just
          as it's about to close.

          an emergency exit stairwell.

          INT. PLAZA HOTEL - LOBBY

          Wyatt is just about to step onto an elevator, when a crowd of
          wedding guests also start to pile in. Furious, he abandons
          the elevators for the nearest stairs.

          Only the party 30 stories above remains oblivious: music

          Wyatt is bounding up the stairs, rounding the Fifth Floor -
          - when he hears the door overhead bang open, and like a tidal
          wave a flood of guests fill the stairwell.
          Wyatt presses against the crush of bodies, pushing his way up

                                                                          Close on a door marked by a placard:   9th floor -- as it's
          banged open by Jonathan's shoulder.
          The sound of the fire alarm is fainter up here as Jonathan
          races down the carpeted corridor, room numbers blurring past
          in sporadic fits                                                -                                      925...921...           918...   913...   910...
          Jonathan finally lurches to a halt before room 907.
          He takes out his key card, about to slide it in the slot --
          when a hand grabs his forearm! He spins in panic to --
          - a CLEANING WOMAN. She says something.in Vietnamese,
          indicating the ringing alarms.

          JONATHAN
          Fire, I know - I'll be out in a minute.
          The scared Cleaning Woman nods and hurries off as Jonathan
          quickly slides the key in the slot. The light blinks green.
          He jerks the door handle and throws open the door to find -

          INT. ROOM 907

          - nothing. The room is freshly made up, no sign of life other
          than A PORNO FILM BLARING from the TV set on Pay-Per-View.
          Jonathan's heart is pounding - where is she? He searches
          every corner, the bathroom, the closets. Everywhere.
          The sterile room taunts him - the uncreased bedspread, the
          neat arrangement of the complimentary stationary, the
          incessant moaning coming from the porn on the TV set --
          Jonathan suddenly erupts, grips the TV and shoves it off its
          ledge. It hits the floor with a crash, and sudden silence.
          Jonathan rubs his brow, heaving in desperation -- when his
          eyes land on the sleek, dark piece on which the TV was

          CONTINUED:
          resting; it's a dense, rectangular block - only when Jonathan
          taps it, he realizes: it's hollow.
          He immediately seizes it, yanks it from the wall...
          And there she is, lying face down in a lifeless heap: "S".
          Panicked, Jonathan rushes to her, turns her over. She looks
          semi-conscious, hands and mouth duct-taped. Jonathan
          hurriedly removes the tape, gently shakes her, terrified by
          how lifeless she appears -
          - when her eyes widen, focus on his face. Before he can say
          anything, she throws her arms around his neck, presses her
          face to his chest.

          âS.,
          (whispers gratefully)
          You're alive.
          He's struck by these words, and nods, holding her face in his
          hands as he kisses her urgently and gratefully.

          JONATHAN
          What do you say we stick together from now
          on?

          JA S"
          I'd like that.

          INT. EMERGENCY STAIRWELL

          A rush of guests hurriedly descending the staircase, a
          seemingly endless stream of densely packed faces.
          Close on Wyatt jostled within the flow of the wealthy guests -
          as he's the only one heading up. He passes the 6th floor...

          INT.                                                             9TH FLOOR

          Jonathan and "S" hurrying down the hall - Jonathan torn
          between a choice of two stairwells. His eyes dart from one to
          another                                                          - he finally gambles on the one to the right.

          INT. EMERGENCY STAIRWELL

          Wyatt forcing his way upstream with menacing determination;
          his gaze is wilder, more and more irritated by the descending
          mob of successful, well-dressed guests he's pushing against --
          - when he halts, peering up through the railings' lozenge-
          shaped opening, past a collection of hands and profiles...
          .to Jonathan and "S" some three stories above.

          CONTINUED:
          TIGHT ON WYATT. As yet unnoticed by Jonathan, he remains
          halted on a stair, bodies squeezing past him.
          TIGHTER ON HIS EYES. That predatory gleam.
          EVEN TIGHTER ON HIS GUN, tucked carefully at his side.
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN AND "S" three stories above, starting to
          descend -- when Jonathan notices the hint of disruption in the
          flow of bodies below.
          Immediately wary, he leans over the railing, but can't get a
          good look. He grips the railing, leans further over... and
          his eyes find Wyatt's staring right back up at him --

          JONATHAN
          He's down there! I saw him -

          11 SIP
          Oh God -

          JONATHAN
          Up - we've got to go up!
          Clutching her arm, Jonathan and "S" turn back up, against the
          flow of traffic. Stories above, less and less people are
          evacuating.
          ANGLE ON WYATT as he presses upward, his steely gaze even
          more rapacious.
          The crowd is thinning as Jonathan and "S" race upward as
          well.
          INSERT JONATHAN'S POV: a shaky, dizzying blur as they race
          higher and higher...
          INSERT WYATT'S POV: from below but gaining on them, Jonathan
          and "S". appearing and disappearing with each twist and turn
          of the staircase...
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN AND "S", desperately racing upwards...
          CLOSE ON WYATT bounding the stairs, footsteps echoing, the
          staircase now empty and quiet, save for the footfall of
          Jonathan and "S"                                                 - no more than three floors above Wyatt
          now...
          Wyatt slows his pace, leans into the railing, takes aim...
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN AND "S" still hurrying up - when a shot
          rings out, a jolting echo clanging through the stairwell, the

          bullet missing them by inches. "S" screams, Jonathan tugs her
          with him                                                         -
          - when a second shot rings out, the bullet punching a dent
          into the underside of the stairs just overhead.
          ON WYATT, realizing he needs a cleaner shot, taking the
          stairs even harder in pursuit, all merciless intensity.

          EXT. HOTEL ROOFTOP - MOMENTS LATER

          The party is still at full throttle. Apparently no one has
          yet told them of the alarms.
          CLOSE ON A STAIRWELL DOOR MARKED "EMERGENCY EXIT" as it
          suddenly bangs open and Jonathan and "S" spill out.
          They pause a moment - thrown by the sight of all the wealthy,
          beautiful faces, laughing, dancing.

          JONATHAN
          Come on!
          She grabs his hand, and they waste no time disappearing into
          the mass of bodies.
          They keep moving. Shoulder to shoulder within the swell of
          partiers, they fit right in - instantly anonymous                - though
          not as smartly attired.
          BACK TO THE STAIRWELL DOOR as Wyatt enters the party,
          scanning the dense crowd, all senses alert.
          INSERT WYATT'S POV: just a mass of successful, attractive,
          partying young men and women. There's no way to pick Jonathan
          and "S" out.
          Wyatt's smirk fades to an icy glare as he stalks the
          periphery.
          WITHIN THE CROWD "S" clutches Jonathan's hand, their heads
          ducked low as they press forward...
          CLOSE ON WYATT, frustration gnashing at him as he quickens
          his pace, the idiotic enthusiasm of the crowd enraging him,
          sweat beading on his face                                        --
          -- when suddenly the music stops. Wyatt frowns., eyes darting.
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN AND "S" glancing around in confusion -

          SECURITY                                                         (DISTANT U.S.)
          Ladies and Gentlemen, we need everyone to
          evacuate the hotel. This way please.

          The crowd noise resumes, as the throngs begrudgingly start
          for the exits.
          ON JONATHAN AND "S," doing their best to stay concealed
          within the exiting crowd.
          Angle on Wyatt pushing his way through the crush, shoving
          people aside, trying to find them -
          - when he suddenly stops. He has an idea. He takes out his
          cell phone.
          BACK TO JONATHAN AND "5" within the crowd -
          - when Jonathan's cell phone RINGS.
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN as his eyes widen in panic.
          RING... He quickly fumbles for it, tries to turn it off        -
          - but it's too late... WHIP ACROSS THE CROWD to Wyatt,
          grinning wider. He's spotted them. In an instant he is bee-
          lining through the packed suits.
          WIDE SHOT OF THE ROOFTOP as the throngs are clearing out.
          Jonathan grabs "S" as they duck, racing across the dark,
          rooftop, looking for a place to hide.
          They take cover behind a large venting duct near the ledge -
          gasping to catch their breath... Stepping back, "S's" foot
          clinks against something: a stray iron railing post.
          She reaches. down for it, starts to lift it -
          - when Wyatt's hand darts in and grasps the other end.
          She looks up in terror - when Wyatt punches her violently,
          knocking her to the ground.
          Jonathan rushes to her - only to be blocked by Wyatt,
          gripping the iron rod tight.

          WYATT
          Nice try back there, Jonathan. Looks like
          you picked up a thing or two from me.
          Jonathan tries to strike him - when with a lightning quick
          movement Wyatt whips the iron rod through the air, cracking
          Jonathan across the face.

          Jonathan crumples, his glasses knocked to the ground.
          CLOSE ON WYATT as he grips the iron rod like a tennis
          racquet, steps into position                                   -
          - and brings the rod down on Jonathan with ruthless tennis
          strokes: Backhand! Bam! Forehand! Bam! Slice! Bam!
          Jonathan can barely peer up, bloody and beaten. He hears
          Wyatt drop the iron rod...


          JONATHAN'S POV: Wyatt's blurry figure hovering above suddenly
          swoops in on us  
                                              -
          - as Wyatt grabs Jonathan by the throat, hefts him up and
          yanks him back to the roof's concrete ledge. Jonathan fights
          to struggle free - when Wyatt jams the gun under his chin.
          Jonathan freezes.

          JONATHAN

          (GASPING)
          They'll... catch... you...

          WYATT
          Me? No - no, I'm just a face in the crowd.
          I'm a tourist, just passing through.
          JONATHAN'S POV: Wyatt's face presses closer, now almost in
          focus as he presses Jonathan's torso back over the ledge -

          WYATT
          As for you, you had your fun...
          Wyatt presses closer, crushing Jonathan's back to the edge.

          WYATT
          Now we're going to go back down...
          INSERT JONATHAN'S HAND reaching into Wyatt's pocket, his
          fingers fumbling for the cell phone                            (Jonathan's old phone).

          WYATT
          We're going to get that laptop...
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN'S FINGERS blindly prodding - he has the
          phone now - his fingers feel for the antenna...

          WYATT
          And we're going to finish this, once and
          for -
          - when with all his strength Jonathan jams the cell phone up
          into Wyatt's eye, the antenna punching into the retina.

          Jonathan -
          - when with every ounce of strength Jonathan charges, Wyatt's
          shot missing him as Jonathan slams him into the ledge wall,
          seizing the momentum to turn himself -

          - to find she's right beside him, grateful tears in her eye.
          She leans into him, and he holds her tight, the two of them
          embraced on the precipice as we

          Strobed reds and blues of police and fire.trucks amassed,
          trying to control the throngs of guests and pedestrians
          blocking our view of the body they're all gawking at.
          We travel through the confusion until we find JONATHAN AND
          "S" sitting side by side on the sidewalk curb, each propped
          against the other.
          The 'shock of it all is beginning to fade. He reaches into his
          pocket and hands her 'Duck on Bike'.

          JONATHAN
          Yours, I believe.

          Thanks, Frank.
          She winds the toy up. They watch it make it's funny way down
          the sidewalk.

          and whispers the answer in his ear. Jonathan gazes at her a
          moment - whatever her name is, it must be perfect.

          JONATHAN
          So what now?
          She smiles up at him.

          S
          Well... are you free tonight?
          On Jonathan: treasuring these moments. He is truly free --
          perhaps for the first time in his life.

          JONATHAN
          Yes. I'm free.
          They gaze at each other.
          We leave Jonathan and "S" to their privacy, pulling back as
          they continue talking, continuing away until we're

          THROUGH A WINDOW AND INSIDE THE HOTEL ITSELF
          the window itself now a frame, letter-boxing the scene,
          people passing like fish in their tank... except for Jonathan
          and S, seated center-frame, two small figures side by side,
          face to face, talking intimately as we.
