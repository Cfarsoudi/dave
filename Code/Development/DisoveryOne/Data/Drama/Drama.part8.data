               FADE IN

               RAIN

               Falls from low grey clouds. Down below we see...

               THE RIVER

               Muddy, slow and powerful, overflowing its banks. In the near 
               distance is...

               THE RESERVOIR

               Filled to the maximum, water thundering out of two open gates. 
               We close in on...

               THE DAM

               There's a Dam Control Office in the middle of the dam. We 
               MOVE OFF the reservoir and head out over...

               THE TOWN OF HUNTINGBURG

               We see "NO FEAR" spelled out in stones on one man's roof. We 
               go down and into...

               EXT. STREETS OF HUNTINGBURG - DUSK

               Storefronts are sandbagged and closed. A sign on one store 
               reads: GONE FISHING. A sign on another: HEY LOOTER. NOTHING 
               OF VALUE HERE. TRY NEXT DOOR. And on the next store: HE'S 
               LYING.

               A CHURCH

               Beautiful, old, ringed with a five-foot-high wall of sandbags. 
               The floodwater is up to the first level of sandbags.

               CARS AND PICKUP TRUCKS

               Loaded down, are heading out of town on streets covered in 
               the first water of the flood.

               A STATUE

               On an island in the middle of the street. It's Civil War-
               era, of a general on a horse, sword held high. The floodwater 
               is over the curb, lapping at the base of statue's pedestal. 
               Near the statue stands...

               THE SHERIFF

               50s, with soft edges and friendly eyes. He's talking into 
               his radio mike.

                                     SHERIFF
                         So, are we all going to die?

               EXT. RESERVOIR DAM

               HANK, the dam control officer, is on the radio with the 
               Sheriff.

                                     HANK
                         Not right now. But I'm gonna have to 
                         let out a little more.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               WAYNE and PHIL, two deputies, 30s, are near the Sheriff, 
               shoring up a sandbag wall that has partially collapsed.

                                     PHIL
                         I think my best was when I turned 
                         twelve. My Dad set up a treasure 
                         hunt. It was really cool.
                              (off Wayne's disdainful 
                              look)
                         Well, it was.

               Wayne shrugs a "whatever" and pulls a sandbag up out of the 
               water. There's unpleasant-looking muck all over his arms. He 
               drops the sandbag back into the water and shakes off the 
               crud with disgust.

                                     WAYNE
                         This blows.

                                     PHIL
                         My most awful birthday was sweet 
                         sixteen. I had mono. How about you? 
                         What was your worst?

                                     WAYNE
                         You kidding? You think I could've 
                         possibly had a birthday worse than 
                         this? What kind of loser do you think 
                         I am?

                                     SHERIFF (O.S.)
                         Don't answer that, Phil.

               The Sheriff walks over.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Hank says he's gonna open another 
                         gate. We're gonna get another rise.

               They turn at the sound of honking. The MAYOR drives up.

                                     MAYOR
                         Gentlemen. Hey -- happy birthday, 
                         Wayne.

               Wayne nods. Phil stiffens. They do not like this guy.

                                     MAYOR
                              (to the Sheriff)
                         Mike, I gotta say, what you're 
                         doing... I don't know if I'd be here, 
                         considering.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (good-natured)
                         Well, you would be if you wanted to 
                         get the last couple of paychecks 
                         some bastard owed you.

                                     MAYOR
                              (grins, then:)
                         I just want you to know I think the 
                         people 'round here made a big mistake.

               Phil grumbles to himself.

                                     PHIL
                         "The people"? You're the one who 
                         screwed him.

                                     MAYOR
                         Sorry, Phil?

                                     PHIL
                              (blushes)
                         I, uh --

                                     SHERIFF
                              (to Mayor, saving 
                              Phil)
                         You know, Bob, as much as I'd love 
                         to stand here all day talking about 
                         how great I am, if you don't get 
                         moving I'm gonna have to haul your 
                         sorry ass off to jail.

                                     MAYOR
                              (laughs)
                         Okay, okay, I'm going. Keep up the 
                         good work, boys. It's appreciated.

               The Mayor rolls up his window and heads off.

                                     WAYNE
                         Whaddya say we go torch the fucker's 
                         house and blame it on looters. Or 
                         how about we put a dead cow in his 
                         living room. He comes back after 
                         it's been in the water a couple of 
                         days. Hello!

                                     SHERIFF
                              (shakes head)
                         You wanna know how to get the best 
                         revenge on the Mayor and his boys? 
                         You do exactly what we're doing. You 
                         protect the town. You protect it 
                         better than they would. Better than 
                         they ever could.

                                     WAYNE
                              (thinks, shrugs)
                         I think the dead cow's better.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (ignores Wayne)
                         Any looter that comes in here is in 
                         for a big surprise, cause as long as 
                         I'm still wearing this pointy thing...
                              (indicates badge)
                         ...nobody's taking anything from 
                         this town.

               INT. BANK VAULT

               Nervous assistant bank manager WELLMAN is hurriedly tossing 
               stacks of money into two canvas bags.

               A MAN'S SHADOW

               Washes up on Wellman.

                                     CHARLIE (O.S.)
                         Do you think you could go a little 
                         faster, pal?

                                     WELLMAN
                         I -- I'm going as fast as I can.

               SECOND SHADOW COMES UP

                                     TOM (O.S.)
                         Well, it's not fast enough.

               Wellman is about to speak, then sees something, gulps.

               A SHOTGUN

               Is held by one of the men, pointed at the floor.

               WELLMAN

               Sweeps the money off the shelves and into the bags.

                                     SECOND MAN (O.S.)
                         That it?

                                     WELLMAN
                         Yes. We don't keep any of our --

               THE TWO MEN

               Ignore Wellman, grab the canvas bags and stride off.

               EXT. BANK - DAY

               CLOSE ON the lower half of the front doors as they fly open. 
               Out come TWO MEN in long dark raincoats.

               WELLMAN

               Runs up, stopping in the open door.

                                     WELLMAN
                         Hey, wait!

               VERY CLOSE ON THE TWO MEN

               As they slowly turn to face Wellman. We just see their faces, 
               shielded from the rain by hat brims. Meet...

               TOM AND CHARLIE

               Tom, 30, handsome, with an easy smile. Charlie, 50, with a 
               tough, red face.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Excuse me?

               WELLMAN

               Looks nervous for a second, then holds up a clipboard.

                                     WELLMAN
                         You forgot to sign.

               TOM AND CHARLIE

               We see, for the first time, by their hats and uniforms, that 
               they are armored car drivers. There's an armored car parked 
               at the curb, on the other side of a low wall of sandbags.

               Charlie sighs, goes back to Wellman and perfunctorily signs 
               the form. Then he and Tom go to the sandbag wall. Tom holds 
               both bags in one hand and the shotgun in the other. Charlie 
               doesn't want to get wet.

               He steps from the sandbag wall onto the rear bumper of the 
               truck, then keys open the doors.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Okay.

               Charlie reaches out for the money bags. Tom jumps off the 
               sandbag wall and lands in the water, splashing Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         For Christsakes!

                                     TOM
                         It's a flood, Charlie. You're gonna 
                         get wet.

               Charlie takes the bags, tosses them in then shuts the back. 
               He moves toward the front, still trying to keep out of the 
               water. Tom splashes him some more.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hey! Do you know what kind of crap 
                         is in that water?

                                     TOM
                              (of course he knows)
                         Well, yeah.

               Tom kicks some more water at Charlie. Charlie gives Tom a 
               withering look and climbs in the truck.

               INT. ARMORED TRUCK

               Charlie gets into the driver's seat; Tom climbs into the 
               shotgun seat. They shut and bolt the doors. Charlie gets on 
               the radio.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Dispatch, this is 31.

                                     DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                         Go ahead, 31.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We're leaving Huntingburg. We'll be 
                         back in an hour.

                                     DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                         Ten-four. Get out of there.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We're gone. Over and out.

               Charlie hangs up the radio. He starts writing on a clipboard. 
               Silence for a few moments, and then Charlie notices Tom 
               staring at him.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What?

                                     TOM
                         Your ear.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What about my ear?

                                     TOM
                         You've got a major hair growth going 
                         on.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Shut up.

                                     TOM
                         I'm serious. You're gonna need 
                         somebody to go in there with a weed 
                         whacker.

               Charlie grabs a donut bag off the seat and tosses it to Tom.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Here.

                                     TOM
                         You're offering me one of your donuts? 
                         I don't know what to say. I'm getting 
                         all misty.

                                     CHARLIE
                         If it'll shut your mouth you can 
                         have the whole bag.

               Charlie starts the truck. Tom thinks about it, then tosses 
               the bag back.

                                     TOM
                         Nah. I start eating donuts and I'll 
                         never get out of this truck.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (disgusted)
                         I love how you think you're better 
                         than this.

                                     TOM
                         Don't get me wrong, Charlie. There's 
                         a lot to like about this job -- and 
                         I don't just mean the dashing 
                         polyester ensemble and the solid 
                         three-figure income.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (angry)
                         You ungrateful shit! I don't believe 
                         you!

                                     TOM
                              (surprised)
                         Charlie, relax! I was kidding!

                                     CHARLIE
                         You don't wanna do this? Fine. Go 
                         back to selling hot construction 
                         machinery. That's a helluva career.

                                     TOM
                         It had better hours.

               Charlie slams the clipboard down on the seat.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You think this is a joke? This is 
                         funny? Jesus Christ! You know how 
                         lucky you are you could get in here? 
                         Thirty years old and all the crap 
                         you pulled and you never got caught?

                                     TOM
                              (angry)
                         That wasn't luck, old man. That was 
                         skill. I was good at it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Oh, yeah, it takes a lot of skill to 
                         fence bulldozers. That's goddamn 
                         genius time.

                                     TOM
                         About as much skill as it takes to 
                         sit in a truck and get fat eating 
                         donuts.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Oh, so that's all I've been doing, 
                         huh? Just wasting my life away.

                                     TOM
                         I didn't say that.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yeah, building a home, raising a 
                         family -- that's just stupid.

                                     TOM
                         I didn't say that!

                                     CHARLIE
                         You know what, Tom? I really don't 
                         give a shit what you said.

               Tom doesn't reply. Charlie puts the truck in gear; starts 
               off. Tom looks at Charlie, shakes his head -- what was that 
               about?

               JIM

               Late 50s, with a creased face and piercing eyes. He's sitting 
               at the bar, drinking coffee. Rain sheets down outside. The 
               BARTENDER watches TV, sound off. Next to Jim at the bar are...

               RAY, KENNY AND MR. MEHLOR

               Ray, 40s, has lank hair, rheumy eyes and a glass of Irish 
               whisky in front of him. Kenny, 20s, long hair, has the energy 
               of a puppy -- unfortunately he has about as much smarts as a 
               puppy. Mr. Mehlor. 40s, looks like -- and was -- a high school 
               teacher.

               ON TV

               Sound off, a MAN is crying about what he has lost in the 
               flood.

                                     RAY
                         "Thus saith the Lord; Behold, waters 
                         shall rise up out of the north and 
                         be an overflowing flood and all the 
                         inhabitants of the land shall howl." 
                         Jeremiah 47:2.

               Ray takes a drink. Kenny leans over to Ray, sotto.

                                     KENNY
                         You're gonna be able to buy a helluva 
                         lot of bibles, huh, Ray? Me? First 
                         thing I'm gonna do is get my brother 
                         a lawyer. Best that money can buy.

               A thought comes to Jim -- an answer to a clue in the crossword -- 
               and he starts filling in words as Ray and Kenny talk.

                                     RAY
                         What's he facing?

                                     KENNY
                         Thirty in.

                                     RAY
                         He cap a cop or something...?

                                     KENNY
                         Security guard. "In the commission..." 
                         All he's got is a piece of shit P.D. 
                         Now I'm gonna be able to afford him 
                         a good lawyer -- a guy with a haircut.

               Jim leans over to Kenny.

                                     JIM
                         'Scuse me a second. Take a look at 
                         thirty-one across.

               Jim slides the newspaper in front of Kenny.

                                     KENNY
                         Shit, Jim. I don't do crossword 
                         puzzles.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         I'll take a look, Jim.

                                     JIM
                         Kenny can read.
                              (to Kenny)
                         Just look at it. You know when you 
                         write down a word and suddenly it 
                         looks all wrong? Maybe it's right, 
                         but it doesn't look right?

               Jim points at the newspaper.

                                     JIM
                         Thirty-one across.

               Kenny shrugs and looks down at the newspaper.

                                     KENNY
                              (mumbles as he reads)
                         Mention money again and...

               His eyes go wide.

               ECU CROSSWORD PUZZLE

               In an uncompleted part of the puzzle, Jim has written a

               YOU.

               JIM AND KENNY

               Kenny looks up at Jim. Jim glances over at the bartender 
               then back at Kenny. Understand?

                                     JIM
                         Did I get it right?

                                     KENNY
                         Yeah, Jim. You got it right.

               INT. ARMORED TRUCK - DUSK

               Charlie and Tom continue to drive in silence. They both sneak 
               looks at each other. Their eyes meet for a second, then they 
               look away. A moment's pause then...

                                     TOM
                         Jerk.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Jack-ass.

               A hint of a smile on both of them. Tom reaches for Charlie.

                                     TOM
                         Give us a kiss. Come on.

               Charlie goes red in the face, pushes Tom away.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Get out of here.

                                     TOM
                              (laughs, beat)
                         You really are a cranky old fart, 
                         you know that?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm sorry.

                                     TOM
                         What was that about? I mean, I'm 
                         just sitting here and all of a sudden 
                         you go postal on me.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I don't know, I... It's just this 
                         weather. I... I want to get back.

                                     TOM
                         You know, I really do appreciate 
                         what you've done for me. This is a 
                         good job.

                         No, it's not. It stinks. It's putting

               EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN - DUSK

               Looking away from town, the HIGH SCHOOL is on the left. On 
               the right is the CEMETERY. Farther on, on the left, is a CAR 
               AND BOAT DEALERSHIP. The road is covered in water.

               THE ARMORED TRUCK

               Goes by the entrance to the high school, water shooting up 
               from the wheels, pushing out in a wide wake.

               INT. TRUCK

               Tom glances ahead and sees that the road is covered in water.

                                     TOM
                         Jesus. Where's the road?

               THEIR POV

               Stretching out ahead of them are reflector bars on the 
               telephone poles, a few feet above the rippling surface of 
               the floodwater.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It's there.
                              (beat)
                         Somewhere. I hope.
                              (beat)
                         Look, Tom, I don't care what it is 
                         you end up doing.

                                     TOM
                         Oh, God, here we go again.

                                     CHARLIE
                         This is the last time, I swear.

               Tom sees something ahead. He doesn't understand at first.

               HIS POV

               The reflector bar on the pole two poles ahead is lower than 
               the others. No reflector bars for a hundred yards, then they 
               resume.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (looks at Tom)
                         I just think, whatever it is you do, 
                         it's time you did some heavy lifting.

               Tom figures out what's going on with the reflector bars.

                                     TOM
                         Stop!

                                     CHARLIE
                         No, you gotta hear this. You're better 
                         than --

                                     TOM
                         Stop the truck! We're going down!

               OUTSIDE THE TRUCK

               The water rises fast up the grille as the truck angles down.

               INSIDE THE TRUCK

                                     CHARLIE
                         Jesus!

               Charlie stands on the brakes.

               THEIR POV

               A wave of water rushes forward from the truck, then comes 
               back and washes over the hood, splashing up on the windshield.

                                     TOM
                         Back up!

               Charlie throws the truck into reverse but gives it too much 
               power. They hear the rear wheels spinning underwater. Charlie 
               eases off, the tires start to catch, they start moving 
               backwards.

               Charlie and Tom exchange a quick look of relief... and then 
               the engine dies. Charlie tries to restart it, but there's 
               nothing.

               OUTSIDE THE TRUCK

               It's stopped on a downgrade -- it's a dip in the road.

               The water is up to the top of the front tires: up to the 
               hubcaps on the rear wheels. The headlights are underwater, 
               spots of yellow glowing. They've stopped next to a lighted 
               sign.

                                 WELCOME TO HUNTINGBURG.

                        HOME OF THE 1987 STATE CHAMPION WARRIORS.

               IN THE TRUCK

                                     CHARLIE
                         Goddammit!

                                     TOM
                         It's a little dip in the road or 
                         something. You can see the reflectors 
                         come up the other side.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (curses to himself)
                         I knew this would happen.
                              (grabs radio mike)

                                     TOM
                         I'll see if there's anyone coming. 
                         Maybe we can get pulled out.

               Tom opens the door. Charlie adjusts the radio frequency 
               selection button; clicks on.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Dispatch, this is 31. 31 calling 
                         dispatch.

                                     DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                              (over radio)
                         31, this is dispatch.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (into radio)
                         Dispatch, we're stuck outside of 
                         Huntingburg. Truck's dead.

                                     DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                         Where are you?

                                     CHARLIE
                         We're on 231, headed for the 
                         Interstate. Right by a sign saying 
                         "Welcome to Huntingburg."

               Tom climbs out and up on top of the truck.

               OUTSIDE THE TRUCK

               Tom stands on top of the truck. In one direction, nothing 
               but blackness. The other way he can see the lights of the 
               town. But there are no cars coming.

               IN THE TRUCK

               Charlie looks over as Tom appears, upside-down, in the 
               doorway.

                                     TOM
                         The town's been evacuated. We won't 
                         get any help from there.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Dispatch can't get anyone out.

                                     TOM
                         They are aware we're carrying a 
                         shitload of money...?

                                     CHARLIE
                         They called the National Guard. 
                         They're gonna be here in about ninety 
                         minutes.

                                     TOM
                         Ninety minutes? Jesus.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (nods; into radio)
                         Dispatch, we're gonna need help a 
                         little sooner than --

               There's a sudden sparking sound and the radio cuts out and 
               interior lights and the headlights go out.

                                     TOM
                         Oh, shit.

               INT. HOUSE - DUSK POV THROUGH WINDOW

               Looking out as the Sheriff's car rolls past on the water-
               covered street. A HAND lets go of a curtain and it swings 
               across the window.

               EXT. STREET - DUSK IN THE SHERIFF'S CAR

               The Sheriff motions Wayne to stop the car, then he grabs the 
               radio mike and clicks it on as a megaphone.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (into mike)
                         Henry, I saw you. Come on out.

               No one comes out of the house.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Henry, I'm not leaving until you 
                         come out.

               A few moments pass and then...

               HENRY AND DOREEN SWERZKY

               Late 70s, step out onto their porch.

                                     DOREEN
                         Jesus H. Christ, Henry, I told you 
                         to stay away from the damn window.

               THE SHERIFF

               Gets out of the car.

                                     SHERIFF
                         What are you still doing here?

                                     HENRY
                         We're just --

                                     DOREEN
                         We're setting traps.

                                     SHERIFF
                         That's illegal, Doreen.

                                     DOREEN
                         You gonna arrest us, Sheriff? Hell, 
                         are you even sheriff anymore, Sheriff? 
                         Didn't you lose an election? I sure 
                         as hell know I didn't vote for you, 
                         and neither did Henry.

                                     HENRY
                         Doreen...

                                     SHERIFF
                         You don't need to set traps.

                                     DOREEN
                         That's what they said in '73. When 
                         we got back, anything the bastards 
                         didn't steal they broke, just for 
                         the hell of it.

                                     SHERIFF
                         That's not happening this time.

                                     DOREEN
                         Damn right it's not.

                                     SHERIFF
                         You can't stay, you know that.

                                     HENRY
                         We're going to my sister's.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Good.

                                     DOREEN
                         Soon as we finish setting the traps.

               The Sheriff wants to say something more, but he's not about 
               to argue with Doreen. He just nods and gets back into the 
               car.

               IN THE CAR

               The Sheriff climbs back in. He and Wayne watch Henry and 
               Doreen go back into the house, Doreen still nagging at Henry.

                                     SHERIFF
                         God'll understand if you have to 
                         drown her in the basement, Henry.

               The Sheriff sighs, nods to Wayne. Wayne puts the car in gear.

               EXT. ARMORED TRUCK - NIGHT

               The water is creeping up the sloping hood of the truck.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We gotta get out of here.

                                     TOM
                         What about the money?

                                     CHARLIE
                         The money's safe; we're not. Water 
                         rose about a foot in the last twenty 
                         minutes. The National Guard isn't 
                         going to be here for another hour. 
                         You do the math.

               Tom shrugs -- Charlie's right. They're about to get out when 
               light washes up on them. They look out to see...

               THE HEADLIGHTS OF A GMC SUBURBAN

               Approaching on the other side of the dip, a quarter-mile 
               away.

               CHARLIE AND TOM

               Look at each other then get out of the truck.

               THE SUBURBAN

               Stops on the far side of the dip -- a hundred yards away. 
               The headlights shine across the water. Doors open and MEN 
               get out.

               TOM AND CHARLIE

               Come around the front of the truck. They can't see through 
               the glare of the Suburban's bright headlights.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hello!

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         You okay? You stuck?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yes!

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         We'll see if we can get you out! 
                         We'll be right over!

               Charlie looks at Tom, relieved.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Looks like we might just --

               THE SUBURBAN

               Headlights go on high beam.

               CHARLIE AND TOM

               Squint, blinded by the high beams.

                                     TOM
                         Why'd they do that?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Probably so they can see better.

                                     TOM
                         Or so we can't see at all.

               Charlie looks at him -- what does he mean? Tom puts his hand 
               on his pistol.

               IN THE WATER

               Assembled by the Suburban are...

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               All holding guns. He speaks to them quietly.

                                     JIM
                         This is my retirement fund, boys, 
                         and if any one of you screws up, I 
                         swear to God I'll kill you. Let's 
                         go.

               They start wading down into the dip in the road. Kenny carries 
               a rifle.

               TOM AND CHARLIE

               Tom squints through the bright light.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Company dispatch and the National 
                         Guard are the only ones who know 
                         we're here.

                                     TOM
                         Anyone with a scanner from Radio 
                         Shack could've intercepted your call, 
                         Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (realizes)
                         Jesus.

                                     TOM
                              (to Jim and men)
                         Could you turn down your lights?!

                                     JIM
                         We're bringing a rope!

                                     TOM
                         Turn down your lights!

                                     JIM
                         We'll be right there!

               Tom starts to pull his gun.

               KENNY

               is fired up on adrenalin. He has his rifle up and is aiming 
               it.

               HIS POV

               Tom with his hand on his pistol, starting to pull it out.

               TOM AND CHARLIE

               Charlie sees Tom going for his gun. He moves close to Tom, 
               half in front of him, putting his hand on Tom's.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Take it easy, Tom.

               KENNY

               Stiffens.

               KENNY'S FINGER

               Squeezes the trigger of his rifle.

               TOM

               Jumps at the sound of the rifle crack.

               CHARLIE

               Is knocked back.

               TOM

               Yanks out his gun and starts shooting back.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Duck down in the water.

               TOM

               Shooting blindly, looks over and sees...

               CHARLIE

               A horrible look on his face, blood coming out of his neck. 
               He sinks into the water.

               KENNY

               Shoots off another few quick rounds.

               TOM

               Drops into the water, bullets plugging in around him. Just 
               his hand and pistol are visible, shooting blindly back toward 
               Jim and his men. THE SUBURBAN

               Is hit by Tom's fire.

               TOM

               Runs out of bullets. A beat later we see Charlie start moving 
               through the water -- Tom is pulling him.

                                     JIM
                         STOP SHOOTING!

               KENNY

               Doesn't hear Jim and keeps firing.

               JIM

               Aims his pistol at Kenny's head.

                                     JIM
                         Stop.

               Kenny stops.

               BEHIND THE ARMORED TRUCK

               Tom comes up in the water behind the truck, gasping, holding 
               Charlie. Tom rests his gun on the truck bumper.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm sorry, Tom.

               Charlie's gone.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Jim glares at Kenny, his eyes on fire.

                                     KENNY
                         He was going for his gun!

                                     JIM
                         He wasn't gonna shoot, Kenny. 
                         Goddamnit!
                              (shakes head, calls 
                              to Tom)
                         We just want the money! Get away and 
                         we won't have to kill you!

               TOM

               Shuts his eyes, thinking, scared.

                                     JIM (O.S.)
                         Now!

               Tom opens his eyes. He looks down at...

               CHARLIE

               Floating in the water.

               TOM

               What the hell is he going to do?

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Jim's men look at him. Jim motions them to wait some more.

                                     JIM
                         You got thirty seconds to get the 
                         hell away!

               Jim and the others wait, but there's no answer from Tom.

                                     JIM
                         The clock's running! Go!

               Still no response from Tom.

               THEIR POV

               All they can see is the front of the truck, in the light of 
               the "Welcome" sign. They can't see the back.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Jim nods to his men. They head for the truck, down into the 
               deeper water at the bottom of the dip in the road. All have 
               guns up and ready.

               Jim sends Mr. Mehlor and Ray out to circle around. They all 
               move quietly. The only sound is the rain.

               JIM

               Gets to the truck and moves along its side, Kenny right behind 
               him. Jim gets to the back of the truck, nods for Kenny to 
               cover him, then steps out behind the truck, gun up.

               JIM'S POV

               Tom is gone.

               CHARLIE

               Is floating in the water, eyes of glass.

               KENNY, MR. MEHLOR AND RAY

               Step into the circle of light thrown by the "Welcome" sign.

                                     JIM
                              (eyes Charlie)
                         Ah, Jesus.
                              (to Kenny)
                         Your dad'd be real proud of you, 
                         Kenny.

                                     KENNY
                         He was going for his gun!

                                     JIM
                         Mr. Mehlor, I believe we're gonna 
                         need your science project.

               Mr. Mehlor nods and digs into his pack. Ray looks down at 
               Charlie in the water.

                                     RAY
                         "I shall bring floodwaters upon the 
                         earth to destroy all that lives under 
                         the heavens and every creature that 
                         has the breath of life in it shall 
                         perish." Genesis 6:17.

                                     KENNY
                         Were you a preacher or something?

               Ray laughs.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         Ray did five years in the hole at 
                         Joliet. The only thing you get to 
                         read in the hole is the Bible.

                                     KENNY
                              (to Ray)
                         You got religion?

                                     RAY
                         Obviously.

               Mr. Mehlor laughs as he pulls something out of his pack. 
               It's...

               SMALL EXPLOSIVE DEVICE

               A half-stick of dynamite with a timer, mounted on a magnet.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         When you hit the switch you've got 
                         thirty seconds.

                                     RAY
                         You teach your students how to make 
                         things like that?

               Mr. Mehlor puts the device on the back door.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         You been to a high school recently, 
                         Ray? My students taught me how to 
                         make things like that. Ready?

                                     JIM
                         Hold on.

               Something's wrong. Jim touches the handle on the door. It 
               moves. Uh-oh. He raises his pistol, grabs the door handle 
               and pulls. The door swings open. We don't need to see what 
               he sees -- we can tell from the expression on his face.

               EXT. ON THE ROAD

               Tom is running hard through the knee-deep water, pulling a 
               string of canvas money bags buckled together. The truck and 
               "Welcome" sign are two hundred yards behind him. Tom hears 
               an angry yell.

               EXT. BY THE ARMORED TRUCK

               Kenny is the one yelling.

                                     JIM
                         Shut up. Everyone.

               They quiet. The patter of the rain is too loud -- they can't 
               hear anything. Jim scans the horizon, but sees nothing.

                                     RAY
                         Now why'd he have to go and do a 
                         thing like that?

                                     JIM
                         To stay alive.
                              (off their looks)
                         He thinks we'll kill him -- unless 
                         he knows where the money is and we 
                         don't.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         There is another possibility.
                              (off their looks)
                         He's thinking of keeping it for 
                         himself.

                                     JIM
                         There's always that. Either way, we 
                         got ourselves a sharp one.

                                     KENNY
                         What do we do?

               Jim is looking at something in the distance.

                                     JIM
                         Pretty soon the water'll be too deep 
                         for him to run. But for us it'll be 
                         just deep enough.

                                     KENNY
                              (unclear)
                         Deep enough for what?

               INT. CAR AND BOAT DEALERSHIP - SHOWROOM

               A glass window is smashed and water floods into the boat 
               showroom. Jim and his men stride in. Kenny ogles a 
               particularly nice cruiser. Jim stops at a smallish ski-boat.

                                     JIM
                         Here we go.

                                     KENNY
                              (re: cruiser)
                         What about this monster?

                                     JIM
                              (re: ski-boat)
                         This is all we need.

                                     RAY
                         Shit, Jim, we're stealing. Can't we 
                         take anything we want?

                                     JIM
                         The water isn't very deep yet. We 
                         need something with a low draft. Mr. 
                         Mehlor -- find us some gasoline.

               Mr. Mehlor heads off.

               KENNY

               Sees something else he likes. We don't see what it is.

                                     KENNY
                         Oh, Jim...?

               EXT. CEMETERY

               The name WILLIAM PORTMAN is chiseled into a crypt. Tom appears 
               from underwater, gasping for breath. He gets to his feet and 
               trudges off through the water.

               EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE CEMETERY

               Tom comes out through the gates of the cemetery, splashing 
               through the knee-deep water. He's running when he hears, 
               from behind him, boat engines firing up. He turns to see...

               LIGHTS

               Racing toward him over the water, a hundred and fifty yards 
               back.

               TOM

               Sprints off.

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Jim is steering the ski-boat. Mr. Mellor hunkers down beside 
               him. We PULL BACK to see...

               TWO JET-SKIS

               Flanking the ski-boat, piloted by Kenny and Ray.

               ON THE ROAD

               Tom is running as fast as he can. He looks back, sees the 
               ski-boat and jet-skis closing. They'll get him before he 
               gets to town. He suddenly veers off the road toward...

               THE HIGH SCHOOL

               The sign out front reads: GO WARRIORS!

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL

               Tom runs around the side of the high school.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Ride up on the ski-boat and jet-skis and round the corner.

               THEIR POV

               No sign of Tom.

                                     JIM
                         Cut your engines!

               The engines are shut down. They all drift. Jim shines a 
               flashlight over onto...

               WINDOWS

               There's a hole in a window large enough to climb through.

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM

               Tom wades through the classroom, pushing floating desks aside. 
               Flashlight beams stab into the room. Tom hurries to the hall.

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL

               Jim turns to his men.

                                     JIM
                         Let's get him out. But for Godsake, 
                         whatever you do...
                              (with a hard look at 
                              Kenny)
                         ...don't kill him. Not until we find 
                         out where he hid that money.

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY

               Tom makes his way past banks of lockers, trying to get as 
               far as he can from the probing flashlight beams.

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - FRONT DOORS

               Kenny drifts up to the front doors. He pulls on them. Locked.

                                     JIM
                         Mr. Mehlor?

               MR. MEHLOR

               Reaches into his pack.

               INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY

               Tom tries lockers, looking for a place to hide.

               EXT. FRONT DOORS

               Kenny rides his jet-ski fast away from the front doors and 
               the doors explode.

               INT. SCHOOL FRONT LOBBY

               Tom ducks down as...

               A FIREBALL

               Shoots over him.

               KENNY AND RAY

               Ride the jet-skis into the flooded school.

               UNDERWATER

               Tom is swimming as hard as he can, out of breath. KENNY AND 
               RAY

               Ray goes off down a hall while Kenny idles in the lobby.

               TOM

               Surfaces, gasping.

               KENNY

               Hears the gasp, turns, grinning.

                                     KENNY
                         Enemy sub off the port bow!

               TOM

               Gets to his feet runs as fast as he can down the hall. He 
               rounds a corner and keeps going.

               KENNY

               Guns his engine and takes off after Tom.

               TOM

               Runs another thirty feet, then trips on something and goes 
               down.

               KENNY

               Comes around the corner, grinning when he sees...

               TOM

               Halfway down the hall, standing frozen, caught in Kenny's 
               light.

               KENNY

               Guns it, racing forward down the hall toward Tom.

                                     KENNY
                         Full steam ahead!

               THE JET-SKI

               Hits something underwater and stops.

               KENNY

               Keeps going. He flies through the air, slams headfirst into 
               a trophy case and drops into the water.

               TOM

               Stands up -- he was kneeling.

                                     TOM
                         Low tide, sailor.

               A HANDRAIL

               On the wall, angles down into the water. Underwater there 
               are a couple of steps leading up to a change in level in the 
               hall -- that's what the jet-ski grounded on.

               HALLWAY

               Ray motors down the hallway toward the corner.

                                     RAY
                         Kenny?

               HIS POV

               Around the corner comes a jet-ski. Ray assumes it's Kenny.

                                     RAY
                         See him?

               Then the jet-ski speeds up and shoots by him. Ray sees it's...

               TOM

               Wearing Kenny's hat and jacket.

               RAY

               Gives chase.

               SCHOOL HALLWAYS

               Ray races after Tom along the flooded hallways, taking the 
               turns fast. Ray pulls a gun, starts shooting.

               TOM'S POV

               Tearing through the halls, flashlight lighting the way. 
               Bullets hit the walls, ceiling, water around him.

               TOM

               Comes around a corner, sees the open front doors ahead of 
               him.

               JIM AND MR. MEHLOR

               Come into view in the ski-boat, blocking the exit.

               TOM

               Turns hard and speeds down a side hall.

               TOM'S POV

               A wall of windows at the end. No way out. Trapped. Then...

               KENNY

               Rises out of the water, blood running down his face, pistol 
               up.

               TOM

               Looks back.

               RAY

               Is on his tail.

               TOM

               Makes his choice and guns the jet-ski straight at Kenny.

                                     TOM
                         Yee-hah!

               KENNY

               Fires, misses and is knocked to the side as...

               TOM

               Hunches down on the jet-ski and crashes through the windows.

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL

               Jim and Mr. Mehlor are moving right outside the windows just 
               as Tom blasts out of the school and races off into the dark.

               EXT. OPEN WATER

               Tom moves fast over the water. He yanks off his clip-on tie.

               JIM AND THE OTHERS

               Chase Tom's light, behind by fifty yards, heading out into 
               farm fields. They get closer and closer and then watch as...

               TOM'S JET-SKI

               Runs straight into a tree and explodes.

               JIM AND THE OTHERS

               Race up to find the burning, flaming wreckage of the jet-
               ski. Ray circles on the other jet-ski. Kenny, still bleeding 
               from the head, is in the boat with Jim and Mr. Mehlor.

                                     KENNY
                              (laughing)
                         Nice driving, buttwipe!

                                     RAY
                         I'm glad you're enjoying this, Kenny, 
                         but if he's dead, how do we find the 
                         money?

               Kenny reacts -- oh, right.

                                     JIM
                         Oh, he's still alive.

               We see what Jim sees.

               ECU THROTTLE OF JET-SKI

               Tom used his tie to wrap the throttle open.

               HUNDRED YARDS AWAY

               Tom is hiding in the branches of a floating tree, watching 
               the distant lights of Jim and his men. The current carries 
               Tom away.

               WITH JIM AND HIS MEN

               Jim scans the horizon; sees nothing.

                                     JIM
                         Ray, I'm in need of a little 
                         inspiration.

                                     RAY
                         "With a raging flood he makes an end 
                         of those who oppose him, and pursues 
                         his enemies into darkness." From one 
                         of the more obscure --

                                     KENNY
                         Sorry to interrupt Bible study and 
                         all, but has no one but me noticed 
                         how completely screwed we are? We 
                         should be back in the motel room, 
                         counting out the money. Instead --

               Jim lashes out with a fist, hard and fast, hitting Kenny in 
               the chest, knocking him out of the ski-boat, into the water. 
               Kenny comes up in the thigh-deep water, sputtering.

                                     JIM
                         No one likes this particular turn of 
                         events, Kenny, but we have a choice -- 
                         we can can either deal with it or we 
                         can walk away. There's a lot of money 
                         out there, so I choose to deal with 
                         it. If you want to go, that's fine -- 
                         start swimming. You want to stay, 
                         that's fine, too -- just stop your 
                         damn whining.

               Jim pushes the throttle forward and the ski-boat takes off, 
               leaving Ray on the jet-ski, with Kenny in the water.

                                     KENNY
                         What the hell's his problem? All the 
                         money in the world ain't worth a 
                         goddamn nickel if you get caught. 
                         It's not like there won't be other 
                         jobs.

                                     RAY
                         You may have more of these in you, 
                         Kenny, but Jim doesn't.

               Ray pulls Kenny up onto the jet-ski and takes off after Jim.

               EXT. BACK OF CHURCH - SANDBAG WALL

               The water level is creeping up a five-foot-high wall of 
               sandbags.

               REVERSE ANGLE

               Looking out over the top of the sandbag wall. A tree floats 
               by on the water.

               HANDS

               Suddenly appear on the top of the wall and...

               TOM

               Pulls himself into view. He climbs over the wall, exhausted.

               BEHIND THE SANDBAG WALL

               Gasoline-powered pumps are sucking up any rainwater. The 
               sandbags have kept the floodwater at bay.

               TOM

               He hurries up the back steps and goes into the church.

               INT. CHURCH - BACK ROOM

               Tom walks through a small room lined with closed cupboards. 
               He goes through a door.

               INT. CHURCH - MAIN HALL

               Tom comes out into the altar. He looks around, impressed. 
               It's a beautiful church. Scaffolding goes up one wall -- the 
               church is being restored. Tom is startled by a sound from 
               above. He grabs a heavy silver candlestick as a weapon and 
               looks up to see...

               BIRDS

               Fluttering up in the rafters.

               TOM

               Takes a breath. Just as he relaxes, he hears a whooshing 
               sound from behind him and turns to see...

               A LARGE CRUCIFIX

               Being swung at his head. Thunk and...

               THE SCREEN GOES BLACK

               FADE IN:

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Tom slowly regains consciousness, blinking his eyes. He 
               hears...

                                     SHERIFF (O.S.)
                         What are you doing here?

               But the Sheriff isn't asking Tom, he's asking...

               KAREN

               30, pretty, even in head-to-toe rain gear.

                                     KAREN
                         I was setting up pumps.

                                     WAYNE
                         I sure as hell don't get what you 
                         see in that church.

                                     KAREN
                         I wouldn't expect you to, Wayne.

                                     WAYNE
                         What's that supposed to mean?

                                     SHERIFF
                         Karen, did you think the order was 
                         for everyone but you to evacuate?

                                     KAREN
                         I was gonna go as soon as I filled 
                         the pumps, but the next thing I know, 
                         I've got a looter on my hands. Now, 
                         maybe I'm crazy, but I was expecting 
                         a little gratitude?

                                     PHIL
                         I think it's great what you did.

                                     WAYNE
                         That's it, Phil. That'll finally get 
                         you into her pants.

                                     PHIL
                         Shut up.

                                     SHERIFF
                         What if he'd had a gun, Karen? A lot 
                         of these looters carry guns.

                                     TOM (O.S.)
                         I'm not a looter.

               TOM

               Sits up on a cot, behind bars in the holding cell, woozy.

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL

               Jim and his men are searching the school for the money.

                                     RAY
                         Jim, it could be anywhere. It might 
                         not even be in the school.

                                     JIM
                         Keep looking.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               The rain sheets down hard. A lightning flash reveals...

               THE STATUE

               The water is up to the horse's knees. The lightning passes 
               and a second later thunder rolls.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               The Sheriff, Phil, Wayne and Karen stand outside the cell. 
               Tom is inside, on the cot. He touches the cut on his forehead.

                                     WAYNE
                         What were you doing at the church?

                                     KAREN
                         I told you -- he was looting it.

                                     TOM
                         I just said I'm not a looter!
                              (to Karen)
                         You're the one who nailed me?
                              (Karen nods)
                         You got a better arm than my ex-wife. 
                         What the hell did you hit me with -- 
                         a statue? I saw a flash of some guy 
                         coming at me.

                                     KAREN
                              (mumbles, embarrassed)
                         It was a crucifix.
                              (to others)
                         It was the only thing there!

                                     TOM
                         Oh, great. Now I'm gonna have people 
                         coming from around the world to see 
                         the face of Jesus on my forehead.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Look, son, what were you doing in 
                         the church?

                                     TOM
                         Looking for a place to hide out.

                                     WAYNE
                         From who -- Swamp Thing?

                                     TOM
                         The bastards who killed my partner.

               That stops the room.

                                     TOM
                         We were driving an armored truck. 
                         The truck got stuck out past the 
                         high school. They must've picked up 
                         our call to dispatch, 'cause they 
                         knew where we were. Charlie and I 
                         were just standing there and all 
                         hell broke loose.

                                     SHERIFF
                         How much money did you have?

                                     TOM
                         A little over three million.

               They all exchange a look -- that's a lot of money.

                                     TOM
                         The bank was afraid of looters. They 
                         had us cleaning out their branches 
                         up and down the river.

                                     WAYNE
                         They stole three million dollars?

                                     SHERIFF
                         No, I don't think so.

               They all look at the Sheriff. He looks at Tom.

                                     SHERIFF
                         You took the money, didn't you.

                                     TOM
                         I hid it in the cemetery. Tied it to 
                         a crypt for a guy named Portman.

                                     WAYNE
                         What the hell'd you do that for?

                                     TOM
                         I don't like to carry around that 
                         much cash.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Jesus, Wayne, use your head. If he 
                         hadn't hidden it, they woulda killed 
                         him, too.

               The Sheriff looks at Tom -- is that it? Tom nods.

                                     SHERIFF
                         You got any ID?

                                     TOM
                         No, it was in my jacket and I --

                                     WAYNE
                         Color me surprised.

               The Sheriff thinks for a beat, then tosses some keys to Phil.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Get out two rifles and a shotgun.

               Phil nods and goes to it. The Sheriff opens a desk drawer, 
               pulls out an ankle holster.

                                     WAYNE
                         You believe him?

                                     SHERIFF
                         Well, yes, Wayne, I do. And even if 
                         I didn't, I'd say we sure as hell 
                         had an obligation to check it out, 
                         don't you think?

               The Sheriff starts strapping on the ankle holster.

                                     TOM
                         I'll go with you. I can show you 
                         where --

                                     SHERIFF
                         No, I think you better stay put. But 
                         that was --

                                     WAYNE
                         Yeah, all we need is an armored car 
                         guy helping us out.

               The Sheriff thwacks Wayne in the ear.

                                     WAYNE
                         Ow!

                                     SHERIFF
                         Wayne, what's the worst that's ever 
                         happened to you? When old Mrs. Dugan 
                         went after you with a knife? This 
                         guy just got shot at!
                              (dismisses Wayne; to 
                              Tom)
                         Smart move with the money.

               Phil comes over with the guns.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (to Phil)
                         Wayne and I'll check out the cemetery. 
                         You escort Slugger...
                              (nods at Karen)
                         ...out of town. Get her to some high 
                         ground, then come on back.

               The Sheriff jams a small pistol into his ankle holster.

                                     KAREN
                         I have to fill the pumps --

                                     SHERIFF
                              (pulling her out)
                         Not any more you don't.

               The Sheriff straightens up, grabs a rifle from Phil and pulls 
               Karen to the door. Wayne goes to Tom's cell door and pulls 
               it shut with a click.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Wayne...

                                     WAYNE
                         He could still be lying!

               The Sheriff rolls his eyes and gestures for Wayne to come 
               along. He opens the door for Karen, Wayne and Phil to go 
               through.

                                     TOM
                         Sheriff -- they killed my partner 
                         without any warning.

                                     SHERIFF
                         And they're gonna regret that, I 
                         guarantee you. They're gonna regret 
                         coming anywhere near this town 
                         tonight. And out he goes.

               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Water is halfway up the four-foot high wall of sandbags around 
               the station. There are three outboard motorboats moored to 
               the sandbags.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Phil, take Karen's boat.

               The Sheriff and Wayne climb toward their boats.

                                     WAYNE
                         You can do it, Phil. The men of 
                         Huntingburg are counting on you.

                                     PHIL
                         Just bite me.

               Wayne laughs as he and the Sheriff fire up their boat engines.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Tom hears boat engines start up and move away. He lays back 
               down on the cot, listening to the rain.

               INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE

               Empty. Light comes out from under the door to the bathroom.

               INT. BATHROOM

               Hank is on the can reading a copy of "American Survivalist" 
               magazine. An odd reaction comes over his face. He feels 
               something weird. He looks down.

               ON THE FLOOR

               Water is seeping in under the door.

                                     HANK
                         Holy shit!

               INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE

               The bathroom door flies open and Hank waddles out, pants 
               around his feet. He shuffles fast to the control wheels and 
               starts spinning them.

               EXT. RESERVOIR DAM

               Two gates open fast, all the way, and water thunders out.

               INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE

               Hank pulls up his pants as he gets on the radio.

                                     HANK
                         Sheriff! Sheriff!

               EXT. PARK AREA

               The Sheriff and Wayne are motoring in their boats, zooming 
               through the trees, engine noise obliterating anything coming 
               in over the radio.

               INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE

                                     HANK
                              (on the radio)
                         Sheriff, come in!

               EXT. MAIN STREET - MOVING BOAT

               Phil steers Karen's small boat down Main Street, past the 
               statue. The water is up to the rider's stirrups.

                                     KAREN
                              (pleading)
                         Did you see the stained glass windows, 
                         Phil? Did you see what a good job 
                         they did? I can't let anything happen 
                         to the church, not after all I've 
                         put into it.

                                     PHIL
                         Karen, you know I'd do anything for 
                         you, but the Sheriff told me to get 
                         you out of town. I'm sorry. It's for 
                         your own good.

               Karen stands up.

                                     PHIL
                         What're you doing?

                                     KAREN
                         If you're not going to take me back 
                         to the church, then I'll swim.

               Karen moves to get out of the boat.

                                     PHIL
                         No. Hey, hold on.

               Phil lets go of the throttle and stands, moving toward Karen.

                                     KAREN
                         What am I saying?

               Karen suddenly turns on Phil and pushes him out of the boat.

                                     KAREN
                         This is my boat. You swim.

               Karen guns the engine and shoots off down a side street. 
               Phil stands in the waist-deep water and watches her go, 
               flabbergasted.

               EXT. CHURCH

               Karen comes around a corner and drives her boat up to the 
               church. The water is swirling quietly, still a good three 
               feet below the top of the wall.

               EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN - WELCOME SIGN

               Close on the lighted "Welcome to Huntingburg" sign. There's 
               a rushing sound and a two-foot-high wall of water hits the 
               sign. The lights explode in geysers of sparks and the water 
               rushes on.

               EXT. PARK AREA

               The Sheriff and Wayne are racing through a grove of half-
               submerged trees. There's a rushing sound above the sound of 
               the engines. WHAM! and they're hit by the wall of water. 
               Wayne falls out of his boat and is lost in the swirling water.

               EXT. ALLEYWAY

               Jim and his men are motoring down an alleyway when...

               THE WALL OF WATER

               Rushes down the alley.

               RAY

               The water hits him hard, knocking him off the jet-ski. He's 
               swept away by the water.

               CLOSE ON A FENCE LACED WITH CONCERTINA WIRE

               The surge water shoots through it. And suddenly there's...

               RAY

               Slammed up against the fence, pinned to it, water rushing 
               over and around and by him. He yells as the wire cuts into 
               him.

               EXT. CHURCH

               Karen is pouring gasoline into the pumps.

               She hears the rushing and looks up as the surge hits. Water 
               shoots over the top.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Tom hears the sound and opens his eyes -- what the hell is 
               that?

               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               The wall of water slams in hard, cascading over the sandbag 
               wall.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               TOM SITS UP, SWINGING HIS LEGS OVER THE SIDE OF THE COT. HE 
               REACTS, LOOKS DOWN. HIS POV

               There's two feet of water in the station.

               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               The building is like a rock in a stream, with the water 
               rushing up high against one wall, roiling and swirling around 
               the sides.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Tom looks over, stunned, to see... THE DOOR

               As a fine stream spits in through the keyhole.

               THE WINDOWS

               Are heaving as the water rises up against them.

               TOM

               Gets to his feet, woozy and goes to get out of the cell. He 
               remembers -- uh-oh: the cell door is locked.

               EXT. ALLEYWAY

               Jim pulls Ray, coughing, choking, bleeding, into the ski-
               boat.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               The water level inside is rising fast. It hits the wall 
               sockets and there's a spit of sparks, then all the desk lamps 
               go dark. Light still comes from overhead fluorescent panels. 
               Tom sees...

               TWO KEYS ON A KEY RING

               Laying on the Sheriff's wooden desk. They're four feet away -- 
               too far to reach.

               EXT. CHURCH

               Karen suddenly has a horrible thought and stops. She shakes 
               it off -- doesn't want to think about it -- and mutters to 
               herself.

                                     KAREN
                         They'll get him out.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               Phil is clinging to the statue as the water surges by below 
               him.

               EXT. PARK AREA

               Wayne gets back into his boat. The Sheriff realizes something.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Wayne... You locked him in.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Tom looks through the cell bars at wooden chairs bobbing in 
               the water. The Sheriff's desk lifts up, starts floating. Tom 
               gets an idea. He takes his belt off.

               EXT. NEAR SHERIFF'S STATION

               A telephone pole is half-submerged, being pulled along fast 
               by the current.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Tom holds one end of the belt and tosses the rest of it at...

               THE DESK

               Bobbing in the rising water. He misses the keys.

               TOM AND THE DESK

               Tom tries again. The belt lands on the desk top.

               Tom very gently starts pulling. Too hard; the belt starts 
               slipping off the desk. He gets it just right and the desk 
               starts moving toward Tom. He reaches out with his hand, 
               stretching.

               HIS FINGERS

               Touch the top of the desk, start pulling it toward him, and 
               he just gets a firm grip on the desk when...

               THE TELEPHONE POLE

               Smashes into a window, bending in the bars on the window, 
               shattering the glass, letting a torrent of water into the 
               room.

               THE DESK

               Is moved by the rush of water, but not before Tom grabs...

               THE KEYS

               And grips them tight.

               TOM

               Tries the keys in the lock. They don't fit. He looks at them.

               CU KEYS

               The tag is emblazoned with the Ford logo.

                                     TOM
                         Great! I can drive out of here!

               Tom tosses the keys into the water and looks around at...

               THE WATER LEVEL

               Rising very fast. A foot in ten seconds.

               TOM

               Climbs up the cell bars, the water rising with him. He's 
               running out of room between himself and the ceiling. Three 
               feet. Two feet. He's being pushed up by the water toward...

               FLUORESCENT LIGHT FIXTURE

               On the ceiling, caged in a wire cover.

               TOM

               Is terrified, about to die. The water rises up past his face.

               TOM'S HANDS

               Pull his Maglite flashlight from his belt. He takes off the 
               lens and the battery cap, then shakes the batteries out.

               TOM

               Sticks the flashlight tube up through the wire grate over 
               the light fixture.

               He blows out the water -- like clearing a snorkel -- then 
               breathes. Reprieve for a few moments and then...

               THE WATER

               Reaches the top of the flashlight tube and starts to trickle 
               in when...

               THE FLUORESCENT LIGHT FIXTURE

               Goes dark. In the darkness, there's the sound of tubes 
               breaking and metal being wrenched.

               TOM

               Looks up, astonished, to see...

               THE FLUORESCENT FIXTURE

               Being lifted up and away from above. Streetlight comes in, 
               silhouetting...

               A FIGURE

               Standing on the roof. The figure leans down and starts tugging 
               at the wire cage over the inside of the fixture. In the light, 
               Tom sees that it's...

               KAREN

               And she's pulling as hard as she can, but the wire cage isn't 
               budging. She pulls out a Swiss Army knife, unfolds a small 
               knife and starts taking out the screws holding the cage in 
               place. She gets two screws out.

               TOM

               Pulls on the cage and it swings down. He climbs up it.

               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION ROOF

               Tom surfaces in a hole in the roof. There's a vent duct laying 
               on the roof -- Karen must've kicked that over to get to the 
               light fixture. Karen helps Tom up. She sits and he lays down 
               on the roof, catching his breath.

                                     TOM
                         Thank you.

                                     KAREN
                         I owed you -- for hitting you and 
                         all. But we're even now, okay?

                                     TOM
                         Even.
                              (beat, looks around)
                         What happened?

                                     KAREN
                         I don't know.

               They get up.

                                     KAREN
                         Maybe another levee broke upriver. 
                         They've been --

               Just then...

               A PROPANE TANK

               Explodes. The fireball rips across the dark sky, illuminating 
               everything, showing...

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Fifty feet away -- Jim, Mr. Mehlor and Ray in the ski-boat 
               and Kenny on the jet-ski -- guns aimed at Tom and Karen.

                                     TOM
                         Oh, God.

               DARKNESS

               As the lightning passes, and in the darkness, the thunder 
               rolls.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Switch on their lights and move forward. They pass...

               CARS

               Floating down the street with other debris. The cars have 
               been damaged by the flood -- one is missing a door.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               When they get closer to the Sheriff's station, what they see -- 
               or don't see -- makes them stop.

               THEIR POV

               Tom and Karen have disappeared. Karen's boat is still moored 
               to the Sheriff's station roof, empty.

                                     JIM
                         They're in the water! Kenny, cut 
                         your engine!

               Kenny shuts off the engine of the one remaining jet-ski. Jim 
               shuts down the boat engine. They float in silence, scanning 
               the water with their flashlights. There's no sign of Tom and 
               Karen.

               UNDERWATER

               Tom motions Karen to follow him. She's freaked and hesitates. 
               Tom grabs her hand and pulls her.

               THEIR POV

               The ski-boat and jet-ski are right above them, flashlights 
               playing over the water.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Reach the roof of the Sheriff's station. Jim looks around.

                                     JIM
                         Kenny, go that way. We'll go down 
                         here.

               LONG SHOT POV THROUGH CAR WINDSHIELD

               Of Kenny and Jim heading off in different directions.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Rise into view in a car. They gasp for air and keep low.

                                     KAREN
                         Tell them where the money is.

                                     TOM
                         I can't.

                                     KAREN
                         Well, I can.

               She's about to call out. Tom grabs her hard.

                                     TOM
                         If they know where the money is, 
                         they will kill us.

               Before Karen can say anything, a flashlight beam comes 
               swinging toward them and they have to duck underwater.

               JIM

               Watches as his flashlight beam washes over the car. Nothing 
               there. He guns his engine and heads off down the street.

               THE CAR

               Floats off around a corner.

               IN THE CAR

               Tom and Karen surface, catch their breath. Quiet for a few 
               moments as they both look around to see that Jim and his men 
               are gone.

                                     KAREN
                         So what do we do?

                                     TOM
                         I guess just drive around until we 
                         run out of gas.

                                     KAREN
                              (pissed)
                         Look, I've spent the last eight months 
                         of my life restoring that church, 
                         and I just left it to come save your 
                         ass, so spare me, okay?

                                     TOM
                              (beat)
                         When we get down here a little further 
                         we'll find a place for you to hide.
                              (off her look)
                         I'm gonna get back to the truck and 
                         wait for the National Guard.
                              (checks watch)
                         They should be there pretty soon.

               Karen nods. Tom looks at her. She's shivering.

                                     TOM
                         Cold?

                                     KAREN
                         No, I'm fine. The heater just kicked 
                         in.

               Tom looks at her, gives a little grin. Their eyes meet for a 
               second, then they look away.

               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Phil climbs up onto the roof, exhausted. He sees the hole in 
               the roof and goes to look at it. As he's looking down...

                                     SHERIFF (O.S.)
                         Is he dead?

               Phil turns to see...

               THE SHERIFF AND WAYNE

               Coasting up in their boats.

                                     PHIL
                         No. Someone got him out.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Who?

                                     PHIL
                              (hesitates)
                         Maybe Karen.

                                     WAYNE
                         Karen? How could she get him out? 
                         You took her out of town.

                                     PHIL
                         I -- It --

                                     SHERIFF
                         Let's hear it, Phil.

                                     PHIL
                         It happened real fast, okay?

               EXT. ALLEYWAY

               Tom and Karen float down the alley in the car.

                                     KAREN
                         You ever been robbed before?

                                     TOM
                         No. The scariest thing that ever 
                         happened before was Charlie running 
                         out of donuts.
                              (off her look)
                         I've only been doing this for a couple 
                         months.

                                     KAREN
                              (not what she wanted 
                              to hear)
                         Oh.

               Silence for a few moments.

                                     KAREN
                         What'd you do before this?

                                     TOM
                         I, uh... I sold construction 
                         machinery.
                              (off her look)
                         I was making good money, it just... 
                         I don't know. It just didn't seem 
                         right for me anymore.

                                     KAREN
                         How'd you end up in this?

                                     TOM
                         My uncle did me a favor; got me in.

                                     KAREN
                         Nice favor. How's he gonna feel after 
                         tonight?

                                     TOM
                         My uncle was Charlie -- my partner 
                         in the truck.

                                     KAREN
                         Oh, God. I'm sorry.

               Tom nods -- so is he.

               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Phil climbs into the Sheriff's boat.

                                     WAYNE
                         She know karate or something, Phil? 
                         Maybe kung fu? I mean, I can't see 
                         how else she could overpower the 
                         likes of you.

                                     PHIL
                         Shut up, Wayne.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Shut up, both of you. Let's go find 
                         Karen; see if she's got him.

               The Sheriff fires up his engine and heads off, Wayne 
               following.

               EXT. ALLEYWAY

               Karen and Tom are still in the car. They freeze at the sound 
               of engines in the distance. The sounds fade. Tom looks around.

                                     TOM
                         God, I wonder whose car this is.

               Karen plucks some cassette tapes out of the water.

                                     KAREN
                         Well, whoever it is, he listens to 
                         Pat Benatar, Eddie Money and the 
                         soundtrack to "Footloose."

                                     TOM
                         Really?
                              (looks at tapes)
                         Hold on...
                              (looks around car)
                         ...I think this is my car from high 
                         school.

               Karen laughs. Just then...

               THE CAR

               Gets caught on something and stops.

                                     TOM
                         Looks like we get out here.
                              (Karen hesitates)
                         Come on -- I told your father I'd 
                         have you home by ten.

               Karen grins. Just then...

               A TRANSFORMER

               down the street explodes.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Hear a sparking sound and look over to see...

               A TRANSFORMER

               On a telephone/power pole close to them. Rain hits it, causing 
               the sparking sound. The floodwater is inching up the pole 
               toward it.

               The water will reach the transformer in a matter of seconds. 
               And while they're staring at that...

               ANOTHER TRANSFORMER

               At the end of the street explodes as water hits it.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Look around -- what to do? Tom points.

                                     TOM
                         There!

               They climb out of the car and start swimming toward a house.

               THE TRANSFORMER

               Water is three inches from the transformer; two inches...

               TOM AND KAREN

               Swimming as hard as they can.

               THE TRANSFORMER

               One inch from the water...

               TOM AND KAREN

               Reach the house. They pull themselves up onto a television 
               antenna/ladder running up the side of the house. Karen's 
               feet are still in the water.

                                     TOM
                         Get your feet up!

               THE TRANSFORMER

               The water is about to touch. There's a sizzling sound.

               TOM AND KAREN

               They heave a huge sigh of relief -- but then Tom realizes...

                                     TOM
                         Oh, shit!

                                     KAREN
                         What?

                                     TOM
                              (re: antenna/ladder)
                         It's metal!

               Tom pushes Karen over onto a window ledge. Then, just as 
               Tom's about to step over...

               KENNY

               Comes screaming in on the jet-ski. He dives off the jetski, 
               gets a hold of Tom and pulls him under.

               KENNY AND TOM

               Surface. Kenny is stronger and he has Tom in a tight grip. 
               One problem -- Kenny doesn't know the danger they're in.

                                     TOM
                         We've gotta --!

               Kenny shoves Tom underwater.

                                     KENNY
                         HEY! I GOT HIM!

               Tom comes up, looks over at...

               THE TRANSFORMER

               The sizzling is getting louder.

                                     TOM
                         We have to --!

               Kenny dunks Tom again.

                                     KENNY
                         I GOT HIM!

               UNDERWATER

               Tom grabs Kenny's arms and pulls himself up fast.

               KENNY AND TOM

               Tom's head comes out of the water and slams into Kenny's 
               chin. Kenny is stunned. Tom gets free of his grasp.

                                     KAREN
                         Hurry!

               Tom does the backstroke, pulling hard toward Karen.

               KENNY

               Still stunned, finally hears the sizzling and looks over 
               at...

               THE TRANSFORMER

               The water touches the outer casing of the transformer.

               KENNY

               Starts swimming fast toward...

               TOM AND KAREN

               Karen grabs Tom's arm and Tom gets a hold of the windowsill 
               and pulls himself up.

               KENNY

               Grabs onto...

               THE TV ANTENNA

               And starts pulling himself out of the water.

               THE TRANSFORMER

               Explodes.

               KENNY

               Feels pretty pleased with himself until...

               THE TV ANTENNA

               Starts dancing with electricity and...

               KENNY

               Is hit by the voltage and his teeth clamp shut and his body 
               goes rigid and his clothes explode in flames.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Look away.

               THE WATER

               Dead fish start floating to the surface.

               KENNY

               Is fried, smoking. He falls off the TV antenna and hits the 
               water with a loud and ugly hiss. He floats away, his body 
               shaking spasmodically.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Tom hears an engine approaching. He looks around, then smashes 
               the window with his elbow.

               INT. HOUSE

               The window glass tumbles in. Tom reaches in, undoes the latch 
               and slides up the window. He climbs in, straddling the window 
               sill. The camera moves down Tom's leg to show...

               A WOLF TRAP

               Laying on the floor, just below the window.

               TOM

               Is oblivious. He starts to put his foot down into the trap. 
               Just then he knocks...

               A POTTED CACTUS

               Off the windowsill. It falls straight down into...

               THE WOLF TRAP

               Hitting the trigger. The jaws snap, obliterating the cactus.

                                     TOM
                         Jesus Christ!

               A SHOTGUN BARREL

               Snaps into view, pointing right at Tom's head.

                                     WOMAN (O.S.)
                         You so much as breathe funny and 
                         your head is going back out that 
                         window without you.

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET

               Jim drives the boat down the street. Mr. Mehlor is scanning 
               the water with a flashlight.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         Jim! Over there!

               Jim looks over to see...

               THE JET-SKI

               Floating in the water. And not far from it is...

               KENNY

               Still twitching.

               OMITTED

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               INT. HOUSE - BEDROOM

               Doreen holds the shotgun on Tom and Karen as they move away 
               from the window, hands raised.

                                     DOREEN
                         Real slow now. Like you were in a 
                         big jar of molasses. That's it.

               They hear footsteps coming down old wood stairs.

                                     MAN (O.S.)
                         Doreen? You haven't killed anybody, 
                         have you?

                                     DOREEN
                         I've got everything under control, 
                         Henry. You go back up.

               Henry enters.

                                     HENRY
                         Jesus, Doreen, you caught a whole 
                         gang.

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET

               Jim and Mr. Mehlor pull Kenny into the ski-boat. Kenny is 
               shivering. Part of his hair has been burned away.

                                     KENNY
                         Jesus, God, it hurts!

                                     JIM
                         You're gonna be okay, Ken. Mr. Mehlor 
                         knows these things and he thinks 
                         you're gonna be okay.

               Mr. Mehlor looks at Jim. Mr. Mehlor knows these things and 
               he thinks Kenny is going to die.

                                     KENNY
                         It hurts!

                                     JIM
                         Don't you, Mr. Mehlor? Don't you 
                         think Kenny's gonna be okay?

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         Yeah, Kenny. You're gonna be fine.

                                     KENNY
                         Jesus, I can't stop shivering.

               Mr. Mehlor moves aside. Jim puts his arms around Kenny.

                                     KENNY
                         I know you didn't want me to come.

                                     JIM
                         You kidding? We couldn't've done 
                         anything without you.

                                     KENNY
                         My dad'd sure be pissed off, huh?

                                     JIM
                         Your dad'd just want you to lay still 
                         while we got you some help.

                                     KENNY
                         Hey -- hey the pain's goin'.
                              (relief)
                         Oh, man.

               He looks up at Jim and grins.

                                     KENNY
                         When you said I was gonna be okay, I 
                         thought you were just shittin' me.

                                     JIM
                         See? You gotta trust me.

               Kenny's shivering stops. It stops because he's dead. Jim 
               slowly lets go.

               INT. HENRY AND DOREEN'S ATTIC

               Henry and Doreen have brought everything into their attic -- 
               a TV, some silver and china, bowling trophies. A Coleman 
               lantern lights the room.

                                     DOREEN
                              (sarcastic)
                         Well, isn't that just wonderful! Now 
                         these bastards are gonna want to 
                         kill us, too! Why the hell did you 
                         have to come to this house?

                                     KAREN
                         We thought it was empty.

                                     DOREEN
                         You know what? The house next door 
                         is empty. So whaddya say we go back 
                         downstairs and you two keep moving?

                                     HENRY
                         We are not going to send these people 
                         out to the wolves.

                                     DOREEN
                         Oh, we're not, are we? Then what's 
                         your plan, General Schwartzkopf?

                                     HENRY
                         I -- I just don't think --

                                     TOM
                         It's okay. I have to go anyway.

               They look at him, surprised.

                                     TOM
                         The National Guard'll be at the truck 
                         in about fifteen minutes. I'm gonna 
                         go wait for them.

                                     DOREEN
                         You can't swim that far in fifteen 
                         minutes.

                                     HENRY
                         He could take our boat.

                                     DOREEN
                         Henry!

                                     HENRY
                              (to Tom)
                         I'll go get it ready for you.

                                     DOREEN
                         Henry, he is not taking our boat.

               Henry ignores Doreen. He pushes the attic stairs down, heads 
               down them.

                                     DOREEN
                              (grabs TV; to Tom)
                         Here. You want a TV too? How about 
                         some china? Maybe our silver?
                              (sets TV down)
                         Henry! Henry, you leave the boat 
                         where it is!

               Doreen heads off down the stairs. Tom starts down the stairs, 
               stops.

                                     TOM
                         Karen?
                              (she looks at him)
                         I'm Tom.

               They shake hands.

                                     KAREN
                         Watch yourself, Tom. I really don't 
                         wanna have to save your life again.

               Tom nods and goes down the stairs.

               EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE

               Henry stands on the roof of the back porch, steadying a small 
               rowboat as Tom gets in. Doreen nags from the window.

                                     DOREEN
                         You give away our only boat in the 
                         middle of a flood. You are a genius, 
                         Henry. A goddamn genius.

                                     TOM
                              (whispers to Henry, 
                              re: Doreen)
                         You wanna come with me?

               Henry looks at Tom, entertaining the notion...

                                     DOREEN
                         Jesus, Henry, what are you waiting 
                         for -- a kiss goodbye? Get back in 
                         here.

               Henry sighs and lets go of the boat. Tom rows off.

               LONG SHOT OF TOM

               We see him in silhouette, crossing the gap between two houses.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Are watching, from the shadows on the dark side of the street.

                                     RAY
                         Why don't we just get him?

                                     JIM
                         If our resourceful young friend hears 
                         us coming, he'll electrocute us or 
                         sink us or one of you'll shoot him. 
                         Besides...
                              (glances at watch)
                         ...I know where he's going. What I'd 
                         like to know is where he came from.

               EXT. CHURCH

               The Sheriff sits in his boat, moored to the wall of sandbags 
               around the church. Wayne's boat is tied up next to it. The 
               floodwater is trickling over the top of the wall. The gas-
               powered pumps inside the wall are keeping the waters at bay.

               WAYNE AND PHIL

               Come out of the front doors of the church.

                                     WAYNE
                         They're not here.

               EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN - WELCOME SIGN

               Tom rows up to the truck and "Welcome" sign. His flashlight 
               shows just the top of the truck and sign. Tom looks at his 
               watch, ties the rowboat to the sign, jumps into the water.

               A few moments pass, then Tom surfaces, holding a shotgun. 
               Then he senses something behind him and turns to see...

               A COW

               Floating in the water, tongue out, eyes glassy.

               TOM

               Kicks away, horrified. And then he hears an engine. He looks.

               TOM'S POV

               Jim's ski-boat is coming over the water. The engine cuts out 
               and the ski-boat drifts, a hundred feet from Tom.

                                     JIM
                              (yelling)
                         Son, before you go underwater and do 
                         something tricky, there's something 
                         I'd like you to see!

               A flashlight comes on, the beam swivels, illuminating...

               HENRY AND DOREEN

               Standing in the ski-boat, blinking in the light.

               TOM

               Slumps.

                                     JIM
                         Now, I know it's your job to protect 
                         that money, and maybe you'd even be 
                         foolish enough to give your life for 
                         it. The question is, are you willing 
                         to give their lives for it?

               Jim puts a pistol to Doreen's head.

                                     JIM
                         Drop the gun and get into the boat.

               TOM

               Thinks for a second, then throws the shotgun away and pulls 
               himself into the rowboat.

                                     JIM
                         Excellent choice.

               TOM, JIM, HENRY AND DOREEN

               As Tom and Jim call to each other across the water, Doreen 
               goes at Henry.

                                     TOM
                         I'll take you to the money, but you 
                         gotta let them go.

                                     DOREEN
                         I hope you're proud of yourself, 
                         Henry Sears.

                                     HENRY
                         Shh.

                                     JIM
                         I think it'd be best if --

                                     DOREEN
                         I told you not to give him the goddamn 
                         boat.

                                     HENRY
                         Doreen, please.

                                     JIM
                         I think it'd be best if we all stayed 
                         together.

                                     TOM
                         You say all you want is the money? 
                         Prove it. Let them go.

                                     JIM
                         I don't know if that's --

                                     DOREEN
                         We could be safe in our home instead 
                         of out here in a boat with these low-
                         life scumbags!

                                     JIM
                              (after a look at 
                              Doreen, nods to Mr. 
                              Mehlor)
                         Let 'em go.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               The Sheriff, Wayne and Phil motor past the statue. Wayne is 
               driving his boat; Phil is with the Sheriff. The water is up 
               to the General's neck.

               EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN

               Tom helps Henry and Doreen over into the rowboat. As he does, 
               his face comes close to Henry's for a second.

                                     TOM
                              (whisper)
                         Karen?

                                     HENRY
                              (shakes head, whispers)
                         In the attic. They never saw her.

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET

               Karen swims down the center of the street.

               EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN

               Tom is in the ski-boat with Jim. He looks out at...

               HENRY AND DOREEN

               As Henry rows them off into the darkness.

                                     DOREEN
                              (disappearing in dark)
                         Faster, Henry! The bastards might 
                         change their minds! Stop lily- dipping 
                         and move it!

               Henry starts to turn the boat around.

                                     DOREEN
                         What're you doing?

                                     HENRY
                         I'm gonna row back there and see if 
                         he'll shoot you. Or me. Fine either 
                         way.

                                     DOREEN
                         Henry...?

                                     HENRY
                         Do you want me to get us out of here?

                                     DOREEN
                         Yes, of course, I --

                                     HENRY
                         Then shut the fuck up.

               Henry turns the boat around and rows off. Doreen is silent.

               JIM'S SKI-BOAT

               Jim shakes his head. Tom looks at Ray, coughing and at Kenny, 
               dead. Tom doesn't know what to say.

                                     TOM
                         I...

                                     JIM
                         The only thing I want to hear from 
                         you is where the money is.

               EXT. STREET

               The Sheriff and Wayne are motoring fast down a street, the 
               Sheriff leading. The Sheriff sees something in the water in 
               front of him. He curses and throttles down fast.

               KAREN

               Is in the water, exhausted and cold.

               EXT. CEMETERY

               Jim pilots the ski-boat into the cemetery. All are aghast.

               A DOZEN CASKETS

               Are floating in the water. Half of them have drifted up 
               against the fence; the others are headed that way.

                                     JIM
                         I wonder where they think they're 
                         going.

                                     RAY
                         What the hell's going on?

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         This happened in a flood in Georgia. 
                         The ground gets soggy, and the caskets 
                         are air-tight -- anyone who hasn't 
                         been planted too long just pops up.

                                     RAY
                         You teach your students stuff like 
                         that? No wonder they kicked you out.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         I didn't teach my students anything 
                         at all.

                                     JIM
                              (to Tom)
                         Where is it?

                                     TOM
                         It's hard to tell now with the water 
                         so deep.

               Jim cocks the hammer on his pistol. Tom gets the hint.

                                     TOM
                         It's down there a little further.

               Jim nods, gives the engine some juice and they move on.

               TOM

               Takes a quick look at his watch.

               JIM

               Sees Tom looking at his watch.

               EXT. STREET

               Karen is in the Sheriff's boat, wearing Phil's jacket, trying 
               to warm up.

                                     KAREN
                         Tom went off in their rowboat.

                                     WAYNE
                              (to Phil)
                         It's Tom now. Looks like you lost 
                         out, pal.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Where was he going?

                                     KAREN
                         Back to the armored truck.

               EXT. CEMETERY

               Jim throttles down the ski-boat engine.

                                     JIM
                         Here?

                                     TOM
                         Uh... no. A little farther --

                                     JIM
                         They're not coming, son.

               Tom looks over at Jim, pretending to be confused.

                                     TOM
                         What?

                                     JIM
                         The National Guard. They're not 
                         coming.

                                     TOM
                         I don't --

                                     JIM
                         I know you've been trying to stall 
                         until they show up, but they're not 
                         coming.

                                     TOM
                              (pause as he realizes)
                         Oh, God. You intercepted Charlie's 
                         call, then you called them off.

                                     JIM
                         No, son, I didn't call them off. 
                         They never were coming. We didn't 
                         "intercept" Charlie's call. He called 
                         us direct.

               And on Tom's look of disbelief...

               INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE

               Hank is on the radio.

                                     HANK
                         I'd love to help you, Sheriff, but I 
                         can't leave! If the water goes over 
                         the top again it's bye-bye, dam! Bye-
                         bye, town! In fact, I could use a 
                         little help up here myself.

               EXT. PARK AREA

               The Sheriff is in his boat; Wayne is back in his own. The 
               Sheriff is on the radio.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Hank, remember when Mike Crane holed 
                         up in Jack Finch's barn and said he 
                         was gonna burn it down?

               CROSSCUT WITH HANK

                                     HANK
                         Hey, I was the one who got the dumb 
                         son-of-a-bitch to come out.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Right. And before you went in, I 
                         deputized you, you dumb son-of-a-
                         bitch! So when I say get down here, 
                         it's not a request, it's an order. 
                         So get down here! Now! I won't need 
                         you for long. And bring your gun.

               EXT. CEMETERY

                                     JIM
                         We were gonna hit you just before 
                         you got on the Interstate, but then 
                         you got stuck so we had to change 
                         our plans and take you --

                                     TOM
                         Bullshit. This is all bullshit.

                                     JIM
                         I knew Charlie when we were both 
                         working construction for the Johnstown 
                         company. His middle name was McCarthy 
                         because his parents loved Charlie 
                         McCarthy on the radio. His wife's 
                         name was Mary. She died of a heart-
                         attack last year. He has a daughter 
                         and a son, both grown with children 
                         of their own. I'm afraid I don't 
                         know the names of the grandchildren.

               Tom looks down, not wanting to believe.

                                     JIM
                         What else do I know...? Oh, yes. I 
                         know Uncle Charlie was trying to 
                         steer his favorite nephew away from 
                         a life of crime.

               Tom suddenly lunges for Jim. Ray yanks Tom back.

                                     TOM
                         Why'd you shoot him? Kill Charlie 
                         and you get to keep another share?

                                     JIM
                         No, That was an accident. Ken shot 
                         him.
                              (eyes Kenny sadly)
                         I never told him Charlie was on my 
                         side. Ken liked to talk.
                              (shakes head)
                         He shouldn't've been here. But his 
                         dad asked me to watch over him. I 
                         guess I didn't do the best job.

                                     RAY
                         Excuse me, Jim. I hate to interrupt 
                         and all, but could we just get the 
                         money and get the hell out of here?

                                     JIM
                              (nods; to Tom)
                         I'm gonna ask you one more time. And 
                         before you think of bullshitting me 
                         again, keep in mind I have had a 
                         very frustrating night. And while I 
                         know I'll never get the money if I 
                         kill you, it's getting to the point 
                         where I just don't care.

               Jim casually aims his gun at Tom.

                                     TOM
                         I'll tell you where it is. But it's 
                         not going to do you any good.

               Jim arches an eyebrow.

                                     TOM
                         The Guard may not be coming, but 
                         someone else sure as hell is.

               EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN THE SHERIFF

               At the controls of his boat, moving fast, sprayed by rain. 
               Karen and Phil are in the back of the boat. Wayne is close 
               behind in his boat.

               EXT. CEMETERY

                                     JIM
                         I'll take my chances.

               Tom pauses, looks over to...

               THE CRYPT

               Just the top of it is visible. Two more COFFINS float nearby.

                                     TOM
                         There.

               Jim steers the ski-boat over, hands Tom a flashlight.

                                     JIM
                         Well, go get it.

               Tom climbs over the edge of the ski-boat and into the water. 
               He turns on the flashlight and drops below the surface.

                                     RAY
                              (eyeing Tom in water)
                         "At night we'd go down to the river 
                         and into the river we'd dive."
                              (off Jim and Mehlor's 
                              looks)
                         Springsteen, "The River." I'm all 
                         out of bible quotes.

               UNDERWATER

               Tom shines his light on...

               THE CRYPT

               One end of a rope is tied to the crypt. The other end, cut 
               and frayed, is suspended in the water, waving in the current.

               ON THE WATER

               Jim watches Tom's light rise. Tom comes up fast, takes a 
               breath.

                                     TOM
                         It's gone.

                                     JIM
                         What?

                                     TOM
                              (smug)
                         Looks like somebody beat you to it.

                                     RAY
                         Oh for Christs -- I'm gonna shoot 
                         him, Jim.

               Ray grabs pistol in his belt. Before he can pull it out, 
               holes puff out of his chest, followed by blood and then the 
               sound of the rifle-shots. Ray tumbles into the water. A half-
               second later there's...

               HAIL OF BULLETS

               Ripping into the ski-boat, water, trees, crypt.

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT, WAYNE'S BOAT

               Are outside the fence, a hundred feet from the crypt. PUSH 
               IN FAST on...

               THE SHERIFF

               To the rescue. He and Wayne and Phil fire their guns.

               TOM

               Ducks underwater.

               JIM

               Pulls his pistol, returns fire.

               MR. MEHLOR

               Opens fire with a shotgun, shooting wild, yelling. Then he's 
               hit and knocked out of the boat, dead.

               IN THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

                                     KAREN
                         Stop! You'll hit Tom!

               The Sheriff stops shooting, yells at the others.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Hold your fire!

               Wayne and Phil stop shooting.

               BY THE CRYPT

               Tom is holding onto a coffin, out of view of the Sheriff. He 
               hears a rush of bubbles and turns as...

               JIM

               Comes to the surface, breathing deep.

               JIM'S GUN

               Comes out of the water fast and the barrel goes to Tom's 
               forehead.

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

               There's an adrenal fire in the Sheriff's eyes. He starts his 
               boat forward, Wayne following. Their lights find...

               JIM'S BOAT

               No sign of life. Then there's a sound and the lights sweep 
               over to find...

               JIM AND TOM

               Climbing up on top of the mostly-submerged crypt. Jim is 
               behind Tom with his gun to Tom's head.

               THE SHERIFF

               Stops his boat. Wayne stops, too. They are thirty yards from 
               Jim and Tom.

               KAREN AND TOM

               A look passes between them.

                                     JIM
                              (to Sheriff)
                         Now, sir, I can imagine you'd love 
                         nothing more than to shoot me, but I 
                         caution you -- in order to do that, 
                         you're gonna have to shoot through 
                         young Tom here.

               THE SHERIFF

               Thinks for a second, then shrugs.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Okay.

               He raises his rifle.

               KAREN

               Realizes what is about to happen.

               TOM AND JIM

               Also clue in, but before they can move...

               THE SHERIFF

               Squeezes the trigger as...

               KAREN

               Hits the gun with her arm.

               THE RIFLE

               Fires.

               TOM

               is grazed in the arm by the bullet.

               THE SHERIFF

               Smacks Karen hard with his rifle and she tumbles out of the 
               boat, unconscious.

               TOM AND JIM

               Throw themselves back off the crypt as...

               THE SHERIFF AND WAYNE

               Empty their guns in their direction.

               JIM

               Returns fire, shooting blindly over the top of the crypt.

               PHIL

               Reaches for Karen, floating limp in the water, but...

               WAYNE

               Is closer. He grabs Karen and pulls her into his boat, then 
               grins at Phil.

               TOM AND JIM

               Are behind the crypt. Tom holds his bleeding arm. Jim reloads.

                                     TOM
                         Well, that was unexpected.

                                     JIM
                         Is he the one you thought was coming 
                         to your rescue?

               No answer from Tom, but the answer is clear.

               WITH THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN

               The Sheriff and Wayne reload.

                                     HANK (O.S.)
                         Anyone mind telling me what the hell 
                         is going on?

               The Sheriff, Wayne and Phil turn to see...

               HANK

               In his boat, right behind them, all dressed up in hunting 
               gear, rifle at the ready.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Hey, Hank. That money I told you 
                         about? From the armored car? We're 
                         gonna keep it. Three million dollars. 
                         Four ways.
                              (shoots at crypt)
                         Seven fifty apiece. You okay with 
                         that?

               Hank is stunned. He doesn't answer.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Hank? You okay with that?

                                     HANK
                         Seven hundred and fifty thousand 
                         dollars?
                              (beat, grins)
                         Damn straight I'm okay with that.

                                     WAYNE
                              (grumbling, re: Hank)
                         Don't see what we needed him for.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Then I guess you've never been hunting 
                         with Hank.
                              (to Hank)
                         We got two behind that crypt. Get 
                         'em.

               Hank nods. He motions for Wayne to go one way; he'll go the 
               other. They start off. A blind shot comes from Jim behind 
               the crypt. The Sheriff shoots back. Phil finally musters up 
               the courage to say something.

                                     PHIL
                         Maybe I'm not okay with it.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Come on now, Phil.

                                     PHIL
                         You're gonna kill people?

                                     SHERIFF
                         They're looters, Phil! They come and 
                         steal from an armored truck in our 
                         town -- they're looters.
                              (fires two shots)

                                     PHIL
                         What about Tom? What about Karen? 
                         They're not looters.

                                     SHERIFF
                         No, they're witnesses.

               The Sheriff fires off a flurry of bullets.

               TOM AND JIM

               Behind the crypt, bullets winging by. Jim looks over, sees...

               HANK

               Motor into view.

               JIM

               Opens fire.

               HANK

               Shoots back.

               TOM

               Flattens against the crypt, then turns to see...

               WAYNE

               Coming into view on the other side.

               TOM

               Looks at Jim, sees he's occupied in the fight with Hank. 
               Then he sees...

               RAY

               Floating in the water, dead, pistol still jammed in his pants.

               TOM

               Thinks, decides, and reaches out for Ray.

               CLOSE ON JIM

               Shooting at Hank. He hears gunfire from Wayne and is about 
               to swivel to shoot in that direction when he hears a gun 
               firing from right next to him. He turns to see...

               TOM

               Shooting back at Wayne with Ray's gun.

               WAYNE

               Pulls back out of the line of fire.

               HANK

               Curses and pulls back, too.

               TOM AND JIM

               Exchange a look.

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

                                     PHIL
                         How can you do this?

                                     SHERIFF
                         Jeez, Phil, I always thought Wayne 
                         was the stupid one. Read my lips.
                              (slowly)
                         Three million dollars. Look at it!

               The Sheriff reaches down into a forward storage area of the 
               boat and pulls back a tarp revealing the bags of money.

                                     SHERIFF
                         A couple of those bags are gonna be 
                         yours, Phil.

                                     PHIL
                         But -- but -- you're the Sheriff!

               The Sheriff rips his badge off and throws it away.

                                     SHERIFF
                         I'm the what?

               TOM AND JIM

               Jim looks at Tom, then hands Tom his pistol. Tom doesn't 
               know what Jim's doing. Jim slips beneath the water.

               HANK

               Whistles and gets Wayne's attention. He motions Wayne to try 
               it again.

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

                                     PHIL
                         For twenty years you've been --

                                     SHERIFF
                         For twenty years I've been eating 
                         shit, breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
                         Well, tonight I'm changing the menu! 
                         From now on everything I eat is gonna 
                         be shit-free!

               BEHIND THE CRYPT

               Tom is looking for Jim, to see what he's doing. And then...

               WAYNE AND HANK

               Come around on both sides.

               TOM

               Starts shooting at them with the two pistols.

               WAYNE AND HANK

               Pull back. As they go...

               TOM

               Sees...

               KAREN'S ARM

               Draped over the side of Wayne's boat.

               TOM

               Takes another shot at Hank but stops firing at Wayne.

               CLOSE ON JIM'S SKI-BOAT

               Jim's hand appears over the gunwale. He reaches in and 
               grabs...

               MR. MEHLOR'S PACK

               And pulls it out of the boat.

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

                                     SHERIFF
                         Can I make it any clearer, Phil? Do 
                         you want me to draw pictures?

               Phil pulls out his revolver and points it at the Sheriff.

                                     PHIL
                         I can't let you do it.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Oh for --
                              (beat)
                         Okay, Phil. But here's how it's gonna 
                         go. I'm gonna hear one of two things 
                         out of you. Either I'm gonna hear 
                         you say you're in with us, or...
                              (moves close to Phil's 
                              gun)
                         ...I'm gonna hear a bullet come out 
                         of that gun and go into me.

               Phil is incredulous. The Sheriff weighs his hands like scales.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (one hand)
                         Seven hundred and fifty thousand 
                         dollars or...
                              (other hand)
                         ...you kill me. Your choice.

               The Sheriff weighs the hands a couple more times. Phil slumps, 
               lowers the gun.

                                     SHERIFF
                         There we go.

               SOMETHING

               Flies through the air; lands in the water by the Sheriff. 
               It's...

               MR. MEHLOR'S PACK

               And it starts sinking in the water.

               BEHIND THE CRYPT

               Tom sees...

               JIM

               Haul himself into the ski-boat.

                                     WAYNE (O.S.)
                         In the boat!

               THE SHERIFF, WAYNE AND HANK

               Start shooting at Jim in the ski-boat.

               JIM

               Sticks the shotgun over the gunwale and returns fire.

               TOM

               Starts swimming for the boat.

               THE SHERIFF, WAYNE AND HANK

               See Tom and start shooting at both he and Jim when...

               MR. MEHLOR'S PACK

               Explodes and...

               THE WATER

               Erupts in a huge geyser.

               THE SHERIFF, WAYNE, PHIL AND HANK

               Are knocked off their feet. The Sheriff, Phil and Hank are 
               thrown into the water. Their boats are rocked up and back 
               and swamped with falling water.

               JIM

               Fires up his engine.

               TOM

               Is almost to the boat.

               WAYNE

               Gets to his knees in his boat and starts shooting.

               TOM

               Gets to Jim's boat and grabs onto it.

               JIM

               Cranks the throttle, and, dragging Tom, tears off under the 
               hail of Wayne's bullets.

               TOM'S POV

               As Jim races through the tombstones, barely missing 
               halfsubmerged stone crosses and crypt roofs.

               TOM

               Rams into one cross.

               HIS HANDS

               Start to slip from the boat.

               JIM

               Grabs Tom's hand and holds on as they shoot off across the 
               water.

               THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK

               Get back in the boats.

               EXT. ON THE WATER - MOVING

               Jim hauls Tom into the boat. Tom lays on the bottom, catching 
               his breath. Blood is dripping down from his arm.

                                     TOM
                              (beat, looks up at 
                              Jim)
                         You really want that money?

               Jim gives Tom a look -- of course he wants that money.

                                     TOM
                         'Cause the only way you're ever gonna 
                         see it is if you help me get Karen.

               Before Jim can answer, gunshots ring out behind them. They 
               look back to see...

               THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN

               Coming after them in the three boats, shooting, closing.

                                     TOM
                         We're too slow.

                                     JIM
                              (thinks, then:)
                         Here.

               Jim moves away from the wheel, giving it to Tom. Tom gets up 
               and takes over. Jim bends and picks up...

               KENNY

               Lifeless and limp.

               JIM

               Looks at Kenny for a moment, then pushes his body overboard.

               WITH THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN

               Flying over the water.

               THEIR POV

               They see a body tumble out of the ski-boat.

               WITH JIM AND TOM

               Jim looks back, following Kenny with his eyes.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               Jim and Tom make the turn onto Main Street. They look back 
               as...

               THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN

               Come around the corner, two hundred yards back.

                                     TOM
                         They're not going to catch us now.

               LOW ANGLE

               Of the ski-boat, racing toward camera. As it gets closer, 
               the camera BOOMS DOWN underwater to reveal...

               THE STATUE

               The sword tip just below the surface. THE SKI-BOAT

               There's a jarring metal on metal clank as the sword tip slams 
               into the propeller.

               JIM AND TOM

               Are thrown forward.

               JIM

               Slams head-first into the dash.

               UNDERWATER

               The propeller has stopped.

               TOM

               Looks back to see that...

               THE OUTBOARD MOTOR

               Has almost been ripped from its moorings.

                                     TOM
                         Okay, so maybe they are gonna catch 
                         us now.

               No answer from Jim. Tom looks down.

               JIM

               Is laying on the deck, unconscious. Just then... BAM! BAM! 
               BAM!

               HANK

               Has his rifle resting on his boat's windshield and is firing 
               off a clip on automatic as he, Wayne and the Sheriff close 
               in.

               TOM

               Ducks down and tries to start the engine. No go. Again. It 
               catches on the third try. Tom guns it and the boat tears 
               off.

               THE OUTBOARD ENGINE

               Is wobbling, vibrating.

               HANK

               Keeps up his stream of gunfire.

               TOM

               Stays down, driving blind, as the bullets fly in, blowing 
               holes in the windshield. He looks at Jim, at the engine and 
               curses. He steers the boat toward...

               THE CHURCH

               All lit-up, brilliant white in the darkness, a quarter-mile 
               away.

               EXT. THE CHURCH

               The water is now over the sandbag wall. The first several 
               feet of the church are flooded.

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Comes up fast. Tom grounds it on top of the sandbag wall. 
               Tom hesitates for a half second before grabbing Jim and 
               pushing him out of the boat and into the water.

               JIM

               Hits the cold water and comes to, sputtering.

               TOM

               Grabs guns and ammo and jumps out of the boat and into the 
               water. He lays a rifle on the top of the sandbag wall and 
               fires off a clip.

               THE SHERIFF, HANK AND WAYNE

               Jim's bullets plug into their boats. They circle back.

               AT THE CHURCH

               Tom pushes Jim, still groggy, into the flooded church.

               INT. CHURCH

               Tom shuts the door. He piles the weapons on a shelf. He sees 
               Jim touch his head.

                                     TOM
                         That hurt?

                                     JIM
                         Yeah.

                                     TOM
                         Good.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               Wayne and Hank are alongside the Sheriff, engines idling as 
               they look at the church.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (nods, to Hank)
                         Then go get some bottles.

               Hank nods, guns his engine.

                                     PHIL
                              (to Hank)
                         Wait -- what about the dam?

                                     SHERIFF
                         It'll be fine.

                                     PHIL
                         You said if it goes it'll wipe out 
                         the town.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Fuck the town.

               Hank nods in agreement and takes off.

               INT. CHURCH

               Jim and Tom are by one of the stained glass windows, looking 
               out through a pale-colored pane at the Sheriff and his men 
               across the street. They watch Hank race off.

                                     JIM
                         Does he have the girl?

                                     TOM
                              (shakes head)
                         She's in the small boat.

               Tom touches the wound on his head.

                                     TOM
                         Jesus, I'm gonna get hepatitis.

                                     JIM
                         Hepatitis, hell. You probably already 
                         got cholera.

               Tom gives Jim a look then starts for the back of the church.

                                     JIM
                         What're you doing?

                                     TOM
                         There's a back room.
                              (touches wound)
                         Maybe they've got something I can 
                         use on this.

                                     JIM
                         You been in here before?

                                     TOM
                              (bad memory)
                         Oh, yeah.

                                     JIM
                         What happened?

                                     TOM
                         I saw Jesus.

               EXT. DAM

               Water is starting to go over the top again. It pours down in 
               sheets over the face of the dam.

               INT. CHURCH

               Jim is by the window, looking out at the Sheriff and Wayne 
               across the street in the shadows. He turns as...

               TOM

               Enters from the back. He's got a bottle of rubbing alcohol 
               and a towel. He splashes some of the alcohol on the towel, 
               then touches it to his wound. It hurts like a sonofabitch. 
               After a beat...

                                     TOM
                         So, has this all gone pretty much 
                         how you thought it would?

               Jim turns on Tom.

                                     JIM
                         Everything would have gone fine if 
                         you'd've just walked away from the 
                         truck.

                                     TOM
                         Oh, yeah? Well, everything would've 
                         gone even better if you hadn't decided 
                         to rob the damn truck in the first 
                         place!

               Jim looks away. After another silence...

                                     TOM
                         Did Charlie have cancer or something?

                                     JIM
                         You mean why was he doing this?
                              (thinks, shrugs)
                         No cancer.
                              (beat)
                         Didn't you ever think about taking 
                         the money?

                                     TOM
                         No.

                                     JIM
                         Come now. A man who used to make his 
                         living fencing hot jackhammers never 
                         thought about what he'd do with three 
                         million dollars?

                                     TOM
                         Sorry to disappoint you.
                              (beat)
                         What are you gonna do with it?

                                     JIM
                         As little as possible.

               Silence for a few moments, then...

                                     TOM
                         Belize.

               Jim looks at him.

                                     TOM
                         It's this small country in Central 
                         America, on the Atlantic side.

                                     JIM
                         I know where Belize is. What about 
                         it?

                                     TOM
                         They speak English and the dollar 
                         goes a long way. Beautiful beaches; 
                         friendly people. And they've got 
                         liberal banking laws. Very liberal.

                                     JIM
                         No, you didn't think about taking 
                         that money at all.

                                     TOM
                              (busted)
                         You can't ride in the truck and not 
                         think about it.

                                     JIM
                         I'm sure. And I guess that's pretty 
                         much how it started with Charlie.

               Tom thinks, nods and presses the towel to his wound again.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               Wayne is thinking about something. He makes a decision and 
               flicks on his engine.

                                     SHERIFF
                         What're you doing?

                                     WAYNE
                         We got too many bodies with bullets 
                         in 'em.
                              (nods at Karen)
                         I'm gonna put her in her house, make 
                         it look like she fell down the stairs 
                         and drowned.

                                     PHIL
                         Don't you touch her!

                                     WAYNE
                         Saving her life... Hmm... You know, 
                         that might have actually gotten you 
                         laid.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Oh, for Christsakes, just dump her 
                         here.

                                     WAYNE
                         We got a few minutes before Hank 
                         gets back.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Just dump her here!

               Wayne ignores the Sheriff and motors off.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Wayne! Goddamnit, we've gotta get 
                         them outta there! Wayne!

               But Wayne keeps going.

               INT. CHURCH

               Tom watches Wayne drive off with Karen.

                                     TOM
                         Shit. Where's he going?

               Tom grabs a rifle, frustrated and angry.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               Hank motors up to the Sheriff and Phil.

                                     HANK
                         Where's Wayne going?

                                     SHERIFF
                         On a date. You all set?

                                     HANK
                         Yeah, but --

                                     SHERIFF
                         Then let's go.

                                     HANK
                         Aren't we gonna wait for Wayne?

                                     SHERIFF
                         We can get started without him, the 
                         dumb shit. He won't be long. Besides, 
                         we got Phil. Phil's gonna earn his 
                         money on this, aren't you Phil?

               Phil looks scared shitless.

               EXT. RESERVOIR DAM

               Water continues to pour over the top. CLOSE ON CONCRETE

               Chunks of cement are starting to wash away.

               INT. CHURCH

               Tom finishes reloading a gun.

                                     JIM
                         What -- you're gonna swim after her?

               Tom doesn't answer. He moves toward the front door. Jim cuts 
               him off.

                                     JIM
                         You ain't gonna help her by getting 
                         shot. He's gone and you don't know 
                         where.

                                     TOM
                         The Sheriff knows. I think maybe 
                         I'll go ask him.

                                     JIM
                         You'll be dead before you get over 
                         the sandbags.
                              (beat)
                         Look, he'll be coming for us. You 
                         can ask him then.

               Jim sees something out the window.

                                     TOM
                         What if he doesn't come?

                                     JIM
                         I wouldn't worry about that.

               Tom sees what Jim sees.

               THEIR POV

               The Sheriff, Phil and Hank are heading toward the church, 
               flaming Molotov cocktails in their hands.

               EXT. SIDE OF CHURCH

               The Sheriff, Phil and Hank heave the flaming Molotov 
               cocktails.

               THE ROOF

               The bottles hit, explode. Sheets of fire rain down the roof.

               ONE BOTTLE

               Smashes through a window.

               INT. CHURCH

               Tom and Jim duck down as...

               THE BOTTLE

               Flies across the inside of the church and smashes against a 
               wall, sending sheets of fire down the wall.

               EXT. CHURCH

               The roof is on fire.

               EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Modest, two-story, on a side street. The front door is open; 
               the boat tied up outside. There's a light on in the front 
               hall.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Karen is unconscious. Wayne has her laying on the stairs 
               leading up from the entry area to the second floor. There's 
               three feet of water in the house. Karen's legs are in the 
               water. Her hands are handcuffed to a railing attached to the 
               wall, running up the stairs. Wayne stands over Karen, pats 
               her face.

                                     WAYNE
                         Wakey-wakey.

               Karen stirs, then starts slipping back into unconsciousness, 
               so Wayne splashes her face with water. Karen comes to, 
               sputtering. Her eyes focus. She looks up at Wayne. Wayne 
               grins.

                                     WAYNE
                         Dear Penthouse: I always thought 
                         your letters were fake, until the 
                         wildest thing happened to me. I'm a 
                         policeman in a small town. In the 
                         middle of the big flood last year, I 
                         was patrolling the streets in a boat, 
                         feeling kind of sorry for myself -- 
                         'cause it was my birthday and all -- 
                         when I saw the front door to a house 
                         was open. I pulled my gun -- afraid 
                         it might be looters. Imagine my 
                         surprise when, instead of a looter, 
                         I find a young woman handcuffed to 
                         the railing of her stairs. Her name 
                         was Karen, and ever since she came 
                         back from college she'd made it clear 
                         she was too good for any of us local 
                         folk. Now here she was, in handcuffs! 
                         I said, "What the heck is going on 
                         here, ma'am?" And she said...

               Karen says nothing. Wayne leans in close.

                                     WAYNE
                         And she said...

                                     KAREN
                         Sorry, Wayne, but I'm not playing a 
                         part in your sick little play.

               Wayne pulls his gun, puts it to Karen's head.

                                     WAYNE
                         You're perfect for the role. I suggest 
                         you reconsider.

                                     KAREN
                         Or what? You'll kill me? You're gonna 
                         do that anyway.

                                     WAYNE
                         I might get clumsy. It might take a 
                         while.

                                     KAREN
                         I'm sure you can hurt me. But it's 
                         all going to be the same when I'm 
                         dead.

               Wayne straightens up, looks at her, then launches back into 
               it.

                                     WAYNE
                         And she said, "Happy Birthday, Wayne. 
                         I've got something for you." Well, 
                         I'm not stupid. I knew what she wanted 
                         to give me and I knew she wanted to 
                         give it bad, so I --

               THE OVERHEAD LIGHT

               Sparks and goes out.

                                     WAYNE
                              (looks up at light)
                         That won't do. Man's gotta see what 
                         he's doing. 'Scuse me.

               Wayne heads off for the kitchen. The second he's gone...

               KAREN

               Raises her hips and digs a hand into her pocket and pulls 
               out her Swiss Army knife. She pries open the big blade. She 
               hears Wayne sloshing back toward her. She gets back into the 
               position Wayne left her in as...

               WAYNE

               Re-enters carrying two burning candles in candle-holders.

                                     WAYNE
                         I got the candles. All's we need is 
                         a cake.

               He sets the candles down on a dry step above Karen's head. 
               He leans in close.

                                     WAYNE
                         Mood lighting. You in the mood yet?
                              (no answer from Karen; 
                              back into Penthouse 
                              letter)
                         And then she said, "My present's 
                         ready and waiting. All's you gotta 
                         do is unwrap it."

               Wayne reaches into the water, undoes Karen's rain pants, 
               yanks off her shoes, then pulls off her pants. He throws 
               them over the banister. Karen remains passive, blank. Wayne 
               takes off his holster; hangs it on the banister. Then he 
               pushes his pants down to his ankles. His shirttail is long 
               enough so that we don't have to see his wretched little 
               pecker. He climbs on top of Karen in the water, brings his 
               face close to hers.

                                     WAYNE
                         It was cold and rainy that birthday 
                         night, and all I wanted was to get 
                         someplace warm and dry. As it turned 
                         out, what I really wanted was 
                         something warm and wet. Wayne grins 
                         and closes for a kiss and...

               KAREN'S HAND

               Moves fast with the knife and...

               WAYNE'S EYES

               Pop open wide.

               WAYNE

               His head jerks back. He tries to shout, but all that comes 
               out is an awful gurgle. He tries to push off Karen, but...

               KAREN

               Wraps her legs around him, holds him close, pinning him.

               WAYNE

               Finally breaks free. He tries to stop the bleeding with a 
               hand, but the blood spurts through his fingers. He reaches 
               for his gun in his holster on the banister, but just as he 
               grabs it...

               KAREN

               Lashes out of the water with her legs, kicking Wayne in the 
               groin, pushing him back.

               WAYNE

               Tries to get his balance, but his feet can't move -- his 
               pants are around his ankles. He falls back into the water, 
               firing his pistol.

               BULLETS

               Blow chunks out of the wall next to Karen, hit the ceiling 
               and...

               WAYNE

               Is floating on his back, trying to lift the pistol, but his 
               strength is fading fast. He gets off one last shot and...

               THE CANDLE

               Nearest Karen is blown to pieces.

               WAYNE

               The gun drops into the water. No more shots. No more life. 
               He floats, pants around his ankles, covered in blood, dead.

                                     KAREN
                         Happy Birthday, Wayne.

               EXT. STREET AND CHURCH

               The church roof is on fire.

               THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK

               Are across the street.

               INT. CHURCH

               Jim and Tom hear a creaking and look up.

               THE CEILING

               The fire has eaten holes in the roof. Embers come down.

               EXT. CHURCH AND STREET

               The Sheriff is getting very agitated.

                                     SHERIFF
                         They're not coming out, Hank!

                                     HANK
                         The fire's not catching. The rain's 
                         too --

                                     SHERIFF
                         We have to get them! We have to kill 
                         them! Do you understand? If they're 
                         not dead, we got jack shit!

               INT. CHURCH

               A small chunk of burning ceiling drops down. Jim and Tom 
               look up. Just then...

               BRIGHT LIGHT

               Floods into the church through...

               THE STAINED GLASS WINDOWS

               Filling the church with a kaleidoscope of colors.

               TOM AND JIM

               Look out the windows.

                                     TOM
                         My God they're beautiful.

               THE STAINED GLASS WINDOWS

               Remain beautiful for a few more seconds until they shatter 
               and blow inwards as...

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT AND HANK'S BOAT

               Come crashing through.

               THE BOATS

               Land, stop fast. The Sheriff's boat lands closer to the 
               pulpit; Hank's boat closer to the balcony.

               THE SHERIFF, HANK AND PHIL

               Look around. It's quiet for a moment. There's no sign of Tom 
               and Jim.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Karen has her pants back on. She reaches out with one foot 
               and hooks Wayne's holster off the banister. She flips it 
               through the air and catches it with her hands. She opens 
               little leather pockets -- mace, more bullets. No keys. Karen 
               starts to panic.

                                     KAREN
                         There have to be keys. There --

               She sees...

               WAYNE

               Still floating on his back, still dead. She looks closer 
               at...

               WAYNE'S PANTS

               Bunched around his ankles. And there, hanging from a belt-
               loop is a ring of keys.

               KAREN

               Reaches out with her foot for Wayne's pants. She can't reach.

               WAYNE

               Is slowly drifting out the open door. Beyond the door, in 
               the light of the streetlamp, the water is riffling, moving, 
               and Wayne is heading toward it.

               KAREN

               Slides down further on the stairs, into the water, then stops.

               CLOSE ON HANDCUFFS AND RAILING

               There are metal supports going from the railing to the wall, 
               every three feet. Karen is prevented from going any further 
               down the stairs by one of these supports.

               KAREN

               Reaches out with a foot, straining, stretching her body, 
               almost dislocating her shoulder and...

               HER FOOT

               Just barely touches one of Wayne's feet, but then Wayne's 
               foot slips away and...

               KAREN

               Can only watch as...

               WAYNE

               Drifts out the door and is pulled away by the current.

               EXT. RESERVOIR DAM

               Water is cascading over the top of the dam. Chunks of concrete 
               are washing away.

               INT. CHURCH

               The Sheriff, Phil and Wayne scan the water, looking for 
               movement.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Where are they?! Jesus!

               UNDERWATER POV

               Looking up through a tangle of floating pews at the wavering 
               silhouettes of the boats and the men in them against the 
               burning timbers above.

               TWO PISTOLS

               Come into view, pointed up through the water.

               ON THE WATER

               The Sheriff, Phil and Hank have let down their guard for a 
               second when there's a series of dull, muted clacks from 
               underwater as...

               BULLETS

               Come streaking out of the water, winging by them, plugging 
               into the boats.

               UNDERWATER

               Jim fires the pistols, the bullets' bubble streaks knifing 
               up through the water.

               THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK

               hit the deck in their boats, returning fire over the gunwales.

               TOM

               Surfaces over by the stairs up to the balcony, gasping for 
               air. He runs for the stairs.

               BLAZING TIMBERS

               Start to fall from the burning roof frame, hitting the water 
               with loud sizzling hisses.

               THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK

               Turn to shoot at tom through the dropping flaming debris.

               TOM

               Disappears up the stairs, the bullets just missing him.

               UNDERWATER

               Jim runs out of bullets. He's long since run out of air. He 
               drops his guns and swims under the pews.

               HANK

               Looks up, realizing that Tom will be able to shoot down on 
               him. He reverses his boat fast under the balcony as...

               TOM

               Shoots down from the balcony, blowing a chunk out of the 
               prow of Hank's boat.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               The water is up to Karen's chin. Her hands are working 
               frantically beneath the water.

               UNDERWATER

               She's using the tip of the knife blade to unscrew the screws 
               holding the support to the railing. She's on the last one. 
               The blade slips, misses, gets a quarter turn, another quarter 
               turn...

               KAREN

               Spits out the water that spills into her mouth.

               UNDERWATER

               Another quarter-turn and the screw is loose enough to turn 
               by hand.

               KAREN

               Holds her breath with the water touching her nose. She gets 
               the screw loose, pulls up on the railing and pulls the 
               handcuff through the gap between the support and the railing.

               INT. CHURCH

               The Sheriff turns to Phil and nods re: Jim.

                                     SHERIFF
                         You take care of him!

               The Sheriff aims at the balcony as Phil scans the water, 
               looking for Jim.

               UNDERWATER

               Jim pulls an electrical cord out of a wall socket.

               ON THE BALCONY

               Tom ducks down as the Sheriff's bullets start plugging through 
               the wood front of the balcony. Tom moves away from the bullet 
               strikes, splashing through the water in the balcony.

               CLOSE ON BALCONY FLOOR

               As BANG BANG BANG -- bullets start shooting up from below.

               HANK

               Is firing up at Tom through the floor of the balcony.

               TOM

               Jumps back, startled, looking down at...

               THE BALCONY FLOOR

               Holes explode in the floor, sending up small geysers of water. 
               The water then starts whirlpooling down through the holes.

               TOM

               Moves back from hank's advancing bullet holes.

               THE SHERIFF

               Keeps firing.

               TOM

               Is caught between Hank's bullets and the Sheriff's bullets. 
               So he racks a load in the shotgun and dives backwards off 
               the balcony.

               HANK

               Is still shooting up as...

               TOM

               Arcs off the balcony, firing the shotgun under the balcony 
               at Hank.

               HANK

               Dives to the floor of his boat as Tom's shotgun blasts blow 
               plate-sized holes in the church doors.

               TOM

               Lands in the water and goes under.

               THE SHERIFF AND PHIL

               Look for Tom in the water.

               HANK

               Starts to get up from the bottom of his boat, searching for 
               a clip for his gun.

               THE SHERIFF

               Sees Tom's shape in the water and is about to shoot when...

               JIM

               Jumps up out of the water with the electrical cord. He tosses 
               a loop of the cord around the Sheriff's neck and pulls, 
               yanking the Sheriff out of the boat.

               TOM

               Comes out of the water, aiming his shotgun at...

               PHIL

               Who is aiming his pistol at Tom. Phil freezes.

               THE SHERIFF AND JIM

               Struggle in the water. Jim pulls the cord tightly around the 
               Sheriff's neck as the Sheriff tries to get a shot off at Jim -- 
               he can't get the barrel pointed at Jim.

               HANK

               Fumbles with the bullet clip.

                                     HANK
                              (to Phil)
                         Kill him!

               TOM

               Turns his shotgun on Hank and pulls the trigger -- click. Uh-
               oh.

                                     HANK
                         Kill him!

               TOM AND PHIL

               Exchange a look.

               HANK

               Slams the clip into his gun and levels it at Tom.

               PHIL

               Points his gun at Hank.

                                     PHIL
                         No! We can't --

               BANG! and hank shoots Phil. Phil pitches back out of the 
               Sheriff's boat.

               PHIL

               Lands between Jim and the Sheriff, knocking them apart.

               THE SHERIFF

               Is free of Jim's grasp. He shakes off the electrical cord 
               and turns to shoot...

               JIM

               Who moves a little faster. He grabs Phil's pistol and puts 
               it to the Sheriff's head before the Sheriff can bring his 
               gun around.

               HANK

               Draws a bead on Jim and is about to shoot when...

               TOM

               Comes out of the water on the other side of Hank's boat. Tom 
               pushes down hard on the side of the boat.

               HANK

               Is rocked back, thrown off balance. He starts to spin and 
               bring his gun around when...

               TOM

               Swings with the shotgun, catching...

               HANK

               In the side of the head. Hank crumples and falls into the 
               water, taking his rifle with him.

               JIM AND THE SHERIFF

               Jim nods at the Sheriff's rifle.

                                     JIM
                         In the boat.

               THE SHERIFF

               Hesitates, then tosses his rifle into the boat.

               TOM

               Grabs Hank's rifle and aims it at the Sheriff.

                                     TOM
                         Where's Karen?

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Karen undoes a last screw in a metal support.

               She pulls the handcuff through the gap between the support 
               and railing. She's at the top of the stairs.

               THE END OF THE RAILING

               Curves and goes into the wall.

               KAREN

               Tugs at the railing, tries rocking it up and down. It doesn't 
               budge. She starts chipping at the plaster with the knife.

                                     KAREN
                         God, I am really beginning to hate 
                         fine craftsmanship.

               THE WATER

               It's up to her chest.

               INT. CHURCH

               The Sheriff hesitates.

                                     TOM
                         Where is she?

                                     SHERIFF
                         They went back to her house.

                                     TOM
                         Where's her house?

                                     SHERIFF
                         It's --

               And just then they all hear something truly ominous -- a 
               siren pierces the night.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               She reacts to the siren -- uh-oh.

               INT. CHURCH

               The siren wails.

                                     JIM
                         What in God's name is that?

                                     SHERIFF
                         Hank?

                                     HANK
                              (woozy but okay)
                         It's topped out.

                                     SHERIFF
                         How much time we got?

                                     HANK
                         How should I know?

                                     SHERIFF
                         Guess!

                                     HANK
                         It's an old dam! Not long.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (to Tom)
                         Then I'd say you boys better drop 
                         your guns.

                                     TOM
                         What?

                                     SHERIFF
                         That's the deal! You let me and Hank 
                         go -- with a few of these bags -- 
                         and I'll tell you where to find Karen.

                                     JIM
                              (to the Sheriff)
                         Get out of the boat.

                                     TOM
                         Hold on.

               Jim turns to look at Tom.

                                     JIM
                         Hold on?

                                     SHERIFF
                         It's the only way you're gonna find 
                         her!

                                     TOM
                         It's only a couple of bags.

                                     JIM
                         No.

                                     TOM
                         But I thought --

                                     JIM
                         Look, I don't know what you thought 
                         but I told you, I'm here for the 
                         money; that's all.

               Tom doesn't know what to do. The Sheriff looks pretty pleased 
               with himself. He might just get out of this. And then...

                                     PHIL (O.S.)
                         She lives on Boyd Street.

               They all look over at...

               PHIL

               Alive, but barely.

                                     PHIL
                         Three over. Two-story, blue shutters.

               TOM

               Looks at Jim, disappointed, angry, then hurries to Hank's 
               boat.

               JIM

               Climbs into the Sheriff's boat.

               TOM

               Climbs into Hank's boat. He starts the engine, looks down 
               at...

               PHIL

               Floating in the water, dying. A brief look between them, 
               then...

               TOM

               Drives the boat out through a shattered window.

               JIM

               Pushes the Sheriff out of the boat.

               EXT. RESERVOIR DAM

               A large V is being cut in the top of the dam by the raging 
               water.

               A QUARTER-MILE AWAY

               Looking back at the dam. The line of lights on top of the 
               dam start to fall over, then go dark, snuffed out by an unseen 
               force.

               INT. CHURCH

               Jim keeps his gun leveled at the Sheriff and Hank, standing 
               in the water, as he pulls the money bags up from the forward 
               hold.

                                     SHERIFF
                         So, you just gonna kill me?

                                     JIM
                         Lord knows I should.

               Jim opens a money bag and smiles at what he sees.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Karen tilts her head back to keep her lips and nose above 
               water. And then she hears a window smash. She turns as...

               TOM

               Wades in along the upper hall.

                                     TOM
                         I'm guessing you can't get up.

                                     KAREN
                         I'm handcuffed.

               Tom reaches into the water for the railing.

                                     KAREN
                         The railing's bolted to the wall.

               He looks at her.

                                     KAREN
                         I've got a saw.

                                     TOM
                         Where?

                                     KAREN
                         In the kitchen. In the tall cupboard 
                         beside the --

               And then they hear a sound more ominous than the siren -- 
               they hear the siren stop.

                                     TOM
                         Is that good or bad?

               INT. CHURCH

               Jim, the Sheriff and Hank react to the silence. Jim looks 
               off.

               THE SHERIFF

               Drops underwater.

               JIM

               Turns back at the sound of the Sheriff going under.

               UNDERWATER

               The Sheriff pulls up his pant leg.

               JIM

               Is aiming his gun at the water and is about to fire as...

               THE SHERIFF'S HAND

               Comes out of the water shooting a pistol.

               JIM

               Is shot in the gut and the thigh and high on the chest and 
               he stumbles back, bellowing, and falls out of the Sheriff's 
               boat and into the water.

                                     SHERIFF
                         You should've just killed me.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

                                     KAREN
                         You gotta go!

               Tom starts hyperventilating.

                                     KAREN
                         The dam's gone! You gotta go!

                                     TOM
                              (shakes head)
                         I owe you one.

               Tom breathes deep then ducks underwater.

               UNDERWATER

               Tom flicks on his flashlight and starts swimming down the 
               stairs.

               KAREN

               Watches Tom and his light get swallowed up in the murky water.

               INT. CHURCH

               Phil is grabbing for the Sheriff's boat as the Sheriff and 
               Hank zoom out of the church, leaving him behind.

                                     PHIL
                         NOOOO!

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               The Sheriff's boat comes onto Main Street, moving fast.

               IN THE BOAT

               Hank is looking back, in the direction the flood will come.

                                     HANK
                         We gotta go faster!

                                     SHERIFF
                         Yeah, you're right.

               The Sheriff pushes Hank out of the boat.

               HANK

               Goes skipping over the water and slams into a streetlight 
               post.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Tom swims down into the living room. His light shows a couch, 
               chairs, TV set. Books and newspapers are suspended in the 
               water.

               EXT. THE CHURCH

               The damaged ski-boat that Jim and Tom took to the church has 
               slipped off the sandbag wall and is drifting. A peaceful 
               scene. But then, from the distance, comes a rushing roar.

               INT. CHURCH

               Phil hears the roar. He looks around, lost.

               EXT. STREET

               Hank, groggy in the water, also hears the distant roar.

               INT. CHURCH

               The roar is building, getting louder. Phil sees something in 
               the water and reaches for it, frantically. He gets it. It's...

               A BIBLE

               And he clutches it to his chest as...

               THE FLOOD

               Hits the church.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN

               Tom swims into the kitchen. He looks for the tall cupboard 
               by the fridge. He opens it.

               INSIDE THE CUPBOARD

               Hanging on a hook on the back wall is a saw. Tom grabs it.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               Hank unwraps himself from around the lamp post. He looks 
               back.

               HIS POV

               Streetlights in the distance, winking out one by one, marking 
               the advance of the wall of water.

                                     HANK
                         Oh my God.

               Hank looks around for safety. He sees it.

               HIS POV

               There's an alleyway.

               HANK

               Swims for the alley.

               EXT. THE ADVANCING FLOOD

               Roars through the town, pushing a rolling wave of debris, 
               obliterating anything in its path.

               EXT. ALLEY

               Hank swims into the alley. Hank looks for something to climb 
               up on, to hold onto. There's...

               FIRE ESCAPE LADDER

               At the end of the alley.

               HANK

               Swims for it. He hears the rushing roar of the advancing 
               flood. He expects the flood to blow by the end of the alley. 
               Wrong.

               WALL OF WATER

               Comes into the alley, banking high on the far wall before 
               coming down and barreling toward Hank. And what makes it 
               worse for Hank is that there's...

               A CAR

               At the front of the wave, being pushed by the water.

               HANK

               Dives clear just as...

               THE CAR

               Smashes into the wall, right where Hank had just been.

               HANK

               Relief in his eyes. He gets to the fire escape and is climbing 
               to safety when...

               PROPANE TANK

               Comes into the alley, rolling in the flood, spraying propane 
               from a torn hose. It explodes.

               HANK

               Barely has time to scream.

               INT. KAREN'S KITCHEN - BREAK OF DAWN

               Tom is threading his belt through the handle of the saw to 
               secure it. He gets it done and starts to swim out of the 
               kitchen.

               BACK TO KAREN

               Just Karen's lips and nose are above water.

               IN THE KITCHEN

               Tom is about to leave when everything starts to move -- 
               rocking, from side to side, as if in a slow motion earthquake. 
               Cupboards and the fridge open and bottles and food and plates 
               tumble out.

               EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               The house has been hit by the flood. It's being pulled by 
               the massive current, stretching overhead phone and power 
               lines.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Karen hears the groaning, ripping as the house tears free 
               from water and sewer lines. She's looking down for Tom when 
               there's a snap and the light above her goes out.

               EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               The house is carried on the current, turning in the water.

               IN THE KITCHEN

               Tom watches, astounded, as the room starts to turn around 
               him. He kicks fast for the door to...

               THE LIVING ROOM

               Tom swims in, fast, toward the stairs when...

               A WINDOW

               Caves in and...

               HUGE TREE BRANCH

               Smashes in, filling the room, blocking Tom's route to the 
               stairs.

               TOM

               Tries to get through the tangle of branches and leaves, but 
               can't. He swims over to another window and slides it up.

               KAREN

               Keeps looking down for Tom.

               EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               The house is impaled on a tree, the current sluicing around 
               it.

               TOM

               Surfaces near the side of the house, gasping. The current 
               starts ripping him past the house. He swims as hard as he 
               can back to the house, reaches out and grabs onto a gutter.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Karen doesn't have much time left. The water is washing over 
               her mouth and nose. And just as she's about to go under...

               TOM

               Swims in with the saw. He starts sawing on the handrail. 
               Everything's going fine. And then...

               THE SAWBLADE

               Snaps.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Look at each other. Oh no. Karen's going under.

               TOM

               Sees something. He dives into the water.

               KAREN

               Can only watch and wait. What's he doing? Oh, Jesus. And 
               then...

               TOM

               Surfaces, holding Wayne's pistol. He puts the mouth of the 
               barrel to the handcuff chain, shields Karen's face, looks 
               away and pulls the trigger.

               EXT. A TREE IN WATER

               The water swirls through the branches of a half-submerged 
               tree.

               HENRY AND DOREEN

               Are in the tree. Henry is either unconscious or dead. Doreen 
               cradles him.

                                     DOREEN
                         Come on, Henry. Forget that "Go to 
                         the light" crap. Come back to me. 
                         You're all I've got.

               And Henry starts to come to.

                                     DOREEN
                         Oh, Henry. Thank God.

               Henry opens his eyes.

                                     HENRY
                         Next time, when I say "Let's 
                         evacuate," we're gonna evacuate.

                                     DOREEN
                         Whatever you say, honey.

               She hugs him tight and after a beat he hugs her back.

               EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Tom and Karen swim out of a second floor window, grab the 
               rain gutter. Tom pulls himself onto the roof then grabs Karen 
               and helps her up. They crawl until they're clear of the edge. 
               Only the sloped roof of the house is visible in the swirling 
               water. They are just catching their breath when they are hit 
               by...

               BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT

               And they look to see...

               THE SHERIFF

               In his boat, shining a searchlight on them with one hand, a 
               gun in the other. He starts shooting.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Tom pushes Karen toward the peak of the roof as the bullets 
               plug in around them. Tom pushes Karen over the top then turns 
               and dives off the roof and into the water.

               KAREN

               Hears an engine behind her and turns.

               A BOAT

               Racing toward the house. It's...

               THE SKI-BOAT

               And at the controls is...

               JIM

               Barely alive.

               THE OUTBOARD MOTOR

               Is wobbling, vibrating at the back of the boat, almost loose 
               from its moorings.

               JIM'S POV

               He sees Karen, crouched below the peak of the house, a bright 
               light coming from the other side along with gunshots.

               JIM

               Pushes the throttle all the way forward.

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Shoots forward.

               UNDERWATER

               Tom swims hard toward the Sheriff's boat.

               THE SHERIFF

               Is shooting down into the water at Tom's moving shape.

               THE SKI-BOAT

               With Jim at the wheel, comes racing straight toward the house.

               KAREN

               Thinks he's going to turn.

                                     KAREN
                         No! No!

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Doesn't turn.

               KAREN

               Rolls to the side, just getting clear as...

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Hits the sloping roof of Karen's house and ramps up it.

               THE OUTBOARD MOTOR

               Digs into the shingles of the roof and tears free from the 
               back of the boat.

               THE SHERIFF

               Hears the sound and looks up as...

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Comes over the peak of the roof.

               TOM

               Surfaces to see...

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Fly right over him, heading straight for...

               THE SHERIFF

               Who ducks down, just in time as...

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Misses him, landing just past him in the water.

               THE SHERIFF

               Straightens up, grinning with glee that the boat missed him. 
               And then he hears a piercing whine coming from behind him. 
               He turns, just in time to see...

               THE OUTBOARD MOTOR

               Flipping end over end, propeller whirring, heading straight 
               for him.

               THE SHERIFF

               Starts to scream.

               CLOSE ON KAREN

               Looking over the peak of the roof in horror. She hears the 
               Sheriff's scream and the scream of the propeller and then a 
               horrible ugly ripping and both screams stop.

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

               The Sheriff is gone. The side has been smashed out of the 
               boat and the boat is flooding with water.

               THE SHERIFF

               Is just some misshapen thing trailing red, floating in the 
               water.

               JIM

               Tries to restart the ski-boat but it's dead. He slumps 
               forward.

               TOM

               Sees Jim slump against the side of the boat.

                                     TOM
                         You okay?

                                     JIM
                         Fine.

               Tom can tell Jim's anything but. Tom swims for the boat.

               THE BOAT

               Tom swims up, pulls himself in. He pulls Jim back off the 
               controls, sees the blood.

                                     TOM
                         Oh, God. We gotta get you to --

               Jim looks at Tom. Tom understands -- Jim's not going anywhere.

                                     TOM
                         Thanks.

                                     JIM
                         For what?

                                     TOM
                         You just saved our lives.

                                     JIM
                         I did? I just came for the money.

               Tom looks at Jim -- he knows Jim's lying.

                                     KAREN (O.S.)
                         Do you need any help?

                                     JIM
                              (grabs Tom's arm)
                         No. Tell her to stay back.

                                     TOM
                              (to Karen)
                         It's okay!

               Jim lets go of Tom.

                                     JIM
                         You're going to turn it in?

                                     TOM
                         Sorry to disappoint you.

                                     JIM
                         Well, hell, then I guess I better 
                         take it after all. I figure the 
                         river'll carry me down to the Gulf 
                         of Mexico. If I catch the right 
                         currents, maybe I'll end up in... 
                         Belize?
                              (Tom nods)
                         You come look me up. I'll buy you a 
                         drink.

                                     TOM
                         I'll do that.

               Jim grimaces as he's hit by a wave of pain. He looks away.

                                     JIM
                         Go.

               Tom hesitates for a second.

                                     JIM
                         Please.

               Tom turns and slides into the water and swims away.

                                     JIM
                         Son, don't think too badly of your 
                         Uncle Charlie. He always said you 
                         were capable of remarkable things.
                              (beat)
                         He was right.

               There's a last look between Jim and Tom, then Tom swims away.

                                     JIM
                              (smiles)
                         The rain's stopped.
                              (breathes deep)
                         The air after a rain...

               Jim slowly topples forward and is still.

               TOM

               Swims through the swirling current toward Karen's roof.

               JIM'S BOAT

               Sinks below the surface and is gone.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Karen is down at the water's edge with her arm extended to 
               Tom. Tom grabs it, and as Karen pulls...

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               EXT. CHURCH - SUNSET

               Karen pulls Tom up onto scaffolding running along the edge 
               of the new roof under construction. Tom holds a paper bag. 
               He's wearing work gear -- tool belt, work boots, etc. Tom 
               looks at the work being done on the roof.

                                     TOM
                         They got a lot done today.

                                     KAREN
                         It's coming along.
                              (re: bag)
                         What'd you get?

                                     TOM
                         Barbecue chicken from Lilly's.

                                     KAREN
                         Yum.

                                     TOM
                         You want some? I wish you'd told me. 
                         I woulda got more.

                                     KAREN
                         Ha ha.

               And as they sit down and start to eat, the camera begins to 
               PULL BACK.

                                     TOM
                         I talked to Mikey. He says the 
                         flooring should be in by Friday.

                                     KAREN
                         That's what he said last week.

                                     TOM
                         I said if it wasn't here by Friday 
                         at six that you were going to go 
                         over and beat the crap out of him.

                                     KAREN
                         And I will.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

EXT. CEDARS-SINAI - WIDE - DAY

A monolith with alienating foregrounds. A bus pulls in on
Beverly. NEIL McCAULEY and a nurse get off. Neil carries
a paper bag and wears white pants like a hospital attendant.
Neil is an ice-cold professional: very big, very tough.
At 42 his short black hair is graying. He spent eight
years in McNeil and three in San Quentin. He got out and
hit the street in 1987. Four of the McNeil years were
spent in the hole. Neil's voice is street, but his language
is precise like an engineer's. He's very careful and very
good. Neil runs a professional crew that pulls down high
line, high number scores and does it anyway the score has
to be taken down: if on the prowl (a burglary), that's
fine; if they have to go in strong (armed), that's fine
too. And if you get in their way, that's got to be your
problem. His lifestyle is obsessively functional. There's
no steady woman or any encumbrance. Neil McCauley keeps
it so there's nothing he couldn't walk from in 30 seconds
flat.

ANGLE

Right now, he enters the big double doors and pulls a white
intern's coat from his paper bag.

INT. CEDARS-SINAI CORRIDOR - TRAVELING TWO SHOT - DAY

We DOLLY on Neil as he crosses through the long crowded
corridor. Patients, nurses, interns and doctors pass by.
A P.A. broadcasts occasional messages.

PROFILE

Nail crosses under an "EMERGENCY" sign and keeps going
towards the exit doors.

TRAVELING - FRONTAL

Neil APPROACHES THE CAMERA. From the other direction two
ambulance attendants wheel an old man under oxygen and
pass by Neil.

                                                  CUT TO:

WIDE REAR SHOT

Without breaking his stride from the moment he got off the
bus, Neil exits through the doors, examines four ambulances
parked in the slots, climbs into one and drives off. Maybe
he's stolen it. We don't know.

EXT. R & C CONSTRUCTION SUPPLIES - ON CHRIS - DAY

CHRIS SHIHERLIS crosses past stacks of gravel and cement
with a white-coated BLACK CLERK. Chris wears a hard hat
over a mongol cut, Levi's, black boots and a sleeveless
sweat shirt and carries on one shoulder a 150 lb., red,
Milwaukee Tool Company case. He looks like a construction
worker by day who by night hits L.A's slams, jams and raves.
He's 29, from Austin, Texas. Chris is also a highline
pro: a boxman who knows five ways to open any safe made.
Right now he's buying a hollow core drill. He and McCauley
were cellmates in San Quentin Penitentiary from 1984 to
1987. Chris hit the streets in 1988. He's a hot dog and
spends money as fast as he makes it. Right now, he and
the Clerk exit to the sales counter.

                                                    CUT TO:

As they approach, the Clerk goes behind it.

                      CLERK
          What you working on?

                      CLERK
              (re: toolcase)
          With that you can ream solid
          steel. Check, charge, or cash?

                       CHRIS
          Cash. Put "Jack's Fencing" on
          the receipt.

INT. "TOYS 'R' US STORE" - ON CERRITO - DAY

MICHAEL CERRITO - at 40 - is looking at a doll house.
He's a wide, thick, coarse-featured big man. Sicilian
from Sunnyside, he's spent 15 years in Attica, Joliet and
Marion penitentiaries. He's strictly a "cowboy": his
natural inclination towards a score is "...get the guns
and let's go." He's been off smack and everything else
for five years. He's clean and sober. He's the nicest
guy on the block and a loving father. If you get in his
way, he'll kill you as soon as look at you. If you asked
him about the contradictions, he wouldn't know what you
were talking about.

CLOSE OR DOLL HOUSE DETAILS

It's 3 x 6 and two feet high. Miniature room sets are
inside. Cerrito's thick fingers close the door. He picks
it up. WIDEN. He crosses to a counter and MIDDLE-AGED
CLERK.

          Wrap this here up.

                      CLERK
          Yessir. You're going to have a
          happy little girl.

          That's nice.

                       CERRITO
          Yeah. And gimme those three
          masks there.

Clerk takes down Clark Gable, Three-eyed Monster, and
Beautiful Lady, full-head rubber masks.

   Yeah. Their m.o. is that they

   number three 'cause it didn't
   rake any difference anymore, so
   why leave a living witness?
   Drop of a hat? They'll rock and
   roll. Also: the way they went

            The plates are mezzotints. They
            evoke a feeling Japanese painters
            called "sabi". They believed
            there were eight scenes of
            transcendental loneliness. They
            painted them over and over again.
            One is a flock of geese hovering
            over a field. There's always
            mist. It's painted just as the
            leader touches down.

          A bank. On Thursdays it gets
          cash deposits for distribution
          to other branches. The branches
          have to buttress their cash

Hanna rises. The mother's arguing with the man cop because

shock. She pushes the uniformed cop of the way. Hanna

crawls under the pick-up and   Neil's car and emerges on the
passenger side behind Neil's   rear wheel in Neil's blind

Waingro winds up and cracks the girl.     She knocks over a

Bartender writes on a cocktail napkin.

Waingro flips the Bartender a $20.

                       WAINGRO
          Thanks.

Another woman takes Waingro's eyes. He spins around on
his bar stool and grabs her arm as she passes. Big smile.
Its...

Breedan's woman. She, too, is a dancer and her shift's

He clicks off makes a drinking motion to...

HANNA

...who shakes his head "no." He puts a finger over his
lips meaning silence. Hanna looks at the clock. It's
12:03 a.m. Hanna takes a deep breath. He closes and opens
his eyes. They wait.

EXT. ALLEY - WIDE ON ALLEY - LATER

Nothing. Then the Pontiac with its lights off rolls
forward. Chris gets out with a salesman's sample case and
pads down the five steps to the rear entry of the jewelry
store. Chris is in a black suit and sneakers. There are
surgical gloves on his hands. The others stay in the car.

TIGHTER: CHRIS

assembles a heavy lock punch from the black case.      It's
formidable. He nods.

CERRITO

the telephone pole  like an experienced lineman. The
telephone pole is  next to the roof upon which Jackson and

Cerrito are aware of each other.

EXT. ROOF - JACKSON

Doesn't know Cerrito is there. He hears BREATHING. He's
curious. He raises his head over the edge and his eyes go
wide. WIDEN. He's inches from the back of Cerrito's head.
Cerrito twists and turns and jerks back in effort - almost
touching Jackson. Cerrito's too absorbed to sense Jackson's
presence. Jackson carefully closes his eyes and sinks
down.

EXT. EMA, INC., REAR ENTRANCE - CHRIS

He gets a nod from Cerrito.   He slams the lock punch with
a cut down sledge hammer.

tumblers and "gates."

the mechanism.

          I got an idea what they're looking
          at. You know what they're looking

Hanna turns his back on the rest of the detectives and a
big smile dawns upon his face. He raises his arms out
wide. Hanna turns in one direction, then another. Schwartz
doesn't understand.

VERY TIGHT ON HANNA IN 3/4 REAR SHOT

The image vibrates. Hanna says more. We don't hear it.
We HEAR a CAMERA SHUTTER CLICK. The IMAGE FOCUSES and

Hanna laughs.

EXT. KNOLL - L.S. HANNA - TWILIGHT

Pull back to reveal he's being surveilled by Neil. He's
been photographing Hanna with a black Nikon on a tripod
with a 1300Mm Questar Reflector lens. Neil's made his
tail. The recce in the blue Cadillac was bait. Neil half
returns Hanna's smile. He climbs into the Caprice. Cerrito
roars off, leaving a cloud of dust which billows into mauve

          His name is Hanna; first name,

          Lieutenant in major Crimes Unit.
          He's taken down some heavy crews.
          Blew away Frankie Yonder in

          Dedicated. Divorced three times.
          Current wife's Justine. He's
          why the extra heat.
              (pause)
          Vice sergeant says Hanna likes
          you. Thinks you're some kind of
          'star.' 'You do this sharp, you
          do that sharp. Look how sharp
          this guy is to figure that.'

Neil laughs.

              (continuing)
          Funny as a heart attack.

The adversarial intensity is eye-to-eye.

          That's part of it.

          That's nice.     That your life?

                      HANNA
          No. My wife spends half her

          stepdaughter's got problems 'cause
          her real father's a world class
          asshole. And every moment I

          in your life you're not willing
          to walk out on in 30 seconds
          flat if you feel the heat around
          the corner.

            There's a flip side to that coin.

                      DR. BOB
          You're number one with a bullet
          on the six o'clock news. It's
          at least double the risk. So
          I'm doubling my price.

Neil opens a shopping bag and stacks packets of bills.
News coverage switches to sports and weather.

                      NEIL
          You're wrong. It's four times
          the risk. 'Cause something happens
          to him, I'm coming back for you.
          And I'm double the worst trouble
          you ever had.

Bob looks at Neil's eyes and believes it.

Marciano does. Charlene seems to soften and relax and
take satisfaction at Marciano's put-down.

                        FARINA
                (continuing; soft)
            He's right. And you know it.

            Yes.

                        FARINA
            Well, you're right. You would
            be. But if you don't betray
            Chris, you betray Dominick.
            Because he becomes an orphan
            when you go to prison as an
            accessory 'cause you got no living
            parents to take him. Then he
            ends up state-raised and fucked
            for life. Your son Dominick's
            innocent. He didn't choose a
            life like that. Chris did.

Charlene rises and crosses to a bedroom and looks in the
door - presumably at Dominick.

            Give up Chris. You get off clean.

Charlene sits - shell-shocked - dressed in black with white
face and red lipstick. Marciano re-enters with a drink
for her.  Charlene looks towards the bedroom containing
Dominick, then nods her head "yes." Farina dials a number.

HANNA

rejoins her and takes her hand. He looks at her and then
at the floor. He puts an around her.

                        JUSTINE
                (really questioning)
            ...Will things change between

            Probably not...
                (beat)
            ...but I am reminded of how much
            I love you. But that may not be
            enough.

                 (kisses him)
            You have to go to work, don't
            you?

                        HANNA
                (touches her face)
            Yeah.

As he's rising.

                        JUSTINE
            Be careful, Vincent. Be very
            careful...
                (beat)
            Let's keep on trying?

HANNA

walking backwards, facing her, nods "yes." The last thing
in the world he wants to do is leave. Then he turns and
starts running down the white marble corridor...

of people leaving the floor. The emergency LIGHTING is on

flashlight on the doors of 1404, 1405 and 1406 as well as
1403.

WAINGRO'S POV: NEIL'S BACK AND CORRIDOR

A few patrons exit past the uniformed Neil.     It looks
legitimate.

Neil kicks the door and...

smashes into Waingro. Neil hits the door again and it
smashes into waingro a second time.

NEIL

reaches around, grabs Waingro by the arm, dislocates his
shoulder, breaks his collarbone and throws him across the
room. Waingro's gun goes flying.

WAINGRO

on the sofa, seeing Neil McCauley. He feels his internal
organs drop through the floor. He looks away.

Waingro won't look at Neil.

                         NEIL
                 (continuing)
             Gimme your eyes. 'Cause you're
             gonna die.

Waingro, pathetically, obeys and looks up.      Neil's .45
EXPLODES TWICE.

CLOSER: NEIL

Bosko and others spill out carrying shotguns. A black and
white parks perpendicular to the traffic flow and halts
cars. She's worried, confused.

          Three teams are moving up the

          fire alarm. Surveillance said
          McCauley looked right at 'em.
          Didn't seem surprised.

                      HANNA
              (into radio)
          It means he knew we were here

          Yeah, yeah, that's fine.   Stay
          on it. 10-4.

For some reason Hanna's disinterested. He's moving down a
different track. He's cruising the streets looking for
something else.

HANNA'S POV: SIDE STREETS

adjoining the hotel are cluttered with emergency vehicles,
cars, pedestrians, on-lookers, service people from adjoining
buildings.

HANNA'S POV: FIRE ENGINE, AMBULANCE, MERCEDES, BLACK AND
WHITE...

Then Hanna's P.O.V. PANS LEFT back to the Mercedes. The
woman waiting in the passenger seat. It is Eady. She's a
block down. A woman waiting...in a car...alone.

CLOSER: HANNA

It's what he was looking for.

EXT. STREET - WIDE

Hanna is out of the car in the jammed street, running
towards Eady and the Mercedes a block away.

her ... leaving her ...

EADY

next to the Mercedes. Shouting at Neil. We can't hear
what she says. SIRENS and NOISE of an ambulance.

HANNA

AMBULANCE pulls in front of him, blocks him. He's around
it, pushing a news crew out of the way, stops.

MERCEDES WITH EADY

in the street.    Alone.   No Neil.

HANNA

spins around, searching.

HIGH + WIDE: HANNA

in the sea of people and vehicles, crossing drivewaYs and
landscaping. Hanna - against the tide - moving away from
the crime scene and police barricades to neighboring
buildings.

FRONTAL: HANNA

through the crowd, searching.     People pushed aside so he
can see. Then...

HANNA POV: THROUGH OFFICE BUILDING LOBBY TO REAR PARKING

A figure is running between cars. Beyond are the lights
of an L1011 ten feet off the ground about to touch down.

ROARING through the frame. Reveal Neil jumping a     fence

lights.

CLOSER: HANNA

among the   structures housing the ballasts for the lights.
The ROAR   of a 757's 95,000 lbs. of thrust beats an him.
He spins   to protect his face. His clothes and hair are
whipped.    As he runs to us ...

CLOSER: HANNA

looks up..

HANNA POV: UP INTO LIGHTS SEARCHING FOR NEIL. SUDDENLY:

NEIL (SLO MO)

is there. His .45 is up, centered into Hanna's face.
He's eight feet away, framed against the glaring racks of
strobes.

NEIL'S HAND (SLO MO)

squeezing the trigger, both eyes over the front sight,
moving laterally on target through the liquid air and
lights...

The misfired round, ejected and spinning away. The new
round, moving forward, the slide returning to battery...

HANNA

FIRES THREE perfectly controlled, hammered-on SHOTS.     His
front sight barely moved.

NEIL

HIT THREE TIMES in the chest - is blown back into the racks
of lights. He lies still.

HANNA

approaches, slowly.    His gun hand drops to his side.

WIDE: NEIL + HANNA

Neil's   on the ground, his back against the rack. One arm
is in   his lap. The other is flung over the top bar of the
strobe   rack. Neil looks at Hanna and gestures with his
hand.    Hanna takes it. Neil holds on tight.

NEIL

last breath.

                        NEIL
            ...not half bad.

                        HANNA
            ...pretty good your own self.

Then Neil's eyes dim.    And he dies.

LONG REAR SHOT: HANNA + NEIL

Neil's head has fallen onto his shoulder. Hanna still
grips his hand and looks down the runway into the west at
the lines of blue runway lights like rivers. The two of
them stay there like that.

         Plan a good enough getaway, you could steal
         Ebbetts Field.

                      BERGMAN
         Ebbet's Field's gone...

                      MOORE
         What'd I tell ya...?
              (BERGMAN HANDS HIM A SLIP OF
               PAPER. OF THE SLIP OF PAPER)
         Higher than the estimate.
              (HE PASSES THE PAPER TO BLANE)

                      BERGMAN
         And half of that's yours.     You n'your team.

                      MOORE
         Yeah, why're you telling me that?

                      BERGMAN
         ...I told you we're on for the "other"
         thing? The Swiss thing?

                      MOORE
         ...why're you telling me that, Bill? That
         half of it's mine. I know half of it's
         mine. Because, you'll remember, me and my
         crew? Went in there and got it.
              (PAUSE)

                      BERGMAN

         ...you remember that?

                      BERGMAN
         It's the shot of the century.

                      MOORE
         Yeah--well, it's a shame...

                      BERGMAN
         I'm locked into it. It's such a beautiful
         deal, Joe... we waited so long.

HE PUTS HIS ARM AROUND MOORE, AND WALKS HIM INTO THE OUTER OFFICE,
WHERE WE SEE BLANE AND BELLA AND SEVERAL BODYGUARD TYPES.

               FROM HIS DESK.)
         This Swiss thing? After how long we
         waited...?

                      MOORE
         Woulda shoulda coulda.

                      BERGMAN
         ...I was a publisher man, I'd publish the
         plans... it's the Mona Lisa.

                      MOORE
         You're too kind.

                      BLANE
         Why don't you publish the plans?

                      BERGMAN
         Yeah, no, I'm saying, that's what I would do,
         f'I was in the book business. Unfortunately,
         I'm a thief, so, I have to do that thing.
         You understand... Joe:

                      MOORE
         What is it I understand...?

                      BERGMAN
         You understand my position.

                      MOORE
         Here's mine? I did the job. Me and my
         crew. We brought you the swag, we're going to
         take our cut.

                      BERGMAN
         Well, look here, it's the Golden   Rule. You

                        MOORE
         Alright.

                      BERGMAN
         You'll do the job?

                      MOORE
         That's right.

                      BERGMAN
         I'm sorry I put you in a position.

                      MOORE
         It's very sporting of you to say so.

                        BERGMAN
         Well...

                      MOORE
         I'm going to need some walking-around money.
              (BERGMAN NODS)
         And I'm going to need my men's share, on the
         last job.

                      BERGMAN
         That's not unreasonable.

                      MOORE (cont'd)
         Give it to me
               (HE HOLDS OUT HIS HAND.)

                        BERGMAN
         ...now?

                      MOORE
         ...you got it in your pocket.

BERGMAN SIGHS, TAKES OUT AN ENVELOPE, AND SHOWS IT TO MOORE.

                      BERGMAN
         ...you're ahead of me every turn.    How about
         that.

                        MOORE
         ...stunning.

                      BERGMAN
         ...the date holds, you got the shipment on the
         fourteenth.

                      MOORE
         ...how do I insure my cut?

                                                               26.


                      BERGMAN
         I swear to you...

                      MOORE
         ...you lost your amateur standing. Here's
         what the thing is: I go with the gold.
              (PAUSE)
         I go with the gold, or there's no deal.
         I take my half, you take your half on site,
         we're done.
              (PAUSE)

                        BERGMAN
         ...so be it.

                       MOORE
         Now:   what's your little surprise.

ANGLE, OVER THEM, ONTO THE GROUP OUTSIDE THE DELI, AS WE SEE THAT

         Well, you were prolly just overcome by the
         heat of the moment. Is that the thing?

                                                              27.

MOORE STARTS TO WALKAWAY FROM THE GROUP, FOLLOWED BY BLANE.

                      MOORE
         You want to show me another way?

                      BLANE
              (OF BELLA, AS HE STOPS MOORE)
         ...why does he go with the gold?

                       BERGMAN
         Y'ever split a piece of cake? One kid gets
         to cut the cake, the other gets to choose.
         We're gonna get the gold. Your guy gets to

               (PAUSE)

                      MOORE
         Then we go together.

                      BERGMAN
         You go with the gold. That's the deal.
              (PAUSE. BLANE AND MOORE START TO
               WALKAWAY)

                      BLANE
         You're losing a step, Joey.

                                                                 28.

                      MOORE
         And now the Time Was, I got to get out of
         Town.

HE TURNS BACK, HANDS THE ENVELOPE TO PINCUS.

                      MOORE (cont'd)
              (SOTTO, TO PINCUS)
         Okay it's on.

                      PINCUS
              (AS HE TAKES THE ENVELOPE)
         I'll take care of it.

PINCUS TURNS BACK TO EXCHANGE A PRIVATE WORD WITH MOORE.

                      MOORE
         You wanna wash any laundry out inna
         street...? ...you said you were gone take
         care of it, take care of it.
              (PAUSE, WHILE PINCUS HESITATES)
         ...are you in or out...?

PINCUS EXCHANGES A LOOK WITH BLANE.    SHRUGS, AND NODS AND WALKS
OFF.

         game.

                      PINCUS
         He's too old for that.

                       MOORE

         now, you...

                      MOORE

         pissing their shit, look'n around, shoot
         someb'y inna head, I'd like to have an

MOORE SHAKES HIS HEAD IN DISBELIEF.

                      BELLA (cont'd)
         No, no. No. Teach me something: why should
         it go sour. Was that such a stupid...?

         Yeah.

                      MOORE

                                                               44.


                       MOORE
          I'm done.
               (PAUSE)
          Well, that's it them.

MOORE GETS UP, CAMERA TAKES HIM TO THE RYDER TRUCK. HE OPENS THE
BACK, AND WE SEE HIM OPEN WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE SOLID MOTOR, WHICH
IS REVEALED TO BE HINGED AND HOLLOW.

BLANE FOLLOWS HIM, AND HANDS HIM SEVERAL FIREARMS, WHICH HE
SECRETS IN THE HOLLOW SPACE.

                       MOORE (cont'd)
          You got the detonators?

BELLA HOLDS UP SEVERAL PUTTY COLORED PACKAGES OF PLASTIQUE, WHICH HE
TAKES OFF OF THE TABLE, BEARING THE PROPS.

                       BELLA
          ...din we check'em?

                       MOORE
          I know we checked'em. What I'm doing, I'm.
          I'm asking you a question.

                       BELLA
          What happened to Check It an Forget it?

                       MOORE
          Yeah, well, I went to the Other camp, which
          is Fuss it to Death, and Fuck it into a
          Cocked Hat, or do you want to run the
          show...?

PAUSE.   THEY EXCHANGE A LOOK.

BELLA WALKS AWAY SHAKING HIS HEAD.

                       BLANE
          Then we ready to Go Do it?

                       PINCUS
          I'm ready to go do it, you know why? I never
          liked the Swiss in any case. You know
          why? They make those little clocks, two
          cocksuckers come out of them, little
          hammers, hit each other on the head.
               (PAUSE)
          What kind of sick mentality is that?

ANGLE, ON BLANE AND BELLA, AS BELLA LOOKS OVER AT MOORE.

ANGLE.   ON BELLA, AS HE WALKS OVER TO FRAN.

THEY BOTH LOOK BACK AT MOORE, WHO IS LOADING UP THE TRUCK.

                       BELLA
          Z'he gonna hold up?

                                                              45.


                      FRAN
         Why would you put a man in a position, he's
         got no way out?

                      BELLA
         What is that, your philosophy?

                      FRAN
         That's right.

                      BELLA
         ...what is it to you?

                      FRAN
         ...he's my Husband.

                      BELLA
         Whose fault is that, you wanna think about
         it? Listen:...

                        MOORE
         Yeah:    Let's go get the money.

                      BLANE
              (TO BELLA AND PINCUS)
         You clean the place down, n'y'thing'll burn,
         burn it..., nobody's coming back here, nothing
         that we need, don't leave it f'somebody else.

PINCUS LIGHTS A FIRE IN A 55 GALLON DRUM.

ANGLE, ON MOORE, AS HE WALKS TO THE FRONT OF THE SHED, AND LOOKS
OUT AT HIS BOAT.

FRAN COMES UP BEHIND HIM.

                      FRAN
         Z'it gonna work?

                      MOORE
         It's either gonna be a monumental heist, or a
         real amusing anecdote.

                      FRAN
         You know why? Because you're thorough.

                      MOORE
         I hope to tell you...

SHE TURNS TO WALK BACK INTO THE SHED. HE TURNS TO LOOK AT HER.
IN THE B.G. WE SEE PINCUS FEEDING PAPERS INTO THE FLAMES.

ANGLE. EXT THE BOATSHED, ON THE GROUP, BLANE MOORE, PINCUS AND
BELLA, AS THEY WALK TOWARD THEIR CARS.

PINCUS IS ON THE PHONE IN THE B.G. (ON A CELLPHONE)

MOORE STOPS TO LOOK AT HIS BOAT.

                      BELLA
         You gonna miss it?

                        MOORE
         What?

                        BELLA
         Your boat?

                      MOORE
         Well, it's a nice boat.

                      BELLA
         Hey, baby, after this job, you're gone have
         enough money, make this look like a Boat inna
         Bathtub.

                      MOORE
         That's right.

PINCUS GOES TOWARD MOORE EXCITEDLY.

                      MOORE (cont'd)
         ...what is it?

                      PINCUS

         ...what car?

                      PINCUS
         ...the car we used at the Overpass. The cops
         found it, I heard it on the police band.

         five hours to... you know, f'you want, I'll
         be glad, transfer your load...

         palletted in there, pretty good, and... I,

         wait.

         face on a Postage Stamp. N'he's looking for

EXT HIGHWAY DAY.

A TAXICAB. TURNING INTO A PIER AREA. A SMALL MARINA. A SMALL
POWERBOAT BEING BACKED INTO THE WATER BY A SUBURBAN. THE CAB
ENTERS THE AREA, AND FRAN GETS OUT, AND PAYS THE CABBIE OFF. SHE
TURNS TOWARD THE WATER.

AT A SMALL CABANA, NEAR THE END OF THE PIER.       FRAN.   SITTING ON A
BENCH, LOOKING OUT AT THE SAILBOAT.

ANGLE

ON THE BOAT. AS MOORE PULLS IT UP TO THE END OF THE PIER.         JUMPS
DOWN, AND TIES UP THE BOAT.

                         MOORE
            How're you doing? Blane's Okay.      Billy's
            Okay, Pinky called, he...
                 (PAUSE)

HE LOOKS AT FRAN.    HOLD.

BERGMAN AND HIS CREW EMERGE FROM THE SMALL CABANA.

MOORE TURNS BACK TOWARD THE BOAT.       A THUG YELLS AT HIM AND PULLS A
PISTOL. HE STOPS.

                         BERGMAN
            Yeah, yeah, what there was a change in
            Plans...? You couldn't get to me to tell me?

                         MOORE
            Let my wife go.

                         BERGMAN
            Do you mind if I say something personal?
                 (PAUSE)
            You wife's a whore. She'n'you, 've fucked
            this perfect little plan, into...

MOORE STEPS TOWARD BERGMAN.      A THUG CLUBS MOORE TO THE GROUND.

                         BERGMAN    (cont'd)
            Get up. Get up, get     up, you contrary
            motherfucker. I was     going to make you rich.
            I was going to make    you rich. The Swiss
            Score. And look how     you treat me. Cause you
            got to be Too Smart.     You got to be too smart.
            Don't you?

MOORE RISES TO HIS FEET.

                                                                116.


                      BERGMAN (cont'd)
         You just gotta complicate it That Last Bit.
              (PAUSE)
         Well. Do you want to wrap it up, or you want
         to stand around out here, guess my Real Name?

                      MOORE
         What is your real name?

                      BERGMAN
         It's Rumplestiltskin.

                      MOORE
         What was it before you changed it?

THE THUG HITS MOORE AGAIN.

                      FRAN
         Don't hurt him...

                      BERGMAN
         You had to go out on a limb -- you had to go
         out on a limb, Didn't you...? Didn't you...

                      MOORE
         Let the girl go, I'll give up the gold.

                      BERGMAN
         Yeah, we had, basically, we had in mind a
         different deal... a different deal. How bout
         that, I hear, if you're flexible, it Keeps you
         Young.

                      MOORE
         I'll give up the Gold, Me and the girl leave
         on the boat.

                      BERGMAN
         Well, that's very sentimental.   But what if
         the gold's on the boat.

                      MOORE
         Search the boat.

BERGMAN TAKES OUT A SMALL KNIFE, AND BEGINS TO CLEAN HIS NAILS.

                      BERGMAN
         Yeah, no, I don't got to search the boat.

ANGLE

ON BERGMAN, AS HE BECKONS SEVERAL OF THE THUGS ONTO THE BOAT.

                      BERGMAN
         Yeah, no, your wife just made another deal.
         The deal she made, we get the gold, we let you
         live. Whaddaya think?

                                                           117.


PAUSE.   AS MOORE LOOKS AT FRAN.

                       MOORE
          You let me walk away.

                       BERGMAN
          That's right.

                        MOORE
          Me and her.

                       BELLA
          Well, not quite.

                       MOORE
          What did you do to her...

HE LOOKS AT FRAN.

                       FRAN
          I gave you up, Baby.     I gave up the gold.
               (PAUSE)

                       BERGMAN
          Yeah, that's what we did for her, we let you
          live.

                       FRAN
          I gave you up. I had to.

                       BERGMAN
               (TO THE THUGS)
          Let's get this boat out of here.
               (TO MOORE)
          We're letting you live cause it makes the
          broad happy. That's what she traded us for
          the gold.

                       MOORE
          Hold on, hold on, let's siddown...

                       BERGMAN
          Oh, yeah, let's siddown. You fucken dog inna
          manger, we sit here a little long enough, the
          Boys in Blue come visit, n'there goes the
          neighborhood...

                        MOORE
          One second.   Hold on...

                       BERGMAN
          You're bust, Baby. You got Broke... go cry
          a little
               (TO MOORE, SOTTO)
          You fortunate motherfucker, she don't step up,
          you're gone stay here, for, like, a little bit
          of forever...

                                                                118.


                      BERGMAN (cont'd)
         ...this way you walk away, you Lucky Dog.

                      MOORE
         Take the gold. Take the gold off, leave me
         the boat.

                      BERGMAN
         Don't make me lose my respect for you. By the
         way, we already had the gold. Pincus gave it
         up. That's what she traded for your life.
              (PAUSE)
         She's got a very commercial mind...

BELLA STARTS TO TAKE FRAN AWAY, BACK DOWN THE PIER.    WE SEE A BLACK
CAR, DRIVING DOWN THE PIER, TOWARD THE GROUP.

BERGMAN BECKONS A HENCHMAN, AND POINTS AT THE BOAT.

                      BERGMAN (cont'd)
         ...take it back to the boatyard
              (HE MAKES A DIALING MOTION)
         Get a number, call'im up, we need a private
         slip, what do you call it, a shed. Tell'im
         we'll pay in cash. Get the thing squared
         away, we'll take the gold out...
              (THE HENCHMAN STARTS TO GO OFF,
               NODDING)

                      BELLA
              (TO MOORE)
         You don't want to stay here, pal. They're
         coming for you... they're coming for you...

HE STARTS PUTTING FRAN INTO THE CAR.

                      FRAN
              (TO BERGMAN)
         Leave him some money. Give him some money...
         don't let him go out there with nothing...
              (SHE GETS INTO THE CAR.)

ANGLE CU ON FRAN AS BELLA PUTS HER INTO THE CAR.

                      FRAN (cont'd)
         I'm sorry, baby.

ANGLE, ON MOORE, AS HE TURNS, AND WE SEE THE CAR DRIVE OFF.

                      BERGMAN
         Yeah, we don't want, to send you out there
         broke... here: go buy yourself something
         nice... You don't mind if I pay you in
         Gold...?

HE STEPS OVER TO THE BOAT, FLOATING ALONGSIDE THE DOCK.    HE TAKES
HIS CLASP KNIFE, AND APPLIES IT TO THE SHINING RAIL.

ANGLE INS.

                                                                   119.


THE BLADE BENDS ON THE RAIL.

ANGLE ON BERGMAN, AS HE GETS ONTO THE BOAT. HE WALKS TO ONE RAIL
AND TRIES TO CARVE IT WITH HIS KNIFE. NOTHING HAPPENS. HE WALKS
TO ANOTHER RAIL, AND TRIES THE SAME.

ANGLE INS. THE KNIFE. THE BLADE BENDING ON THE RAIL.        MORE
PRESSURE IS EXERTED. THE BLADE SNAPS.

ANGLE

ON BERGMAN.   WHO GESTURES FOR ANOTHER KNIFE.   THE HENCHMAN DOES NOT
UNDERSTAND.

                      BERGMAN (cont'd)
         A knife, gimme another knife...

THE HENCHMAN HANDS HIM A KNIFE. BERGMAN TRIES NOW ONE AND NOW
ANOTHER OF THE RAILINGS. THE KNIFE CANNOT RAISE SHAVINGS ON ANY OF
THEM.

ANGLE

ON BERGMAN, AS HE LOOKS BACK AT THE SHORE.

                      BERGMAN (cont'd)
         ...I don't... I need you to tell me where
         the gold is.

BERGMAN GETS OFF THE BOAT, AND ADVANCES ON MOORE, WHO IS STANDING ON
THE PIER.

                      BERGMAN (cont'd)
         Where's the gold?

                      MOORE
         Where would you like it to be...?

BERGMAN GESTURES TO THE THUGS, WHO TAKE HOLD OF MOORE'S ARMS.
MOORE LOOKS AROUND WILDLY AT THE DESERTED PIER. BERGMAN ADVANCES
ON MOORE, HOLDING THE KNIFE.

                      BERGMAN
         What is it, with your pal...?

AS BERGMAN NEARS MOORE, MOORE TURNS, BREAKING THE HOLD OF THE TWO
MEN. HE HITS ONE IN THE THROAT, KICKS AT THE OTHER, AND STARTS
TO RUN. ONE OF THE THUGS PULLS A PISTOL, AND SHOOTS AT MOORE, AND
MOORE FALLS TO THE PIER, GRASPING HIS SHOULDER, HE GETS SLOWLY UP,
AND FACES BERGMAN, AND THE THUGS, WHO STAND ON THE PIER ALONGSIDE
THE SAILBOAT. MOORE LOOKS AROUND.

                        BERGMAN (cont'd)
         And then   where is he now. Your  running buddy?
         No, It's   all over, and I need to know:
         Where Is   The Gold. I hate to do  anything as
         dramatic   as "counting to Three," but... ONE:
                        (MORE)

                                                                  120.


                      BERGMAN (cont'd)
              (HE HOLDS OUT HIS HAND. A
               HENCHMAN PUTS A PISTOL INTO IT.)

AS HE SPEAKS, MOORE KEEPS TURNING, SO THAT THE SUN IS BEHIND
MOORE, AND SHINING INTO THE EYES OF BERGMAN AND HIS ACCOMPLICES,
WHO NOW STAND WITH THEIR BACKS TO THE BOAT.

                      BERGMAN (cont'd)
         Two... why must you, oh, God, why in the
         world must you, why in the hell, a guy like
         you, would you put me in a position... Aahh,
         the Hell with it, life is too short, you
         know what? Fuck you...

HE RAISES HIS ARM TO FIRE. BEHIND HIM WE SEE BLANE EMERGE FROM THE
SAILLOCKER ON THE BOAT'S DECK, BLANE HOLDS A SHOTGUN. HE SHOOTS
BERGMAN AND THE TWO THUGS, ONE OF THE THUGS TURNS AND FIRES AT
BLANE, WHO IS WOUNDED. BLANE FIRES AGAIN AT THE THUG, AND STUMBLES
ON TO THE PIER, AND FALLS BACKWARD INTO THE WATER BETWEEN THE BOAT
AND THE PIER.

ANGLE

ON MOORE, WHO MOVES JERKILY,     TO THE SIDE OF THE PIER. HE TRIES
TO PUSH THE BOAT AWAY, TO GET     TO BLANE IN THE WATER. HE UNTIES
THE LINE WHICH HOLDS THE BOAT     TO THE PIER, AND PUSHES THE BOAT
AWAY. HE THROWS THE LINE TO      BLANE, WHO USES IT TO LIFT HIMSELF UP
ONTO THE PIER.

THE TWO MEN SIT FOR A MOMENT, CATCHING THEIR BREATH.

                      MOORE
         How you doing?

                         BLANE
         I'm leaking?
              (PAUSE)
         You hurt?

MOORE NODS. HE STANDS, AND HELPS BLANE TO HIS FEET. MOORE PICKS
UP THE SHOTGUN. THEY LOOK AROUND, BEHIND THEM, THE SAILBOAT IS
DRIFTING OUT TO SEA.

THEY START DOWN THE PIER. STEPPING OVER ONE OF THE BODIES OF THE
THUGS. THE SECOND THUG LOOKS UP.

                         THUG
              (WEAKLY)
         I... I...

BLANE KICKS HIS BODY OVER THE SIDE OF THE PIER, INTO THE WATER.

MOORE STEPS OVER THE DYING BERGMAN.

                       BERGMAN
         Cute.   Very cute.

MOORE WALKS OVER HIS BODY, AND HE AND BLANE CONTINUE DOWN THE
PIER.

                                                                  121.


                      BERGMAN (cont'd)
         Don't you want to hear my dying words...?

MOORE TAKES THE SHOTGUN FROM BLANE, AND STEPS BACK TO BERGMAN.

                       MOORE
         I just did.

HE SHOOTS BERGMAN, HANDS THE SHOTGUN BACK TO BLANE, AND THE TWO
HEAD OFF, HELPING EACH OTHER DOWN THE PIER.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT INDUSTRIAL DINER. DAY.

MOORE, HIS ARM IN A SLING, NOW WEARING A BEARD, SITTING IN A BOOTH,
DRINKING COFFEE.

                       BLANE
              (VO)
         I hear...

MOORE LOOKS UP, BLANE, WALKING WITH A CANE, SLIDES INTO THE BOOTH
OPPOSITE HIM.

                      BLANE (cont'd)
         I hear if you put milk into it, it lesses the
         chance of stomach distress.

                      MOORE
         Hey, you can't worry about every little
         thing...

THEY BOTH SIT, LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW.

A WAITRESS COMES BY WITH A COFFEEPOT.

                       WAITRESS
         Heat it up?

                      MOORE
              (AS HE RISES)
         No, I think we gotta be moving on.

ANGLE EXT THE DINER, AS THE TWO WALK ACROSS AN INDUSTRIAL AREA.

                      BLANE
         Too bad about Pinky.

                      MOORE
         Ain't that so.

                      BLANE
         ...always made me laugh.

                                                              122.


                      MOORE
         Well, what more can you say of anyone?

                      BLANE
         Nothing...

BEAT. THEY CONTINUE WALKING ACROSS THE STREET TO REVEAL THEY ARE IN
THE INDUSTRIAL AREA OUTSIDE THE BOXING GYM. THERE ARE MANY KIDS
PLAYING IN THE STREET.

                      BLANE (cont'd)
         Robert the Bruce...

                      MOORE
         Yeah?

                      BLANE
         Why'd they call him Robert "The" Bruce...

                      MOORE
         ...what?

                      BLANE
         Why'd they call him Robert "The" Bruce?
              (PAUSE)

                      MOORE
         Because he asked them to.

BLANE NODS.

                      BLANE
         Y'go to that Plastic Surgeon, don't lettem put
         you all the way under. I knew a guy in
         Statesville, went to get his face fixed, woke
         up, sucker'd given him a pair of tits.

                      MOORE
         Yeah, that's no bargain.

                      BLANE
         Well, he landed back inside, he never had to
         want for Cigarettes...

BLANE TAKES OUT A SLIP OF PAPER, AND HANDS IT TO MOORE.   MOORE LOOKS
AT IT.

                      MOORE
         Send your cut there...?

                      BLANE
         Wire it there, when you get where you're
         going.

                      MOORE
         That I will, Pal.

                                                                123.


                      BLANE
         I hear it's nice down there in the Sun.

                      MOORE
         Zat where I'm going?

                      BLANE
         Wherever it is, Brother, don't come back.
              (BEAT. MOORE NODS.)

BLANE EMBRACES MOORE. BEAT. BLANE HANDS HIM THE KEY TO THE
GARAGE. AND WALKS OFF. WE SEE BLANE WALK ACROSS THE STREET, A
CONVERTIBLE PULLS UP, DRIVEN BY A VERY BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN. BLANE
GETS INTO THE PASSENGER SEAT AND MOTIONS HER TO DRIVE.

ANGLE C.U. MOORE LOOKING ON.

ANGLE: HIS POV, ON BLANE'S CAR, AS IT DRIVES OFF, BLANE TURNS BACK
TO LOOK AT MOORE ONE LAST TIME, THEN SHRUGS AND TURNS FORWARD.

ANGLE, ON MOORE, AS HE WALKS ACROSS THE STREET, TURNS A CORNER AND
STANDS BEFORE A GARAGE DOOR.

MOORE USES THE KEY AND OPENS A SMALL DOOR SET INTO THE OVERHEAD
DOORS OF THE GARAGE. HE ENTERS THE DARK GARAGE.

ANGLE INT THE GARAGE.

A NEWISH TRUCK, WITH A LARGE ENGINE LASHED ONTO ITS BED. THE ENGINE
IS PAINTED IN FRESH BLACK PAINT. BEHIND IT, THE OLD BATTERED PICKUP
TRUCK, UP ON A JACK, ITS BED FULL OF THE RUSTED PIPES OF THE
DISCARDED BOXING EQUIPMENT, AND THE OLD ROTTEN LEATHER "HEAVYBAG."
MOORE TAKES OUT A PACK OF CIGARETTES AND A LIGHTER, HE IS ABOUT TO
LIGHT A CIGARETTE, WHEN HE LOOKS OVER AT THE NEW TRUCK.

HE PUTS THE CIGARETTES DOWN ON THE OLD TRUCK, BENDS   DOWN, AND PICKS
UP A CAN OF BLACK PAINT. HE WALKS TO THE NEW TRUCK    AND APPLIES
TOUCHUP PAINT TO THE ENGINE LASHED IN THE BACK. HE    NODS AT IT,
AND THEN, SATISFIED, HE TAKES A TARP AND COVERS THE   ENGINE.

HE GETS INTO THE NEW PICKUP TRUCK AND STARTS IT.

WHILE IT WARMS UP HE GOES TO THE FRONT OF THE GARAGE, WIPING THE
BLACK PAINT OFF OF HIS HANDS WITH A RAG. HE RAISES THE SHED DOOR,
TO REVEAL FRAN STANDING THERE.

HE SMILES AND KISSES HER AND TAKES HER BACK TOWARD THE NEW PICKUP
TRUCK. HE OPENS THE PASSENGER DOOR.

                      MOORE
         Yeah, I knew you'd show.

                      FRAN
         Good, good plan, baby...

                      MOORE
         Yeah, I wouldn't clear my throat, without a
         backup plan...

                                                              124.


                      FRAN
         That's the right way to do it.

                      MOORE
         End of the day, though, end of the day,
         what's the important thing...?

                      FRAN
         That's right.

                      MOORE
         What's the important thing...?
              (PAUSE)

                      FRAN
         Shame about Pinky...

                      MOORE
         You heard.
              (OF TRUCK)
         Come on, get in.

                      FRAN
         Y'all loaded up?

HE LIFTS THE TARP TO REVEAL THE ENGINE, COATED IN BLACK PAINT,
SITTING THERE. HE RECOVERS IT.

                      MOORE
         C'mon, get in, we'll talk on the road.     You
         heard about Pinky...

                       FRAN
         Yeah.   I heard. I'm sorry about that.

                      MOORE
         Yeah, well, it just went bad there, that
         little bit. Dinnit...?

                        FRAN
         Yes, It did.

MOORE TOUCHES THE BRUISE ON HIS HEAD.

                      MOORE
         ...yes, it did... it got kind of convincing.

                      FRAN
         ...and, so, you got hurt.

                      MOORE
         Well, you can't do it halfway, can you...?

                      FRAN
         No, anything you do, you got to do full-out.
         Don't you?

                                                               125.


                      MOORE
         Indeed you do.

                      FRAN
         And, sometimes...
              (PAUSE)

                      MOORE
              (TOUCHES HIS FOREHEAD, AND THE
               BRUISE, WINCES)
         Then, that's just the Price.

                      FRAN
         That's right. That's what you taught me.
         That's part of it.

                      MOORE
         Well, but didn't you do great. Played it down
         to the last recorded syllable...

                      FRAN
         I went to a good school.

                      MOORE
         Never seen it done n'y better.   You hotwalked
         that dude so good.

                      FRAN
         ...thank you, Joe.

                      MOORE
         Cooled him out the livelong day.   You made it
         look so real.

HE MOVES TO THE FRONT OF THE SHED. AND TURNS OUT THE LIGHTS.    HE
WALKS BACK TOWARD FRAN, WHO IS STANDING AT THE TRUCK.

                      MOORE (cont'd)
              (TO HIMSELF)
         ...yes, you did.

                      FRAN
         Well, you know...
              (PAUSE)

                      MOORE
         ...what d'you mean, "that's part of it?"

                      FRAN
         I don't get you?

                      MOORE
         I was talking about Pinky.

                     FRAN
         Uh huh.

                                                                  126.


                      MOORE
         I said we paid the price.         And you said.   We
         paid part of it.
              (PAUSE)

                        FRAN
         Yes.    That's right.

                      MOORE
         ...what's the rest of it...?
              (PAUSE)
         What's the rest of it...?

ANGLE XCU MOORE.   AS HE LOOKS AT FRAN.

ANGLE

FRAN, AS SHE LOOKS BEYOND MOORE.

ANGLE ON MOORE AS HE TURNS.       BELLA IS STANDING BEHIND HIM.

BELLA HOLDS A PISTOL. HE MOVES TO MOORE, AND HE FRISKS HIM, AND
FINDS NOTHING, AND TAKES A STEP AWAY.

ANGLE, ON MOORE, AS HE LOOKS FROM BELLA TO FRAN.

                          MOORE (cont'd)
         Oh.

         Well. They don't always leave with the Ones
         they came In with.

                (PAUSE)
         Oh.

BELLA LOOKS AT THE TRUCK.     HE LOOKS INQUIRINGLY, AT FRAN.

                      FRAN
              (TO MOORE)
         It was dead, anyway.
              (PAUSE)
         You know it was.

                          MOORE
         Was it...?

              (TO BELLA)
         ...it's in the back.

BELLA WALKS TO THE BACK OF THE TARP, RAISES A CORNER, LOOKS IN.

HE LOOKS AT HIS HANDS, AND TAKES OUT A HANDKERCHIEF, AND WIPES OFF
THE BLACK PAINT. HE LOWERS THE TARP DOWN.

                      MOORE
              (OF BELLA)
         Why dun' he shoot me?

                      FRAN
         Cause it's over. It's all done.    That's the
         deal.

                      MOORE
         He ain't gonna shoot me?

                        FRAN
         No.

                      MOORE
         Then he hadn't aughta point a gun at me.
              (PAUSE)
         It's insincere...

MOORE SITS DOWN ON AN UNOPENED WOODEN BOX, IN THE DOORWAY OF THE
GARAGE.

                      MOORE (cont'd)
         Oh, God, I'm tired...

         I'm sorry, Baby.

         Hmm.

                      MOORE
         It was a pretty plan, though, wunnit...?

                      FRAN
         Cute as a Chinese baby...

                      MOORE
         Thanks for everything.
              (FRAN GETS UP INTO THE TRUCK)

                      FRAN
         You'll be alright.

                      MOORE
         You think so?

         You always are.

                      MOORE
         Well, I missed this trick, though, didn't
         I...?

                      FRAN
         ...the best laid plans of mice and men...

                        MOORE
         ...what?

                      FRAN
         I said Nobody's Perfect.
              (PAUSE)
         You take care.
              (TO BELLA)
         Alright, let's go.

THE TRUCK DRIVES OFF.

ANGLE

ON MOORE, AS HE SLOWLY SHAKES HIS HEAD.   HE SIGHS.   HE WALKS BACK
INTO THE SHED.

                                                               129.


HE WALKS TO THE OLD ABANDONED PICKUP, WHERE HE LEFT HIS CIGARETTES
AND LIGHTER. HE TAKES OUT A CIGARETTE, AND HOLDS IT TO HIS LIPS.
HE HESITATES. HE CRUMBLES IT, AND THROWS IT TO THE FLOOR. LOWERS
THE PICKUP TO THE GROUND, USING THE HYDRAULIC JACK.

HE SIGHS, AND SLAMS THE TAILGATE ON THE OLD METAL FRAME OF THE
BOXING EQUIPMENT. THE TAILGATE DOES NOT CLOSE. HE SLAMS IT AGAIN.
AND IT CLOSES.

HE WALKS OVER AND GETS IN THE CAB OF THE OLD PICKUP.

ANGLE

THE OLD METAL FRAME IN THE BED OF THE PICKUP TRUCK. WE SEE THAT THE
TAILGATE HAS JAMMED ONTO THE OLD METAL PIPES, AND THE PIPE'S PAINT
HAS CHIPPED TO REVEAL THAT THE PIPE IS GOLD, AND WE SEE, ON
THE BASE OF THE PIPE, WHERE THE PAINT HAS CHIPPED, FAINTLY, THE
LETTERS CREDIT INTERNATIONAL DE GENEVE.

ANGLE

ON MOORE, IN THE TRUCK, AS IT PULLS OUT OF THE GARAGE.

                                                         FADE OUT.

          "...she gave to my family a fidelity without stint or
          calculation or recompense and gave to my childhood an
          immeasurable devotion and love".

          JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI 1963

                         

          INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

          AIBILEEN, black, 53, sits at a table in a small, green
          kitchen. She wears a yellow dress with black piping and
          grips a tattered spiral notebook.
          Although cracked, the window behind her is crystal clear.
          Three framed portraits hang on the wall above her: John F.
          Kennedy, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and an UNKNOWN YOUNG
          BLACK MALE wearing thick glasses.
          Aibileen swallows hard.

                          AIBILEEN
           I was...born in 1911...on Piedmont
           Plantation in Cherokee County.
          An UNSEEN WOMAN interviews Aibileen.

           WOMAN (O.C.)
           Did you know as a girl, growing up,
           that one day you'd be a maid?

                          AIBILEEN
           Yes, ma'am. I did.

           WOMAN (O.C.)
           And you knew that because?

                          AIBILEEN
           Momma was a maid. My grandmother
           was a house slave.

           WOMAN (0.C.)
           Oh.
          The woman repeats Aibileen's answer slowly as she writes.

           WOMAN (O.C.) (CONT'D)
           A...House...Slave. Uh-huh. Okay.
          Aibileen squeezes the notebook in her lap.

           WOMAN (O.C.) (CONT'D)
           Now, did you ever dream of being
           something else?
          Aibileen gulps. She doesn't answer. The room is quiet.

           WOMAN (O.C.) (CONT'D)
           Well then, what's it feel like, to
           raise a white child when your own
           child's at home...being looked
           after by somebody else?

           2.

                         
          Aibileen's hand trembles as she sips from a glass of water.
          She glances sadly up to the picture of the young black male.

           FADE TO BLACK:

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           I done raised seventeen kids in my
           life. Lookin' after white babies,
           that's what I do.

                         

          INT. LEEFOLT HOME - MAE MOBLEY'S ROOM - MORNING

          MAE MOBLEY LEEFOLT, 2 1/2 years old, lies in a crib, crying.
          AIBILEEN enters. Her dark black skin contrasts angelically
          with a brilliant white work dress, white panty hose and shoes

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           I know how to get them babies
           asleep, stop cryin' and go in the
           toilet bowl before they mommas even
           get outta bed in the mornin.'
          Aibileen lifts Mae Mobley out of her crib and pulls her into
          her expansive bosom.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Babies like fat. They like big fat
           legs too. That I know.
          Aibileen sits with Mae Mobley in a rocking chair.

           AIBILEEN (V.O) (CONT'D)
           I work from eight to four, six days
           a week. Ninety-five cents an hour
           comes to a hundred seventy-two
           dollars ever month. I do all the
           cooking, cleaning, washing, ironing
           and grocery shopping, but mostly, I
           take care a baby girl...And law, I
           worry she gone be fat. Ain't gonna
           be no beauty queen either.
          Mae Mobley reaches up and touches Aibileen's face. Aibileen
          kisses her and whispers in her ear.

                          AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
           You is kind. You is smart. You is
           important.
          Mae Mobley's mother, ELIZABETH LEEFOLT, 21 and lanky, enters
          wearing a green dress very much under construction. Pins and
          double-stick tape hold it all together.
          Elizabeth has pointed features and a nest of teased, brittle
          hair.

                          ELIZABETH
           Aibileen, bridge club's in an hour!
           Did you finish the chicken salad?

           3.

                         

                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
           Oh, and Hilly's deviled eggs. No
           paprika!
          Elizabeth rotates around like the Tin Man.

                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
           Does this dress look homemade?

                          AIBILEEN
           I reckon when you finish, it won't.
          Elizabeth exits with her pinned hemline sloping at a good
          twenty degree angle. Aibileen shakes her head.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Miss Leefolt still don't pick Baby
           Girl up but once a day. The
           birthin' blues had got holt a Miss
           Leefolt pretty hard. I done seen it
           happen plenty a times...once babies
           start havin' they own babies. And
           the young white ladies of
           Jackson...Oh, law, they was havin'
           some babies.

                         

          INT. JACKSON JOURNAL NEWSPAPAER - OFFICE - SAME DAY

          A smoking RECEPTIONIST, 50, leads EUGENIA "SKEETER" PHELAN,
          23, across a smoke-filled news office. Even the light bulbs
          have yellowed.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           But, not Miss Skeeter...
          Skeeter has very frizzy blond hair cut short above her
          shoulders. She carries a red satchel.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           No babies...No man...And not
           lookin'.
          She wears flats, careful not to add more than a centimeter to
          her towering height. Dressed well, Skeeter tugs on her
          unfamiliar attire.

                         

          INT. MR. BLACKLY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          The receptionist and Skeeter enter the office of MR. HAROLD
          BLACKLY, 68. He has greased, grey hair and the face of a
          mean man. Smoke pours into the room.

           MR. BLACKLY
           Shut the Goddamn door!
          He snaps his fingers over a chair. Skeeter sits down.

           MR. BLACKLY (CONT'D)
           They announced last week
           cigarettes'll kill you.

           4.

                         
          Mr. Blackly pours a pack of nuts into his mouth.

           MR. BLACKLY (CONT'D)

                          (CHEWING)
           Okay, let's see what you got.
          Skeeter quickly hands Mr. Blackly a resumé. He skims it
          over, marking it violently with a red pen.

           MR. BLACKLY (CONT'D)
           "Murrah High Editor, Ole Miss Rebel
           Rouser Editor, double major, Junior
           League editor...Damn girl, didn't
           you have any fun?

                          SKEETER
           Is that...important?
          Mr. Blackly sighs, hands the resumé back to Skeeter.

           MR. BLACKLY
           You got any references?
          Skeeter nods slowly. She takes a deep breath and pulls a
          letter out of her satchel. She hands it to Mr. Blackly.
          Mr. Blackly snatches the letter and reads it quickly,
          mouthing the words as he does. He drops the letter on his
          desk, and looks to Skeeter, flabbergasted.

           MR. BLACKLY (CONT'D)
           That...is a rejection letter.
          Skeeter's face flushes hot and quick.

                          SKEETER
           Not exactly. Missus Stein-

           MR. BLACKLY
           -STEIN?! Missus who?
          Skeeter points toward the letterhead.

                          SKEETER
           Elaine Stein, Senior Editor at
           Harper and Row Publishing. In New
           York. I'm going to be a serious
           writer, Mr. Blackly. So, when I
           applied to Harper and Row, Missus

                          STEIN WROTE-

           MR. BLACKLY
           -She told you "no."

                          SKEETER
           Until I gain some experience, Mr.
           Blackly! See, it says it right
           there at the end. "Great
           potential...Gain some experience
           and please apply again."
          Mr. Blackly pours the rest of the peanuts in his mouth.

           5.

                         

           MR. BLACKLY
           Oh, Christ...I guess you'll do.
           Can you clean?

                          SKEETER
           Clean?
          Mr. Blackly sees cigarette smoke bleeding under his door.

           MR. BLACKLY
           Clean!
          Mr. Blackly pulls up a box filled with letters and
          newspapers. He slams it down in front of Skeeter.

           MR. BLACKLY (CONT'D)
           Miss Myrna's gone shit-house crazy
           on us, drunk hair spray or
           something. Read her past columns
           and all these letters. Answer them
           just like she did, nobody'll know
           the damn difference.
          Skeeter forces a smile.

           MR. BLACKLY (CONT'D)
           You know who Miss Myrna is?

                          SKEETER

                          (COVERING)
           I read her articles all the time.

           MR. BLACKLY
           Articles? Ha! It's a cleaning
           advice column, Miss Phelan. Eight
           bucks a week. Copy due Thursday.
          Mr. Blackly picks up the phone and starts yelling at someone.
          Skeeter excitedly grabs the box of letters and leaves.

                         

          INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - BATHROOM - SAME DAY

          HILLY HOLBROOK, 22, white and hefty, sits on a closed toilet
          seat in a well-appointed bathroom. She's covered in red plaid
          and bows and has a round face topped by a perfect beehive.

                          HILLY

                          (SCREAMING UPWARD)
           Momma! We're late for bridge!
          Hilly carefully rolls toilet paper out from its holder. She
          raises a pencil and places the tiniest dot imaginable on the
          first and second sheets of paper.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           Miss Hilly was the first of the
           babies to have a baby. And it must
           a come out of her like the eleventh
           commandment. `Cause once Miss
           Hilly had a baby, ever girl at the
           bridge table wanted one too.

           6.

                         
          She carefully rolls the paper back up in the roll.

                          HILLY
           Minny! Go get Momma!

                         

          INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - ENTRY FOYER STAIRWELL - SAME TIME

          MINNY JACKSON, 33, black, plump and in uniform, rolls her
          eyes beneath a crystal chandelier. She shouts up the
          mahogany stairwell.

                          MINNY
           Missus Walters?! You need help
           coming down?
          MISSUS WALTERS, 60, passes quietly behind Minny.

                          MISSUS WALTERS
           I'm down!
          Minny jumps with a yelp, spins around.

           MISSUS WALTERS (CONT'D)
           Been down.

                          MINNY
           Gone give me a heart attack!
          Missus Walters ambles toward the closet door. Minny quickly
          tries to turn her toward the front door. Missus Walters
          resists.

                          MISSUS WALTERS
           Minny, I'm getting my coat.
          Missus Walters opens the closet.

                          MINNY
           It's ninety degrees out there,
           Missus Walters.
          Missus Walters pulls out a red, wool coat with cheetah print
          collar.
          The early stages of Alzheimer's have appeared, but Missus
          Walters is still quite proud at eighty percent capacity.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           Once Missus Walters' arteries went
           hard, Miss Hilly moved her and
           Minny in with her. Fired the maid
           she had just to make room. See,
           Minny about the best cook in
           Mississippi, and Miss Hilly wanted
           her.
          Hilly's approach is marked by the whishing sound of her
          plaid, fat thighs.

           7.

                         
          She nonchalantly grabs the coat from her mother and carries
          it out the door.
          Minny and Missus Walters follow. Minny carries a chocolate
          pie. Hilly barks over her shoulder.

                          HILLY
           Minny, William took Billy out for
           ice cream. So, hurry back and get
           Billy down for his nap. No dilly
           dallying.

                          MINNY
           Yes, ma'am.
          Minny raises the pie behind Hilly's beehive, dreaming of
          smashing it into her head.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           Minny my best friend. A old lady
           like me lucky to have her.

                         

          INT. LEEFOLT HOME - BATHROOM- SAME DAY

          Aibileen kneels next to Mae Mobley who sits on a small
          children's training toilet.

                          MAE MOBLEY
           No!

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           It's a tricky thing...you try to
           make a baby go in the toilet bowl
           before it's time. If theys can't
           get the hang of it, theys get to
           thinking low a theyselves.
          Mae Mobley sticks her lip out.

                          AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
           You drunk up two glasses a grape
           juice, I know you got to tee-tee.

                          MAE MOBLEY
           Nooo.
          Mae Mobley shakes her head.

                          AIBILEEN
           I give you a cookie if you go.
          Tee-tee immediately sprinkles into the bowl.

                          AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
           Mae Mobley! You going!
          Aibileen and Mae Mobley laugh excitedly as Elizabeth storms
          into the bathroom in her finished dress. The hemline now
          slants in the other direction.

           8.

                         

                          ELIZABETH
           Aibileen, the girls are pulling up,
           and the table isn't set!

                          MAE MOBLEY
           Mae Mobley go, Momma!

                          ELIZABETH
           Get in your room! Right now!
          Mae Mobley rises behind Aibileen's leg.

                          MAE MOBLEY
           I sorry.
          Elizabeth reaches down and scoops up Mae Mobley like a sack
          of potatoes.
          Mae Mobley looks to Aibileen over her mother's shoulder, her
          eyes have welled up.
          Aibileen mouths "I love you" and blows her a kiss.

                         

          INT. LEEFOLT HOME - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          The Leefolt's small, wood paneled, two bedroom "ranch" is
          destined to become income property one day.
          FIVE YOUNG WOMEN, early 20s, and Elizabeth hover around two
          collapsible card tables arranged in the living room.
          Aibileen methodically arranges grapes on a platter of chicken
          salad resting on Elizabeth's dining table. The table has a
          small L-SHAPED CRACK in the middle.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           I lost my own boy, Treelore, right
           before I started waitin' on the
           Leefolts...
          Elizabeth glances anxiously to the dining table then catches
          eyes with Aibileen, nodding ever so slightly.

                         CLOSE ON:
          Aibileen carefully slides the platter over the L-SHAPED CRACK
          making sure it's hidden.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           After Treelore died, a bitter seed
           was planted inside a me. And I
           just didn't feel so accepting
           anymore.
          Hilly enters the front door holding Missus Walters coat.

                          HILLY
           Hey, girls!

           9.

                         

                          YOUNG WOMEN

                          (IN UNISON)
           Hey, Hilly!
          Minny follows behind holding the pie and Missus Walters' arm.

                          HILLY
           (over her shoulder)
           Put Momma in a chair before she
           breaks a hip.

                          MISSUS WALTERS
           I'm not deaf yet, Hilly.
          Minny spies Aibileen in the corner and gives her a "here we
          go" look as she lowers Missus Walters into a chair.
          Hilly approaches Aibileen with the coat.

                          HILLY
           Aibileen, I want you to have this
           coat. It's too big for Momma now
           and it's way too expensive to put
           in the coat drive.
          Hilly extends the coat with a smile.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           All yours.
          Aibileen takes the coat.

                          AIBILEEN
           Thank you, Miss Hilly.

                          HILLY
           Go on. Try it on.

                         

          INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

          Minny plows through the swing door and reaches for Hilly's
          deviled eggs.
          Aibileen rushes in behind her wearing the cheetah collared
          coat. The sleeves are about a foot too short.

                          AIBILEEN
           Hold on! Those are Miss Hilly's.
          Aibileen pulls another plate of eggs out of the fridge.

                          AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
           Gots to have paprika on `em.
          Minny takes an egg. It disappears in a single bite.

                          MINNY
           Forgive me, Lord, but I'm gonna
           have to kill that woman.

           10.

                         
          Aibileen removes the coat and lays it over a chair.

                          AIBILEEN
           Watch yo mouth, Minny.

                          MINNY
           Looks like a walking Christmas
           present with all them bows.
          Aibileen shakes with silent laughter.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           And, now she gone to puttin' pencil
           marks on the toilet paper.

                          AIBILEEN
           Oh, law! Did she?

                          MINNY
           Uh-hum. But, I carry paper in from
           my own damn house. That fool don't
           know.

                         

          INT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

          Elizabeth and Hilly cackle with a group of girls as Missus
          Walters sits on the couch watching "Guiding Light."
          Skeeter suddenly rushes through the front door.

                          SKEETER
           Hey, girls.

                          GIRLS

                          (IN UNISON)
           Hey, Skeeter.
          JOLENE FRENCH, 24, approaches and hugs Skeeter.

                          JOLENE
           Well, if it isn't Long-Haul-
           Skeeter. We didn't think you'd
           ever leave Ole Miss.

                          SKEETER
           Well, it's supposed to take four
           years, Jolene.
          Skeeter spins around to Hilly and Elizabeth with a sigh.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           Sorry I'm late. I had to stop by
           the cleaners and pick up my black
           dress.
          Hilly and Elizabeth look at Skeeter with concern.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           What?

           11.

                         

                          HILLY
           About supper club tonight...Honey,
           Stuart had to cancel.

                          SKEETER
           Again?
          Hilly places her hand on Skeeter's shoulder.

                          HILLY
           He can't get off the rig, Skeeter.
           It's offshore! Stuart is a very
           successful oil man.

                          SKEETER
           I'm starting to think this Stuart
           is a figment of your imagination.

                          ELIZABETH
           Raleigh called his cousin down in
           Hattiesburg. He'll drive up.

                          SKEETER
           The cousin with one eye?!
          Elizabeth nods.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           I guess his black patch will match
           my dress. Just forget it.
          Skeeter storms off. Hilly glares at Elizabeth.

                          HILLY
           One eye?!

                         

          INT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER THE SAME DAY

          Aibileen clears the dining table as bridge begins.
          Hilly, Elizabeth and Skeeter sit with Jolene. Skeeter takes a
          deep breath and belts out her news.

                          SKEETER
           I got a job today... at The Jackson
           Journal!
          Everyone looks at Skeeter as if she just threw up on herself.
          Finally, Hilly pats Skeeter on the leg.

                          HILLY
           They'd be a fool not to hire you.
          Jolene raises her glass.

                          JOLENE
           To Skeeter...and her job. Last
           stop `til marriage.
          Hilly kicks Jolene under the table.

           12.

                         

                          SKEETER
           The Miss Myrna column. Have y'all
           read it?

                          HILLY
           Well, no! But, I bet the poor
           girls without any help, in South
           Jackson, read it like the King
           James.
          Everyone laughs. Skeeter's forehead crinkles.

                          SKEETER
           Elizabeth, would you mind if I talk
           to Aibileen? To help me answer
           some of the letters? Just until I
           get a knack for it.
          Aibileen clears dishes as if she hasn't heard a thing.
          Elizabeth gets very still.

                          ELIZABETH
           Aibileen? My Aibileen? What can't
           you just get Constantine to help
           you?
          Skeeter looks to her lap and shakes her head.

                          SKEETER
           Constantine...quit us.

                          ELIZABETH HILLY
          What?! Oh, my gosh!
          Skeeter nods her head sadly.

                          HILLY
           I'm so sorry, Skeeter.

                          SKEETER
           I really don't want to talk about
           it. Okay?
          The girls nod.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           Anyway...I don't know how to answer
           these letters.
          Elizabeth looks to Aibileen.

                          ELIZABETH
           Well...I mean as long as it doesn't
           interfere with her work.
          A phone rings. Elizabeth nods to Aibileen.

                         

          INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

          Aibileen rushes in the kitchen and answers the phone.

           13.

                         

                          AIBILEEN
           Leefolt residence.

                         

          INT. FOOTE ESTATE (INTERCUT) - KITCHEN - SAME TIME


                         CLOSE ON:
          Pink, fuzzy slippers anchoring bare, sexy legs stand on a
          black and white check floor.

           CELIA FOOTE (O.C.)
           Ah-hem. Hello, is Elizabeth in?
          Rising up a slim torso, sizeable cleavage bursts out of a
          pink robe's collar.

                          AIBILEEN
           She having bridge club right now.
           May I take a message?
          CELIA FOOTE, 28, peroxide blonde, stands in all her country
          girl glory.
          She speaks with a thick, unrefined, Southern accent, mired in
          insecurity.

                          CELIA
           Please tell her Celia Foote called
           again. I'll call back tomorrow.

                          AIBILEEN
           Yes, ma'am.
          Celia nervously twists herself around in the phone cord.

                          CELIA
           Ah-hem. Miss?
          "Miss" strikes Aibileen as very odd.

                          CELIA (CONT'D)
           I'm looking for some help at my
           house. You know any maids looking?

                          AIBILEEN
           No, ma'am.

                          CELIA FOOTE
           Okay. Celia Foote. Emerson 6-8-4.
           Bye, now.
          Celia hands up the phone with a frown and sips from a coca-
          cola bottle.

                         

          INT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Aibileen enters the living room with a coffee pot.

           14.

                         

                          ELIZABETH
           Who was that on the phone?

                          AIBILEEN
           Miss Celia Foote called again.
          Elizabeth leans over and touches Hilly's arm.

                          ELIZABETH
           I've never called her back, Hilly.

                          HILLY
           She can't take a hint, can she?

                          JOLENE
           Who's Celia Foote?

                          HILLY
           That tacky girl Johnny married.

                          ELIZABETH
           Girl? I heard she's twenty-eight.

                          JOLENE
           Oh my God!

                          HILLY
           Uh-hmm, worked concessions at a LSU
           game and sold him a hotdog. And,
           boy, he got a whole lot more.
          All the girls laugh.

                          SKEETER
           Could have been you, Hilly.

                          HILLY
           And live thirty minutes outside of
           town? Anyway, I ran into her at
           the beauty parlor, and she had the
           nerve to ask if she could help with
           the children's benefit.

                          SKEETER
           Aren't we taking non-members? The
           benefit's gotten so big.

                          HILLY
           Yes, but we're not telling her.
          Everyone laughs but Skeeter. Aibileen pours Skeeter a cup of
          coffee. Skeeter looks up decidedly and smiles.

                          SKEETER
           Thank you, Aibileen.
          Hilly begins squirming in her seat, obviously making a point.
          Elizabeth leans over.

                          ELIZABETH
           Oh, Hilly, I wish you'd just go use
           the bathroom.

           15.

                         

                          HILLY
           Ah-hem. I'm fine.
          Missus Walters shouts out from the sofa.

                          MISSUS WALTERS
           She's upset cause the nigra uses
           the guest bath, and so do we.
          Elizabeth turns to Aibileen.

                          ELIZABETH
           Aibileen, go check on Mae Mobley.
          Aibileen disappears. Elizabeth leans into Hilly.

                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
           Just go use mine and Raleigh's.
          Hilly hiss-whispers.

                          HILLY
           If Aibileen uses the guest
           bathroom, I'm sure she uses yours
           too.

                          ELIZABETH

           SHE DOES NOT!
          Aibileen turns the corner in the hall and stops.

                          HILLY
           Wouldn't you rather them take their
           business outside?
          Skeeter sees a reflection of Aibileen listening off of a
          picture in the hall. Skeeter tries to change the subject.

                          SKEETER
           Did y'all see the cover of "Life"
           this week? Jackie's never looked

                          MORE REGAL-

                          HILLY
           -Tell Raleigh every penny he spends
           on a colored's bathroom, he'll get
           back in spades when y'all sell.
           It's just plain dangerous.
           Everybody knows they carry
           different diseases than we do. I
           double.
          Elizabeth takes a puff of her cigarette and fidgets with her
          cards.

                          ELIZABETH
           I can't ask Raleigh until tax
           season. But, it would be nice.

                          HILLY
           That's why I've drafted The Home
           Help Sanitation Initiative.

           16.

                         

                          SKEETER
           "The Home"...the what?!

                          HILLY
           As a disease preventative bill that
           requires every white home to have a
           separate bathroom for the colored
           help. I've even notified the
           Surgeon General of Mississippi.
           I'll pass.
          Skeeter again glances at Aibileen. Their eyes meet.

                          SKEETER
           Maybe we ought to just build you a
           bathroom outside, Hilly.
          The room grows eerily quiet.

                          HILLY
           You ought not to joke about the
           colored situation.
          Hilly leans in toward Skeeter.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           I'll do whatever it takes to
           protect our town. Your lead,
           Jolene.
          Jolene suddenly looks to a wall clock. She jumps up and
          throws her cards to the table.

                          JOLENE
           I have to skedaddle! Gotta get
           over to the station!

                          (EXCITEDLY)
           Daddy's letting me do the weather
           tonight!

                         

          EXT. FOOTE ESTATE - BACKYARD - SAME DAY

          Celia delicately prunes two rosebushes. Her long pink
          fingernails wrap easily around a pair of sheers.
          As Celia stands back to admire her work, We widen to see the
          Foote estate. Ancient oaks dripping in Spanish moss surround
          a perfectly manicured lawn. "Tara" pales in comparison.
          Oddly, the two rosebushes have been planted in the center of
          the lawn, jeopardizing the Antebellum Feng Shui.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           Now, Miss Celia had her a man.
           `Bout the best lookin' man in all
           of Mississippi. But, no baby and
           no friends.
          JOHNNY FOOTE, 23, Celia's ridiculously handsome husband,
          sneaks up behind her as he removes his jacket and tie.

           17.

                         

                          JOHNNY
           Roses look like weeds next to you.
          Celia turns with a yelp. She slaps him playfully.

                          CELIA
           Johnny, you scared the daylights
           out of me!
          Johnny begins kissing her neck.

                          CELIA (CONT'D)
           You're home early.
          Celia pushes him back.

                          CELIA (CONT'D)
           Johnny, I can't get any of your old
           friends from school to call me
           back.

                          JOHNNY
           Oh, who cares, honey. We got all
           we need right here.
          Johnny kisses her again and lowers her to the grass.

                          CELIA
           Johnny, honestly!

                          JOHNNY
           Doctor's orders.
          Johnny starts kissing Celia's breasts. She becomes uneasy
          and rolls out from under him.

                          CELIA
           I don't know what's taking us so
           long. I'm sorry.
          Johnny brushes hair from Celia's face.

                          JOHNNY
           Hey, we've never done it in the
           yard. Maybe that's the trick.
          Celia seductively bites her lower lip.

                          CELIA
           Watch my hair.
          Johnny's hand slides up her thigh.

                         

          INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAY

          Bridge over, Skeeter smokes while watching through a window
          as Minny arrives in Hilly's car. Skeeter blows smoke toward
          Hilly and Elizabeth saying good-bye.

           18.

                         
          A sermon plays over an old AM radio nestled between
          canisters of sugar and flour.
          Aibileen enters with a stack of dirty coffee cups.

                          SKEETER
           Aibileen?
          Aibileen becomes nervous at the sight of Skeeter alone.

                          AIBILEEN
           Yes, ma'am.

                          SKEETER
           I had hoped to ask you myself if
           you could help me with the "Miss
           Myrna" letters...

                          AIBILEEN
           Yes, ma'am.

                          SKEETER
           So...Would you help me?
          Aibileen nods and looks out to Elizabeth on the street.

                          AIBILEEN
           Miss Myrna gets it wrong lotta
           times. Be good to get it right.

                          SKEETER
           Thank you, Aibileen. I plan on
           splitting the pay with you, too.
          Aibileen doesn't respond. She grabs a basket of rolls.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           Listen...all that talk in there
           today. Hilly's talk I mean...I'm
           sorry you had to hear that.
          Aibileen quickly turns her back to Skeeter. A gospel choir
          begins singing on the radio.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           Is that Preacher Green's sermon on
           the radio?

                          AIBILEEN
           Yes, ma'am, it is.

                          SKEETER
           That reminds me so much of my maid
           growing up.
          Aibileen starts wiping down a serving tray.

                          AIBILEEN
           Constantine and me...were in church
           circle together.

           19.

                         
          Skeeter turns to Aibileen as she puts out her cigarette.

                          SKEETER
           She loved me like you love Mae
           Mobley.

                          AIBILEEN
           Yes, ma'am.
          Skeeter moves closer to Aibileen.

                          SKEETER
           Aibileen? How could she just quit
           like that?
          Aibileen stops wiping and looks up to Skeeter...

                          AIBILEEN
           Quit?

                          SKEETER
           Yes. When I got home from school
           last week, Momma said she had quit.
           Back in March to go live with her
           people up in Chicago. She didn't
           leave me a note or anything.
          Aibileen turns and resumes wiping the tray.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           Could you do that to Mae Mobley?
          Aibileen slowly turns back to Skeeter.

                          AIBILEEN
           No, ma'am. I couldn't...

                          SKEETER
           Do you have an address for her or
           anything?
          Aibileen shrugs her shoulders, reeling it all back in.
          Just then, Elizabeth walks into the kitchen holding papers
          stapled together. She looks between Aibileen and Skeeter.

                          ELIZABETH
           I'm sorry. Did I interrupt
           something?
          Skeeter and Aibileen shake their heads.
          Elizabeth hands Skeeter the papers. Home Help Sanitation
          Initiative is written on the cover.

                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
           Hilly wants this put in the League
           newsletter.
          Skeeter nods.

           20.

                         

                          SKEETER
           Aibileen, I'll drop by at ten
           tomorrow to get started on Miss
           Myrna.
          Elizabeth looks at Aibileen.

                          ELIZABETH
           Tomorrow is silver polishing day,
           so y'all make it quick, okay?

                         

          EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - LATER THAT DAY

          Skeeter speeds down a country road lined with ancient oak
          trees in a white Cadillac.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           I knew I had said too much to Miss
           Skeeter, but Constantine's story
           weren't mine to tell. Some things
           a girl shouldn't have to know about
           her own mother.
          Her frizzy hair swirls about as she passes a truck full of
          cotton.

                         

          INT. CADILLAC (FANTASY SEQUENCE) - SAME TIME

          Skeeter looks ahead and sees an OLDER BLACK WOMAN walking
          with a LITTLE BLONDE GIRL, 6. They hold hands.
          The black woman smiles and waves as Skeeter passes. When
          Skeeter looks in her rear view mirror, they're gone.
          Skeeter suddenly stops the car just short of an intersecting
          gravel road.
          Skeeter slowly turns down the old road.

                         

          EXT. CONSTANTINE'S HOUSE - DAY

          Skeeter's car pulls into the overgrown yard of an old shack
          with a rusted-out tin roof.
          Two clapboard rooms are separated by an open breezeway. The
          front door is cracked opened.
          Skeeter gets out and walks toward Constantine's home.

                         

          INT. CONSTANTINE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

          Skeeter enters to find only a small bed, dresser, table,
          rocking chair and a wood burning stove.
          Past intruders have long since taken anything of value.

           21.

                         
          As Skeeter approaches Constantine's bed, an OPOSSUM scurries
          out from underneath.
          Skeeter screams as the opossum runs out the door. Her eyes
          suddenly catch something.
          Lying on the bed is an OLD CORN PIPE.
          Skeeter picks it up and brings it to her face. Her eyes
          begin to well up.

                         

          EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - MOMENTS LATER

          Skeeter pulls in front of a grand antebellum home and parks
          to the side of her family's graveyard.
          Skeeter carries her black dress up the stairs of a covered
          porch.
          An old black man with white hair, JAMESO, 70, tightens a
          porch swing.

                          SKEETER
           Hey, Jameso.

                          JAMESO
           Hello, Miss Eugenia.

                         

          INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - ENTRY FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

          Skeeter walks through the front door.

                          SKEETER
           Momma!
          If the Smithsonian had wished to assemble the perfect
          antebellum home, Skeeter would be standing in it.

                         

          INT. PHELAN HOME - PARENTS' BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Skeeter enters and looks around curiously at an ARRAY OF WIGS
          resting atop a dresser.

                          SKEETER
           Momma?
          Skeeter's mother, CHARLOTTE BOUDREAU CANTELLE PHELAN, 50,
          glides into the room wearing a wig. Her floral print dress
          has a gazillion perfectly pressed pleats.
          Charlotte turns to a mirror and adjusts an auburn-colored,
          `pixie' cut.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Is this a little too young?

                          SKEETER
           It's a little too everything.

           22.

                         
          Charlotte removes the wig with a sigh. Only now do we
          realize her decision to wear wigs isn't elective. Thinning
          hair detracts from her perfectly made up face.
          Charlotte puts on a classic bouffant/flip in dark brown.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           Much better.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Your daddy bought me this dress in

           `58.

                          SKEETER
           Mom, I want to ask you about

                          CONSTANTINE-

                          CHARLOTTE
           -Right after Ole Miss won the Sugar
           Bowl.
          Charlotte unzips the dress and takes it off.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           Come on, you try it on.

                          SKEETER
           What really happened?
          Charlotte winces with pain and grasps her stomach.

                          CHARLOTTE
           I told you...she went to live with
           her people in Chicago...Now,
           Skeeter, your mother is dying, and
           she wants to see you in this dress.
          Charlotte stands in her slip and bra holding the dress.
          Skeeter begins taking off her clothes.

                          SKEETER
           How could she just take off without
           telling me?

                          CHARLOTTE
           I told her not to write you. I
           didn't want you upset in the middle
           of final exams. Honey, we were
           just a job to her. With them it's
           all about money...Did I tell you
           Fanny Peatrow got engaged? After
           she got that teller job, her mother
           said she was just swimming in
           proposals.

                          SKEETER
           Good for "Fat Fanny Peatrow."
          She lowers the dress over Skeeter's head and zips it.

           23.

                         

                          CHARLOTTE
           This looks precious on you! Four
           years ago my daughter went off to
           college, and what did she come home
           with?

                          SKEETER CHARLOTTE
          A diploma. A pretty piece of paper.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           Hilly and Elizabeth have such
           lovely children.

                          SKEETER
           They dropped out of college to
           become housewives, Mother.

                          CHARLOTTE
           If only you'd show a little
           gumption, Eugenia...

                          SKEETER
           Well, I did get a job today.

                          CHARLOTTE
           You did?

                          SKEETER
           Writing...for The Jackson Journal.
          Charlotte plumps up the dress around Skeeter's behind.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Great. You can write my obituary.
           "Charlotte Phelan dead. Her
           daughter still single."

                          SKEETER
           Momma, would it really be so
           terrible if I never met a husband?
          With that, Charlotte grabs Skeeter's hand and takes her to a
          love seat. They sit. This is serious.

                          CHARLOTTE
           I need to...ask you something,
           Skeeter. I read the other day
           about how some girls...get
           unbalanced, start thinking
           these...well, unnatural thoughts.
          Charlotte begins to twist the handkerchief she holds.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           Are you...do you...find men
           attractive? Are you having
           unnatural thoughts about...
          Charlotte shuts her eyes tight.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           Girls or...or women?

           24.

                         

                          SKEETER
           Oh my God!

                          CHARLOTTE
           Because, this article says there's
           a cure, a special root tea.
          Skeeter jumps up.

                          SKEETER
           Mother, I want to be with girls as
           much as you wanna be with Jameso.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Eugenia!
          Skeeter storms out of the room.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

                          (SHOUTING)
           Carlton's bringing Rebecca to
           dinner. Try to look presentable!

                         

          INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

          The Phelan dining room is lit solely by candles.
          The Phelan's new maid, PASCAGOLUA, 40, rolls a cart of
          casseroles around the table.
          Charlotte sits at the head of the table. She's having a bowl
          of broth.
          Skeeter sits next to her Father, ROBERT PHELAN, 60.
          Skeeter's brother, CARLTON, 25, sits next to his fiancé,
          REBECCA, 21. They're perfectly groomed with Hollywood good
          looks.

                          CARLTON
           What the hell do you know about
           cleaning a house, Skeeter?

                          SKEETER
           It's a start, Carlton.

                          CARLTON

                          (MOCKINGLY)
           I thought you wanted to write
           books.

                          ROBERT
           Leave your sister alone, Son. I'm
           proud of you, Sweetheart.
          Charlotte scoops up some broth with a spoon.

           25.

                         

                          CHARLOTTE
           Oh, the irony of it all. Givin'
           advice on how to keep up a home
           when she...
          Charlotte's spoon goes in her mouth.
          Pascagolua tries to scoop some sort of casserole covered in
          almonds onto Skeeter's plate. Skeeter stops her.

                          SKEETER
           Oh! No, Pascagolua! You couldn't
           have known this...But, see, I'm
           allergic to almonds.

                          PASCAGOLUA
           Sorry, Miss Eugenia.

                          SKEETER
           Last time I had an almond, I
           stopped liking men.
          Charlotte glares at Skeeter. Carlton lets out a chuckle.
          Rebecca is mortified.

                          REBECCA
           Oh my Lord.

                          SKEETER
           It's okay, Rebecca. They have a
           special root tea now.

                          CHARLOTTE
           You have pushed it, Young Lady!
          Pascagolua scurries off. Skeeter turns to her father...

                          SKEETER
           Daddy, what happened to
           Constantine?
          The room grows silent. Carlton looks down to his plate.

                          ROBERT
           Ah...well, Constantine went to live
           with her family. People move on,
           Skeeter. But I do wish she'd
           stayed down here with us.

                          SKEETER
           I don't believe you.
          Skeeter looks to her mother who immediately busies herself
          with scooping up more broth.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           Mother, did you...fire her?

                          CHARLOTTE
           You wouldn't understand. Not until
           you've hired help of your own.

           26.

                         

                          SKEETER
           She raised me!
          Charlotte slaps the table and stands.

                          CHARLOTTE

           SHE DID NOT!
          Skeeter's eyes fill with tears...

                          SKEETER
           She worked here for twenty-nine
           years.
          Charlotte presses both hands to her stomach.

                          CHARLOTTE
           It was a colored thing, and I've
           put it behind me.
          Charlotte passes behind Rebecca and kisses her head.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           Excuse me, Rebecca. My daughter
           has upset my cancerous ulcers.
          As Charlotte leaves the room, Rebecca looks at Skeeter like
          she's the worst person on earth.
          Skeeter gets up and storms off into the entry foyer.

                         

          INT. PHELAN PLANTATION (FLASHBACK) - ENTRY FOYER - NIGHT

          Skeeter, 13 and lanky, wears a party dress. Despite a tight
          bun, her strong-willed hair has started to frizz.
          Skeeter's father and brother race down the stairs with
          suitcases. Carlton wears a varsity sweater.

                          SKEETER
           Good luck down there, Carlton.

                          CARLTON
           Have fun at the dance, Skeeter
           Legs.
          Robert and Carlton race outside as Charlotte enters, healthy
          and glowing.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Eugenia! You've grown another inch
           since breakfast. Go put on a dress
           that fits before that boy and his
           daddy come pick you up.
          A horn blows. Charlotte kisses Skeeter on the cheek and then
          looks over to CONSTANTINE, 50.

           27.

                         
          Constantine stands tall. Her skin is black as night. Her
          eyes have a striking honey colored hue to them. She wears a
          white sleeping gown.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           Pray Carlton doesn't like LSU,
           Constantine. It's so far. It
           might be the last we see of him.
          The horn blows again. Charlotte is out the door.
          Skeeter turns to Constantine who is all smiles.

                          CONSTANTINE
           Gone be just you and me all
           weekend.

                         

          EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION (FLASHBACK) - PATIO - MOMENTS LATER

          Skeeter sits at a picnic table smoking a cigarette.
          Constantine smokes tobacco out of a corn pipe.

                          SKEETER
           I just couldn't tell her I didn't
           get asked to the dance.

                          CONSTANTINE
           Some things we should just keep to
           ourselves.
          Skeeter looks down to her long, bony legs.

                          SKEETER
           I'm already taller than the boys'
           basketball coach. How tall are
           you, Constantine?

                          CONSTANTINE
           I'm five-thirteen, so quit feeling
           sorry for yourself.

                          SKEETER
           Momma was third runner up in the
           Miss South Carolina pageant.

                          CONSTANTINE
           "Miss" what? Shoot, Child! You
           gone be "Miss Something Better."
          Constantine grabs Skeeter's hand and presses her thumb firmly
          to her palm.

                          CONSTANTINE (CONT'D)
           Now you listen. Your momma didn't
           pick her life. It pick her, and she
           done even know it. You gone do
           something big with yours. Bigger
           than your momma or your brother.
          Constantine lets go of Skeeter's palm and wipes a tear from
          her face.

           28.

                         

                          SKEETER
           What about you? What did you want
           to be, Constantine?
          Constantine laughs.

                          CONSTANTINE
           Oh, Child! We don't get to pick.
           This pick us, and that just how it
           is.
          Tight on Skeeter's face as Constantine gives her a big hug.

                         

          INT. PHELEN PLANTATION - SKEETER'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

          Skeeter lies in bed staring holes into the ceiling as a
          rooster announces the morning.
          A sudden revelation washes over her. In a flash, Skeeter is
          out of bed and running down the stairs.

                         

          INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

          Pascagoula tends to a skillet full of eggs next to a black
          and white TV resting on the counter.

          CLOSE ON TELEVISION:
          Jolene French attempts to deliver the weather on WLBT.

                          JOLENE
           Sunny skies and a high of ninety-
           eight today with ninety-nine
           percent humidity. There's a slight
           chance of afternoon showers so
           y'all carry an umbrella.
          Jolene pivots to camera, lowers her chin and smiles.
          Skeeter runs past Pascagoula with a phone and disappears
          inside the pantry.

                         

          INT. HARPER AND ROW PUBLISHING - OFFICE - NEW YORK - LATER

          ELAINE STEIN, 45, hard but stylish, talks on the phone in a
          large corner office. She lights a cigarette and swivels her
          chair toward the Manhattan skyline.

                          MISS STEIN
           What gave you this idea, Miss
           Phelan? I'm...curious.

                         

          INT. PHELAN PLANTATION (INTERCUT) - PANTRY - SAME TIME

          Skeeter sits on a huge sack of flour. A millennium's supply
          of can goods fills the shelves.

           29.

                         

                          SKEETER
           I was...well, I was raised by a
           colored woman. I've seen how
           simple it can be and...well, how
           complex it can be, too...between
           the families and the help.

                          MISS STEIN
           Continue.

                          SKEETER
           I'd like to write something from
           the point of view of the help.
           These colored women raise white
           children, and then twenty years
           later those children become the
           employer. It's that irony, Miss
           Stein, that we love them and they
           love us yet...we don't even let
           them use the toilet in the house.
          Miss Stein's swivels her chair back around and sits up.

                          MISS STEIN
           I'm listening.

                          SKEETER
           Margaret Mitchell glorified the
           mammy figure who dedicates her
           whole life to a white family but no
           one...ever asked Mammy how she felt
           about it. There is both undisguised
           hate for white women and an
           inexplicable love, but nobody ever
           talks about it down here.

                          MISS STEIN
           So, a side to this never before
           heard.

                          SKEETER
           Yes!
          Charlotte knocks on the pantry door.

           CHARLOTTE (O.C.)
           Skeeter, who are you talking to in
           there?
          Skeeter covers the mouth piece and opens the door.

                          SKEETER
           Go! Away!
          Skeeter slams the door.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           So, yes, their side of the story.
          Skeeter leans back against the shelves.

           30.

                         

                          MISS STEIN
           Who was that?

                          SKEETER
           My mother. She just dropped by to-

                          MISS STEIN
           Look, no maid in her right mind
           would ever tell you the truth.
           That's a hell of a risk in a place
           like Jackson, Mississippi. I
           watched them try to integrate your
           bus station on the news. Oy! They
           jammed fifty-five Negroes in a jail
           built for four.
          Skeeter panics.

                          SKEETER
           I already have a maid.
          Skeeter can't believe what just came out of her mouth. Miss
          Stein rises and sits on the edge of her desk.

                          MISS STEIN
           Really? A negro maid has already
           agreed to talk to you?
          Skeeter blinks hard. No turning back now.

                          SKEETER
           Yes, ma'am...

                          MISS STEIN
           Well...I suppose I could read what
           you come up with. The book biz
           could use a little rattling.

                          SKEETER
           You'd do that?

                          MISS STEIN
           I'm saying I'll let you know if
           it's even worth pursuing.

                          SKEETER
           Oh, thank you, Miss Stein!

                          MISS STEIN
           And for God's sake, you're a twenty-
           four-year-old educated woman. Go
           get an apartment.
          She hangs up.

                         

          INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAY

          Skeeter sits across the table from Aibileen, reading the
          `Miss Myrna' letters.

           31.

                         
          Outside, winds howl, and the sky grows dark. Jolene's
          forecast appears to be a bit off.

                          SKEETER
           "Dear Miss Myrna, How do I remove
           the rings from my fat, slovenly
           husband's shirt collar when he is
           such a pig and sweats like one
           too..."

                          AIBILEEN
           Which one she want a get rid of?
           Them rings or the husband?
          Skeeter chuckles and shrugs her shoulders.

                          AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
           Tell her a vinegar and Pine-Sol
           soak. Then let it set in the sun a
           bit.
          Skeeter writes this down.

                          AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
           Bout an hour. Let it dry.
          Skeeter keeps writing. Aibileen notices something outside.
          Hilly walks into the Leefolt backyard with her son, BILLY, 3,
          perched on her hip.
          A CONTRACTOR, 30s, follows holding a set of plans.
          Skeeter turns to the open window. It's already started to
          sprinkle outside.

                          HILLY
           Build it just like the one at my
           house, right against the garage.
          The contractor nods. Lightning strikes, thunder cracks.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           Oh, mercy!
          Hilly is off and running with Billy. Skeeter seizes the
          moment.

                          SKEETER
           Aibileen, do you ever wish you
           could...change things?
          Aibileen turns slowly from the window.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           I mean, all that talk yesterday and
           now with what Hilly's up to.
          Aibileen's eyes fall to the floor.

           32.

                         

                          AIBILEEN
           Everthing's fine.

                          SKEETER
           My momma fired Constantine. Thank
           you for telling me that.

                          AIBILEEN
           I never tolt you that!
          Aibileen jumps up as another crack of thunder sounds out.

                          SKEETER
           Aibileen, I have an
           idea...Something I want to write
           about...But I need your help.
          Skeeter rises.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           I want to interview you...about
           what it is like to work as a maid.
          Aibileen stops at the refrigerator, gripping the life out of
          its handle.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           I'd like to do a book of interviews
           about working for white families.
           Show what it's like to work for,
           say...Elizabeth.
          Aibileen begins to perspire. She grabs the counter to steady
          herself, then moves toward her chair.

                          AIBILEEN
           You know what'd happen to me if
           Miss Leefolt knew I was tellin'
           stories on her?

                          SKEETER
           I was thinking we wouldn't tell
           her. The other maids will have to
           keep it secret, too.

                          AIBILEEN
           Other maids?

                          SKEETER
           I was hoping to get four or five.
           To really show what it's like in
           Jackson. To see what y'all get
           paid, the babies, the bathrooms,
           the good and the bad.
          Aibileen shakes her head.

                          AIBILEEN
           They set my cousin Shinelle's car
           on fire just cause she went down to
           the voting station.

           33.

                         

                          SKEETER
           A book has never been written like
           this, Aibileen.

                          AIBILEEN
           `Cause they's a reason. I do this
           with you, I might as well burn my
           own house down.
          Bam! The front door slams shut.

                         

          INT. LEEFOLT HOME (INTERCUT) - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

          Soaking wet, Elizabeth and her husband, RALEIGH, 25, stand
          toe to toe.

                          RALEIGH
           I put up with the new clothes and
           all the damn trips to New Orleans,
           but this takes the goddamn cake!

                          ELIZABETH
           It'll confuse Mae Mobley if she
           sees Aibileen going inside. And we
           can't risk her health.

                         KITCHEN:
          Aibileen hears Mae Mobley crying, but she is frozen.

                         LIVING ROOM:

                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
           Hilly spoke to the Surgeon General!
           She also said it'll add value to
           our home!

                          RALEIGH
           Great! Mae Mobley can just go to
           college in that bathroom, too.

                          ELIZABETH
           Honey, Hilly's covering the
           cost...and said you can just do
           William's taxes to pay her back.

                          RALEIGH
           We don't take orders from the
           Holbrooks!

          Raleigh storms in and is surprised to see Skeeter.

                          RALEIGH
           Skeeter? How you doing?

                          SKEETER
           Fine.

           34.

                         

                          RALEIGH
           Fix me a sandwich, Aibileen.
          Raleigh storms out as Elizabeth charges into the kitchen.

                          ELIZABETH
           Aibileen, Mae Mobley's crying her
           eyes out!
          Aibileen runs off. Elizabeth sees Skeeter and tries to
          compose herself.

                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
           Skeeter...Hello. I'm sorry but I
           think it's best if you leave now.
          Skeeter gathers her things.

                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
           And...I don't think this Miss Myrna
           thing is gonna work out with
           Aibileen.

                         

          INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - DEN - LATER THAT DAY

          The storm has escalated. The Holbrook house is without
          power. Hilly runs around lighting candles.
          Missus Walters lies on the couch while Minny fans her with a
          newspaper.

                          MISSUS WALTERS
           You're making it a lot hotter
           flapping your arm like that.
          Minny stops and begins squirming with discomfort. Missus
          Walters notices her looking out to the garage bathroom.
          Lightning strikes. Leaves blow across the yard. Hilly plops
          down in a chair with a candle.

                          HILLY
           That should do it. Minny, go get
           me and Momma some iced tea.
          Minny hesitates. She gulps.

                          MINNY
           Uh...Miss Hilly?

                          HILLY
           Yes.

                          MINNY
           Never mind.
          As Minny turns, Missus Walters calls out to her.

           35.

                         

                          MISSUS WALTERS
           You go on ahead and use the guest
           bath, Minny. It's okay.

                          HILLY
           Oh, for crying out loud. It's just
           a little rain. She can go get an
           umbrella up in William's Study!

                          MISSUS WALTERS
           I believe she was working for me
           before you dragged us both here.
          Minny looks outside just as wind slams an aluminum lawn chair
          against the garage bathroom.
          Boom! Another crash of thunder. Large hail stones begin
          falling in the yard.

                          MINNY
           I'm gone get your tea.

                         

          INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - BATHROOM - SECONDS LATER

          Minny sneaks into the guest bath with a candle and shuts the
          door. She carefully lowers the seat and sits. Relief
          spreads across her face.
          There's a knock on the door. She freezes.

           HILLY (O.C.)
           Minny?
          Minny panics, staying completely quiet.

                         

          INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE (INTERCUT) - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

          Hilly leans into the bathroom door.

                          HILLY
           MINNYYYY, are you in there?

                          MINNY
           Yes, ma'am...

                          HILLY
           Are you sitting down?
          Minny gets up quickly and flushes the toilet. Hilly beats on
          the door.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)

           GET OFF OF MY TOILET!!!
          Outside the house, an eerie, groaning sound, much like a
          freight train, intensifies.
          The top of a huge tree snaps off and falls against the house,
          shattering a window.

           36.

                         
          Minny crouches down and covers her head. A draft sucks the
          candle's flame toward the bottom of the door.

                         

          INT. LEEFOLT HOME - MAE MOBLEY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Aibileen sits with Mae Mobley against an interior wall,
          holding a mattress on top of them and humming in her ear.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           On top a Minny losin' her tenth
           job, eighteen people died in
           Jackson that day. Ten white.
           Eight black.

                         

          EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - SAME TIME

          Skeeter stands in her backyard facing Jackson. Cool winds
          head toward the dark, swirling horizon.
          In the distance, lightning strikes.

                         

          EXT. FOOTE ESTATE - FRONT PORCH - SAME TIME

          Celia leans on the porch railing, gazing helplessly as the
          relentless hail storm pummels her two rosebushes.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           God don't pay no mind to color or
           class once he sets a tornado loose.
          Within seconds, the rose blossoms are gone.

                         

          INT/EXT. BATHROOM/BACKYARD (INTERCUT) - THREE MONTHS LATER

          Aibileen uses the newly completed bathroom Hilly has built in
          the garage. The walls consist of unpainted plywood with a
          small window hugging the ceiling.
          Beads of sweat glisten on Aibileen's forehead under a single
          bulb hanging above.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           Soon after, that bitter seed inside
           of me had sprout and was growing
           fast...
          Well into her second pregnancy, Elizabeth exits the house
          with Mae Mobley at her side. She wears an awful, homemade
          maternity dress.

                          ELIZABETH
           Hurry, Aibileen. Mae Mobley's up,
           and I'm off to the doctor.
          Aibileen reaches behind and flushes the toilet. Mae Mobley
          gets excited and points to the garage bathroom.

           37.

                         

                          MAE MOBLEY
           Aibee bafroom, Momma!
          Mae Mobley walks toward the bathroom and calls out.

           MAE MOBLEY (CONT'D)
           Aibee?
          Elizabeth grabs her and forces her down on the back step.

                          ELIZABETH
           No!

                          AIBILEEN
           Be right there, Baby Girl.
          Aibileen pulls up her panty-hose.

                         

          EXT. BUS STOP - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

          Aibileen waits with YULE MAY, 45, as well as other maids and
          black males at a bus stop. Yule May is tall, pretty and
          graceful. Her hair is pulled tightly into a bun.
          Skeeter walks down the sidewalk toward them. She and
          Aibileen catch eyes. Skeeter waves.
          Yule May inches away from Aibileen. One BLACK MAN in
          particular looks with concern as Skeeter walks up.

                          SKEETER
           Afternoon, Aibileen.
          Aibileen nods nervously, looking at the other domestics.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           Can I talk to you?
          A bus pulls up.

                          AIBILEEN
           You got some "Miss Myrna" questions
           for me?

                          SKEETER
           No.
          Yule May and others board. Skeeter grabs Aibileen's arm.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           Please.
          Aibileen signals to Yule May to go on ahead without her.

                          AIBILEEN
           Yes, ma'am.
          The bus pulls away.

           38.

                         

                          SKEETER
           Please let me interview you. I
           know it's scary, but I really
           believe this has to be done. We'll
           be careful.

                          AIBILEEN
           This already ain't careful, Miss
           Skeeter. You not knowing that is
           what scares me most. I'm sorry.
          Skeeter hands Aibileen a piece of paper with her phone number
          written on it. Aibileen turns and walks off down the
          sidewalk.

                         

          EXT. BUS STOP - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Dark outside, Aibileen approaches another, more integrated
          bus stop.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           I know pretty well what happens if
           the white ladies found out we was
           writing about them. Womens, they
           ain't like men. Women don`t beat
           you with a stick. Naw, they like
           to keep they hands clean. Got a
           shiny set a tools they use, sharp
           as witches' fingernails.
          As Aibileen ambles toward a bench, TWO WHITE WOMEN in nurse
          uniforms push in front of her and sit.

                         

          INT. MISSISSIPPI LAW LIBRARY - NEXT MORNING

          Skeeter sits at a long table surrounded by books piled high
          as if to provide a shield of sorts.
          Lying before her, is an old, thin, onionskin booklet curling
          at the edges. It's titled:
           "Compilation of Jim Crow Laws of the South"
          Skeeter opens the booklet and begins reading.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           Any person printing, publishing or
           circulating written matter urging
           for public acceptance of social
           equality between whites and negroes
           is subject to imprisonment.

                         

          INT. AIBILEEN'S HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Aibileen sits at a table wearing a nightgown. She carefully
          combs and styles her wig for work in the morning.
          Her real hair is bound tightly in dozens of tightly bound
          nubs.

           39.

                         
          The rotary wall phone rings. Aibileen hangs the wig on her
          chair and answers.

                         

          INT. MINNY'S HOUSE (INTERCUT) - HALLWAY - SAME TIME

          Minny is hysterical.

                          MINNY
           Oh, Aibileen! I went and did it
           now!
          Minny wraps a hand up in the phone cord.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           Miss Hilly been tellin' everbody in
           town I stole a candelabra! That's
           why I can't get no job.

                          AIBILEEN
           Everbody know you honest, Minny.

                          MINNY
           Oh, but I got her back...I did
           something awful, Aibileen.

                          AIBILEEN
           What you did?!

                         

          EXT. HOLBROOK HOUSE (FLASHBACK) - DAY

          Minny stands on Hilly's porch holding a chocolate pie.

           MINNY (O.S.)
           I cain't tell! I ain't tellin'
           nobody! I done a terrible awful
           thing to that woman. And now she
           knows what I did!
          Hilly answers the door and snarls at Minny. Minny presents
          the pie and says "I am sorry."
          Hilly waves Minny inside.

                         

          INT. MINNY'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER


                          MINNY
           She got what she deserve, Aibileen.
           But, now I ain't gone never get no
           work again...Leroy gone kill me.
          Minny's husband, LEROY, 40, approaches behind Minny. Minny
          slowly turns...

                         

          INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

          Aibileen hears a loud slap and Minny's phone dropping to the
          floor. Yelling and screaming follows.

           40.

                         

                          AIBILEEN
           Minny!
          She can't bear to listen and hangs up the phone. She sees
          Skeeter's phone number taped to the wall.
          Aibileen's breath becomes heavy. Anger wells inside her.
          She picks up the phone again and begins to dial.

                         

          EXT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - NEXT NIGHT - DUSK

          Wearing a black scarf over her hair and clutching her red
          satchel, Skeeter approaches a small, one-story wood
          structure. White paint peels, hydrangeas fill the yard.
          Skeeter spies an old pickup truck parked on the side of
          Aibileen's house, completely covered in years of dust.
          Skeeter checks over her shoulder several times. The porch
          steps creak under her big feet.
          Aibileen quickly opens the door and waves her inside.

                         

          INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Aibileen wears the same yellow dress she wore in the first
          scene.

                          SKEETER
           I parked way up on State Street and
           caught a cab here like you asked.

                          AIBILEEN
           Got dropped two streets over?
          Skeeter nods.

                          SKEETER
           Aibileen, I now know it's against
           the law for us to meet like this.
          Skeeter stares Aibileen up and down. Aibileen self-
          consciously flattens our her dress.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           I've never seen you out of uniform
           before. You look nice, Aibileen.

                          AIBILEEN
           Thank you.
          Aibileen motions for Skeeter to sit on a narrow sofa behind a
          coffee table covered in hand-tatted lace.
          A tray holds a teapot, two cups that don't match and cookies
          resting on folded napkins.
          As Aibileen pours the tea, her hand shakes.

           41.

                         

                          AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
           I'm sorry. I've never had a white
           person in my house before.
          Skeeter sips her tea.

                          SKEETER
           I've never been in a colored
           person's home before. I think
           we're both doing great. This tea
           is really nice.
          Aibileen watches as Skeeter takes a bite of the cookie.

                          AIBILEEN
           Miss Skeeter, What if...What if you
           don't like what I got to say?
           About white peoples?

                          SKEETER
           I...this isn't about my opinion.
           It doesn't matter how I feel.

                          AIBILEEN
           You gone have to change my name.
           Mine, Miss Leefolt's, everbody's.

                          SKEETER
           Everybody? So, you know other
           maids who might be interested?
          Aibileen is quiet for a moment. She shakes her head.

                          AIBILEEN
           It gone be hard.

                          SKEETER
           What about Minny?

                          AIBILEEN
           Minny got her some stories, sho
           nuff. But, she ain't real keen on
           talking to white peoples right now.

                         

          INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

          We continue with the interview seen on page one.

                          SKEETER
           What does it feel like, to raise a
           white child when your own child's
           at home, being...looked after by
           somebody else?

                          AIBILEEN
           It feel...Uh.
          Aibileen glances up to the framed picture of Treelore.

                          SKEETER
           Is that your son?

           42.

                         

                          AIBILEEN
           Yes, ma'am. He dead two years now.
           Got run over at the lumber yard.
           Lungs were crushed.

                          SKEETER
           I'm so sorry. That's horrible.
           And, Aibileen, you don't have to
           call me "ma'am." Not here anyway.
          Aibileen nods. Skeeter stares at her list of questions.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           Do you want to talk about the
           bathroom? Or, about Elizab--Miss
           Leefolt? Anything about the way
           she pays you? Has she ever yelled
           at you in front of Mae Mobley?
          Aibileen shakes her head.

                          AIBILEEN
           I'm sorry, I-
          Aibileen covers her mouth with her hand. Skeeter becomes
          disgusted with herself.

                          SKEETER
           No, I am.
          She pulls out a stack of Miss Myrna letters.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           Let's just do a couple of Miss
           Myrna letters, and I'll run on...

                          AIBILEEN
           I thought I might write my stories
           down and read them to you.

                          SKEETER
           Well, sure I guess.

                          AIBILEEN
           It no different than writing down
           my prayers.

                          SKEETER
           You don't say your prayers aloud?

                          AIBILEEN
           Prayer like electricity. It keep
           life going. Writing it down make
           it more powerful. Lot a ailing,
           sick peoples in this town.

                          SKEETER
           I'm sure.

                          AIBILEEN
           I didn't get a chance to pray for
           Treelore.

           43.

                         

                          AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
           God took him fast `cause he didn't
           want to argue with me. He was just
           twenty-four years old. The best
           part of a person's life.

                          SKEETER
           Oh, Aibileen.

                          AIBILEEN
           But he'd like we's doing this. He
           always said we gone have a writer
           in the family one day...After my
           prayers last night, I got some
           stories down too.
          Skeeter nods. Aibileen opens her notebook and reads.

                          AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
           My first white baby to ever look
           after was named Alton Carrington
           Speers. It was 1938, and I'd just
           turned fourteen years old. Daddy
           had left us, so I dropped out a
           school to help momma with the
           bills.

                         

          INT. MOUNT ZION BABTIST CHURCH - MORNING

          A congregation of three hundred stand singing lively with the
          large choir.
          Aibileen stands next to Yule May and is whispering in her
          ear. Yule suddenly leans back, shocked, shaking her head
          "no."
          Minny watches from two pews back. Her curiosity is peaked.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           Alton's momma died a lung disease.
           I loved that baby, and he loved me.
           That's when I learned I could make
           children feel proud of theyselves.

                         

          INT. HARPER AND ROW PUBLISHING - OFFICE - NEW YORK

          Miss Stein sits at her desk reading Aibileen's stories.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           Alton used to always be asking me
           how come I's black...

                         

          INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER


                          AIBILEEN
           It just ate him up, so one time I
           told him it cause I drank too much
           coffee. Oh, law, you should a seen
           his face.

           44.

                         
          Skeeter laughs as she writes down Aibileen's story.

                          SKEETER
           This is great. You have no idea
           how much I appreciate this...But I
           just have to ask. What changed
           your mind?

                          AIBILEEN

                          (WITHOUT PAUSE)
           Miss Hilly Holbrook.

                         

          INT. JUNIOR LEAGUE HEADQUARTERS - MORNING

          Hilly stands at a podium banging a gavel. The pleats of her
          navy blue sailor's number fan out like an accordion.
          A room full of JUNIOR LEAGUE MEMBERS sits up and quiets down.
          Half the girls are pregnant and most all drink TAB and are
          smoking. Skeeter sits in the back next to Elizabeth.

                          HILLY
           We're running behind on our "coat
           drive," girls. So hurry up and
           clean out those closets...But our
           Christmas Benefit, however, is
           right on schedule as y'all have
           already filled all our baked goods
           raffle slots.
          The girls applaud, turning to each other with praise.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           Y'all think we can put a dent in
           the African Children's hunger this
           year?
          More applause. Those who aren't pregnant, stand. Hilly
          beams. Elizabeth nudges Skeeter out of her chair.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           Now for some exciting news...I
           wanted y'all to be the first to
           know...My William is seeking
           election to the State Senate this
           November!
          Now, even the pregnant women stand. Elizabeth grabs
          Skeeter's arm and pulls herself up.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           He's runnin' on a platform of
           health. Protecting our children.
           Protecting our way of life. So, I,
           with William, have drafted The Home
           Health Sanitation Initiative.
          This sets off a room of whispers.

           45.

                         

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           Skeeter, when can we expect to see
           the initiative in the newsletter?
           I gave it to you a month ago.
          Everyone turns to Skeeter. Elizabeth panics.

                          ELIZABETH
           I gave that to you myself!

                          SKEETER
           I, ah...Well, I-

                          HILLY
           Would you please stand, Skeeter?
          As Skeeter rises, several women shake their heads.

                          SKEETER
           I'll have it in there soon.
          Skeeter glances at the initiative tucked in her satchel.

                         

          EXT. LEAGUE HEADQUARTERS - PARKING LOT - LATER THAT DAY

          Skeeter turns a corner and sees Hilly leaning on her car.

                          SKEETER
           Hilly? Do you need a ride?
          Hilly shakes her head with little emotion.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           I'm sorry about the newsletter.
          Hilly nods. A soft smile begins to form.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           With Momma being sick and-
          Hilly erupts with excitement.

                          HILLY
           He's coming! Oh, Skeeter, he's
           definitely coming this time. This
           Saturday night.

                          SKEETER
           Oh, Hilly, he's cancelled twice
           before. Maybe it's a sign.

                          HILLY
           Don't you dare say that!

                          SKEETER
           You know I won't be his type.
          Hilly grabs Skeeter by the shoulders.

           46.

                         

                          HILLY
           It's your time, Skeeter. And
           damnit, I'm not going to let you
           miss this just because your mother
           convinced you you're not good
           enough for somebody like him.

                         

          INT. MINNY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

          Minny is again wearing her maid's uniform. She puts two
          plates of food down on the kitchen table.
          She sits next to her daughter, SUGAR, 15. Sugar wears a
          brand-spanking-new maids's uniform.

                          MINNY
           Eat up, Girl. Miss Woodra's like
           to not feed ya on try-out day.
          Sugar takes a bite of toast.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           I still say you're too young to be
           waitin' on white peoples...Now,
           Sugar, I want you to listen to me,
           and you listen to me good.
          Minny grabs Sugar's face and looks her right in the eyes.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           These are the rules for working in
           a white lady's house.
          Sugar jerks her face away and sticks her lip out.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           Rule Number One: Don't you ever let
           White Lady find you sittin' on her
           toilet.
          Sugar nods.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           Number Two: You keep your nose out
           of White Lady's problems, and don't
           cry to her with yours. White
           people ain't your friends.

                         

          EXT. RURAL BUS STOP - LATER THAT MORNING

          Minny steps off a bus and walks down an old country road.

           MINNY (V.O.)
           Number Three: When you're cooking
           white food, taste it with a
           different spoon. They see you put
           the tasting spoon back in the pot,
           might as well throw it all out.
           Spoon, too.

           47.

                         

          EXT. FOOTE ESTATE - LATER

          Minny approaches the Foote estate. She stops just short of
          stairs leading up to the front porch.

           MINNY (V.O.)
           Four: You use the same cup, same
           fork, same plate every day.
          Minny takes her first step on the stairs.

           MINNY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Five: Don't hit her kids. White
           people do they own spanking.
          Minny slowly raises her hand to knock on the front door.

           MINNY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Six: No sass-mouthing!
          Minny knocks.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)

                          (TO HERSELF)
           Number six, Minny. Number six.
          The door flies open. Celia Foote answers. She's covered in
          tight pink clothes. Flour covers her face and hair.

                          CELIA
           Hey there! I'm Celia Rae Foote.
           Aibileen said you'd be on time.
          Minny looks down disapprovingly to Celia's bare feet.

                          CELIA (CONT'D)
           Can I get you a cold Coca-Cola?

                          MINNY
           No, thank you. I'm Minny
           Jackson... You...cooking
           something?

                          CELIA
           One of those upsidedown cakes from
           the magazine. It ain't workin' out
           too good. Come on in.

                         

          INT. FOOTE ESTATE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

          Minny enters behind Celia gawking at the flour massacre.

                          MINNY
           What in the hell-
          Minny catches herself.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)

                          (TO HERSELF)
           Tuck it in, Minny. Tuck it in.

           48.

                         

                          CELIA
           I guess I have some learnin' to do.

                          MINNY

                          (STUPID SMILE)
           You sure do.

                         

          INT. FOOTE ESTATE - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Minny and Celia enter a huge dining room. Minny gawks at a
          dusty mahogany table surrounded by twelve chairs.

                          CELIA
           Johnny's momma wouldn't let me
           decorate a thing. If I had my way,
           this house would have wall to wall
           white carpet with gold trim and
           none of this old stuff.
          Minny spies a framed battle-worn Confederate flag complete
          with bullet holes.

                          MINNY
           Where you from?
          Celia lowers her head in shame...

                          CELIA
           Sugar Ditch. It's near Memphis.

                          MINNY
           I know Sugar Ditch. My cousin live
           there.
          Celia changes the subject.

                          CELIA
           Let's go meet Oscar!
          Celia grabs Minny's hand. Annoyed, Minny pulls it away.

                         

          INT. FOOTE ESTATE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Minny stands at the base of a massive, stuffed Grizzly bear.
          It clears the twelve-foot ceiling by an inch.

                          CELIA
           Johnny's granddaddy shot him up in
           Montana back in 1910 with Teddy
           Roosevelt.
          Celia points to fifteen guns mounted behind Oscar.

                          CELIA (CONT'D)
           We got five bedrooms and bathrooms
           here in the main house. The pool
           house has two more beds and baths.

           49.

                         

                          MINNY
           When you gone have some chillins,
           start fillin' up all these beds?
          Celia swallows hard. She places her hand on her stomach.

                          CELIA
           I'm pregnant now.
          Minny steps back and surveys Celia.

                          MINNY
           Gone be eatin' for two. Double the
           cookin'.
          Celia slumps her shoulders as she looks around the house.

                          CELIA
           I know it's an awful lot to do.
           Five other maids have already
           turned me down...Can I at least
           give you some bus money?

                          MINNY
           When you hear me say I don't wanna
           clean this house?

                          CELIA
           What? So...You'll do it?!
          Before Minny can nod. Celia throws her arms around her.
          Minny backs away.

                          MINNY
           No huggin', now. No huggin'.

                          CELIA
           I'm sorry. This is my first time
           hiring a maid.

                          MINNY
           We got to talk about some things
           first. I work Sunday through
           Friday.
          Celia bites her pinky nail.

                          CELIA
           You can't come at all on weekends.

                          MINNY
           Okay. What time you want me here?

                          CELIA
           After eight, and you have to leave
           at four.

                          MINNY
           Okay. Now what your husband say
           you can pay?
          Celia looks away.

           50.

                         

                          CELIA
           Johnny doesn't know I'm bringing in
           help.

                          MINNY
           And what's Mr. Johnny gone do if he
           comes home and finds a colored
           woman up in his kitchen?

                          CELIA
           It's not that I'd be fibbing. I
           just want him to think I can do
           this on my own...I need some help
           `til I get the hang of it. I need
           a maid.

                          MINNY
           A course you do. Last one done got
           shot in the head.
          Minny sniffs the air.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           Miss Celia, I think you done burned
           up yo cake.

                         

          INT. FOOTE ESTATE - KITCHEN - SECONDS LATER

          Celia grabs a rag off the sink and jerks the cake out of the
          oven.

                          CELIA
           Oww! Dawgonit!
          She drops the burnt cake on the floor.

                          MINNY
           You can't use no wet towel on a hot
           pan.
          Minny grabs a dry towel and picks up the cake.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           I'll take this burnt up cake with
           me so Mister Johnny don't see it.

                         

          INT. LEEFOLT HOME - MAE MOBLEY'S ROOM - MORNING

          Aibileen removes Mae Mobley's wet cloth diaper on a changing
          table. Mae Mobley's behind is covered with inflamed diaper
          rash.
          Aibileen shakes her head. Elizabeth enters the room.

                          ELIZABETH
           I'm off, Aibileen. Don't forget
           Raleigh wants pot roast tonight.

           51.

                         

                          AIBILEEN
           Yes, ma'am.
          Aibileen's eyes narrow.

                         

          INT. AIBILEEN'S HOME - KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Skeeter works with a typewriter now. Aibileen, more casually
          dressed than before, waits for Skeeter to finish typing.

                          AIBILEEN
           I reckon I'm ready...to talk about
           Miss Leefolt now.
          Skeeter stops typing and looks up. She nods.

                          AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
           Baby girl don't get her diaper
           changed `til I get there in the
           morning. That's `bout ten hours
           she gots to sit in her mess. I be
           so worried about her on my day off.
           I always come in an hour early on
           Mondays.

                         

          INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Charlotte sits at a table sorting through mail as Skeeter
          enters and grabs an apple

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           Miss Leefolt pregnant again, too.
           And, law, I pray this child turn
           out good. It a lonely road if a
           momma don't think theys child is
           pretty.
          Charlotte glances down disapprovingly at the dingy, huarache
          shoes on Skeeter's feet. Skeeter heads for the door.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Where are you going, Skeeter?
          Skeeter turns.

                          SKEETER
           Bible study.

                          CHARLOTTE
           On a Saturday night?

                          SKEETER
           Momma, God doesn't care what day of
           the week it is.
          Skeeter walks out the back door as Charlotte shakes her head.

           52.

                         

          EXT. JOLENE FRENCH'S HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY

          Hilly, Elizabeth and Jolene French stand with Hilly's
          contractor. He unrolls a set of bathroom plans.
          Hilly and Elizabeth look to Jolene and nod approvingly.

                         

          INT. AIBILEEN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Skeeter's typing slows.

                          AIBILEEN
           Miss Leefolt be spending so much
           time keeping up with the society
           ladies, she done forgot the child
           she got now.
          Just then Minny barges through the kitchen back door.

                          MINNY
           Aibileen!
          Minny stops cold in her tracks at the sight of Skeeter.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           Yule May told me what y'all up to.
          Aibileen nods. Minny's face hardens.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           Medgar Evers live five minutes
           away. They blew up his carport
           last night. For talking!
          Minny scowls at Skeeter.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           What makes you think colored people
           need your help? You white. Why
           you care?

                          AIBILEEN
           We all working for the same thing.

                          MINNY

                          (TO SKEETER)
           Maybe you just want to get her in
           trouble.
          Skeeter is petrified. Her face reddens.

                          SKEETER
           I want to show her perspective...so
           people might understand what it's
           like from your side.

                          MINNY
           Well it's a real Fourth of July
           picnic.

           53.

                         

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           It's what we dream a doing all
           weekend long, get back in they
           house to polish the silver. And we
           just love not getting minimum wage
           or Social Security.

                          SKEETER
           I know, Minny. Maybe things might

                          CHANGE IF-

                          MINNY
           What law's gonna say you gotta be
           nice to your maid? And another
           thing, I don't want my children
           going to school with white kids.
           And I don't care a thing about
           votin.' Only thing black mens get
           elected to is Deacon of the church.

                          AIBILEEN
           You don't have to do this, Minny.

                          MINNY
           You damn right I don't! You two
           givin' me the heart palpitations.
          Minny storms out the back door. Skeeter looks like she might
          get sick.

                          AIBILEEN
           And that was a good mood.
          Minny immediately storms back in the kitchen.

                          MINNY
           All right...I'm gone do it. I just
           want to make sure you know this
           ain't no game we're playing here.
          Skeeter nods, trembling as Minny slides a chair in the middle
          of the kitchen and sits.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)

                          (TO SKEETER)
           Slide your chair out from under
           that table and face me. I want to
           see you square on at all times.
          Still trembling, Skeeter slides her chair from the table and
          just sits there staring at Minny.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           I's got to come up with your
           questions, too?!

                          SKEETER
           Let's begin...begin with...with
           where you were born.
          Aibileen grabs her notebook and begins writing.

           54.

                         

                          MINNY
           Belzoni, Mississippi on my great-
           auntie's sofa. Next!

                         

          INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - HOURS LATER

          Minny talks a mile a minute. Aibileen continues writing.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           Once Minny got to talking `bout
           food, she liked to never stop...

                          MINNY
           I put the green beans in first,
           then I go on and get the pork chops
           going cause, mmm-mmm, I like my
           chops hot out the pan.
          Just as Aibileen fills the first notebook, Skeeter hands her
          another from her satchel.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           But when she got to talking about
           the white ladies, it took all
           night...

                         

          INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - SUNRISE

          The first signs of morning sun filter into the kitchen.

                          MINNY
           "Oh, Minny, I'm gone give you a
           week paid vacation." Now, I ain't
           had no paid vacation in my life. A
           week later, I come back and they'd
           moved to Mobile. "Miss Lazy
           Fingers" scared I'd find a new job
           before she moved...
          Minny spins around to Aibileen with sudden realization...

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           We gots to get more maids!
          Minny stands. Skeeter's eyes widen with hope.

                          AIBILEEN
           I know, but it hard, Minny.
          Mind racing, Minny flies out the door without a word.
          Aibileen turns to Skeeter.

                          AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
           You gone and done it now.

           55.

                         

          INT. HARPER AND ROW PUBLISHING - OFFICE - NEW YORK - DAY

          Miss Stein discusses Aibileen and Minny's stories with
          Skeeter on the phone.

                          MISS STEIN
           I like this "Sarah Ross." She can
           kvetch but not complain too much.

                         

          INT- PHELAN PLANTATION (INTERCUT) - PANTRY
          Skeeter nods rapidly as if she knows what "kvetch" means.

                          MISS STEIN
           And this "Bertha"...she's got
           chutzpah. I'll give her that.

                          SKEETER
           So...you liked it?

                          MISS STEIN
           Eugenia, Martin Luther King just
           invited the country to march with
           him in D.C. this August. This many
           negroes and whites haven't worked
           together since "Gone with the
           Wind."

                          SKEETER
           Does this mean you'll publish it?

                          MISS STEIN
           I never said that. My advice is to
           write it fast before this civil
           rights thing blows over. I need it
           by New Year's, and don't send me
           anything more until you have twelve
           maids.

                          SKEETER
           Twelve?

                          MISS STEIN
           At least.

                         

          INT. AIBILEEN'S KITCHEN - THAT NIGHT

          Minny, Aibileen and Skeeter sit at the kitchen table.

                          MINNY
           Aibileen and I done asked everbody
           we know. Thirty-one maids.
           Everbody too scared, think we
           crazy...

                          SKEETER
           Then we might as well stop!

                          MINNY
           I got plenty a stories, Miss
           Skeeter. Just write`em down and
           invent a maid that said it. We
           already making up everbody's name.
           Make up the maids, too.
          Skeeter jumps up from her chair.

                          SKEETER
           We can't do that!
          Aibileen and Minny lean back.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           I mean...I would never do that. It
           wouldn't be real. It's wrong.

                          AIBILEEN
           Don't give up on us, Miss Skeeter.
          Skeeter softens and sits back down.

                          SKEETER
           I'm sorry. Thank you both for
           trying.

          Celia and Minny stand at a fried chicken assembly line.

                          MINNY
           What can you cook?
          Minny dips pieces chicken in an egg wash, then drops them in
          a paper bag. A puff of flour rises out of the bag.

                          CELIA
           I can cook corn pone, boil
           potatoes, and do grits.
          Minny bursts out laughing.

                          CELIA (CONT'D)
           We didn't have electric current
           where I was raised.

                          MINNY
           Well, I reckon if there's anything
           you ought to know `bout cooking...
          Minny holds up a can of Crisco.

           57.

                         

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           It's this. The most important
           invention since they put mayonnaise
           in a jar. You don't even know the
           things you can do with this here
           can.
          Celia peers into the skillet as Minny spoons out a mound of
          Crisco.

                          CELIA
           How pretty. Looks like frosting.
          Minny rolls her eyes and hands Celia the bag of Chicken.

                          MINNY
           Shake that.
          Celia starts shaking the bag.

                          CELIA
           This is fun!

          Minny sits down at the table with a plate of chicken. Celia
          sits down next to her.

                          CELIA
           Looks so good! I'm starved.
          Aggravated, Minny stands.

                          MINNY
           You supposed to eat in the dining
           room, Miss Celia. That how it
           works.
          Minny grabs Celia's plate.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           Here, I'll take your plate in the
           dinin' room for ya. Want tea?

                          CELIA
           I'm fine right here, Minny.
          Minny sits back down with a sigh. Celia touches her arm.

                          CELIA (CONT'D)
           I'm real grateful you're here.

                          MINNY
           Miss Celia, you got a lot more to
           be grateful for than me.
          A car is heard pulling up in the driveway. Minny panics.

           Oh, no! Hide!
          Minny slides down underneath the kitchen table.

                          CELIA (CONT'D)
           Oh...It's just the florist. Johnny
           must have sent me flowers.
          Minny pulls herself up off the floor. She's mad.

                          MINNY
           Miss Celia, I ain't playin' around
           no more! He gone catch me here and
           shoot me dead right here on this no-

           so good?

                          CELIA FOOTE
           You're right. Maybe we ought to
           burn the chicken a little.
          The doorbell rings. Celia runs off to answer.

                          MINNY
           Minny don't burn chicken.

          Skeeter sits with a towel draped across her shoulders.
          Charlotte, now in an auburn wig, squirts mounds of goo from a
          pink tube onto Skeeter's hair.

                          CHARLOTTE
           This is bound to work, Sweetie. It
           even smells expensive.
          She begins twisting Skeeter's hair into gooey spikes.

                          SKEETER
           I feel the hope in your fingers.
          Skeeter resembles a papier maché starfish.

                          CHARLOTTE
           How can you not know his last name?

                          SKEETER
           He's William's cousin. That's all
           I know.

                          CHARLOTTE
           That's just so sweet of Hilly.
          Charlotte takes a drag from her cigarette, then lifts up a
          silver machine complete with power cord and rubber hose.

                          SKEETER
           What is that?!

           59.

                         

                          CHARLOTTE
           The Shinolator! It cost eleven
           dollars. I'm a good mother.
          Charlotte puts a shower cap device on Skeeter's head and
          reads from the Shinolator manual.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           "The Miracle Straitening Cap" must
           remain on the head for two hours."

                          SKEETER
           Two hours?!
          Charlotte flips a switch and takes another drag. The machine
          groans to life. Skeeter's cap inflates.

                          CHARLOTTE
           I'll have Pascagoula bring you a
           magazine.
          Skeeter snatches her mother's cigarette and takes a drag.

           Thanks, Constantine. Do you think
           this dress is cute?
          Skeeter holds the magazine up to Pascagoula. Only now does
          she realize what she's said and done.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           I'm sorry. Thanks, Pascagoula.
          Pascagoula nods and starts to walk away then turns.

                          PASCAGOLUA
           I knew Constantine. She was a
           mighty fine woman.

                         

          INT. PHELEN PLANTATION - SKEETER'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT DAY

          The Shinolator was a success. Skeeter's hair is straight,
          silky and beautiful.

           Holy shit.

                          CHARLOTTE
           You've shrunk five inches. You'll
           be able to wear heels tonight.
          Charlotte looks down to the huarache shoes on Skeeter's feet
          and rushes to the closet.

           60.

                         

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           You're not leaving this house in
           those awful, Mexican, man shoes.
          Charlotte pulls out a dress and pair of heels.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           What time is he picking you up?

                          SKEETER
           He's meeting me at Hilly's. Can I
           take the Cadillac?

                          CHARLOTTE
           We promised Carlton the Cadillac
           tonight. So, William's cousin will
           just have to come get you himself.

                          SKEETER
           I'll take the truck.

                          CHARLOTTE
           It's hooked to the motor grader.

                          SKEETER
           I'll drive slow.

                         

          EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - FIELD - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

          Skeeter pulls away in a rusted 1941 Chevy farm truck with a
          huge motor grader attached. Charlotte runs next to the
          truck. Her wig is askew.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Don't mope. Remember to smile!
          Skeeter floors it. Charlotte runs faster.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           And, don't sit like some squaw
           Indian. Cross! Your! Ankles!
          Skeeter leaves her mother in a cloud of dust.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

                          (SHOUTING)
           I love you!

                         

          INT. FARM TRUCK - COUNTRY ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

          Chunks of mud fly off the tires. The June sun has set the
          truck's interior at a stubborn 115 degrees.
          Skeeter has no choice but to lower her window. The
          Shinolator meets its match.
          A mangy, STRAY CAT suddenly jumps out in the road. When
          towing 10,000 pounds of farm equipment, slowing down quickly
          isn't an option.

           61.

                         
          A loud thud sounds out from the truck's grill.

                         

          INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - PARLOR - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Hilly, her husband, WILLIAM, and Skeeter's date, STUART
          WHITWORTH, drink high balls and eat cheese in the Holbrook
          parlor. Gold swag curtains hang on the windows.
          Balding and pudgy, only William's family money once made him
          a desirable bachelor. Stuart, on the other hand, is very
          handsome, the "Marlboro Man" in a well-tailored suit.
          Yule May (who we met earlier at church with Aibileen) now
          works for Hilly. She clears empty glasses.

                          WILLIAM
           With your daddy's endorsement, I
           can win that Senate seat.
          Stuart feigns interest.

                          STUART
           I'll talk to him.
          Ice slams against Stuart's teeth as he downs his drink.
          Hilly pats William's leg then turns with concern to a
          grandfather clock announcing half past the hour.
          The front door flies open. Skeeter enters completely out of
          breath and sweaty. Her HAIR HAS TRIPLED IN SIZE. She waves.

                          SKEETER
           Hey.
          As Hilly races toward Skeeter, William and Stuart stand.
          Stuart is as tall as he is handsome.

                          HILLY
           Boys, we'll be right back. Y'all
           talk about quarterbacks or
           something. Yule May, get Miss
           Skeeter a Coca Cola.
          Yule May runs off. Hilly pulls Skeeter down the hall.

                         

          INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Skeeter sits on the toilet downing a Coca-Cola. Hilly twists
          the last of Skeeter's hair into giant rollers.

                          HILLY
           Skeeter, you don't even have on
           lipstick!
          Skeeter dabs her armpits.

           62.

                         

                          SKEETER
           It was so goddamn awful. I hit a
           cat.
          Hilly sprays Final Net.

                          HILLY
           Well...What do you think of him?
          Skeeter applies lipstick. Hilly removes the rollers.

                          SKEETER
           He looks handsome.
          Skeeter stands up and does a twirl for Hilly.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           All right, give it to me. One to
           ten?
          Hilly sprays Skeeter with perfume and stands back.

                          HILLY
           Seven.

                          SKEETER
           Really?! Seven?
          Hilly nods, lets out a little squeal.

                          HILLY
           Honey, you're beautiful. Just go
           on out there...you're gonna do
           great. It's your time, Skeeter. I
           just know it.
          Hilly hugs Skeeter.

                         

          INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          Hilly, William, Stuart and Skeeter sit at a round table
          adorned with white linens, silver and fine china.
          The room buzzes with Jackson's elite all trying to be noticed
          as a JAZZ QUARTET plays softly in a corner.
          A WAITER approaches. Stuart leans into Skeeter without
          making eye contact.

                          STUART
           You want a drink?

                          SKEETER
           Just water, please.

                          STUART

                          (TO WAITER)
           Double Old Kentucky straight...with
           a water back...Make that two backs.

           63.

                         

                          SKEETER
           THANKS?! So...you went to Alabama?
          Stuart nods. Hilly rolls her eyes.

                          HILLY
           "Roll Tide." We still love him.
          Hilly pinches Stuart on the cheek.

                          SKEETER
           Now you're in the oil business.
           Hilly says you're a rigsite leader.

                          STUART
           The money's good. If that's what
           you really want to know.

                          SKEETER
           That's not what I-
          Skeeter and Hilly watch as Stuart's and William's eyes fix on
          the front of the restaurant.
          Celia and Johnny have entered. Celia wears a tight green
          dress and the reddest lipstick ever put in a tube.

                          STUART
           Isn't that your old boyfriend,
           Hilly? Johnny Foote?
          Hilly scowls.

                          STUART (CONT'D)
           Who's his girl? Lord, she's hotter
           than Delta asphalt.
          Celia spots Hilly and gives a self-conscious wave.

                          HILLY
           William! The Lieutenant Governor
           just walked in.
          Hilly jumps up and pulls William away. The waiter returns
          with Stuart's drink and the water backs.

                          STUART
           So, what do you do with your time?

                          SKEETER
           I write a...a domestic maintenance
           column for the Jackson Journal.
          Stuart smirks, taking a huge sip of his drink.

                          STUART
           You mean housekeeping?
          Skeeter nods and grabs her water.

           64.

                         

                          STUART (CONT'D)
           Jesus, I can't think of anything
           worse than reading a cleaning
           column. Except maybe writing one.

                         

          INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - LOBBY - SAME TIME

          Hilly and William finish shaking hands with the Lieutenant
          Governor. As he walks away, Hilly shouts out.

                          HILLY
           We'd love your support on election
           day!
          Celia and Johnny walk up. Hilly stiffens.

                          JOHNNY
           Hilly, you look lovely tonight.

                          HILLY
           Thank you, Johnny.

                          JOHNNY
           William, have you ever met Celia?
          William steps forward and shakes Celia's hand.

                          WILLIAM
           Nice to meet you.
          Hilly grabs the crook of William's arm.

                          HILLY
           Sweetie, we need to go order our
           dinners.
          Celia musters up all the courage inside her.

                          CELIA FOOTE
           Hilly, did you ever get the
           messages that I've been calling
           you?

                          HILLY
           I did not.

                          CELIA FOOTE
           Well, I would love to help with the
           benefit. I have a lovely hand if
           you need invitations addressed.

                          HILLY
           "Save the dates" were mailed weeks
           ago...You didn't get one?
          Celia shakes her head.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           Mail's a lot slower way out there
           in the country, huh?

           65.

                         

                          HILLY (CONT'D)

                          (TO WILLIAM)
           Now, come on, before they run out
           of Trout Almondine.
          Hilly pulls William away. Johnny grabs Celia's hand.

                         

          INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS


                          STUART
           Sounds like a ploy to find a
           husband...becoming an expert on
           keeping house.

                          SKEETER
           Well, you must be a genius. You
           figured out my whole scheme.
          Skeeter fumes as Hilly and William return and sit.

                          HILLY
           What'd we miss?

                          STUART
           Isn't that what you women from Ole
           Miss major in? Professional
           husband hunting?

                          SKEETER
           I'm sorry, but were you dropped on
           your head as an infant?
          Stuart blinks and then smiles, somewhat impressed. Desperate
          to change the subject, Hilly claps her hands.

                          HILLY
           Who? Is? Hungry?
          Skeeter stands.

                          SKEETER
           Not me! A kiss from God couldn't
           turn this `frog' into a `prince.'
          Tables begin to stare.

                          STUART
           Or you a `princess,' Sweetheart!
          As Skeeter walks away, she purposefully slides her purse into
          a glass of water, knocking it over into Stuart's lap.

                         

          INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MORNING

          Hilly and William each have a section of newspaper in their
          face as Yule May clears breakfast dishes. Yule May lingers
          nervously.

           66.

                         

                          HILLY
           Run on, now, Yule May. Got a big
           crowd coming for Miss Leefolt's
           baby shower.

                          YULE MAY
           Miss Hilly, I would like to ask you
           and Mister William something.
          Hilly lowers her paper and nods. Yule May begins wrenching
          her hands.

           YULE MAY (CONT'D)
           My twin boys finished high school,
           both on the honor roll...My husband
           and I have been saving for years to
           send them to college.

                          HILLY
           Okay...
          Only now does William lower his paper.

                          YULE MAY
           We are short seventy-five dollars
           on one of the tuitions.
          William stands up, kisses Hilly on the cheek.

                          WILLIAM
           Well, I'm late. Gotta go.
          William leaves.

                          HILLY
           Go on...

                          YULE MAY
           Now...We're faced with having to
           choose. Which son gets to go...if
           we don't find all the money.
          Hilly draws in a deep breath as does Yule May.

           YULE MAY (CONT'D)
           Would you consider givin' us a
           loan? I'll...I'll work for free
           until it's paid off.

                          HILLY
           That's not working for free, Yule
           May. That's paying off a debt.

                          YULE MAY
           Yes, ma'am.

                          HILLY
           As a Christian, I'm going to do you
           a favor.
          Yule May's eyes widen as a hopeful smile forms.

           67.

                         

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           God doesn't give charity to those
           who are well and able. You need to
           come up with this money on your
           own. You'll thank me one day.
          Hilly raises the paper up to her face as Yule May exits.

                         

          INT. WHITE GROCERY STORE - LATER THAT MORNING

          Minny and Aibileen, in uniform, push carts side by side in
          the grocery store. The white shoppers are dressed casually.
          Other maids in the store (all required to be in uniform while
          shopping) keep quietly to themselves.
          White women smile and chat with one another as they meander
          down the aisles as if the black maids aren't even there.
          Minny suddenly spots Celia in the produce section. She pulls
          Aibileen close as they peer around the corner.

                          MINNY
           That's her.
          Aibileen's mouth drops open at the sight of Celia's shorts
          and tight sweater. Celia is having trouble selecting
          produce.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           Lord, she's trying to shop.
          Celia walks up to a maid, grabs her, and pulls her to the
          tomatoes. The maid, clearly uncomfortable, selects a tomato,
          hands it to Celia, and scurries away.

                          CELIA

                          (SHOUTS OUT)
           Thanks, Doll!

                          MINNY
           Miss Celia just don't see `em. The
           lines. Not between us, Miss Hilly,
           nobody.
          Aibileen just nods.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           What you so quiet for? I know you
           got a opinion `bout all this.

                          AIBILEEN
           You gone accuse me a
           philosophizing.

                          MINNY
           I ain't afraid a no philosophy.

           68.

                         

                          AIBILEEN
           I don't believe in lines anymore.
           Lines is in our heads `cause people
           like Miss Hilly try to make us
           believe they there.
          Celia squeezes a canteloupe with another scared maid.

                          MINNY
           Oh, they there. I know. I get
           punished for crossing them.

                         

          EXT. BUS STOP - MOMENTS LATER

          Aibileen and Minny continue their conversation while waiting
          with several other maids at a bus stop in front of the store.

                          AIBILEEN
           Lotta of folk think if you talk
           back to your husband, you crossed a
           line...need to be punished.

                          MINNY
           You know I ain't studying no line
           like that.

                          AIBILEEN
           Cause it ain't there. `Cept in
           Leroy's head. Lines between black
           and white ain't there either.
          Minny and Aibileen watch as Celia exits the store with her
          groceries and prances toward her car.

                          MINNY
           So, I ain't crossing no line if I
           tell Miss Celia she ain't good
           enough for Miss Hilly? Tell her
           she ain't in Miss Hilly's league?

                          AIBILEEN
           All I'm saying is kindness don't
           have no boundaries.
          Just then, MYRLIE EVERS, 30, (Medgar Evers wife) approaches
          the bus stop with her three Children. SONS, 10 and 3, and a

          DAUGHTER, 8.
          Aibileen and Minny nod as the Evers walk past and sit on a
          bench.

                          AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
           Law, the Evers children have gotten
           so big!

                          MINNY

                          (QUIETLY)
           Cause they happy. Myrlie got her a
           good man...And you better not try
           to say they ain't no line between
           her Medgar and my Leroy.

           69.

                         

                          AIBILEEN
           No. You got me.
          A bus pulls up and the doors open. Minny, Aibileen and the
          other maids step aside to let the Evers family board first.

                         

          EXT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - BACK YARD - LATER THAT DAY

          Aibileen has come along to aid Yule May with Elizabeth's baby
          shower.
          A table is set in the middle of the yard covered in white
          linens and Hilly's best sliver.
          Hilly's son sits on her lap. The other girls' children wear
          bathing suits jumping noisily in and out of two plastic kiddy
          pools.
          Yule May clears cake plates while Aibileen removes crumbs
          with a sterling crumb scraper.
          Mae Mobley wanders up to the table. Her belly almost looks
          distended crammed inside last year's one piece.

                          MAE MOBLEY
           Mae Mo hungry, Momma.
          Elizabeth turns to Mae Mobley but never gets up.

                          ELIZABETH
           She's always hungry.
          All the women laugh except for Skeeter.

                          SKEETER
           You know she can hear you,
           Elizabeth?
          Elizabeth looks down to her plate. Aibileen sets down the
          scraper and kneels down to Mae Mobley.

                          AIBILEEN
           I'm on cut you some cake, Baby.

                          ELIZABETH
           Aibileen, we gave that scraper to
           Hilly and William for their wedding
           present. Chantilly!

                          AIBILEEN
           It so pretty.
          Hilly begins bouncing William Jr. on her knee.

                          HILLY
           Aibileen, are you enjoying your new
           bathroom over at Elizabeth's?
          Hilly nods with a tight smile and glances to the ground at
          Skeeter's red satchel.

           70.

                         

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           Nice to have your own, isn't it?

                          AIBILEEN
           Yes, ma'am.

                          HILLY
           Separate but equal. That's what
           Ross Barnett says, and you can't
           argue with the Governor.

                          SKEETER
           Not in Mississippi. Birthplace of
           modern day government.
          Hilly narrows her eyes at Skeeter and turns to Aibileen.

                          HILLY
           Aibileen, did you know that me and
           Mister Holbrook arranged for that
           bathroom? Sent the boys over and
           the equipment, too.
          Hilly stays on Aibileen, waiting for her to say something.
          Skeeter fumes, hoping Aibileen doesn't say it.

                          AIBILEEN
           Yes, ma'am...And I thank you.
          Hilly smiles and nods.

                          HILLY
           Well...You. Are. Welcome.
          Hilly shoots Skeeter a last look. William Jr. leans into
          Hilly and hugs her.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           One thing I got to say about Miss
           Hilly, she love her children.
           Always tellin' them they smart and
           beautiful. Can't go more than ten
           minutes without givin' one a kiss.
          Hilly kisses her son gently.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           And, law, do they love her back.
           When she starts up on me, I just
           try and think a my sweet Treelore
           and how much he loved me. That
           kind a love makes me cry. Even
           when it going to Miss Hilly.
          Hilly again glances to the red satchel, staring quizzically
          at the worn booklet of The Jim Crow laws sticking out.

                         

          INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAY

          Yule May washes dishes as the women are heard saying their
          "good-byes" on the street. Skeeter slips into the kitchen.

           71.

                         

                          YULE MAY
           May I get you something?

                          SKEETER
           No, thanks...

                          (HUSHED)
           Yule May, I wanted to talk to you.
          Yule May turns off the sink faucet making sure Hilly is still
          cackling out on the street.

                          YULE MAY
           I know what you want to ask, Miss
           Skeeter. Aibileen and Minny
           already did.
          Yule May closes the kitchen door.

           YULE MAY (CONT'D)
           I'm trying to get my boys off to
           college. It's worthwhile what
           y'all doing, but my boys are worth
           more.

                          SKEETER
           I understand.

           HILLY (O.C.)
           What do you "understand," Skeeter?
          Skeeter and Yule May turn to find Hilly standing in the
          swinging door leading into the dining room.

                          SKEETER
           Ah...Yule May was just telling me
           how excited she was that her boys
           were going to go to college.

                          HILLY
           Is that true, Yule May?

                          YULE MAY
           Yes, Ma'am.
          Skeeter notices that Hilly is holding the booklet of Jim Crow
          laws in her hand.

                          HILLY
           Did you also ask Miss Skeeter if
           you could borrow money?

                          SKEETER
           Of course not, Hilly!
          Hilly approaches Skeeter.

                          HILLY
           Skeeter, I'm starting to think
           you're intentionally not putting my
           initiative in the newsletter.
          Eyes down, Yule May hurries out of the kitchen.

           72.

                         

                          SKEETER
           Not at all. I'm just so busy right
           now with Mom.

                          HILLY
           Skeeter...I'm sorry about your
           mother. And I know you must be so
           worried.
          Hilly holds up the Jim Crow booklet.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           But I'm worried about you. All
           this carrying on lately and now
           you're reading this stuff?

                          SKEETER
           My dad had me get that for him.

                          HILLY
           I mean, around your friends is one
           thing...But, believe it or not,
           there are real racists in this
           town! If the wrong person caught
           you with this...you'd be in serious
           trouble.
          Skeeter snatches the booklet from Hilly.

                          SKEETER
           Thanks, Hilly! And thanks for
           going through my things.

                         

          INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - SKEETER'S BEDROOM - NEXT DAY

          Skeeter types feverishly while smoking a cigarette. Keys type
          out: "Home Help Sanitation Initiative."
          Skeeter picks up Hilly's document and shakes her head. She
          types: Don't risk your children's and family's health!

                         

          INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Yule May vacuums. She pulls the sofa away from the wall to
          clean beneath it.
          Noticing something on the floor, Yule May leans over.
          She rises holding a SMALL RUBY RING. Years of dust and hair
          blanket the pitiful gem set in ten karat gold.
          The vacuum seems to roar louder now. Yule May breathes
          heavily. She shoves the ring into her uniform pocket.

                         

          INT. PHELEN PLANTATION - SKEETER'S BEDROOM - THAT AFTERNOON

          As Skeeter bangs away on her typewriter, Charlotte bursts
          into the room, stuck somewhere between panic and joy.

           73.

                         

                          CHARLOTTE
           Skeeter!

                          SKEETER
           What?!

                          CHARLOTTE
           Don't panic, but there's a very
           tall man named Stuart here for you.

                          SKEETER
           He's a drunken asshole, Mother.
           You wouldn't like him.
          Charlotte pulls a sun dress out of Skeeter's closet.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Skeeter, love and hate are two
           horns on the same goat. And, you
           need a goat!

                         

          INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Skeeter, Charlotte and Stuart sit in the living room.
          Pascagoula serves finger sandwiches.
          Stuart looks nice in khaki pants, a blue blazer and a red
          tie. His nose is pink from working in the sun.
          No one says a word. Finally...

                          CHARLOTTE
           Stuart, would you like a cocktail?
          Skeeter shoots her mother a "What the..." look.

                          STUART
           No, Ma'am. Little too early.

                          SKEETER
           Ha!
          Charlotte moves on.

                          CHARLOTTE
           What's your last name, Stuart?

                          STUART
           Whitworth.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Hmm...Where are you from?

                          STUART
           Natchez.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Really? Well, I know a Whitworth
           from Natchez...But he's a Senator
           up in Washington.

           74.

                         

                          STUART
           Yes, Ma'am. That's my daddy.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Who is?

                          STUART
           Senator Whitworth. That's my
           father.
          Charlotte's jaw drops to her string of pearls.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Really?
          Stuart nods. Charlotte stands, flustered yet joyful.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           Well...tell him I said
           "Hello"...I'm going to go see if
           Pascagoula needs some help in the
           kitchen.
          Charlotte backs away behind Stuart's chair. She points at
          Skeeter violently, as if to say, DON'T MESS THIS UP!

                         

          EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - BACK YARD - MOMENTS LATER

          Skeeter and Stuart stand beneath an old Cypress tree as
          Charlotte peeps from an upstairs window.

                          STUART
           Look. I know it was a few weeks
           back, but I came here to say I'm
           sorry for the way I acted.

                          SKEETER
           Who sent you? William or Hilly?

                          STUART
           Neither. I was rude, and I've been
           thinking about it a lot.

                          SKEETER
           Well, I haven't. So, just go.

                          STUART
           Now, look. I told Hilly I wasn't
           ready to go out on any date. I
           wasn't even close to ready.
          Stuart shoves his hands in his pockets like a boy.

                          STUART (CONT'D)
           I was engaged last year. She ended
           it.
          Skeeter refuses to pity him.

           75.

                         

                          STUART (CONT'D)
           We'd been dating since we were
           fifteen. You know how it is.

                          SKEETER
           Actually, I don't. I've never
           dated anyone before.
          Stuart looks up and starts laughing loudly.

                          STUART
           Well! That must be it then.

                          SKEETER
           What?

                          STUART
           I've never met a woman that said
           exactly what she was thinking.

                          SKEETER
           I've got plenty to say...

                          STUART
           Would you like to...come downtown
           with me and have dinner? We could
           talk... We could listen to each
           other this time.

                          SKEETER
           I can't think of anything worse.
          Stuart looks down and nods.

                          STUART
           Then, I'm sorry. That's what I
           came to say and...I said it.
          Stuart turns and walks towards his car, self-consciously
          weaving his strong fingers through his hair.
          Skeeter looks up to her mother's empty window and shouts out
          to Stuart.

                          SKEETER
           Just give me a minute!
          Stuart turns.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           Let me get my sweater.

                         

          INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Skeeter and Stuart sit closely as the same waiter as before
          approaches.

                          STUART
           What do you want, Skeeter?

           76.

                         

                          SKEETER
           I'll have a Co-cola. Lots of ice.

                          STUART
           No, I mean in life. What do you
           want?
          Only now does Skeeter notice the tray of champagne the waiter
          is holding. Stuart nods as two glasses are set before them.
          The waiter leaves.

                          SKEETER
           I want to be a journalist. Maybe a
           novelist. Maybe both.

                          STUART
           I like that...I've been thinking
           about you. You're smart, you're
           pretty, you're...tall!

                          SKEETER
           Pretty?

                          STUART
           Yes. And I read your column. Very
           informative.

                          (SMILING)
           I never knew Crisco got rid of
           diaper rash.
          Skeeter laughs and slaps him playfully.

                          STUART (CONT'D)
           I hope you get to write something
           really good, Skeeter. Something
           you believe in.
          Stuart suddenly leans over and kisses Skeeter.

                         

          EXT. DRIVE-IN-MOVIE - ONE WEEK LATER

          Stuart and Skeeter make out HARD in the back of the
          Holbrook's convertible. Hilly and William sit in the front.
          Hilly peers into the rearview mirror to get a better view.
          Proud of herself, she pats William's leg.
          William slides his hand up Hilly's leg. She jerks it away.

                         

          EXT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

          Aibileen sits on the kitchen floor next to a bucket. She
          feverishly scours grease off the baseboards.
          Elizabeth's car pulls up. Aibileen smiles.

                          AIBILEEN
           Baby girl home.

           77.

                         
          The car door slams shut.

           ELIZABETH (O.C.)
           Aibileen! My trunk's full!
          Aibileen rises slowly, placing a hand on her knee. Outside,
          Elizabeth suddenly shouts out hysterically.

           ELIZABETH (O.C.) (CONT'D)
           Mae Mobley! No! Stop!
          Aibileen panics. She gets up, looks out the window.

                         

          INT. LEEFOLT BACKYARD - SAME TIME

          Mae Mobley sits on Aibileen's toilet in the garage. Door
          wide open, pants around her ankles.

                          MAE MOBLEY
           Me and Aibiee bafroom, Momma.
          Elizabeth runs over and yanks Mae Mobley off, popping her
          hard on the behind.

                          ELIZABETH
           It! Is! Not!
          Mae Mobley begins to cry. Aibileen watches as Elizabeth hiss-
          whispers and yanks Mae Mobley hard on the arm.

                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
           This is dirty out here! You'll
           catch diseases.
          Elizabeth punctuates with three more slaps to her legs.

                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
           No! No! No!

                         

          INT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Aibileen sits on the couch with Mae Mobley who eats a cookie.
          Mae Mobley's face is red and damp.

                          AIBILEEN
           I'm here, baby girl. Aibee's here.
          Aibileen kisses her on the cheek.

                          AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
           You is kind. You is smart. You is
           important...You want me to tell you
           one a our secret stories?
          Mae Mobley nods. The phone rings. Aibileen rises.

           ELIZABETH (O.C.)
           I got it!

           78.

                         
          Aibileen sits back down and leans into Mae Mobley.

                          AIBILEEN
           One day this wise Martian come down
           to Earth to teach us people a thing
           or two.

                          MAE MOBLEY
           Martian? How big?

                          AIBILEEN
           Oh, he about six-two.

                          MAE MOBLEY
           What's his name?

                          AIBILEEN
           Martian Luther King.

                          MAE MOBLEY
           What did he look like?

                          AIBILEEN
           Looked just like us, nose, mouth,
           hair on his head. But, sometimes
           people looked at him funny and were
           just downright mean to him.

                          MAE MOBLEY
           Why Aibee? Why was they so mean?

                          AIBILEEN
           `Cause he was green.
          Elizabeth suddenly barges into the living room.

                          ELIZABETH
           Aibileen! Come on! We have to go
           help Hilly. Now! Come on!
          Elizabeth runs outside. Aibileen grabs Mae Mobley.

                         

          EXT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

          Elizabeth wobbles briskly up the street holding her pregnant
          belly. Aibileen and Mae Mobley follow.
          A stream of people walk toward them, laughing.
          They round a corner to see FIFTY OLD TOILETS, in every shape
          and color imaginable, littering Hilly's lawn.
          Some have towering tanks with chain pulls at the top,
          providing amusement to the procession of cars driving by.
          The Holbrook's station wagon sits in the driveway, doors
          still open with LUGGAGE tied to the roof.
          Two OLD BLACK MEN struggle to remove a toilet under William's
          supervision.

           79.

                         
          Aibileen hides her smile. Mae Mobley points.

                          MAE MOBLEY
           Look! Look, Aibee.
          Hilly flies out of her house as a REPORTER snaps a picture of
          her.

                          HILLY
           Get out of here!
          Hilly pushes him in the bushes and runs up to Elizabeth.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           Skeeter! She put it in the
           newsletter. I specifically said
           old coats are to be dropped at my
           house. Not commodes!
          Hilly faces the toilets again and screams.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           She put it in the newsletter when
           she knew we'd be down at the beach.
          Hilly steps up to Aibileen and points to the old men.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           Go help those boys GET THOSE

           TOILETS OFF MY LAWN!

                         

          INT. BUS - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Aibileen rides in the back of a bus with a YOUNG BLACK MAN.
          Two white men sit right behind the white driver.
          The bus slows to a stop in the middle of the road.
          In the distance, blue lights flash in front of a road block.
          A few people gather.

                          DRIVER
           Y'all stay put. Let me find out
           what's going on.
          As the driver gets up, a WLBT-TV news truck whizzes by
          followed by a police motorcycle. Aibileen leans in the aisle
          and looks ahead.
          The driver returns. The young black man speaks up.

           YOUNG BLACK MAN
           What happen up there, Mister?

                          DRIVER
           Colored people off. White people
           lemme know where y'all are going.
           I'll get you as close as I can.

           80.

                         
          As the young black man helps Aibileen down the aisle, a white
          passenger taps the driver on the shoulder.

                          WHITE PASSENGER
           What's going on?
          Aibileen and the young man walk down the stairs.

                          DRIVER
           I don't know. Some nigger got
           shot. Where you headed?
          The bus door shuts and the driver backs away.

                         

          EXT. STREET - MINUTES LATER

          Aibileen and the young man walk along a dark street. The
          sound of cicadas and sirens fill the air.

           YOUNG BLACK MAN
           You all right? You close to home?

                          AIBILEEN
           I be all right. My house is seven
           blocks from here.

           YOUNG BLACK MAN
           Want me to walk you?

                          AIBILEEN
           Naw, thank ya. I'll be fine...Law,
           I hope this ain't as bad as-
          Aibileen turns to discover the young man is gone. She stares
          into the darkness. Scared, she begins to run.
          She cuts through a yard and trips over a hedge. She falls
          hard to her knees.
          Terrified, Aibileen begins to sob. She sees Minny's porch
          light and pulls herself up.

                         

          INT. MINNY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - SECONDS LATER

          Minny sits with all five of her children, Sugar, LEROY JR,
          12, KINDRA, 10, FELICIA, 6, and BENNY, 4. They all listen
          anxiously to a radio on the table.
          Aibileen opens the screen door and falls to the floor.
          Minny jumps up to help her. She sees blood and grass stains
          streaking the knees of Aibileen's panty hose.

                          MINNY
           Aibileen! You okay?
          Aibileen nods, trying to compose herself.

           81.

                         

           RADIO ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
           Almost ten years serving as the
           Field Secretary for the
           NAACP...Medgar Evers is dead.
          Aibileen swallows hard.

                          MINNY
           KKK shot him! Hour ago. Right in
           front a his children, Aibileen.

                          AIBILEEN
           We gone pray for the Evers. We
           gone pray for Myrlie.
          Minny raises her fists.

                          MINNY
           We living in hell! We trapped.
           Our kids is trapped.
          Minny turns to Sugar.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           Take your brother and sister and go
           get in my bed. Stay there!
          Sugar leads the kids to the back of the house.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           What they gone do to us if they
           catch us with Miss Skeeter?

                          AIBILEEN
           We gone be careful.

                          MINNY
           Hitch us to a pickup and drag us
           behind? Shoot me front a my kids?

                          AIBILEEN
           We ain't doing civil rights with
           Miss Skeeter. We just tellin'
           stories like they really happen.
          Minny and Aibileen grab hands and squeeze hard.

                          MINNY
           You a fool, old woman. A fool!
          Aibileen hugs Minny.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           I can't believe I'm on say this...
           But, I actually wish Leroy was home
           right now.
          Aibileen and Minny laugh a little through the tears.

           82.

                         

          INT. HARPER AND ROW PUBLISHING - OFFICE - NEW YORK

          Elaine Stein sits at her desk flipping through the New York
          Times. She notices something, actually laughs.

          CLOSE ON PAPER:
          A picture shows Hilly standing among the fifty toilets in her
          front yard. A caption reads:
           "Come on by, have a seat!"
          Home of William and Hilly Holbrook, Jackson, Mississippi.

                         

          EXT. OFFSHORE OIL RIG - DAY

          Stuart, on the deck of an offshore oil rig, laughs as he
          looks at Hilly's picture inside a local newspaper.
          He writes on the back of a postcard addressed to Skeeter:
           I guess you potty trained Hilly!
           Much love, Stuart.

                         

          EXT. JUNIOR LEAGUE - PARKING LOT - THREE DAYS LATER

          Skeeter parks and gets out of her car. She suddenly finds
          herself face to face with Hilly.

                          HILLY
           You are sick. Do not speak to me.
           Do not look at me. Don't say hello
           to my children. How long had you
           been planning to humiliate my
           family?

                          SKEETER
           That's not it, Hilly.

                          HILLY
           You thought you were so clever,
           didn't ya? But I've already
           installed three of those old
           toilets in people's garages.

                          SKEETER
           Technically, it was a typo, Hilly.

                          HILLY
           I intend to tell Stuart he's
           ruining his reputation by
           associating with you. Jolene's
           yard boy saw you hanging around the
           colored bus stop.

                          SKEETER
           I wasn't hanging-

           83.

                         

                          HILLY
           I guess your car was in the shop?
          Skeeter looks away.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           You know as well as I do, people
           won't buy so much as a slice of
           pound cake from an organization
           that harbors racial
           integrationists!
          Skeeter steps forward.

                          SKEETER
           Hilly, just who is that pound cake
           money being raised for, anyway?
          Hilly rolls her eyes.

                          HILLY
           "The Starving Children of Africa."
          Skeeter nods and walks away. Hilly shouts out.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           Just so you know, Lou Ann Templeton
           has taken your seat at bridge club.

                         

          INT. FOOTE ESTATE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

          Minny walks in, notices it's eerily quiet.

                          MINNY
           Miss Celia?

                         

          INT. FOOTE ESTATE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Minny walks into Celia's bedroom.

                          MINNY
           Miss Celia, you in here?
          Minny hears running water and muffled crying behind the
          bathroom door. She presses her ear to the door.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           Hello? You sick?
          Minny twists the knob. It's locked.

           CELIA (O.C.)
           I'm fine. Minny. Go on home for
           the day.

                          MINNY
           You mess up your hair coloring
           again? I helped you fix it last
           time, got it back real pretty.

           84.

                         
          Celia yells at Minny for the very first time.

           CELIA (O.C.)
           I said go home, Minny!
          Minny sees water creeping out from under the door. She steps
          back and charges, shoulder first.

                         

          INT. FOOTE ESTATE - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

          The bathroom door bursts open with splinters of wood. Minny
          slips in a pool of watered down blood.
          Celia sits against the wall in a bloody nightgown.

                          MINNY
           Miss Celia!
          Celia aimlessly moves the blood around with a wash cloth.

                          CELIA
           There's so much blood. Why is
           there so much blood this time?
          Minny crawls over, peers into the toilet bowl and gags.

                          CELIA (CONT'D)
           Please, Minny. Will you get it
           out? I can't look at it again.
          Shaken, Minny reaches for a trash can. She puts her hand on
          Celia's neck and pushes it down.

                          MINNY
           Keep your head down.

                         

          INT. FOOTE ESTATE- BEDROOM - LATER THAT DAY

          Celia lies in bed while Minny presses a cool rag to her
          forehead. Celia stares out of her bedroom window.

                         CELIA'S POV:
          The two rosebushes stand in the middle of the front lawn.
          A DOCTOR enters the room.

                          DOCTOR
           Give her another pill if she gets
           too agitated. There'll be more
           bleeding, but don't call me unless
           it's heavy.
          Minny nods as the doctor leaves.

                          CELIA
           We got married because I was
           pregnant. But it slipped out too.

           85.

                         

                          MINNY
           That's just God's way. Next one's
           gonna catch.

                          CELIA
           Johnny wants kids now. I thought
           if I was real still, brought
           somebody in to do the house and
           cooking, maybe I'd hold on to this
           one. Oh, Minny, what's he gonna do
           with me?

                          MINNY
           He gone have to get over this. He
           needs to know this takes time.

                          CELIA
           He doesn't know about this one, or
           the one before...
          Minny turns to Celia, stunned by this revelation.

                          CELIA FOOTE
           Minny, you know how to play bridge,
           don't you?
          Minny nods.

                          MINNY
           Yes, ma'am. I used to help Missus
           Walters practice.

                         

          INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - MORNING

          Aibileen holds a plate of grits covered in toasted
          marshmallows, strawberries and three lighted candles.

                          AIBILEEN
           Happy Birthday! Mae Mobley two

          Mae Mobley laughs as Aibileen sets down the grits.

          Mae Mobley blows out the candles.

           How old are you, Aibiee?

           86.

                         
          Mae Mobley picks up a candle and licks off the grits.

                          AIBILEEN
           Gone be fifty-four next week.

                          MAE MOBLEY

                          MAE MOBLEY
           Where are the babies?

                          AIBILEEN
           They all over town.

                          MAE MOBLEY
           Aibee...You're my real mama.

                          AIBILEEN
           Now, you know who your momma is.

                          MAE MOBLEY
           I'm your real baby, Aibee. Those
           other ones are just pretend.

                         

          EXT. FOOTE ESTATE - FRONT YARD - EARLY MORNING

          Celia digs a hole next to the two existing rosebushes. A
          closed shoebox and new rosebush wait to be planted.
          Celia lowers the box in the grave, covering it with dirt.

                         

          INT. FOOTE ESTATE - LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT MORNING

          Celia and Minny sit at a card table holding playing cards.
          Two additional hands lay face up on the table in front of two
          empty chairs across from them.
          Minny lays down one of her cards then looks over to Celia's
          hand.
          She removes a card from Celia's and lays it down. She then
          points to the hand next to Celia. Celia nods.

                         

          INT. JUNIOR LEAGUE - MEETING HALL - DAY

          Hilly stands at her podium, tan and ready to lead. She holds
          her gavel like a weapon.

                          HILLY
           Okay. First order of business.
           We're updating our newsletter.
          Hilly stares right at Skeeter who sits alone in the back.

           87.

                         

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           We're adding a fashion column with
           all the latest trends...Your
           dresses better be cute at next
           week's benefit!
          The women applaud and tap each other on their thighs.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           Now it's time to choose a new
           editor for our new modern monthly.
          Skeeter braces herself as hands pop up everywhere. Jolene
          French stands.

                          JOLENE FRENCH
           I nominate Hilly Holbrook.
          Jolene looks back and snarls at Skeeter.

                          HILLY
           Jolene, you're the sweetest thing!

                          OTHER MEMBERS
           I second. I third. All in favor
           of Hilly, say "Aye."
          The room erupts.

                          MEMBERS
           Aye!
          Skeeter's ousting took less than ten seconds. Elizabeth
          secretly turns to Skeeter from a few rows ahead.

                          ELIZABETH

                          (MOUTHING)
           I'm so sorry.

                         

          EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - FRONT PORCH - MORNING

          Skeeter sits alone on the porch swing in her nightgown,
          shifting through the Miss Myrna letters.
          Charlotte steps onto the porch.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Honey, would you like me to drop
           you off at bridge club on the way
           to my doctor's appointment?

                          SKEETER

                          (COVERING)
           No, Ma'am. It's been cancelled.
           Mae Mobley's sick or something.

           88.

                         

          INT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT DAY

          Bridge is underway at the Leefolt house. Aibileen enters
          holding a tray of coffee cups.
          Elizabeth, Hilly, Jolene and several other girls giggle as
          they kneel down behind furniture.

                          AIBILEEN
           Everything okay?
          Elizabeth looks back. Her belly is huge.

                          ELIZABETH
           Shhh!
          There's a knock at door.

           CELIA (O.C.)
           Elizabeth, it's me, Celia Foote. I
           was in the neighborhood and thought
           I'd drop by.
          The girls giggle more loudly now. Celia peers into the
          living room window.
          The bridge tables are in plain view. Celia's face grows
          pinker than her sweater.

                          CELIA (CONT'D)
           I...brought you a chocolate
           pie...My maid, Minny, made it.
          Hilly's face hardens...

                         

          INT. FOOTE ESTATE - KITCHEN - DAY

          Minny stands at the sink shelling peas. A distinct red cut
          is perched above her swollen eye.
          Celia sits at the kitchen table halfway through the pie.

                          CELIA
           They made me stand there like the
           vacuum man. Why, Minny?
          Minny freezes, keeping her face on the peas.

                          MINNY
           Because they know about you getting
           knocked up by Mister Johnny. They
           mad you married one a they mens.
           Especially since Mister Johnny and
           Miss Hilly had just broke up, too.

                          CELIA
           So, Hilly probably thinks I was
           fooling around with Johnny while
           they were still going steady.

           89.

                         

                          MINNY
           Missus Walters says Miss Hilly
           still sweet on Mister Johnny, too.
          Celia suddenly slaps her thigh with excitement.

                          CELIA
           No wonder! They don't hate
           me...They hate what they think I
           did!

                          MINNY
           They hate you cause they think
           you're white trash! And don't be
           takin' pies to those women!

                          CELIA
           Well, I'm just going to have to let
           Hilly know I'm not a boyfriend
           stealer. In fact, I'll tell her
           Friday night at the benefit.
          Celia rises and smiles like she just cured cancer.

                          MINNY
           Now, Miss Celia...please don't be
           going to that benefit.
          Celia gets some ice out of the fridge.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           Did you hear what I said?
          Celia places the ice in a towel and approaches Minny. She
          looks at the cut above her eye.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           What are you doing?

                          CELIA
           That looks bad.

                          MINNY
           I got to get my work done.

                          CELIA
           I know you didn't fall in the tub,
           Minny. Let me take a look.
          Celia grabs Minny's hand. Minny pulls away.
          Just then Johnny pulls up in the driveway. Celia and Minny
          turn to the window, then spring into action.

                         

          INT. FOOTE ESTATE - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Minny sits crouched on the lid of the guest bath toilet as
          Johnny chases Celia around the house. Celia giggles.

           90.

                         

           JOHNNY (O.C.)
           Come here, Sexy!

           CELIA(O.C.)
           Johnny, you are bad! Bad! Bad!
          Minny looks at the ridiculous image of herself crouching on
          the toilet in the bathroom mirror.
          She raises Celia's ice rag up to her swollen eye.

                         

          INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NEXT AFTERNOON

          Skeeter enters quietly through Aibileen's kitchen door.
          She is surprised to see twenty other black women standing
          solemnly around the kitchen and the living room.
          Aibileen approaches with a worried look.

                          SKEETER
           What's wrong?

                          AIBILEEN
           Yule May in prison, Miss Skeeter.
           Gone be there four years.
          Minny shouts out across the kitchen.

                          MINNY
           Hilly Holbrook been sent from the
           devil to ruirn all our lives.

                         

          INT. HOLBROOK HOME (FLASHBACK) - LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Hilly and the usual suspects play bridge at Hilly's house.
          Aibileen pours coffee an earshot away.

                          HILLY
           Please! A nigra walks in a pawn
           shop with a ring of such size and
           clarity. It took'em all of five
           minutes to figure out where she
           worked.
          Hilly leads the girls' nods of acknowledgement.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           I knew that girl was a thief the
           day she started.

          As Minny wipes her nose with her sleeve, Skeeter approaches.

           I'll ask daddy to get her a good
           lawyer.

           She had a lawyer. A white lawyer!
           But Miss Hilly friends with the

          The women part, making way as Aibileen leads Skeeter to a
          seat at the kitchen table.
          PEARLY, 58, sits next to Skeeter and touches her arm.

                          PEARLY
           I'm on help with your stories.
          Another WOMAN walks over.

                          BLACK WOMAN
           I'm on help too.
          Another woman speaks from the living room.

                          BLACK WOMAN 2
           We all are.
          Women of all ages slowly rise up and nod their heads. Skeeter
          looks around in awe.

                          SKEETER
           Thank you. I don't know what to-

           to work at Doctor Dixon's house.
           Cut through this farmer's lower
           forty to get there. One day, that
           farmer was waitin' on me with a

           walk on his land again. Doctor
           Dixon went and paid that farmer
           double for two a those acres. Told
           him he `bout to start farmin' too.
           But he bought it just for me. So I
           could get to work easy. He did.
          Skeeter closes her eyes for moment.
          When she opens them she sees A VISION OF CONSTANTINE STANDING

          BEFORE HER.
          Constantine smiles and grabs Skeeter's hand. She presses her
          thumb firmly in her palm. When Skeeter blinks again, the
          vision is gone.
          Standing in place of Constantine is GRETCHEN, 26.

                          GRETCHEN
           All these colored women have been
           real nice, haven't they?

                          SKEETER
           Yes. Very nice.

                          GRETCHEN
           Well, they hate you. You know
           this? Every little thing about
           you. But you're so dumb, you think
           you're doing them a favor.
          Skeeter and the other maids are taken aback.

                          SKEETER
           You don't have to do this.

                          GRETCHEN
           You know the nicest thing a white
           woman's ever done for me? Gave me
           the heel of her bread. These women
           are playing a trick on you.
           They'll never tell you the truth!

           93.

                         

                          SKEETER
           You don't know what they've said.

                          GRETCHEN
           Say it, lady, say the word you
           think every time one us stands in
           front of you. Nigger.
          Aibileen crosses over to Gretchen.

                          AIBILEEN
           That's enough, Gretchen.

                          GRETCHEN
           You just as dumb as she is.

                          AIBILEEN
           Get out a my house!

                         

          INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Aibileen sits with Skeeter on the sofa reading and answering
          Miss Myrna letters. Aibileen is dressed very nicely.
          Several flower arrangements are placed around the room. An
          unwrapped present rests on the coffee table.

                          AIBILEEN
           Tell her to pour vinegar in her
           trash cans. Then them dogs will
           stay away.
          As Skeeter writes this down, someone walks onto Aibileen's
          front porch. Skeeter becomes worried. Aibileen looks to a
          wall clock and smiles.
          About a dozen letters and cards fall into a basket under the
          mail slot.
          Aibileen jumps up and starts sorting through the cards.

                          AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
           Today my birthday, Miss Skeeter.

                          SKEETER
           Well, happy birthday, Aibileen.
           You should have told me.

                          AIBILEEN
           And, from all over the county, my
           babies find they way home.
          Aibileen stops on one card in particular. She sits back down
          next to Skeeter.

                          AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
           Some even from overseas. Alton
           Spears lives in Paris now. Married
           him a real pretty French girl. Got
           five kids, too...they's my
           grandbabies.

           94.

                         
          Aibileen opens the card to find a twenty dollar bill inside
          along with a picture of the Spears family. Aibileen reads
          the card aloud.

                          AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
           I still don't drink coffee. Happy
           Birthday. Love Alton.
          Aibileen laughs and raises her hand to her mouth. Skeeter is
          touched.
          The doorbell rings. Aibileen jumps up and opens the door. A
          delivery man greets her with two more vases of flowers.
          Aibileen looks out to the street where a white woman gets out
          of her car with a huge country ham. Two little girls in
          matching dresses jump out behind her.
          The woman sees Aibileen on the porch and waves. Aibileen
          waves back and smiles.
          Catching it all, the moment soon grows bittersweet for
          Skeeter. She wipes her eye.

                         

          INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - SKEETER'S BEDROOM - 3 WEEKS LATER

          Morning light shines into Skeeter's room. Stuart has
          returned from the rig. Fully clothed, he and Skeeter sleep
          on Skeeter's bed.
          Charlotte shouts Skeeter's name from down the hall.

           CHARLOTTE (O.C.)
           Eugenia?!
          Skeeter's eyes pop open. She's groggy and hasn't fully
          realized the company lying next to her.

                          SKEETER
           What?!
          Stuart throws his arm over Skeeter. Reality sinks in.
          Skeeter rolls over to find Stuart, eyes shut, smiling.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           Oh my God! Oh my God!
          When Stuart tries to get up, Skeeter flattens him reaches
          down and pulls the covers up over his entire body.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           Don't move a muscle!
          Skeeter props up on her side and faces the door making sure
          the covers hide that she's clothed.
          Charlotte enters and heads straight for Skeeter's closet.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Morning, Sleepy Head.

           95.

                         

                          SKEETER
           Morning, Mom.
          Charlotte pulls out a dress and lays it on the bed, right on
          top of Stuart.

                          CHARLOTTE
           I thought you could take me to the
           doctor this morning and then we
           could get some lunch afterwards.

                          SKEETER
           Sure!
          Charlotte spies a LARGE TOE sticking out of the covers. It
          belongs to Stuart, but she assumes it's Skeeter's.

                          CHARLOTTE
           (looking at toe)
           Or...we could...go straight to
           Fanny Mae's for a girl day.

                          SKEETER
           Great! I'll get dressed.

                          CHARLOTTE
           When did Stuart leave last night?

                          SKEETER
           Right after you went to bed.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Well, I hope he knows he's welcome
           to stay in Carlton's old room.

                          SKEETER
           I'm not really ready for that yet.

                          CHARLOTTE
           "Bird in the hand," Eugenia. Bird.
           In. The. Hand...
          Charlotte exits and shuts the door.

                          STUART
           (under the covers.)
           Chirp. Chirp.
          Skeeter is mortified. Stuart sits up, grinning.

                          SKEETER
           Oh my God!
          Stuart tries to kiss Skeeter. She resists.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           My breath is horrible.

                          STUART
           So is mine.

           96.

                         
          Stuart embraces Skeeter and brings his lips close to hers.

                          STUART (CONT'D)
           I love you.

                          SKEETER
           I love you, too.
          They kiss.

                         

          EXT. STREET - DOWNTOWN JACKSON - DAY

          A bank's clock shows twelve noon in downtown Jackson. It's
          eerily quiet, not a soul on the street...
          We hear archival footage of Walter Cronkite addressing the
          nation.

                         

          INT. FOOTE ESTATE - LIVING ROOM - SAME DAY

          Minny stands at the top of a tall step ladder vacuuming
          Oscar's head.
          Celia runs into the living room. Tears stream down her face.
          Minny turns to Celia.
          Cronkite tells the nation that John F. Kennedy is dead.
          Minny's eyes roll back in her head as she starts to faint.
          She grabs on to Oscar's body and slides down to the floor.

                         

          EXT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - SAME DAY

          Hilly sits with her son William playing on a blanket on the
          front lawn.
          A neighbor suddenly pulls up in his car stopping in front of
          Hilly. He leans out and tells Hilly the tragic news.
          In complete disbelief, Hilly puts her hand over her mouth.
          She then grabs William, pulls him in close as if he's somehow
          in danger.

                         

          EXT. BUS STOP - LATER THAT DAY

          Aibileen huddles with a dozen other maids in a circle.
          They're all crying. Some throw their hands in the air.

                         

          INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - LIVING ROOM - THREE DAYS LATER

          Skeeter and Stuart sit solemnly with the Phelan family
          watching Cronkite's coverage of the Kennedy funeral.
          Skeeter's dad wipes tears from his eyes. Stuart checks the
          time and leans into Skeeter's ear.

           97.

                         

                          STUART
           Honey, I'm sorry, but I have to get
           down to the coast.
          Skeeter nods as Stuart kisses her.

                          STUART (CONT'D)
           I'll be back in time for the
           benefit. Love you.

                          SKEETER
           You, too.
          We hear Walter Cronkite's parting thoughts on JFK.

                         

          INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Minny, Skeeter and Aibileen sit quietly compiling stories.
          Aibileen and Minny look up to Aibileen's framed picture of
          John F. Kennedy.
          Aibileen grows anxious. She suddenly jumps out of her chair
          and paces around the kitchen.

                          SKEETER
           Are you okay?

                          AIBILEEN
           The world done gone crazy, Miss
           Skeeter! And I'm scared! What if
           folks find out what we writing?
           Figure out Niceville really
           Jackson, and figure out who who?

                          SKEETER
           Aibileen. We've changed all the
           names.
          Aibileen snaps.

                          AIBILEEN
           Y'all two gone sit there and tell
           me you one hundred percent without
           a doubt sure `bout all this?!
          Skeeter looks away..

                          MINNY
           No...So I been thinking...Maybe we
           need us some insurance.
          Skeeter look to Minny.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           I told God I'd never speak of it
           again. But we got no choice. It's
           time...Time to tell you both "the
           terrible awful" I did to Miss
           Hilly. It might be the only thing
           to protect us.

           98.

                         

          INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE (FLASHBACK) - KITCHEN - 6 MONTHS EARLIER

          We continue with the earlier flashback where Minny arrives at
          Hilly's with her famed chocolate pie. Hilly leads Minny into
          the kitchen, Missus Walters follows behind.
          Hilly slices a big piece and grabs a fork. She leans against
          the counter and takes a big bite.

                          HILLY
           Nobody wanted to hire a sass-
           mouthing, thieving nigra, did they?
          Minny stands silent as Hilly finishes in three bites.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           Pie's as good as always, Minny.

                          MINNY
           I'm glad you like it.
          Hilly cuts another piece for herself.

                          HILLY
           If...I take you back, I'll have to
           cut your pay five dollars a week.
          Not expecting this, Minny leans away from Hilly.

                          MINNY
           Take me back?
          Hilly takes an even bigger bite from the second slice.

                          HILLY
           What do you put in here that makes
           it taste so good?

                          MINNY
           That good vanilla from Mexico...
          Minny's eyes narrow over a forced smile.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           And...something else real special.
          Missus Walters grabs a plate and reaches for the pie.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           No, Missus Walters. That Miss
           Hilly's special pie.

                          HILLY
           Momma can have a piece.
          Hilly slides the pie a little too fast down the counter
          toward Minny. Minny stops it before it falls to the floor.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           Cut her one.

           99.

                         

                          MINNY

                          (IMMEDIATELY)
           Eat my shit.
          Hilly calmly sets her plate down on the counter.

                          HILLY
           What did you say?

                          MINNY
           I said eat my shit!

                          HILLY
           Have you lost your mind?!
          Minny moves toward Hilly.

                          MINNY
           No. But you're about to,
           `cause you just did.
          Minny nods smugly as she looks down at Hilly's slice.

                          HILLY
           Did what?
          Missus Walters immediately gets it. She bursts out laughing
          so hard she has to lower herself to the floor.

                          MISSUS WALTERS
           Well, Hilly, that's what you get, I
           guess. And you didn't just eat
           one. You ate two slices!
          Hilly starts to hyperventilate as everything sinks in.
          As Minny leaves, Hilly runs to the sink and throws up.

                         

          INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

          Aibileen and Skeeter are speechless.

                          AIBILEEN
           You trying to get yourself killed?!

                          MINNY
           No! I never planned to tell her!
           I just wanted to see her take a
           bite and leave so I could be done
           with her. Forever! She was never
           supposed to ask me back.
          Minny eyes narrow.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           And, then for less pay! That got
           me even madder. And, then she went
           slid that pie at me. Oh lord!
           That was it! I just lost control,
           Aibileen...you know how I get, now.

           100.

                         

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           So, before I knew it, it just came
           on out my mouth...and I had tolt
           her what was in that pie.
          Aibileen looks to Skeeter shaking her head. Minny suddenly
          gets misty. She wipes her eyes.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           I've asked God to forgive me. But,
           more for what happened to poor
           Missus Walters. Miss Hilly threw
           her in that nursing home just for
           laughing.

                          AIBILEEN

                          (GRAVELY)
           We can't put that story in the
           book.

                          SKEETER
           It's too dangerous, Minny.

                          MINNY
           We need insurance! Hilly Holbrook
           can't never let people know that
           pie story is about her.

                          AIBILEEN
           Exactly! If people find out "The
           Terrible Awful" was you and Miss
           Hilly, then we in trouble. Trouble
           there ain't words for!

                          MINNY
           Right! But don't you see? Miss
           Hilly gone go to her grave
           convincing people this book ain't
           about Jackson. Then we safe,
           insured!
          Minny gets up and walks toward Aibileen.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           You brought me into this, and I'm
           on finish it! Either put it in or
           pull my parts out all together.
          Minny storms out of Aibileen's kitchen.

                         

          INT. HARPER ROW PUBLISHING/PANTRY (INTERCUT) - DAY

          Miss Stein talks to Skeeter on the phone.

                          MISS STEIN
           The last editor's meeting is
           December 17th. If you want a
           chance of this getting read, I need
           it in my hands by then.

                          SKEETER
           But that's in a week, Miss Stein!

           101.

                         

                          MISS STEIN
           Otherwise it goes in The Pile. You
           don't want it in The Pile.

                          SKEETER
           Yes, Ma'am.

                          MISS STEIN
           And you must get a piece in about
           the domestic who raised you. It'll
           add something personal to it.
          Skeeter nods with frustration.

                         

          INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - BALLROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

          The African Children's Benefit Ball is well underway.
          The energy and look of the two hundred attendees feel like a
          throwback to the women's suffrage movement. Many older women
          wear heavy long black skirts and jackets.
          Hilly wears swathes of maroon-colored taffeta. Ruffles
          clutch her throat. She stands next to Jolene French and a

          WLBT CAMERAMAN.
          Dressed to the nines, Jolene raises a microphone and looks
          into the camera.

                          JOLENE
           This is Jolene French reporting
           from the African Children's Benefit
           Ball, and I'm here with League
           President Miss Hilly Holbrook.

                          HILLY
           Thanks, Jolene...
          Three dozen servers stand in a line. Minny and Aibileen are
          among them.
          Tables are covered with items donated for the auction.
          On the baked goods table, Minny's famed chocolate pie
          promises to again be a big money maker.
          Celia and Johnny enter the ballroom. Celia wears a hideous,
          pink and silver sequined gown. As usual, Celia's breasts
          command attention.
          The room locks on Celia as specks of light bounce off her
          dress and jiggle across the ceiling.
          A TITILLATED OLD HUSBAND tips his martini onto his wife's
          shoe.

                          OLD HUSBAND
           (a little too loudly)
           Look at the jugs on that one!

           102.

                         
          Other wives dig fingernails into husbands' arms. The man's
          wife responds louder.

                          OLD WIFE
           Bosoms are for bedrooms and breast-
           feeding. Not occasions of dignity.
          Celia downs a glass of champagne and leans into Johnny.

                          CELIA
           Do you think I might have
           overdressed a little? It's
           supposed to be formal, but this
           looks like a funeral.

                          JOHNNY
           You look gorgeous.
          Minny pulls Aibileen aside and points to Celia.

                          MINNY
           Look what she got on.
          Celia grabs more champagne from a passing server.

                          AIBILEEN
           Lord have mercy. Ladies better
           hold onto they husbands tonight.
          Celia catches eyes with Minny. She smiles and nods quickly
          and then looks away, careful not to tip off Johnny of their
          relationship.

                          MINNY

                          (REGARDING JOHNNY)
           And that's the man that don't even
           know he's paying me.
          Skeeter enters with Stuart. She wears a long-sleeved black
          velvet dress and her hair is being somewhat cooperative.

                          AIBILEEN
           There's Skeeter and that must be
           Stuart. He's handsome... Missus
           Walters?!
          Missus Walters enters wearing a floor-length blue beaded
          gown, circa 1943. A white orchid wilts at her clavicle.

                          MINNY
           Hilly can throw her in a home, but
           she can't keep the taxis away.

                         

          INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - BALLROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Celia approaches Elizabeth and Jolene who talk next to a
          punch bowl. Celia is now drinking some kind of pink drink
          with an umbrella sticking out of it.

                          CELIA
           Well, hello, Elizabeth.

           103.

                         

                          ELIZABETH
           Hi.
          Elizabeth's homemade maternity ball gown resembles a velvet
          potato sack cinched with red ribbon.

                          CELIA
           Those are lovely dresses.

                          JOLENE
           Yours too.

                          CELIA
           Really?! I was worried I was a tad
           overdressed.
          Jolene reaches out an pats Celia's shoulder.

                          JOLENE
           Oh, no. You're just perfect.
          Elizabeth pulls Jolene away. Celia downs her drink.

                         

          INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - BALLROOM - LATER THAT EVENING

          The guests are now seated at twenty-eight round tables.
          Scores of black servers dressed in tuxedos ferry plates.
          Hilly makes her way to the podium.

                          HILLY
           Everybody enjoying their dinner?
          The room claps enthusiastically.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)

                          (FLATLY)
           Let's give a nice round of applause
           for all the men and women that have
           helped make tonight possible.
          Hilly mechanically gestures toward the servers in the room.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           A cause I'm sure is dear to their
           hearts as well.
          Skeeter shakes her head as the less inspired applause dies
          down. Celia waves to Minny and jumps out of her chair.

                          CELIA
           Woo-hoo!
          Johnny grabs Celia by the arm and pulls her back down. Celia
          reaches for Johnny's glass of wine.

                          JOHNNY
           Honey, maybe you've had enough to
           drink. Try to eat your dinner.

           104.

                         

                          CELIA
           And have my stomach poke out?!

                         

          INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - LATER THAT EVENING

          As Celia looks at the prize table's bids, Johnny and Stuart
          lean against a bar chatting with a few other bored men.
          Hilly suddenly slides next to Johnny completely ignoring
          Stuart.

                          HILLY
           Why, Johnny Foote. I'm surprised
           to see you here. Everybody knows
           you can't stand parties like this.
          Hilly squeezes the crook of his arm.

                          JOHNNY
           Celia wouldn't have missed this for
           anything.

                          HILLY
           Where is that wife of yours? Out
           selling hotdogs?
          Johnny looks away.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           Oh, you know I'm teasing you. We
           dated long enough where I can do
           that, can't I?
          Johnny walks away leaving Hilly no choice but to acknowledge
          Stuart. She and Stuart never look each other's way.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)

                          (FLATLY)
           Stuart.

                          STUART

                          (FLATTER)
           Hilly.
          Hilly walks away as Jolene approaches the podium.

                          JOLENE
           I've got the list of winners!

                         

          INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Jolene finishes up the winners list.

                          JOLENE
           I hope you enjoy your new set of
           tires, Missus Atwell. Now, on to
           the baked goods.
          Jolene flips a page.

           105.

                         

                          JOLENE (CONT'D)
           Oh, yum! Yum! The highest bid in
           baked goods goes to Minny Jackson's
           chocolate pie. Congratulations,
           Hilly Holbrook!
          The room erupts in applause. Hilly now sits at a table with
          her family, Missus Walters, and the Leefolts.
          Skeeter and Stuart sit at a table full of elderly people they
          don't know.
          Minny clears dishes nearby. Hearing her name, she becomes
          very alert.

                          HILLY
           What? I didn't bid on anything.
          Minny turns to find Hilly smiling at her tightly.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           Well, wasn't that sweet. Someone
           signed me up for that pie.

                          SKEETER

                          (TO STUART)
           Oh, no.
          Celia rushes up behind Hilly, her voice slurred.

                          CELIA
           Congratulations, Hilly! I didn't
           know you're a fan of Minny's pies.
          Hilly remains calm. Celia grabs Hilly's long sleeve.

                          CELIA (CONT'D)
           I've wanted to talk to you all
           night. Minny told me why you won't
           be my friend. You think me and
           Johnny went behind your back.

                          HILLY
           Let me go!
          Hilly stands up and pulls away. A ripping sound cuts through
          the air.
          Celia stares at Hilly's torn cuff in her hands.

                          STUART
           Oh, God.

                          CELIA
           I'm so sorry.

                          HILLY

                          (GRITTED TEETH)
           What are you trying to do to me?
           What are you and that nigra up to?

           106.

                         
          Jolene announces another round of winners loudly over the
          microphone, forcing Celia to raise her voice.

                          CELIA
           I don't know what you-

                          HILLY
           -You liar! Who did you tell?!
          Jolene loses her place on the list. The room grows quiet but
          Celia is still yelling.

                          CELIA
           Hilly, I got pregnant after you and
           Johnny broke up!
          The room echoes with Celia's words. Across the room, women's
          noses wrinkle.

                          MISSUS WALTERS
           Oh, shit.

                          HILLY
           Shut up, Mother.
          Stuart belts out with a laugh. Skeeter pinches his arm.
          Celia is mortified. Sweat beads on her forehead.

                          CELIA
           Johnny never cheated on you...At
           least, not with me.
          Celia starts to breathe heavily. Her eyes start to water.

                          HILLY
           Johnny would never-

                          CELIA
           And I'm sorry I thought you'd be
           tickled to win that pie.

                          HILLY
           You tell that nigra if she tells
           anybody, I will make her suffer.
          Horrified, Skeeter catches eyes with Minny and Aibileen.
          They all immediately look away.
          Johnny makes his way over. Celia holds her breath, shaking
          her head back and forth.

                          JOHNNY
           Celia, what's wrong, Honey?

                          CELIA
           Uh-oh.
          Celia leans over and vomits on the fleur-de-lis print carpet.
          The entire room gasps in horror.

           107.

                         

                          JOHNNY
           Oh, shit!
          Johnny tries to pull Celia back. She pushes Johnny away and
          runs for the bathroom. He follows.
          Hilly marches over to Aibileen who is standing nearby.

                          HILLY
           Get that cleaned up before it
           starts to smell.

                          AIBILEEN
           Yes, ma'am.

                         

          INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Minny's daughter, Sugar, stands over a large commercial sink
          filled with sudsy water, washing dishes.
          Minny approaches from behind as Sugar holds court with five
          other young girls.

                          SUGAR
           That big-boobed lady Momma works
           for was drunker than an Injun on
           payday. Upchucked in front a
           everbody!
          As the girls all laugh, Minny pops Sugar hard on the back of
          her head.

                          MINNY
           Don't you never let me hear you
           talking bad about the lady who puts
           food in your mouth. Clothes on
           your back! You hear me?
          Minny storms off.

                          SUGAR

                          (TO HERSELF)
           You do it all the time.

                         

          EXT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - PARKING LOT - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Hilly and William walk to their car. Missus Walters follows
          closely behind, holding Minny's pie.

                          HILLY
           Just come on home and stay with us
           tonight, Mother.

                          MISSUS WALTERS
           No thanks, I got a pie to eat.
          Hilly spins around and sees the pie.

           108.

                         

                          HILLY
           You throw that pie away right now!

                          MISSUS WALTERS
           I spent good money on this. Won it
           just for you...

                          HILLY
           You?! You signed me up?
          Missus Walters steps up to Hilly.

                          MISSUS WALTERS
           I may have trouble remembering my
           own name and what country I live
           in. But there's two things I can't
           seem to forget. That my own
           daughter threw me in a nursing
           home...And that she ate Minny's
           shit.
          Missus Walters winks at Hilly and ambles to a waiting taxi
          cab.

                         

          INT. FOOTE ESTATE - BEDROOM - NEXT AFTERNOON

          Celia lies in bed with the covers pulled over her face.
          Minny enters carrying a tray of food, setting it down next to
          two other trays of uneaten food.

                          MINNY
           Ain't Mister Johnny gone wonder how
           dinner got on the table if you laid
           up in bed?
          Celia pulls the covers off her head and sits up a little.

                          CELIA
           The way Hilly looked at me. Like I
           was trash on the road.
          Celia pulls a letter out from under the covers.

                          CELIA (CONT'D)
           She billed me for her dress. In
           lieu of payment, she's asked that I
           send two-hundred dollars to the
           African Children's Fund and then
           she banned me from all future
           League events.

                          MINNY
           She don't count. Don't judge
           yourself by the way she see you.

                          CELIA
           I'm not right for this kind of
           life, Minny. I don't need a dinner
           table for twelve people.

           109.

                         

                          CELIA (CONT'D)
           I couldn't get two people over here
           if I begged. She called me a liar
           and accused me of getting her that
           pie. I wouldn't have thrown up if
           it wasn't for that! I can't do
           this anymore to Johnny. I'm going
           back to Sugar Ditch.

                          MINNY
           You gone leave your husband cause
           you threw up at some party?
          Celia sobs.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           Lord, I reckon it's time you knew.

                         

          INT. FOOTE ESTATE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Celia stares at Minny, wide-eyed and disgusted.

                          MINNY
           Miss Hilly thought you knew `bout
           "The Terrible Awful," that you were
           making fun a her. It's my fault
           she pounced on you. But if you
           leave Mister Johnny, then Miss
           Hilly done won the whole ball game.
           Then she done beat me, and she done
           beat you.
          Celia lies there. Minny's concerned she's said too much.

                          CELIA
           Thank you. For telling me that.

                         

          INT. ROOSEVELT HOTEL - NEW ORLEANS - ONE WEEK LATER

          Stuart lies on a bed inside the Presidential Suite of the
          Roosevelt Hotel. He's on the phone with Skeeter.

                          STUART
           Hey, Honey.

                         

          INT. PHELAN PLANTATION (INTERCUT) - KITCHEN - SAME TIME

          Skeeter talks to Stuart. Pascagoula cooks breakfast.

                          SKEETER
           Stuart! How are you calling me?
           Aren't you on the rig?

                          STUART
           What if I told you I have twenty-
           four hours in New Orleans?

           110.

                         

                          STUART (CONT'D)
           That I'm in the Presidential Suite
           of the Roosevelt Hotel...That we
           have dinner reservations in the
           Blue Room tonight and lunch
           tomorrow at Galatoires.
          Skeeter becomes troubled...

                          STUART (CONT'D)
           Did you hear me? I spoke to your
           dad, and he's gonna have Jameso
           drive you down right now.

                          SKEETER
           Oh, Stuart.

                          STUART
           What?

                          SKEETER
           I have to work.

                          STUART
           Work in the car. Jesus, Skeeter,
           it's a cleaning column.

                          SKEETER
           I have a deadline, Sweetie. You
           should have asked me about this.

                          STUART
           I'm trying to be romantic...

                          SKEETER
           I'm sorry, Honey. I can't come.
          Stuart shakes his head and hangs up the phone.

                         

          INT. FAYE BELLE'S HOME - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Aibileen and Skeeter sit across from, FAYE BELLE, 101,
          palsied and gray skinned and hunched in a wheelchair.
          Aibileen grabs Faye Belle's hand stirring a sudden flash of
          memory. Her voice is coarse and hard to understand.

                          FAYE BELLE
           I remember hiding with Miss Lilia
           in a steamer trunk while Yankee
           soldiers stomped through Master's
           house. We were both four. Eighty-
           five years later she died in my
           arms. We's were friends `til the
           end. Her grandson still pays my
           rent. Buys all my groceries too.

                         

          INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

          The manuscript sits before Aibileen, Minny and Skeeter.

           111.

                         

                          SKEETER
           I have one more story to type, but
           other than that, we are done.

                          AIBILEEN
           Law, look at all them pages. Two-
           hundred and sixty-six of `em.

                          MINNY
           Now we just wait and see? Hopin'
           Missus Stein publish it?
          Skeeter nods.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           What story you got left to type?

                          SKEETER
           Mine.
          Aibileen looks at Skeeter.

                          AIBILEEN
           If your momma won't tell you, I
           reckon I will.

                         

          INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Red-eyed, Skeeter enters Charlotte's room. A bowl rests on
          the bedside table with a wet rag draped over the side.
          Charlotte is wig free and terribly thin. Her collarbone
          protrudes long and narrow, but her eyes are as sharp as ever.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Have you been crying? You know
           that ages your skin, Dear.

                          SKEETER
           Mother, I need to talk to you about
           Constantine.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Oh, Eugenia. That was so long ago.

                          SKEETER
           Well, I have to speak to her.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Now, you look. I was good to
           Constantine. Oh, she talked back
           plenty of times, and I put up with
           it. But, Skeeter, she didn't give
           me a choice...

                          SKEETER
           What...happened?

           112.

                         

          INT. PHELAN PLANTATION (FLASHBACK) LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Charlotte, much healthier, scurries around the house
          adjusting flower arrangements and straightening pictures.

           CHARLOTTE (V.O.)
           I was hosting a D.A.R. luncheon.
           Constantine was to do the floors
           that morning so they'd be dry in
           time.
          Charlotte finds Constantine mopping the foyer very slowly.
          The effects of arthritis are apparent.

           CHARLOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Well, the floors were soaking wet
           when the first guest arrived.
          A guest unnecessarily grabs a table for balance, making a
          point about the damp floor...

                         

          INT. PHELAN PLANTATION (FLASHBACK) DINING ROOM - DAY

          Charlotte sits with twelve women at the dining table as
          Constantine pushes the casserole cart around and begins
          serving lunch.
          As the guests sip coffee, each woman grimaces and turns to
          Charlotte.

           CHARLOTTE (V.O.)
           Then, she burned the coffee. She
           had gotten so old, Skeeter.
          Charlotte shoots Constantine a look. Constantine nods
          sorrowfully. She picks up a woman's plate and begins filling
          it with food from the cart very slowly.
          Constantine strains to lower the plate in front of the woman.
          Her hands tremble.

           CHARLOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Her mishaps were becoming a daily
           occurrence, and I had had it.
          The plate tilts causing peas to pour into the woman's lap.

                          WOMAN
           Watch out!
          With that, Charlotte stands up and slaps the table with her
          hand.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Get a hold of yourself,
           Constantine!
          Constantine slowly looks to Charlotte. Totally exhausted,
          she grips the casserole cart with both hands to steady
          herself.

           113.

                         

           CHARLOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           And that's when it happened.
          Constantine wets herself.
          Slowly the women begin realizing what's happening. The two
          women closest to Constantine gasp and quickly move away from
          her.
          Another woman rises from the table covering her mouth with a
          napkin and leaves the room.
          Just now realizing what has happened, Constantine looks down
          at her soiled dress. No one says a word. No one comes to
          Constantine's aid.
          Constantine looks to Charlotte.

                         

          EXT. COUNTRY ROAD (FLASHBACK) - MOMENTS LATER

          Constantine hobbles with a cane down a gravel road still
          wearing her soiled dress. She turns and looks one last time
          at the Phelan Plantation...

                          CHARLOTTE
           I told her she couldn't work here
           anymore and to go on home.

                         

          INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Skeeter trembles. Charlotte won't look at her.

                          SKEETER
           How could you humiliate her like
           that?!

                          CHARLOTTE
           I didn't mean to.

                          SKEETER
           Why didn't you help her?

                          CHARLOTTE
           I was upset. I didn't know what
           else to do.

                          SKEETER
           So you just threw her away? That
           woman did you the biggest favor of
           your life. She taught me kindness
           and self respect and you just threw
           her away like a broken appliance.
          Charlotte starts to cry. Skeeter isn't affected.

           114.

                         

                          CHARLOTTE
           I didn't throw her away, Skeeter.
           Your daddy went to her house the
           very next day to give her her job
           back. But she had already moved to
           Chicago. Left everything behind.

                          SKEETER
           `Cause she didn't have anything
           anymore. You broke her heart!

                          CHARLOTTE
           Please don't do this to me,
           Skeeter. I feel terrible. And you
           have to remember, they're not like
           us. They are different.
          Charlotte gets defensive.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           And you idolized her too much! You
           always have!

                          SKEETER
           I needed somebody to look up to.
          Skeeter turns to leave.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           I have to go find her. She needs
           me.

                          CHARLOTTE
           We finally found the address of her
           daughter in Chicago...so we sent
           Carlton up there to go get
           Constantine.
          Skeeter turns back to her mother.

                          SKEETER
           And?

                          CHARLOTTE
           When he got there...she was dead,
           Eugenia. I'm so sorry, Honey.
          Charlotte tries to comfort her. Skeeter rejects her mother's
          hand.

                          SKEETER
           Why didn't y'all tell me all this?

                          CHARLOTTE
           I knew you'd blame me...when it
           wasn't my fault. It just happened,
           and it was so unfortunate. I'm
           sorry, Eugenia.

                          SKEETER
           When did she die? How long had she
           been in Chicago?

           115.

                         
          Charlotte pulls the white basin closer, hugs it to her side.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Two weeks.
          Skeeter stands, never turning as she exits.

                         

          EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - PATIO - MOMENTS LATER

          Skeeter stands on the back patio crying. She slowly walks
          off into the yard.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           Constantine's story finally made it
           in our book. But the reason she
           got fired did not. Miss Skeeter
           just couldn't put that kind a shame
           on her own mother.

                         

          EXT. BOOKSTORE - DOWNTOWN JACKSON - SIX MONTHS LATER

          The front window of a bookstore displays many of the nation's
          top selling books.
          A clerk sets a tiny stack of books in the far corner.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           They printed a few thousand copies
           with the worst advance Miss Stein
           had ever seen.
          The stack is "The Help," in hardcover. It's wrapped in pale
          blue. A white peace dove spreads its wing under the title.

                         

          INT. MINNY'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Minny stands over the stove frying chicken as Sugar enters
          with the day's mail. Minny snatches the mail from her and
          sees an envelope from Harper and Row.
          Minny tears it open. Her eyes go wide.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           We got four hundred dollars. Got
           another four hundred when it got
           printed. Divided thirteen ways
           that came to sixty-one fifty-three
           a person.
          Minny hugs Sugar and runs out the screen door with her check
          as the chicken sizzles.

                         

          INT. AIBILEEN'S HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

          Aibileen and Minny hug each other as the jump up and down
          with checks in hand.

           116.

                         

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           Minny got so excited she burnt up a
           skillet of chicken.

                         

          EXT. FOOTE ESTATE - FRONT PORCH - DAY

          Minny knocks on the door holding bags of groceries.

                          MINNY
           Come on, Miss Celia! Get out a
           that bed and let me in. It's
           twelve noon. I did all the
           shopping just like you asked.
          The door slowly opens. Celia steps out onto the porch,
          looking beautiful, still dressed tacky.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           Well, look at you, Miss Celia.

                         

          INT. FOOTE ESTATE - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Celia leads Minny into the dining room. The table, set
          beautifully in silver and crystal, is covered with delicious
          looking casseroles and fried chicken.

                          MINNY
           What's all this?

                          CELIA
           I cooked it all by myself. I wanted
           to do something special. I wanted
           to say "thank you."

                         

          INT. FOOTE ESTATE - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Celia and Minny dine, and Minny's enjoying it.

                          MINNY
           Greens got just the right amount a
           hock taste to `em. That's a good
           pot liquor, Miss Celia. Who taught
           you to cook like this?
          Minny winks as she dunks a piece of corn bread in the greens.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           Corn bread's happy now.
          Celia lays down her fork.

                          CELIA
           Are you happy, Minny?

                          MINNY
           Why you ask such a funny question?

           117.

                         

                          CELIA
           Are you?

                          MINNY
           A course I's happy. You happy too.
           Big house, big yard, good husband.

                          CELIA
           You know, if I were you, I'd give
           it right back to him. I'd hit him
           over the head with a skillet and
           tell him to go straight to hell...
          Minny starts to protest but is tired of excuses.

                          MINNY
           Maybe I will.
          Celia jumps up.

                          CELIA
           I almost forgot the dessert.
          Minny smiles softly as Celia disappears into the kitchen.

          Aibileen irons as Elizabeth enters with shopping bags.
          She races to the television and turns it on. As the tube
          warms up, we hear the conclusion of a Tide commercial.
          WLBT's lunchtime show, "People Will Talk," continues.

          INTERCUT WITH STUDIO, LEEFOLT HOME, HILLY'S HOME, AND ALL

          Jolene French sits on the set of Jackson's morning show. A
          MALE HOST watches as the show runner counts down.

                          SHOW RUNNER
           Five, four, three, two, one.

                          MALE HOST
           Welcome back to "People Will Talk."
           And do we have something to talk
           about. Jolene has quite a book to
           review.
          Jolene shakes her head, visibly upset.

                         

          INT. HOLBROOK'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

          Hilly watches Jolene on television as her new maid,
          ERNESTINE, pours a cup of coffee with her right hand.

           118.

                         
          Ernestine's left arm is missing. The maid pickings for Hilly
          have gotten slim.

                          HILLY
           Why are you frowning, Jolene?
          Hilly leans over and taps her television.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           You don't look cute that way.

                          MALE HOST
           It's called "The Help." A new book
           by an anonymous author.
          Aibileen jerks her head toward the television.

           MALE HOST (CONT'D)
           Touching and enlightening, it's
           filled with testimonials from
           Mississippi's own housekeepers.

                         

          INT. FOOTE ESTATE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

          Minny watches transfixed as she and Celia eat dessert in
          front of the television.

                          CELIA
           Look how cute that dress is.

                          MALE HOST
           Takes place in the fictional town
           of "Niceville." The book is
           dedicated to C and T. If you're
           out there C and T, we'd love to
           have you on the show because
           Niceville sounds like Jackson, if
           you ask me.
          The host starts laughing. Jolene snaps.

                          JOLENE FRENCH
           It's not Jackson! It's a disgrace
           to the South! A disgrace to good
           Southern women who've spent their
           lives taking care of their help.

          Smoke rises from the shirt Aibileen is ironing. She snaps to
          attention, pulls the iron off the burned shirt.

                          MALE HOST
           But did you read that ending?

                          JOLENE FRENCH
           I know I personally treat my help
           like family, and every one of my
           friends does the same.

           Bertha, if you're listening, I have
           a new found respect for what you

           passin' on dessert at your table!

          FOOTE LIVING ROOM
          Minny walks like a zombie over to Celia and gathers her dirty
          plate, never taking her eyes off the television.

                          JOLENE FRENCH
           Do not buy this book! Ladies of
           Jackson, do not support slander
           with your husband's hard earned-
          Poof! Jolene disappears by way of a Seal-Lily ice cream

          Stacks of "The Help" rest on tables in the store.
          Elizabeth enters, pick up two copies and pulls them close to

          She races to the register like a teen buying a Playboy.

          Aibileen, Skeeter and Minny sit at the table. Aibileen's
          phone rings off the wall, but she won't answer.

                          SKEETER
           I knew nothing about it. Miss
           Stein's P.R. Department called the
           station directly.

           120.

           Ever maid callin' to say they white
           lady's gone and bought the book.
           They so scared.

                          MINNY
           `One-arm-Earnestine' said Miss
           Leefolt brought a copy over to Miss
           Hilly in less than a hour. She
           better read it quick and start the
           "this ain't Jackson crusade."

                          SKEETER
           Don't count on it. In her one year
           at Ole Miss she never cracked a
           book.

                          MINNY
           Oh, she gone read it. Especially
           after that man made such a stink on
           the tee-vee. She gone read it.

          Elizabeth and Hilly read the book aloud over the phone with

          A bus is filled with domestics en route to work. Everyone is

          Charlotte lies in bed reading the book next to Robert, who is
          asleep.
          As she turns a page, her face reveals a dawning realization.
          Troubled, she starts to wake Robert but doesn't.
          Charlotte trembles as she brings the book in close to her
          chest.
          She slides down to her pillow and stares at the ceiling.

                         

          EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - PORCH - DUSK

          Skeeter sits on the swing with Stuart who's just arrived from
          the rig, still wearing his dingy work clothes.

           121.

                         

                          STUART
           That month felt like a year. I
           missed you so much.

                          SKEETER
           Me, too.

                          STUART
           Skeeter, I told Daddy I'm not going
           back on the rig.
          Stuart nonchalantly pulls out a ring from his front pocket
          and places it in Skeeter's lap.
          A huge diamond is surrounded by twelve small sapphires.
          Skeeter's smile quickly fades as she raises the ring.

                          SKEETER
           Stuart...I have to tell you
           something.

                          STUART
           How about "yes?!" I had this with
           me down in New Orleans, you know.
          Skeeter touches Stuart's face.

                          SKEETER
           I'm serious...and...you have to
           promise not to tell anyone.

                          STUART
           Hang on. Did you say `yes'?

                          SKEETER
           Yes.
          Stuart hugs Skeeter. She pulls back.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           But listen. Can I have your word?
          Skeeter has again ruined Stuart's big moment.

                          STUART
           Sure. You have my word.

                         

          EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

          Stuart storms off the porch, dumbfounded. Finally.

                          STUART
           This is what you've been writing
           for the last twelve months?! What
           happened to the cleaning column?

                          SKEETER
           I did both.

           122.

                         
          Skeeter approaches Stuart.

                          STUART
           So, the talk in town? I said they
           were dead wrong. Told them you
           were too smart to get mixed up in
           anything like that.
          Skeeter reaches to calm him. He pulls away.

                          STUART (CONT'D)
           That joke you played on Hilly with
           the toilets. Hell, that's funny.
           But this? I don't understand why
           you did this...why you even care.

                          SKEETER
           What?

                          STUART
           Things are fine around here. Why
           stir up trouble?

                          SKEETER
           I'm not stirring up trouble,
           Stuart. Trouble's already here.

                          STUART
           I guess it is.
          Skeeter grabs his arm.

                          SKEETER
           I had to tell you. You needed to
           know.
          Stuart shakes his head and pulls away...

                          STUART
           I guess I don't really know you,
           Skeeter. And I can't marry somebody
           I don't know.
          Stuart looks down at the ring.

                          STUART (CONT'D)
           That was my grandmother's.
          Skeeter hands the ring back. Stuart shoves it in his pocket.

                          STUART (CONT'D)
           Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

                          SKEETER
           Just leave.

                         

          INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Charlotte sits in bed next to Robert who is fast asleep. She
          hears a door closing outside.

           123.

                         

                          CHARLOTTE
           Skeeter?! Come in here, please.
          After a few moments, Skeeter enters.

                          SKEETER
           You okay? Can I get you anything?

                          CHARLOTTE
           Come here, Eugenia. I want to tell
           you something.

                          SKEETER
           Me, too.

                          CHARLOTTE
           You go first.

                          SKEETER
           Stuart proposed.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Finally!

                          SKEETER
           You knew?

                          CHARLOTTE
           Of course. He had to ask Daddy for
           your hand.
          She lifts Skeeter's ring hand. Seeing her bare finger,
          Charlotte's smile fades. Skeeter prepares for the worst.

                          SKEETER
           Just say it.

                          CHARLOTTE
           What did you do?!

                          SKEETER
           Nothing!
          Skeeter stands to walk away.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Young lady, I'm talking to you!
          Skeeter sits back down...

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           Stuart'll come around. It's a funny
           dance.
           (points to Robert )
           Took this one a year. Anyway, my
           news. After a long talk with your
           daddy, I've made a decision. My
           health's been on the uptick these
           past few weeks. And I know the
           doctor says it's some kind of last

                          STRENGTH NONSENSE-

           124.

                         
          Charlotte starts coughing. Skeeter hands her a tissue.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           But, as I said, I made a decision.
           I have decided not to die.

                          SKEETER
           Oh, Momma.
          Charlotte slaps her palms as if throwing the cancer away.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Too late. I tried calling Fanny
           Mae's so I could make your hair
           appointments for the next twenty
           years, but they wouldn't allow it.
          Charlotte raises Skeeter's ring finger.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           I certainly can't leave you now.
          Skeeter laughs and hugs her mother. Robert never stirs.

          Hilly drives in front of Jitney Jingle grocery store. She
          wears a scarf on her head and big sunglasses. One-armed
          Ernestine rides in the passenger seat.
          Hilly slows in front of the store's big glass entrance. She
          hurriedly waves Ernestine out of the car.

          Hilly reads the book in bed. William is fast asleep.
          Suddenly, her eyes widen, her breath becomes heavy. She
          slowly turns a page and freezes. Her face turns white.
          Hilly balls both fists, looks to the ceiling and screams
          louder than humanly possible.

          THE SCREAM CONTINUES OVER:

                         

          INT. SKEETER'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

          Skeeter lies in bed sleeping. Her eyes pop open.

           125.

                         

          INT. AIBILEEN'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

          Aibileen lies in bed sleeping. Her eyes pop open.

                         

          INT. MINNY'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

          Minny lies in bed sleeping. Her eyes pop open. But, this
          time, Hilly's scream fades as knocks at the door grow louder.
          Knocking that has actually stirred Minny awake.
          Sugar and Kindra enter, jumping in bed with Minny.

                          SUGAR
           Momma, there's a white man at our
           door!

           MAN (O.C.)
           Minny Jackson! Are you in there?!
          Minny covers the girls with a blanket. She puts on a robe and
          grabs a bat from behind the door.

           MAN (O.C.) (CONT'D)
           I can hear you. Open the door.

                         

          INT. MINNY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Minny approaches the door.

                          MINNY
           Who there?

                          MAN
           Johnny Foote. Minny Jackson, I
           want to talk to you. Open up.
          Minny slowly opens the door. Johnny is all smiles.

                          JOHNNY
           Finally, I meet Minny Jackson...
          As Johnny enters, Minny raises the bat and swings. Johnny
          turns and stops the bat with his hand.

                          JOHNNY (CONT'D)
           What the hell are you doin'?!
          Minny lets go of the bat and cowers on the floor, raises her
          hands in front of her.

                          MINNY
           Please don't hurt me! My babies
           are in the house.
          Johnny drops the bat and pulls Minny up from the floor.

                          JOHNNY
           Calm down, girl. I'm not here to
           get you.

           126.

                         
          He suddenly throws his arms around her and squeezes hard.

                         

          INT. MINNY'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

          Johnny and Minny sit at her kitchen table.

                          JOHNNY
           When I finally confronted Celia
           about you, she told me about the
           baby. All of them. You saved her
           life.

                          MINNY
           I don't know about that.

                          JOHNNY
           Well, I know the day you came to
           our house, she started getting
           better. And I'm not just talking
           about the cookin' either.

                          MINNY
           You knew I was there?

                          JOHNNY
           Fried chicken and okra on the first
           night? Y'all should have at least
           put corn pone on the table.

                          MINNY
           I couldn't make you eat anymore
           corn pone, Mister Johnny.

                          JOHNNY
           Next morning, I snuck back up to
           the house, peeked in the window,
           and there you were. Given ol'
           Oscar a wipe down.
          Minny smiles for the first time.

                          MINNY
           So I ain't losing my job?

                          JOHNNY
           You have a job with us for the rest
           of your life, if you want it.

                         

          INT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Bridge is underway at the Leefolt house with the usual
          suspects, except Skeeter. LOU ANN TEMPLETON has taken her
          place.
          Aibileen nervously pours coffee.

                          JOLENE FRENCH
           I heard that Betty character might
           be Charlene.

           127.

                         

                          HILLY
           It's not Jackson, and that book is
           garbage. I bet the whole thing's
           made up by some nigra.
          Aibileen begins pouring coffee into Hilly's cup.

           LOU ANN TEMPLETON
           And, Jolene, didn't your momma
           leave Cora to you in her will?

                          JOLENE
           Well, yes...But that's not odd is
           it? Happens all the time, right?
          A sudden realization washes over Jolene.

           LOU ANN TEMPLETON
           Did anybody ever figured out who C
           and T are?

                          HILLY
           The book is NOT ABOUT JACKSON!
          Aibileen spills a few drops of coffee on Hilly's plate. Hilly
          looks up to Aibileen slow and deliberate.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           You spilled some, Aibileen.
          Aibileen takes the cloth from the coffee pitcher handle and
          dabs the spilled coffee.
          Aibileen glances at Hilly. A secret burns between them.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           Get me a new plate. One you
           haven't soiled with a dirty cloth.

                         

          EXT. MOUNT ZION CHURCH - EVENING

          Aibileen and Minny walk into the church parking lot wearing
          their Sunday best.
          Minny takes note of all the cars.

                          MINNY
           We late? Looks like Bible study
           done already started.

                          AIBILEEN
           No. We ain't late.

                         

          INT. MOUNT ZION BABTIST CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER

          As Minny and Aibileen enter the church. Four-hundred members
          stand at once. The congregation begins to clap.

           128.

                         
          Minny and Aibileen look around trying to figure out the
          source of adulation. They both start clapping too.
          Aibileen steps up to a woman in the last pew.

                          AIBILEEN
           Who we clappin' for?
          The woman laughs.

                          WOMAN
           Honey, we clappin' for you.
          The woman raises a copy of "The Help." Aibileen notices a
          copy of the book in each member's hand.
          Aibileen looks to Minny, realizing she's in on it.
          A REVEREND approaches, hands Aibileen a copy of the book.

                          REVEREND
           Aibileen, this is an important time
           for you and our church. We know
           you couldn't put your name in here,
           so we all signed our own.
          The Reverend then hands her a box wrapped in white paper,
          tied with a blue ribbon.

                          REVEREND (CONT'D)
           This is for the white lady. Tell
           her we love her like family.

                         

          INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Skeeter sits between Aibileen and Minny on the sofa thumbing
          through her signed book.
          Hundreds of signatures cover the pages.

                          AIBILEEN
           Churches over two counties signed
           our books. All for you and me.
          Aibileen points to the inside back cover.

                          AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
           Doctor King signed it, too. He
           readin' our book.
          Aibileen glances proudly at the framed portrait of Dr. King.

                          MINNY
           We did something. We did something
           good.

                          SKEETER
           It's beautiful.
          Skeeter closes the book and sets it down regretfully.

           129.

                         

                          AIBILEEN
           What's wrong?
          Skeeter pulls a letter out of her purse.

                          SKEETER
           I got a job offer from Harper and
           Row...in New York.

                          AIBILEEN
           Congratulations!

                          MINNY
           That real good, Miss Skeeter.

                          SKEETER
           I not taking it. I just wanted to
           share it with you both. There's no
           one else I can tell.

                          AIBILEEN
           What you mean you not takin' it?
           This is what you been dreaming of.

                          SKEETER
           I can't leave you two right when
           things are getting bad from a mess
           I created. I set out to write a
           book to make white people thankful.
           But in the end, what we should say
           is "sorry."

                          AIBILEEN
           If bad things happen, they ain't
           nothing you can do about it. And
           if they happen, at least now theys
           a reason behind it. A reason we
           can wrap our heads around and be
           proud of...
          Skeeter nods with little relief.

                          AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
           Now, I don't mean to rub salt in
           your wound, but...you ain't got a
           good life here in Jackson. Plus,
           your momma's getting better-
          Minny aggressively chimes in.

                          MINNY
           You ain't got nothing left here but
           enemies in the Junior League. You
           done burned ever bridge there is.
           And you ain't never gone get
           another man in this town, and ever
           body know it. So don't walk your
           white butt to New York, RUN IT!
          Minny leans over, placing her hand on Skeeter's for the first
          time since knowing each other.

           130.

                         

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           And you listen to me. I'm on take
           care a Aibileen, and she gone take
           care a me.
          Skeeter nods.

                          AIBILEEN
           Go find your life, Miss Skeeter.

                         

          EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - NIGHT

          Skeeter stands next to the barn smoking a cigarette reading
          the Harper and Row offer for the hundredth time.
          Tires crunch gravel down the drive. Skeeter sees a car
          moving toward her with the headlights off.
          Worried, Skeeter looks toward her home. Charlotte can be
          seen in an upstairs window.
          Skeeter soon recognizes the car as Hilly's.
          Hilly parks, lights a cigarette and gets out of her car.
          Skeeter charges toward her.

                          SKEETER
           What are you doing here?
          Hilly screams and throws her lit cigarette at Skeeter.

                          HILLY
           Don't you get an inch closer!
          Hilly's a mess. Her shirt is half tucked. Her shorts strain
          to contain a newly developed layer of fat.
          A horrible fever blister burns hot on Hilly's upper lip.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           I've contacted my lawyer, Hibbie
           Goodman. He's the best libel
           attorney in Mississippi. You're in
           big trouble, Missy. And you're
           going to jail.

                          SKEETER
           You can't prove anything, Hilly.

                          HILLY
           I one-hundred-percent know you
           wrote it `cause nobody else in town
           is as tacky as you. Those nigras of
           yours are in a lifetime of trouble.

                          SKEETER
           Exactly who are you talking about?
           You don't know anything.

           131.

                         

                          HILLY
           I don't, do I? You tell Aibileen,
           the next time she wants to write
           about my dear friend Elizabeth...uh-
           huh. Remember her? Had you in her
           wedding? Let's just say, Aibileen
           ought to've been a little bit
           smarter before putting in the L-
           shaped crack in poor Elizabeth's
           dining table. And that nigra,
           Minny? Do I have plans for her.

                          SKEETER
           Careful, Hilly. Don't give
           yourself away now.

                          HILLY
           That was not me WHO ATE THAT PIE!
          Hilly storms up the porch steps. Skeeter follows.

                          SKEETER
           I did not invite you here!
          Skeeter yanks Hilly's arm hard.

                          HILLY
           I've come to tell your mother what
           a hippie you've become. She's
           gonna be disgusted by you.
          Skeeter can't help but laugh.

                          SKEETER
           You're telling my mother on me?
          Hilly opens the door. Skeeter grabs her. They struggle.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           You get out of here!
          Charlotte suddenly appears. Skeeter lets go of Hilly.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Why, Hilly...It's been such a long
           time, Dear. Everything okay, you
           two?
          Hilly is shocked by Charlotte's frail appearance.

                          HILLY
           Missus Phelan, I'm...I'm here to-

                          CHARLOTTE
           Hilly, you're a mess. Are you ill?
          Hilly self-consciously licks her fever blister.

                          HILLY
           Well, I...I didn't have time to get
           fixed up before-

           132.

                         

                          CHARLOTTE
           Darling, no husband wants to come
           home and see this.
          Charlotte peers closely at Hilly's cold sore.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           And that...that is horrendous.

                          HILLY
           Missus Phelan, I'm here-

                          CHARLOTTE
           You know, Hilly. If I didn't know
           any better, I'd say you've been
           eating too many...SWEETS?
          Hilly's face turns purple with embarrassment. Charlotte
          moves in for the kill.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           In fact. I'm sure of it. Now GET
           OUT OF MY HOUSE...before we all get
           one of those on our lip.
          Hilly looks back and forth between Skeeter and her mother,
          not knowing what to say.
          Hilly runs out of the house as Charlotte sashays quietly into
          the living room.
          Shocked, Skeeter stands alone in the foyer. Hilly sprays
          gravel across the Phelan yard as she speeds away.

           CHARLOTTE (O.C.) (CONT'D)
           Eugenia?

                          SKEETER
           Yes, Ma'am.

           CHARLOTTE (O.C.)
           Come in here, please.
          Skeeter gulps as she heads toward the living room.

                         

          INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Charlotte pats the sofa as Skeeter enters and sits.

                          SKEETER
           Ma'am?

                          CHARLOTTE
           Do you have plans tomorrow? Bible
           study? Anything like that?

                          SKEETER
           No, Ma'am.

           133.

                         

                          CHARLOTTE
           Good. We're going shopping.
          Skeeter lets out a big sigh of relief.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           `Cause no single daughter of mine
           is going to New York, representing
           the great state of Mississippi,
           without a proper cosmopolitan
           wardrobe.

                          SKEETER
           What?

                          CHARLOTTE
           I'm very proud of you, Eugenia.

                          SKEETER
           How do you know about New York?

                          CHARLOTTE
           A friend of Constantine's told me.
          Charlotte reaches down and pulls up her copy of "The Help".

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           Would you do me the honor of
           signing my copy?
          Skeeter nods. Charlotte hands Skeeter a pen. Her hand
          trembles as she signs the book, never having guessed how good
          it would feel.

                         

          INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - MORNING

          Aibileen washes dishes as the phone begins to ring. She
          answers. Minny screams on the other end of the line.

                         

          EXT. GAS STATION (INTERCUT) - SAME TIME

          Minny stands barefoot inside a phone booth, her lip swollen,
          face bleeding. Her kids stand outside, crying.

                          MINNY
           They fired Leroy last night! And
           when Leroy ask why, his boss say
           Mister Holbrook told him to do it.
           Said his nigger wife the reason.

                          AIBILEEN
           Oh, Law!

                          MINNY
           He try to kill me with he bare
           hands! He threw the kids in the
           yard, lock me in the bathroom, and
           say he gone set the house on fire.

           134.

                         

                          AIBILEEN
           Where are you now?!

                          MINNY
           The gas station. I climbed out the
           window, and we all ran here.

                          AIBILEEN
           I'm on come there now.

                          MINNY
           Wait, Aibileen...I'm pregnant.

                          AIBILEEN
           Minny, now, you listen to me. That
           baby gone be fine, and you ain't
           never gone lose your job. Mister
           Johnny told you that hisself.
           They's more book money coming.
           Your baby ain't gone know about
           gettin' beat. You hear me? You
           free, Minny! You are free.
          Minny lets out a chuckle of relief and wipes her eyes.

                          AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
           You hear me?

                          MINNY
           I hear you...
          The Leefolt front door opens. Elizabeth calls out.

           ELIZABETH (O.C.)
           Aibileen?

                         

          INT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Aibileen enters to find Elizabeth and Hilly staring at her.
          Elizabeth is two weeks WAY PAST DUE.

                          AIBILEEN
           Good morning.
          Hilly licks her cold sore as she steps forward. She glides
          her hand across the L-shaped crack in the Elizabeth's table,
          drawing Aibileen's attention to it.

                          HILLY
           Aibileen, the silver I lent
           Elizabeth last week.

                          AIBILEEN
           It not polished good? Humidity
           been fighting me on polishing day.

                          HILLY
           When you returned it, three pieces
           were missing out of the felt
           wrapper. A fork and two spoons.

           135.

                         

                          AIBILEEN
           Lemme...lemme go look in the
           kitchen, maybe I left some behind.

                          HILLY
           You know as well as I do that
           silver's not in the kitchen.
          Aibileen turns to Elizabeth.

                          AIBILEEN
           You check in Mae Mobley's bed? She
           been putting things-

                          HILLY
           Do you hear her, Elizabeth? She's
           trying to blame it on a toddler.
          Elizabeth won't look at Aibileen.

                          AIBILEEN
           I ain't stole no silver.
          Elizabeth whispers to Hilly.

                          ELIZABETH
           She says she doesn't have them.

                          HILLY
           Then it behooves me to inform you
           that you are fired, Aibileen. And
           I'll be calling the police. They
           know me.
          Mae Mobley enters the room.

                          MAE MOBLEY
           Aibee, my froat hurts.
          Mae Mobley coughs.

                          AIBILEEN
           I go get her some syrup, Miss
           Leefolt.

                          HILLY
           Elizabeth can take care of her
           child.
          Elizabeth looks to Hilly, appearing somewhat upset with this
          suggestion.

                          ELIZABETH
           I'll go get the couch syrup.
          Hilly glares at Aibileen as Elizabeth runs down the hall.

                          HILLY
           I won't tolerate liars!
          Mae Mobley becomes scared and hides behind Aibileen's leg.

           136.

                         

                          AIBILEEN
           I didn't steal no silver.

                          HILLY
           I'm not talking about silver. I'm
           talking about those things you
           wrote about Elizabeth. Maybe I
           can't send you to jail for what you
           wrote, but I can send you to jail
           for being a thief. And your
           friend, Minny? That nigra's got a
           nice surprise coming to her.
           Johnny Foote listens to what I say.
           She's as good as-
          Aibileen shouts, interrupting Hilly.

                          AIBILEEN
           Woman!...I know something about
           you. Don't you forget that.
          Hilly narrows her eyes.

                          AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
           From what Yule May says, they's a
           lot a time to write letters from
           jail. Plenty a time to write ever
           person in Jackson the truth about
           you, and the paper is free.

                          HILLY
           Nobody would believe something you
           wrote.

                          AIBILEEN
           I don't know. Already sold a lot a
           books.
          Fear floods into Hilly's eyes.

                          HILLY
           Get out of here!

                          MAE MOBLEY
           Don't go, Aibiee!
          Aibileen kneels down as Elizabeth returns with the syrup.

                          AIBILEEN
           Baby, you need to get back to bed.
           You got a fever.

                          MAE MOBLEY
           Noooo! Don't go, Aibee. Please
           don't leave.

                          AIBILEEN
           I gots to, Baby. I am so sorry.

                          MAE MOBLEY
           Why? Are you going to take care of
           another little girl?

           137.

                         

                          AIBILEEN
           No, Baby, that's not the reason. I
           don't want to leave you, but...It's
           time for me to retire. You my last
           little girl.

                          MAE MOBLEY
           Noooo!

                          AIBILEEN
           Baby Girl, I need you to remember
           ever thing I told you. Okay? Do
           you remember what I told you?

                          MAE MOBLEY
           To wipe my bottom good?

                          AIBILEEN
           No, Baby. The other. What you
           are.

                          MAE MOBLEY
           You is kind. You is smart. You is
           important.

                          AIBILEEN
           That's right, Baby Girl.
          Aibileen squeezes Mae Mobley for the last time. They both
          cry together. Hilly speaks up.

                          HILLY
           You need to go now, Aibileen!
          Aibileen rises up from Mae Mobley and turns to Elizabeth.

                          AIBILEEN
           Give my sweet girl a chance.
          Elizabeth avoids eye contact. Aibileen turns and walks away.
          As Elizabeth leans down to pick up Mae Mobley....HER WATER
          BREAKS. She glares at Hilly with shock and regret.

                         

          EXT. LEEFOLT HOME - MOMENTS LATER

          Aibileen steps out of the house with her purse.
          She walks stoically down the driveway. Tears stream down her
          face.
          Mae Mobley runs to the living room window crying. She beats
          on the glass from inside.

                          MAE MOBLEY
           Aibeeeee! Don't go!
          Aibileen never turns.

           138.

                         

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           Mae Mobley was my last baby. In
           just thirty minutes, I felt like my
           whole life was done. Of the
           thirteen maids, seven of us got
           fired. Several other maids got
           fired who had nothin' to do with
           our book. Guess our stories
           weren't so unique after all...But,
           like Minny, we was all free.

                         

          INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

          Hilly, even fatter now, sifts through the day's mail.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           And we's was a lot freer than Hilly
           Holbrook.
          She comes across a piece from Celia Foote addressed to The
          Starving Children of Africa Fund. A smug smile forms.
          She opens the envelope to find a check for $200.00 made out
          to: TWO-SLICE HILLY!
          Hilly screams as she rips the check into pieces.

                         

          EXT. FOOTE ESTATE - YARD - DAY

          Minny folds laundry on a picnic table.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           Ever so often, we all get a nice
           piece of book money in the mail.
           `Manna from heaven' we like to call
           it.
          Minny looks across the table and smiles at Celia who is
          holding and playing with Minny's newborn child.

                         

          EXT. CHICAGO - GRAVEYARD - DAY

          Close on tombstone:

                         

                          CONSTANTINE JEFFERSON
           Born December 24th 1883
           Died March 15th, 1963
          A bouquet of flowers lay at the foot of the tombstone. A
          copy of "The Help" leans against it.
          In the distance, a cab slowly pulls away with Skeeter inside.

           139.

                         

          INT. AIBILEEN'S HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

          Aibileen sits at her kitchen table, typing on Skeeter's old
          typewriter. We watch as keys write out the rest of
          Aibileen's voice over.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           Thousands of our books went out all
           over the world. We had got paid to
           tell the truth and we just couldn't
           believe it...
          Aibileen takes this last page out of the typewriter and
          places it behind two hundred other typed out pages.
          She looks up to the framed picture of Treelore and rises from
          the table with pride.

                         

          INT. HARPER AND ROW - SKEETER'S OFFICE - NEW YORK - DAY

          Skeeter smiles as she reads from a book in her corner office.
          The Manhattan skyline rises behind her. She wears Pucci.
          Her hair is perfectly styled. She looks gorgeous.
          She sets the book down on her desk and picks up the phone.
          The book's cover reads:
           "All My Babies"
           By Aibileen Clark
          Next to the book is a glass box. Constantine's corn pipe
          rests inside.

                         

          AIBILEEN'S NEW HOME - LIVING ROOM - FIFTEEN YEARS LATER
          Aibileen, 70, rises from a sofa. Her hair is gray. Reading
          glasses hang on a chain from around her neck.
          As she begins a slow walk down the hall, we see the
          surroundings of her new home for the first time. It's much
          bigger, well furnished and beautiful.
          She passes a study lined with shelves of books. A copy of
          "The Help" and "All My Babies" are placed side by side.
          At the end of the hall, Aibileen approaches the opened door
          of a brightly lit, sparkling white, bathroom.
          She enters the bathroom and closes the door.

                         What came first?  The music or the 
                         misery?  People worry about kids 
                         playing with guns and watching violent 
                         videos, we're scared that some sort

               Big thin LPs.  Fields of them.  We move across them, slowly...  
               they seem to come to rest in an end of a few books... but 
               then the CD's start, and go on, faster and faster, forever 
               then the singles, then the tapes...

                         But nobody worries about kids 
                         listening to thousands -- literally

                         hearts and rejection and pain and 
                         misery and loss.

               It seems the records, tapes, and CD's will never end until...  
               we come to ROB -- always a hair out of place, a face that 
               grows on you.  He sits in an oversized beanbag chair and 
               addresses us, the wall of music behind him.

                                     ROB
                         Did I listen to pop music because I 
                         was miserable, or was I miserable 
                         because I listened to pop music?

               INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Group of bags huddled next to the door.  Not the go-on-

               vacation set, but the clothes-to-coffee-maker moving out 
               variety.  Rob stares at them, his face unreadable, his head 
               gripped by a big pair Boudokan headphones.  We hear what he 
               is hearing, something foreboding and upbeat at the same time.

               LAURA, Rob's girlfriend, enters the room, and he immediately 
               pulls the headphones off.  She clocks him for a moment, 
               catching him in what seems to be an old and repeated moment 
               of nonpresence.  She begins to heft the bags, Rob goes to 
               her, a little tardy for his big goodbye.  Laura begins to 
               cry a bit.

                                     LAURA
                         I don't really know what I'm doing.

               He smiles, and she doesn't.  He adjusts.

                                     ROB
                         You don't have to go this second.  
                         You can stay until whenever.

                                     LAURA
                         We've done the hard part now.  I 
                         might as well, you know...

                                     ROB
                         Well stay for tonight, then.

               Laura shakes her head, lifts the last small bag, and backs 
               out the door.  A strap catches on a handle and the two of 
               them wrestle with it a bit, while trying to keep the door 
               open, until Laura awkwardly disappears from view and the 
               door shuts behind Rob.  He stays right there staring at the 
               shut door for a long moment, listening to the fading sound 
               of Laura and her dragging bags.

               STEREO

               Rob's left hand cranks the volume knob while his right 
               switches the CD changer to something loud and adrenal.  He 
               addresses us again.

                                     ROB
                         My desert-island, all-time, top five 
                         most memorable break-ups, in 
                         chronological order are as follows: 
                         Alison Ashworth, Penny Hardwick, 
                         Jackie Allen, Charlie Nicholson, 
                         Sarah Kendrew.

               INT. APARTMENT STAIRWELL

               Laura drags her bags, banging down the stairs --

               INT. ROB'S APARTMENT

               Rob moves around the apartment, seeming to expand physically, 
               looking for change as he continues.

                                     ROB
                         Those were the ones that really hurt.  
                         Can you see your name in that list, 
                         Laura?  Maybe you'd sneak into the 
                         top ten, but there's no place for 
                         you in the top five.  Sorry.  Those 
                         places are reserved for the kind of 
                         humiliations and heartbreaks that 
                         you're just not capable of delivering.

               He adjusts the angle of the TV, stuffs a creepy family 
               portrait into a drawer.

                                     ROB
                         That probably sounds crueler than 
                         it's meant to, but the fact is, we're 
                         too old to take each other miserable.  
                         Unhappiness used to mean something.  
                         Now it's just a drag like a cold or 
                         having no money.

               He moves through the living room to an open window facing 
               the street.  Looking down two stories, he sees Laura emerge 
               from the building and drag her bags toward her car across 
               the street.

                                     ROB
                         If you really wanted to mess me up, 
                         you should have got to me earlier.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SUBURBAN PARK - DUSK -

               Rob and Alison sit on the bench, kissing awkwardly.

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         Which brings us to number one.  Alison 
                         Ashworth.

               PARK BENCH - DUSK

               The same shot, the next night: new clothes, same clumsy make-
               out session.

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         My relationship with Alison Ashworth 
                         lasted six hours.

               PARK BENCH - DUSK

               ...Next night...

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         The two hours after school and before 
                         The Rockford Files, three days in a 
                         row.  On the fourth afternoon.

               SAME PARK BENCH

               ...And the fourth night...

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         Kevin Bannister.

               Alison and another boy, KEVIN BANNISTER.  Kissing.  In the 
               background, Rob approaches and stops.  He implodes with self-
               consciousness and humiliation and attempts to affect a casual 
               gait as he mopes away.

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         It would be nice to think that since 
                         I was fourteen, times have changed, 
                         relationships have become more 
                         sophisticated, females less cruel, 
                         skins thicker, but there still seems 
                         to be an element of that afternoon 
                         in everything that has happened to 
                         me since.  All my other romantic 
                         stories seem to be a scrambled version 
                         of that first one.

               INT. ROB'S APARTMENT

               Rob sits in his chair, a cord leading from the stereo to 
               headphones draped around his neck.  Behind him is the wall 
               of music.

                                     ROB
                         Number two.  Penny Hardwick.  Penny 
                         was great-looking, and her top five 
                         recording artists were Carly Simon, 
                         Carole King, James Taylor, Cat 
                         Stevens, and Elton John...

               He lets the needle down on the turntable next to him.

               "Nobody Does It Better" by Carly Simon begins to play as

               PRESENCE...

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL LAWN - FLASHBACK - MOS

               ...and continues as SOUNDTRACK.  PENNY, 16, is walking across 
               the grass toward us.  She's the clean, sporty, nice wholesome 
               girl-next-door.  She waves to off-camera friends, smiling a 
               winning smile.

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         Everybody liked her.  She was nice.  
                         Nice manners.  Nice grades.  Nice- 
                         looking.

               INT. PENNY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Penny and Rob sit on the edge of the bed, kissing.  Rob moves 
               his hand up toward the breast, but the hand then seems to 
               have a new idea, and dives south to follow the thigh into 
               Penny's skirt...

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         She was so nice, in fact, that she 
                         wouldn't let me put my hand 
                         underneath, or even on top of, her 
                         bra.

               ...when he contacts skin, Penny rolls like a gymnast away 
               and off of the bed, out of frame.  Rob looks away balefully.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               "Nobody Does It Better" continues as Rob walks Penny to her 
               front door.  She is smiling, he seems distant.

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         Penny was nice, but I wasn't 
                         interested in nice, just breasts, 
                         and therefore she was no good to me.  
                         And so I was finished with her.

               She leans in to kiss him, and he shrugs her off.

                                     ROB
                         What's the point?  It never goes 
                         anywhere.

               Without looking at her, Rob turns and walks down the street, 
               getting smaller.  Penny watches for a while.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. "EL" TRAIN CAR - MORNING - PRESENT

               Rob sways with the other commuters.

                                     ROB
                         She cried, and I hated her for it, 
                         because she made me feel bad.  I 
                         started dating a girl who everybody 
                         said would put out, and Penny went 
                         with this asshole Chris Thompson who 
                         told me that he had sex with her 
                         after something like three dates.  
                         How had Penny gone from a girl who 
                         wouldn't do anything to a girl who 
                         would do everything?

               A BUSINESSMAN looks up from his paper at Rob, then back down.

               EXT. CLARK STREET - DAY

               An old Chicago block of local merchants, on a busy street.

               Rob makes his way down the street, jangling a set of keys 
               and talking to us.

                                     ROB
                         My store's right up here.  It's called 
                         The Record Exchange.  It's carefully 
                         placed to attract the bare minimum 
                         of window shoppers.

               Rob arrives at a storefront, and begins unlocking a rusty 
               gate with two locks and then a beaten-down door.

                                     ROB
                         I get by because of the people who 
                         make a special effort to shop here 
                         on Saturday young men, always young 
                         men, who spend a disproportionate 
                         amount of their time looking for 
                         deleted Smiths singles and "original 
                         not rereleased" underline Frank Zappa 
                         albums.

               INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

               In almost darkness.  More light might penetrate the windows 
               if there weren't so many record-release posters taped to 
               them.  A dusty narrow corridor clad in burlap and shag rug.  
               On the walls are bagged 45's you will never hear unless you 
               commit your life to the losing proposition of listening to 
               every noodling of Jah Wobble and Glen Glenn and other people 
               you've never heard of.

               But as Rob opens the door, enters, and flips a switch causing 
               the fluorescents to sputter, we see in his eyes the reverence 
               and earnestness of a football coach gazing across an empty 
               field or a priest drawn at midnight to his empty church.

                                     ROB
                         The fetish properties are not unlike 
                         porn.  I would feel guilty taking 
                         their money if I wasn't, kind of, 
                         well, one of them.

               As he walks one of the two slim aisles toward the back, he 
               stops on a dime, steps back and pulls a CD from the sea and

               replaces it almost the same position, but not quite --
               meticulousness and pride in this gesture...

               After a moment the door creaks open behind Rob, admitting 
               DICK, a nervous, forlorn but sweet and intelligent discophile 
               with long greasy black hair, a Sonic Youth T-shirt, a 
               monstrous pair of headphones, and a canvas record bag 
               emblazoned with a label logo.

                                     ROB
                         'Morning, Dick.

                                     DICK
                         Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.

                                     ROB
                         Good weekend?

                                     DICK
                         Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice 
                         Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The 
                         one on Testament of Youth.  Never 
                         released here.  Japanese import only.

                                     ROB
                         Great.

                                     DICK
                         I'll tape it for you.

                                     ROB
                         No, that's okay.  Really.

                                     DICK
                         'Cause you like their second one, 
                         you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one 
                         with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You 
                         didn't see the cover though.

                                     ROB
                         Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that 
                         one.

                                     DICK
                         Well, I'll just make it for you.

                                     ROB
                              (resigned)
                         Okay.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RECORD STORE - LATER

               Dick is behind the counter, Rob in the aisles with a clipboard 
               doing inventory.

                                     ROB
                              (re: music)
                         What's this?

                                     DICK
                         The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like 
                         it?

               The door flies open and BARRY, an acid-tongued post-punk 
               rock misanthrope without quite enough intelligence to 
               conceptualize his own rebellion, walks in.  His teeth are 
               clenched in air-guitar concentration and he's phonetically 
               cranking a Clash riff:

                                     BARRY
                         BAA!  BA BA DANG!

               Dick shrinks back from him instinctively.  He stops mid-step 
               and cocks his ear at the music playing in the store.  His 
               face adopts an exaggerated grimace.

                                     BARRY
                         Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?

                                     DICK
                         It's the new --

                                     ROB
                         It's the record we've been listening 
                         to and enjoying, Barry.

               Barry moves in on the stereo behind the counter, and Dick 
               gets out of his way.

                                     BARRY
                         Well that's problematic because it 
                         sucks ass.

               He pops the CD out and frisbees it to Dick.

                                     BARRY
                              (re: the CD)
                         Yours, I assume...

               Barry pulls a tape out of his jacket and jams it in.  "How 
               to Kill a Radio Consultant" by Public Enemy comes through at 
               through the red levels.

                                     ROB
                              (over the blare)
                         TURN IT OFF, BARRY.

                                     BARRY
                         IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.

               Barry walks in rhythm toward the stockroom and disappears.

               Rob goes behind the counter and stops the tape.  Barry's 
               head pops out of the stockroom.

                                     BARRY
                         What are you doing?

                                     ROB
                         I don't want to hear Public Enemy 
                         right now.

                                     BARRY
                         Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do 
                         is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on 
                         some old sad bastard music see if I 
                         care.

                                     ROB
                         I don't want old sad bastard music 
                         either.  I just want something I can 
                         ignore.

                                     BARRY
                         But it's my new tape.  My Monday 
                         morning tape.  I made it last night 
                         just for today.

                                     ROB
                         Yeah, well it's fucking Monday 
                         afternoon.  You should get out of 
                         bed earlier.

                                     BARRY
                         Don't you want to hear what's next?

                                     ROB
                         What's next?

                                     BARRY
                         Play it.

                                     ROB
                         Say it.

                                     BARRY
                              (sighs)
                         "Little Latin Lupe Lu."

               Rob groans.

                                     DICK
                         Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?

                                     BARRY
                              (defensive)
                         No.  The Righteous Brothers.

                                     DICK
                         Oh well.  Nevermind.

               Barry bristles and moves slowly in on Dick.

                                     BARRY
                         What?

                                     DICK
                         Nothing.

                                     BARRY
                         No, not nothing.  What's wrong with 
                         the Righteous Brothers?

                                     DICK
                         Nothing.  I just prefer the other 
                         one.

                                     BARRY
                         Bullshit.

                                     ROB
                         How can it be bullshit to state a 
                         preference?

                                     BARRY
                         Since when did this shop become a 
                         fascist regime?

                                     ROB
                         Since you brought that bullshit tape 
                         in.

                                     BARRY
                              (sarcastic)
                         Great.  That's the fun of working in 
                         a record store.  Playing crappy pap 
                         you don't want to listen to.  I 
                         thought this tape was going to be, 
                         you know, a conversation stimulator.  
                         I was going to ask you for your top 
                         five records to play on a Monday 
                         morning and all that, and you just 
                         had to ruin it.

                                     ROB
                         We'll do it next Monday.

                                     BARRY
                         Well what's the point in that?

               From outside.  HEAR THE SOUND OF SKATEBOARD WHEELS CLACKING 
               AND SCRAPING, GETTING LOUDER.  Rob, Dick and Barry stop 
               fighting to listen, then each moves purposefully to a spot 
               in the store.  Dick to the register, Barry to the back, Rob 
               next to the door, as if bracing for a street fight.

               The SOUND gets closer, then stops.  The door swings open to 
               admit VINCE and JUSTIN, two fifteen-year-old skate punks.

               Vince's hair is post-apocolyptically hacked to different 
               lengths, Justin's in uniformly shaven with leopard spots 
               dyed browse.  Rob follows them, watching their every move.

               Dick counters from his perch, getting another angle.  Barry 
               cracks his knuckles threateningly.  Vince and Justin do their 
               best browser impersonations.  Finally Justin plucks a CD, 
               and the two move to the counter.

                                     ROB
                         Hey.  Didn't you steal that one 
                         already?

                                     DICK
                         Can I help you?

                                     JUSTIN
                         Just this.

                                     DICK
                         That'll be fifteen-twenty-seven.

               Vince reaches into his deep pocket and pulls out a paper 
               cup, with piece of paper attached that says "Please help me.  
               I'm retarded."  He pours a mass of change and crumpled singles 
               onto the counter.  Dick begins counting it out.

                                     VINCE
                         Isn't your name Dick?

                                     DICK
                         Yes.

                                     VINCE
                         That sucks.  Get it?

               Dick cracks a sad smile for a second.  He bags the CD and 
               Vince and Justin are off.  Rob walks back through the stock 
               room door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RECORD STORE - STOCK ROOM - LATER

               Rob is on his knees, opening boxes with a razor knife.  He 
               talks to us as he works.

                                     ROB
                         I'm sick of the sight of this place, 
                         to be honest.  Some days I'm afraid --

               Dick sticks his head in the door, looks at Rob, looks where 
               Rob is looking (camera), and retreats back through the door.

               Rob continues.

                                     ROB
                         I'm afraid I'll go berserk, rip the 
                         Elvis Costello mobile from the 
                         ceiling, throw the "Country Artists 
                         Male A-K" rack out onto the streets, 
                         go off to work in a Virgin Megastore 
                         and never come back --

               He hears the bell on the front door RING, and he stops and 
               listens, looks a bit worried.

                                     CUSTOMER (O.S.)
                         I'm looking for a record for my 
                         daughter.  For her birthday.  "I 
                         Just Called To Say I Love You." Do 
                         you have it?

                                     BARRY (O.S.)
                         Oh yeah.  We got it.

               Rob relaxes and goes back to work.

                                     CUSTOMER (O.S.)
                         Great.  Can I have it then?

                                     BARRY (O.S.)
                         No, you can't.

               Rob deflates, shaking his head.

               STORE FLOOR

               Barry leans back, elbows up on the counter behind him, talking 
               to the CUSTOMER, a middle-aged graying man in a raincoat.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Why not?

                                     BARRY
                         Because it's sentimental tacky crap, 
                         that's why not.  Do we look like the 
                         kind of store that sells "I Just 
                         Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to 
                         the mall and stop wasting our time.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         What's your problem?  What did I...  
                         Why are you --

                                     BARRY
                         Do you even know your daughter?  
                         There is no way she likes that song.  
                         Or is she in a coma?

               The Customer throws up his hands and starts out of the store.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Okay, okay, buddy.  I didn't know it 
                         was Pick On the Middle-Aged Square 
                         Guy Day.  My apologies.  I'll be on 
                         my way.

               He steps out of the door.

                                     BARRY
                         B'Bye!

               Outside, anger catches up to the Customer.  He turns and 
               throws up a middle finger --

                                     CUSTOMER
                         FUCK YOU!

               -- and bolts.  Barry smiles and turns to see

               ROB

               standing in the doorway of the stock room.  He feigns 
               applause.

                                     ROB
                         Nice, Barry.

                                     BARRY
                         Rob.  Top five musical crimes

                         '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is 
                         it in fact unfair to criticize a 
                         formerly great artist for his latter-
                         day sins?  "Is it better to burn out 
                         than to fade away?"

                                     ROB
                         You just drove a fucking customer 
                         away, Barry.

                                     BARRY
                         We didn't even really have it.  I 
                         happen to know for a fact that the 
                         only Stevie Wonder single we have is 
                         "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just 
                         goofing on the straight, and it never 
                         cost you a penny.

                                     ROB
                         Not the point.

                                     BARRY
                         Oh, so what's the point then?

                                     ROB
                         I don't want you talking to our 
                         customers like that again.

                                     BARRY
                         "Our customers?" You think that Mr.  
                         L.L. Bean out there is going to be a 
                         regular?

               Rob's face begins to redden with anger.

                                     ROB
                         Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we 
                         used to fuck with anyone who asked 
                         for anything we didn't like, but 
                         it's gotta stop.

                                     BARRY
                         Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy 
                         one record -- which we didn't even 
                         have -- and leave and never come 
                         back again anyway.  Why not have a 
                         little fun?  Big fucking deal.

                                     ROB
                         What did he ever do to you?

                                     BARRY
                         He offended me with his terrible 
                         taste.

                                     ROB
                         It wasn't even his terrible taste.  
                         It was his daughter's.

                                     BARRY
                         Oh, now you're defending that 
                         motherfucker?  You're going soft in 
                         your old age, Rob.  There was a time 
                         when you would have chased him out 
                         of the store and up the street.  Now 
                         all of a sudden I'm offending your 
                         golf buddy.
                              (sarcastic)
                         You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry.  
                         How are we ever going to make enough 
                         money to get you and Laura into the 
                         country club?

               Rob is red and seething.

                                     BARRY
                         And by the way, I tell you this for 
                         your own good: That's the worst 
                         sweater I've ever seen.  I have never 
                         seen a sweater that bad worn by anyone 
                         I'm on speaking terms with.  It's a 
                         disgrace to the human race.

               Rob springs on Barry, grabbing him by the lapels and jerking 
               him up against the wall.  Rob is so mad he can't say anything.

                                     DICK
                         Hey, guys... Hey.

               Rob runs out of steam and drops Barry, who backpedals fast.

                                     BARRY
                              (extremely shaken)
                         What are you, some kind of fucking 
                         maniac?  If this jacket's torn you're 
                         gonna pay big.

               Barry stomps out of the store.  Rob turns and goes back to 
               the stockroom, and sits on the stepladder.  Dick appears in 
               the doorway, terrified.

                                     DICK
                         Are you all right?

                                     ROB
                         Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura 
                         and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if 
                         we ever see Barry again maybe you 
                         can tell him that.

                                     DICK
                         'Course I will, Rob.  No problem.  
                         No problem at all.  I'll tell him 
                         next time I see him.

               Rob nods.  Dick sets out into the uncharted conversational 
               territory of interpersonal relationships.

                                     DICK
                         I've ah... got some other stuff to 
                         tell him anyway, so it's no problem.  
                         I'll just tell him about, you know, 
                         Laura, when I tell him the other 
                         stuff.

                                     ROB
                         Fine.

                                     DICK
                         I'll start with your news before I 
                         tell him mine, obviously.  Mine isn't 
                         much, really, just about Marie LaSalle
                              (flashes CD of pretty 
                              woman)
                         playing at Lounge Ax tonight.  I 
                         like her, you know, she's kind of 
                         Sheryl Crowish... but, you know, 
                         good.  So I'll tell him before that.  
                         Good news and bad news kind of thing.

               Dick laughs nervously.

                                     DICK
                         Or rather, bad news and good news, 
                         because he likes this person playing 
                         tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura 
                         too, I didn't mean that.  And he 
                         likes you.  It's just that --

                                     ROB
                         I understand, Dick.

                                     DICK
                         Sure.  'Course.  Rob, look.  Do you 
                         want to... talk about it, that kind 
                         of thing?

               Rob looks up at Dick, who is so nervous that his brow is 
               wet.

                                     ROB
                         No.  Thanks though, Dick.

               Dick sighs with relief, and smiles his way out of the stock 
               room.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ROB IN HIS CHAIR

               Rob to camera.

                                     ROB
                         Number three in the top five break- 
                         ups was Charlie Nicholson, sophomore 
                         year of college.  Some people never 
                         got over 'Nam, or the night their 
                         band opened for Nirvana.  I guess I 
                         never really got over Charlie.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COLLEGE QUAD - DAY - FLASHBACK

               About twenty feet away we see a tall, thin beauty, bleach-
               blonde hair cropped short in darling '80's new-wave asymmetry.

               She is speaking animatedly to a PAMPHLETEER, driving her 
               points home with a forefinger.

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         She looked different.  Dramatic.  
                         Exotic.  She talked a lot, about 
                         remarkably interesting things like 
                         music, books, film, and politics...

               INT. CAFE - DAY

               A younger Rob sits amongst a group of STUDENTS who are engaged 
               in a heated conversation.  He is smiling, mouth closed, just 
               happy to be there.  Charlie sitting next to him, tousles his 
               hair as she talks incessantly.

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                              (over her talking)
                         ...so we didn't have those terrible, 
                         strained sentences, that seemed to 
                         characterized most of my 
                         relationships.  And she liked me.  
                         She liked me.  She liked me.

               Charlie gives Rob a quick kiss and keeps talking...

               EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

               Rob and Charlie walk arm in arm, Rob in cool clothes and 
               sunglasses trying to look cool, Charlie making a point about 
               something.

               Rob checks out how cool he looks with her as they walk by a 
               store window REFLECTION.

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         We went out for two years, and for 
                         every single minute I felt as though 
                         I was standing on a dangerously narrow 
                         ledge.  I couldn't get comfortable, 
                         couldn't ever stretch out and relax.  
                         Why would a girl -- no, a woman -- 
                         like Charlie go out with someone who 
                         only a few years ago sewed a Foghat 
                         patch on his jacket?  I felt like 
                         all those people who suddenly shaved 
                         their heads and said they'd always 
                         been punks.  I felt like a fraud.  
                         And I was depressed by the lack of 
                         flamboyance in my wardrobe...

               INT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

               The fabulous sophomore design student's studio apartment:

               White wood floor, white walls, overvarnished door, Doisneaux 
               print on the wall, futon on the floor.  Rob lies back on his 
               elbows, watching Charlie in uncomfortable, worried awe.  She 
               stands, her back to him, wearing only her underwear and 
               pulling on a T-shirt -- a heartbreaking image to look back 
               on.

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         ...I worried about my abilities as a 
                         lover.  I was intimidated by the 
                         other men in her design department, 
                         and became convinced that she was 
                         going to leave me for one of them.

               Charlie turns around and looks at Rob with naked ambivalence.

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         She left me for one of them.  The 
                         dreaded Marco.

               EXT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               It is RAINING like crazy, and Rob is shouting up at a lit 
               window, maniacally gesturing.  The curtains part and Charlie's 
               figure appears, clad only in a sheet.  Next to her is a tall, 
               built, handsome man, MARCO, also in a sheet.

               Eventually he falls to his knees with a splash and buries 
               his head in his hands.  The light goes out.

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         And I lost it.  I lost it all.  
                         Dignity, faith, fifteen pounds...

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Rob wandering through the rain.

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         Any small idea of personal identity 
                         that I had acquired up to that point.

               INT. SOME RECORD STORE - DAY

               A younger and catatonic Rob listlessly sorts through a stack 
               of records.

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         I came to three months later, and to 
                         my surprise had flunked out of school 
                         and started working in a record store.

               INT. ROB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Rob stands in front of his wall of music, shifting LPs around 
               between the shelves and piles on the floor as he talks to 
               us.

                                     ROB
                         What I really learned from the Charlie 
                         Debacle is that you gotta punch your 
                         weight.  Charlie was out of my Class: 
                         too pretty, too smart, too witty, 
                         too much.  What am I?  Average.  A 
                         middleweight.  Not the smartest guy 
                         in the world, but certainly not the 
                         dumbest.  I've read books like The 
                         Unbearable Lightness of Being, 
                         Angela's Ashes, and Love in the Time 
                         of Cholera, and understood them, I 
                         think -- they're about girls, right? -- 
                         just kidding -- but I don't like 
                         them very much.  My all time top 
                         five favorite books are Johnny Cash's 
                         autobiography, Snow Crash by Neil 
                         Stevenson, Zen and the Art of 
                         Motorcycle Maintenance, The Trouser 
                         Press Guides to Rock, and, I don't 
                         know, probably something by Kurt 
                         Vonnegut.  I look through the New 
                         Yorker when my neighbor's done with 
                         it, and I'm not averse to going down 
                         to the Fine Arts to watch subtitles 
                         films, although on the whole I prefer 
                         American films.  Top five being Blade 
                         Runner, Cool Hand Luke, the first 
                         two Godfathers which we'll count as 
                         one, Taxi Driver, and The Shining.  
                         I'm okay looking, average height, 
                         not skinny, not fat.  My genius, if 
                         I can call it that, is to combine a 
                         whole load of averageness into one 
                         compact frame.  You might say there 
                         were millions like me, but there 
                         aren't, really: Alot of guys have 
                         impeccable music taste but don't 
                         read, alot of guys read but are really 
                         fat, alot of guys are sympathetic to 
                         women but have stupid beards, alot 
                         of guys have a Woody Allen sense of 
                         humor but look like Woody Allen.  
                         Some drink too much, some drive like 
                         assholes, some get into fights, or 
                         show off money, or do drugs.  I don't 
                         do any of these things, really.  If 
                         I do okay with women it's not because 
                         of the virtues I have, but because 
                         of the ugly flaws I don't have... 
                         So.  Charlie and I didn't match.  
                         After her I was determined to never 
                         get out of my league again.

               INT. ROB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Rob presses play on the answering machine.  A pleasant, older 
               female voice is heard.  It's JANET, Laura's mother.

                                     JANET
                              (on machine)
                         Hello, you two.  Laura, it's your 
                         mother.  Your father's angina is a 
                         little rough today and I thought 
                         he'd like to talk to you.  No big 
                         deal.  I love you two.  Bye.

               Beep.

                                     LIZ
                              (on machine)
                         Rob, it's Liz.  Just calling to see, 
                         well, if you're okay.  Give me a 
                         ring.  I'm not taking sides.  Yet.  
                         Lot's of love.  Bye.

               He pulls an LP from a shelf, puts it on the turntable and 
               sits back in his chair.

               EXT. LAKE MICHIGAN WATERFRONT - MOS - THE PAST

               The MUSIC becomes SOUNDTRACK to the following scenes.  Rob 
               and SARAH, a thin, modestly attractive young woman, SARAH, 
               walk and talk.  They seem to be emphatically complaining 
               together.

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         Charlie and I didn't match.  Marco 
                         and Charlie matched.  Me and Sarah, 
                         number four on the all time break- 
                         ups list, matched.  She wore more or 
                         less the same clothes as mine, had 
                         an acceptable working knowledge of 
                         music, and she had been dumped by 
                         some asshole named Michael.  He was 
                         her moment, Charlie was mine.  Sarah 
                         had sworn off men.  I had sworn off 
                         women.  It made sense to pool our 
                         loathing of the opposite sex, swear 
                         them off together, and get to share 
                         a bed with someone at the same time.

               INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - MOS - NIGHT

               Rob and SARAH sit up in bed, staring at the television...

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         We were frightened of being left 
                         alone for the rest of our lives.  
                         Only people of a certain disposition 
                         are frightened of being alone for 
                         the rest of their lives at twenty- 
                         six.  We were of that disposition.  
                         Everything seemed much later than it 
                         was.

               INT. SARAH'S KITCHEN - MOS - DAY ROB'S POV

               of Sarah, sitting across the table, mid-confession.

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         When she told me that she met someone 
                         else it made no sense.  Her meeting 
                         someone else was contrary to the 
                         whole spirit of our arrangement.  
                         All we really had in common was that 
                         we were dumped by people, and that 
                         we were against dumping.  We were 
                         violently anti-dump.  So how come I 
                         got dumped?

               ROB IN HIS CHAIR

               The MUSIC becomes PRESENCE again, and Rob takes the needle 
               off the record.

                                     ROB
                         You run the risk of losing anyone 
                         who is worth spending time with.  
                         But I didn't know that at the time.  
                         All I saw was that I'd moved down a 
                         division and that it still hadn't 
                         worked out, and this seemed cause 
                         for a great deal of misery and self-
                         pity.  And that's when Laura came 
                         along.

               INT. ROB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Rob is surrounded by stacks of records on the floor.  He 
               looks to camera.

                                     ROB
                         I'm reorganizing my records tonight.  
                         It's something I do in times of 
                         emotional distress.  When Laura was 
                         here I had them in alphabetical order, 
                         before that, chronologically.  
                         Tonight, though, I'm trying to put 
                         them in the order in which I bought 
                         them.  That way I can write my own 
                         autobiography without picking up a 
                         pen.  Pull them all off the shelves, 
                         look for Revolver and go from there.  
                         I'll be able to see how I got from 
                         Deep Purple to The Soft Boys in twenty-
                         five moves.  What I really like about 
                         my new system is that it makes me 
                         more complicated than I am.  To find 
                         anything you have to be me, or at 
                         the very least a doctor in Rob-ology.  
                         If you wanna find Landslide by 
                         Fleetwood Mac you have to know that 
                         I bought it for someone in the fall 
                         of 1983 and then didn't give it to 
                         them for personal reasons.  But you 
                         don't know any of that, do you?  You 
                         would have to ask me to--

               The phone rings again.  Rob picks it up.

                                     ROB
                         Yeah?

                                     MOM
                         Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.

               Rob deflates a bit.

                                     ROB
                         Hi, Mom.

                                     MOM
                         Everything all right?

                                     ROB
                         Great.  Super-fantastic.

                                     MOM
                         How's the store?

                                     ROB
                         So so.  Up and down.

                                     MOM
                         Your lucky Laura's doing so well.  
                         If it wasn't for her, I don't think 
                         either of us would ever sleep...

               Rob holds his lips together with thumb and forefinger, but 
               succumbs --

                                     ROB
                         She left.  She's gone.

                                     MOM
                         What do you mean?  Where did she go?

                                     ROB
                         How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend.  
                         Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura 
                         move out.

                                     MOM
                         Well call her mother.

                                     ROB
                         She just called.  She doesn't even 
                         know.  It's probably the last time 
                         I'll ever hear her voice.  That's 
                         weird, isn't it?  You spend Christmas 
                         at somebody's house, you know, and 
                         you worry about their operations and 
                         you see them in their bathrobe, and... 
                         I dunno...

               Silence.

                                     ROB
                         There'll be another mom and another 
                         Christmas.  Right?

               Silence... More silence.

                                     ROB
                         Hello?  Anybody there?

               THE SOUND OF SOFT CRYING

                                     ROB
                         I'm all right, if that's what's 
                         upsetting you.

                                     MOM
                         You know that's not what's upsetting 
                         me.

                                     ROB
                         Well it fucking should be, shouldn't 
                         it?

                                     MOM
                         I knew this would happen.  What are 
                         you going to do Rob?

                                     ROB
                         I'm going to drink this bottle of 
                         wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then 
                         tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.

                                     MOM
                         And after that?

                                     ROB
                         Meet a nice girl and have children.  
                         I promise the next time we talk I'll 
                         have it all sorted out.

                                     MOM
                         I knew this was going to happen.

                                     ROB
                         Then what are you getting so upset 
                         about?

                                     MOM
                         What did Laura say?  Do you know why 
                         she left?

                                     ROB
                         It's got nothing to do with marriage, 
                         if that's what you're getting at.

                                     MOM
                         So you say.  I'd like to hear her 
                         side of it.

                                     ROB
                         Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm 
                         telling you Laura didn't want to get 
                         married!  She is not that kind of 
                         girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not 
                         what happens now.

                                     MOM
                         Well I don't know what happens now, 
                         apart from you meet someone, you 
                         move in, she goes.  You meet someone, 
                         you move in, she goes.

               Silence.  Rob busted.

                                     ROB
                         Shut up, Mom.

               Rob hangs up the phone.  He fills up his glass again, takes 
               a swig, and slumps into a chair.  If there was any wind left 
               in Rob, it just got knocked out.  After a moment, he gets to 
               his feet, grabs his jacket and heads out the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LOUNGE AX CLUB - LINCOLN AVE. - NIGHT

               Rob comes down the street and gets in the short line to enter 
               the club.  From inside he hears a GUITAR, playing a tune 
               that becomes familiar not only to Rob, but to us.  When a 
               strong, lilting female VOICE begins to sing, we hear what it 
               is: "Baby I Love Your Way," by Peter Frampton.

               Rob smiles at first, but begins to darken as the verse 
               continues.  He steps out of line and leans against the outside 
               wall, listening.  Is he beginning to cry?  Yes, he is...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ROB IN HIS CHAIR

                                     ROB
                         Peter.  Frampton.  That perm! "Show 
                         Me the Way"!  A phenomenon based on 
                         a live album that was actually 
                         recorded in a studio!  What is 
                         happening?  I am getting misty, choked 
                         up at a song that I had the good 
                         sense at twelve to realize was so 
                         saccharine and stupid as to be 
                         inarticulatable, until Michael Bolton, 
                         that is.

               CUT BACK TO:

               EXT. LOUNGE AX CLUB - LINCOLN AVE.

               He looks around self-consciously, and paces a bit, deciding 
               whether or not to stay.  He takes a deep breath, and heads 
               in the door.

               INT. LOUNGE AX - NIGHT

               As Rob enters he looks to the stage, where MARIE LASALLE is 
               standing alone with her acoustic guitar, heading toward the 
               song's finish.  Rob's expression begins to shift from the 
               melancholy to something else altogether.  Marie is beautiful, 
               and Marie has touched his heart.  Rob navigates toward her 
               though the small crowd as if pulled by something unseen.  He 
               addresses us over his shoulder.

                                     ROB
                         Sentimental music makes you nostalgic 
                         and hopeful at the same time.  Marie's 
                         the hopeful part.  Laura's the 
                         nostalgia part.  These things happen.  
                         They happen to men, at any rate.  
                         This is why I shouldn't be listening 
                         to pop music.

               As he gets closer to the stage --

                                     DICK
                         ROB!

               Rob looks over to see Dick sitting with Barry, a few feet 
               away.  He shakes it off and sits with them, extending a 
               meaningful hand to Barry, who takes it.  They turn back to 
               the stage as Marie finishes the song.

                                     ROB
                         I always hated this song.

                                     DICK
                         Yeah.

                                     BARRY
                         Yeah.

                                     ROB
                         But now I kind of like it.

               Dick and Barry nod, then keep watching.  All three of them 
               are in their own private fantasies with Marie.

                                     DICK
                         She shouldn't done it on "The Number 
                         Four With a Smile."

                                     BARRY
                         Isn't her album called "Number Four 
                         With A Smile?"

                                     DICK
                         That's what I said.

                                     BARRY
                         No, no, no, you said "The Number 
                         Four With a Smile," and there's no 
                         "The" at the front of the title of 
                         the album.

                                     DICK
                         It's a reference to a Chinese meal 
                         in Toronto and I think that there is 
                         a "The."  But I could be wrong.

                                     BARRY
                         You can be and are wrong.

               They drop it, so that their eyes can drift back to Marie.

                                     BARRY
                         I wanna date a musician...

                                     ROB
                              (nods in agreement)
                         I wanna live with a musician.  She'd 
                         write songs at home, ask me what she 
                         thought of them, maybe even include 
                         one of our private jokes in the liner 
                         notes.

                                     BARRY
                         ...Maybe a picture of me in the liner 
                         notes...

                                     DICK
                         Just in the background somewhere.

               MARIE

               as the song ends, and she smiles out over the room.  The 
               audience applauds.

                                     MARIE
                         Thanks, you guys, I know I'm not 
                         supposed to like that song, but I 
                         do.  I'm gonna take a break for a 
                         second.  Anybody wants to buy one of 
                         my tapes, they're five bucks up here.  
                         One of my other personalities will 
                         be selling them.

               ROB, DICK, AND BARRY

                                     BARRY
                         Let's go get one.

                                     ROB
                         Let's not.

                                     DICK
                         I want a tape.

               Barry and Dick stand and begin to move off...

                                     ROB
                         I don't need to go up there right 
                         now.

               ...and they're gone.  After a beat, Rob gets up and follows 
               them.

               FOOT OF THE STAGE

               Dick and Barry wait nervously to buy a tape, Rob just behind 
               them.  Marie processes sales with polite monosyllables, until 
               the three get up front.

                                     MARIE
                         Enjoying yourselves?

               They dart eyes to each other, then nod.

                                     MARIE
                         Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.

                                     ROB
                         Good.

               Rob hands her a ten and she roots around in a duffel bag for 
               change...

                                     ROB
                         So you live in Chicago now?

                                     MARIE
                         Yup.  Not far from here, actually.

                                     BARRY
                         You like it?

                                     MARIE
                         It's okay.  Hey.  You guys might be 
                         the sort to know.  Are there any 
                         good record stores around here or do 
                         I have to go downtown?

               Barry and Dick do not try to control themselves.  They point 
               to Rob.

                                     DICK
                         He's got one!

                                     BARRY
                         On Clark Street!

                                     DICK
                         A couple blocks!  About six!

                                     BARRY
                         We work there!

                                     DICK
                         You'd love it!

               Marie laughs.

                                     MARIE
                         What do you sell?

                                     BARRY
                         A little of anything that matters.  
                         Rock, soul, R&B, punk rock, hip- 
                         hop, ska, new wave...

                                     MARIE
                         Sounds great.

               The line behind them is moving in, and Marie smiles at them 
               and turns to someone else.  They scurry back toward their 
               table.

                                     ROB
                         What did you tell her about the shop 
                         for?

                                     BARRY
                         I didn't know it was classified 
                         information.  I mean, I know we don't 
                         have any customers, but I thought 
                         that was a bad thing, not, like, a 
                         business strategy.

               Rob looks over Barry at Marie.  She catches his eye as she 
               looks over the room.  His eyes shoot to the floor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RECORD STORE - STOCK ROOM - LATER

               Rob is going through a huge stack of used CD's, sorting them 
               off into different bins, bouncing his head absently to the 
               music -- the same song of Marie's that Rob had on when Laura 
               called last night.

                                     BARRY (O.S.)
                         ROB!  PHONE!

               Rob reaches over and hits the SPEAKER button on the phone, 
               still in the groove of sorting.

                                     ROB
                         Rob here.

                                     LIZ (O.S.)
                         Hey.  It's Liz.

                                     ROB
                         What's happenin'.

                                     LIZ
                         You called this morning?

                                     ROB
                         Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you 
                         for that message last night.  It 
                         made me feel like... like less of an 
                         asshole.

                                     LIZ
                         How're you holding up?

                                     ROB
                         Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great.  
                         Last night I got to thinking, "you 
                         know what?  Maybe it is time to move 
                         on.  Maybe we're just not right for 
                         each other.  Or maybe we are.  But 
                         time will tell and at this point I'm 
                         going to be fine with whatever's 
                         meant to be." You know?

                                     LIZ
                         Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to 
                         take sides.  And I like Laura with 
                         you.  She's more fun, more open.  
                         You guys are good together.  I just 
                         wish you two could, I don't know.  I 
                         don't think much of this Ian guy --

               -- Dick bursts in, huge-faced --

                                     DICK
                         Rob.

                                     ROB
                         Liz, hold on a second --
                              (turns to Dick)
                         What?

                                     DICK
                         Marie LaSalle is in the store!  Here, 
                         she's here, and now!

               Rob freezes, he and Dick turn to the speaker, which cranks 
               Marie's voice.  Rob goes to the phone and picks up the 
               handset.

                                     ROB
                         Liz, can you hold for a second?

               He hits hold.

                                     ROB
                              (to Dick)
                         I'll be out there!  Go!
                              (picks up the phone)
                         Hey, Liz, I gotta go... Tomorrow 
                         night?  Great.  Green Mill.  Fine.  
                         Seven?  Done.  Thanks.  Right.  Bye.

               He hangs up fast, spins around to look in a cracked one-foot-
               square cracked mirror bearing the logo of Aerosmith that is 
               mounted on the wall, and moves out into the

               FRONT ROOM

               and up the aisle fast toward the stereo where he turns Marie's 
               music off.  He takes a deep breath and looks up, meeting her 
               eyes.

                                     ROB
                         Oh.  Hi.

               Marie smiles.

                                     MARIE
                              (re: music)
                         Don't you like that?

                                     ROB
                         No, no, I love, it's just, thinking 
                         you're, you must be so sick of it...  
                         Well.

               He reaches back and puts it back on.  He cracks his face 
               into a smile, then walks fast back to the stock room door.  
               Marie watches him go.

               STOCK ROOM

               where as soon as he crosses the threshold his fist clench 
               and he grimaces:

                                     ROB
                         WHAT FUCKING IAN GUY?!!

               Dick comes in --

                                     DICK
                         Rob --!

                                     ROB
                         -- FUCK OFF!

               Dick backs out fast.  Rob leans on a wall.  Barry enters --

                                     BARRY
                         We're only on the fucking list for 
                         Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's 
                         all!  All three of us.

                                     ROB
                         That's fucking great, Barry.  We can 
                         spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save 
                         five each.  Fantastic, Barry!

                                     BARRY
                         We can take your car.

                                     ROB
                         It's not my car, now is it?  It's 
                         Laura's car, and thus Laura has it.  
                         So it's an ass-bumping double- 
                         transferring bus ride through 
                         bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab.  
                         Wow.  Fucking great.

               Barry sighs, throws up his hands and heads out the door.

                                     BARRY
                         Jaggoff...

               Barry exits.  Rob seems to be having trouble staying on his 
               feet.

                                     ROB
                         Who the fuck is Ian?!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ROB'S BUILDING'S LOBBY - NIGHT

               Rob enters and walks to the mail table, looking like shit.

               He starts sifting through envelopes for his.

                                     ROB
                         Laura doesn't know anybody called 
                         Ian.  There's no Ian at her office.  
                         She has no friends named Ian.  She 
                         has never met anyone called Ian in 
                         her whole life.  Although there may 
                         have been one in college -- but I am 
                         almost certain that since 1989 she 
                         has lived in an Ian-less universe.

               He slows... and stops.  His face gets a little paler as he 
               lifts a letter up to his face.

               CLOSE-UP: LETTER

               A cable service bill to a Mr. I. Raymond.

               ROB

               as he looks at it, divining.

                                     ROB
                         "I. Raymond." Ray. "I." IAN.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ROB IN HIS CHAIR

               Rob to camera.

                                     ROB
                         Mr. I Raymond. "Ray" to his friends, 
                         and, more importantly, to his 
                         neighbors.  The guy who up until 
                         about six weeks ago lived upstairs.  
                         I knew it was him the moment I saw 
                         the letter.  I start to remember 
                         things now: His stupid clothing, his 
                         music -- Latin, Bulgarian, whatever 
                         fucking world music was trendy that 
                         week--stupid laugh, awful cooking 
                         smells.  I can't remember anything 
                         good about him at all.  I never liked 
                         him much then, and I fucking hate 
                         him now... I manage to block out the 
                         worst, most painful, most disturbing 
                         memory of him until I go to bed.

               INT. ROB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Darkness.  We move silently through the rooms, and enter the 
               bedroom... closer to the bed, we see Rob on his back, sheets 
               held clenched up to his chin.  He stares at the ceiling, 
               sadly.

               JUMP CUT

               To almost the same shot, but it's Rob and Laura in the bed, 
               semi-tangled.  Laura has a book in her lap.  A CREAKING is 
               heard.  Laura's eyes go to the ceiling, and Rob sits up at 
               attention.  They look up at the light fixture, which shakes 
               a little faster, with the rhythm of the creaking.  Someone 
               is definitely having sex upstairs, and they are going for 
               it.

                                     ROB
                         Jeez.  He goes on long enough.

                                     LAURA
                         I should be so lucky.

               They turn to each other and laugh.

               JUMP CUT BACK

               to Rob lying still in bed, staring at the ceiling.

                                     ROB
                         You are as abandoned and as noisy as 
                         any character in a porn film, Laura.  
                         You are Ian's plaything, responding 
                         to his touch with shrieks of orgasmic 
                         delight.  No woman in the history of 
                         the world is having better sex than 
                         the sex you are having with Ian in 
                         my head.

               ROB'S IAN-LAURA SEX NIGHTMARE - QUICK CUTS

               Ian mercilessly savages Laura from behind, below, and above, 
               champagne showers, toe-sucking, and animal screams --

               BACK TO ROB IN BED,

               imploding with disgust and sorrow.  Tears run down his cheeks 
               into his ears.

                                     ROB
                         Number five -- Jackie Allen.  My 
                         break up with Jackie Allen had no 
                         effect on my life whatsoever.  I 
                         just slotted her in to bump you out 
                         of position, Laura.  Yes, you do in 
                         fact make it into the top five.  
                         Welcome.  And just to remind you, 
                         the list is in chronological order, 
                         not in the order of pain and 
                         suffering.

               INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

               Dick and Barry are stocking the racks.  Rob stands at the 
               register, rocking back and forth sort of like an idiot, to 
               "Always and Forever" by the Commodores.  He is a mess.

                                     FEMALE VOICE
                         Hey.

               Rob looks up to see a nineteen or twenty-year-old GIRL 
               standing in front of him.

                                     GIRL
                         Do you have soul?

               Rob smiles bitterly at her, clearly having a different meaning 
               in mind.

                                     ROB
                         That all depends.

               She kind of backs away and goes back to browsing.  The phone 
               rings and Rob picks it up.

                                     ROB
                         Record Exchange... How many records... 
                         Right, well if you could bring them -- 
                         okay, well, where do you live?  
                         Right... how about now?  I can come 
                         right over...
                              (Rob scribbles)
                         Okay.

               He hangs up and grabs his jacket.  Dick emerges from the 
               back.

                                     ROB
                              (to Dick)
                         Some lady's got some singles to sell.  
                         I'll be back in a half-hour.

               Rob walks out.

               EXT./INT. FANCY LINCOLN PARK TOWNHOUSE - DAY

               Rob mounts the stairs and rings the doorbell.  The door opens, 
               revealing a too-tan WOMAN in her late forties, in designer 
               jeans and a T-shirt bearing a rhinestone peace sign.

               She says nothing.

                                     ROB
                         Hi.  You called about the records?

               She turns and walks into the house, leaving the door open 
               for him.  He follows her in and through a fabulous first 
               floor, packed with big-bucks bourgeois: Rugs, art, and 
               antiques:

               She ushers Rob into a large study, and turns the light on.  
               He misses a breath.  The walls are lined with mahogany cases 
               custom-built for CDs, albums, epicurean stereo components, a 
               couple priceless vintage guitars -- every one of the thousands 
               of items bear a little numbered sticker, like a museum.  She 
               points to several boxes on the floor, full of hundreds of 
               singles.

                                     WOMAN
                         Those.

               Rob steps into the room like an Undeserving, and carefully 
               drops to his knees to examine the singles, each pristine in 
               a plastic sleeve: the original God Save the Queen by the Sex 
               Pistols, original Otis Reddings, Elvis Presleys, James Browns, 
               Jerry Lee Lewises, Beatles... on and on.  The mother lode.  
               Rob is doing the best to control the onset of 
               hyperventilation.  He dares a glance over his shoulder to 
               her to see if this is a joke.

                                     WOMAN
                         What do you think?

                                     ROB
                         It's the best collection I've ever 
                         seen.

                                     WOMAN
                         Give me fifty bucks and they're all 
                         yours.

               Rob's face goes funny.  He looks around for a hidden camera.

                                     ROB
                         These are worth at least, I don't 
                         know --

                                     WOMAN
                         I know what they're worth.  Give me 
                         fifty and get them out.

                                     ROB
                         But you must have --

                                     WOMAN
                         I must have nothing.  Their my 
                         husband's.

                                     ROB
                         And you must not be getting along 
                         too well right now, huh?

                                     WOMAN
                         He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three-
                         year-old.  A friend of my daughter's.  
                         He had the fucking nerve to call me 
                         and ask me to borrow some money and 
                         I told him to fuck off, so he asked 
                         me to sell his singles collection 
                         and send him a check for whatever I 
                         go, minus a ten percent commission.  
                         Which reminds me.  Can you make sure 
                         you give me a five?  I want to frame 
                         it and put it on the wall.

                                     ROB
                         It must have taken him a long time 
                         to get them together.

                                     WOMAN
                         Years.  This collection is as close 
                         as he's ever come to an achievement.

               Rob looks back at the records but avoids the trance.

                                     ROB
                         Look.  Can I pay you properly?  You 
                         don't have to tell him what you got.  
                         Send him forty-five bucks and blow 
                         the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or 
                         something.

                                     WOMAN
                         That wasn't part of the deal.  I 
                         want to be poisonous but fair.

                                     ROB
                              (looking back at the 
                              records)
                         Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't 
                         want to be any part of this.

                                     WOMAN
                         Suit yourself.  There are plenty of 
                         others who will.

                                     ROB
                         That's why I'm trying to compromise.  
                         What about fifteen-hundred?  They're 
                         worth five times that.

                                     WOMAN
                         Sixty.

                                     ROB
                         Thirteen hundred.

                                     WOMAN
                         Seventy-five.

                                     ROB
                         Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest 
                         offer.

                                     WOMAN
                         And I won't take a penny over ninety.

               They start smiling at each other.

                                     WOMAN
                         With eleven hundred he could come 
                         home, and that's the last thing I 
                         want.

                                     ROB
                         I'm sorry but I think you better 
                         talk to someone else.

                                     WOMAN
                         Fine.

               Rob half stands, then drops again for one last lingering 
               look.

                                     ROB
                         Can I buy this Otis Redding single 
                         off you?

                                     WOMAN
                         Sure.  Ten cents.

                                     ROB
                         Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten 
                         dollars for this, and you can give 
                         the rest away for all I care.

                                     WOMAN
                         Okay.  Because you took the trouble 
                         to come up here.  And because you've 
                         got principles.  But that's it.  I'm 
                         not selling them to you one by one.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FANCY LINCOLN PARK TOWNHOUSE - DAY

               Rob comes down the stairs holding his single, and walks down 
               the street talking to camera.

                                     ROB
                         How come I end up siding with the 
                         bad guy, the man who ran off to 
                         Jamaica with some nymphette?  I just 
                         got left for someone else, so why 
                         can't I bring myself to feel whatever 
                         it is his wife is feeling?  All I 
                         can see is that guy's face when he 
                         gets that pathetic check in the mail 
                         for those records, and I can't help 
                         but feel desperately, painfully sorry 
                         for him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GREEN MILL - NIGHT

               The bar where Al Capone used to party, and it looks about 
               the same: colored lightbulbs, shadowboxes, deep plush booths 
               and a stage for jazz.  Rob slumps back in a booth, stirring 
               a drink with his finger.  After a beat, we hear a DOOR SLAM 
               off camera, and Rob looks up with a bit of fear.

               Heavy footsteps get louder and closer, until a shadow shrouds 
               Rob -- LIZ stands in front of him.

                                     LIZ
                         MOTHERFUCKER.

               She is enormous, and she is mad as hell.  Rob reflexively 
               shrinks.

                                     ROB
                         What's the -- hey, Liz --

                                     LIZ
                         -- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked 
                         to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and 
                         she gave me a little background.  
                         And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.

               She turns and stomps toward the door.  Rob gets up and 
               follows.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Rob comes out of the club and follows Liz.  She hears him 
               and turns on him, punctuating with a finger in his chest.

                                     LIZ
                         To think I sympathized with you for 
                         two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left 
                         him out of nowhere for the schmuck 
                         upstairs.  You let me believe that!

                                     ROB
                         It's true!

                                     LIZ
                         Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura 
                         pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat 
                         on her!  You borrowed money from her 
                         and never paid a dime back!  And 
                         then, just a few weeks ago, you told 
                         her you were unhappy with her and 
                         were "kind of looking around for 
                         somebody else!"

                                     ROB
                         Well she --

               She turns again and keeps walking, holding a defiant middle 
               finger over her shoulder as she fades down the street.

               INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

               Rob sits, rocking slightly with the movement of the train.

               He stares at an OLD COUPLE who do not speak to each other.

                                     ROB
                         She's right, of course.  I am a 
                         fucking asshole.  I did and said 
                         those things.  But before you judge, 
                         although you've probably already 
                         done so, go off for a minute and 
                         write down the top five worst things 
                         that you have done to your partner, 
                         even if -- especially if -- your 
                         partner doesn't know about them.  
                         Don't dress things up or try to 
                         explain them.  Just write them down 
                         in the plainest language possible...

               A LONG BEAT, even five or ten seconds.

                                     ROB
                         Pencils down.  Okay, so who's the 
                         asshole now?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

               Saturday.  For the first time we see the place kind of busy.  
               Rob watches the room.  Barry is toward the back, talking to 
               a CUSTOMER. "Cruel to Be Kind" by Nick Lowe plays.

                                     BARRY
                         It's almost impossible to find, 
                         especially on CD.  Yet another cruel 
                         trick on all of the dumbasses who 
                         got rid of their turntables.  But 
                         every other Echo and the Bunnymen 
                         album --

                                     CUSTOMER
                         I have all of the others.

                                     BARRY
                         Oh really.  Well what about the first 
                         Jesus and Mary Chain?

                                     CUSTOMER
                         They always seemed...

                                     BARRY
                         They always seemed what?  They always 
                         seemed really great, is what they 
                         always seemed.  They picked up where 
                         your precious Echo left off, and 
                         you're sitting here complaining about 
                         no more Echo albums.  I can't believe 
                         that you don't own that record.  
                         That's insane.

               He plucks it from the rack, and sticks it in the Customer's 
               hand, who regards it with a bit a of shame.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Well what about the new Echo --

                                     BARRY
                         Do not get ahead of yourself.

               DICK

               is listening to a female customer, but he doesn't hear her 
               voice.

               CUSTOMER - DICK'S POV

               The army bag with a red cross on it.  The ring-of-ivy tattoo 
               around the wrist.  The monkey boots.  The eye shadow.

               DICK

               thinking, calculating...

                                     DICK
                         The interesting thing about Green 
                         Day is that so much of their music 
                         is in truth directly influenced by, 
                         in my opinion, two bands.

                                     FEMALE CUSTOMER
                         The Clash.

                                     DICK
                         Correct.  The Clash.  But also the 
                         Stranglers.

                                     FEMALE CUSTOMER
                         Who?

                                     DICK
                         I think you would love the 
                         Stranglers...

               Dick pulls a Stranglers record and puts it on the stereo.  
               Her brow furrows, and then she smiles.

                                     FEMALE CUSTOMER
                         This sounds great.

               Dick smiles humbly.  Two people in the store turn and 
               approach.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Is this the new Green Day?

               BARRY still talking to his Customer, who now has several 
               CD's in his hand.  He looks at Barry with a mixture of hate 
               and adoration.

                                     BARRY
                         That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone 
                         you don't own fucking Blonde on 
                         Blonde.  What about Television?

                                     CUSTOMER
                         I have a television.

                                     BARRY
                         NO--!

               Barry adds more records to the Customer's stack.

               A FEW MINUTES LATER - ROB AND DICK

               stand behind the counter.  Rob holds a CD in his hand, and 
               surveys the roaming customers with a semi-serious air of 
               authority.

                                     ROB
                         I will now sell four copies of Cats 
                         and Dogs by the Royal Trux.

                                     DICK
                         Do it.  Do it.

               Rob pops the CD in and it begins to play... He stands there 
               with his arms folded, waiting.  After a moment, a Customer 
               approaches.

                                     CUSTOMER
                              (re: music)
                         What is this?

                                     ROB
                         It's the Royal Trux.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         It's great.

                                     ROB
                         I know.

               ROB'S POV

               of the room.  Something has caught his eye: a cropped head 
               with a leopard skin pattern surfaces and disappears, like 
               Nessie.

               Rob's face gets hot and mad.  He jumps out from behind the 
               counter.

                                     ROB
                         Dick, ring the man up...

               He moves like a cat through the crowd.  Justin sees him coming 
               and counters around the middle island and heads for the door.  
               Vince appears next to him, fiddling with his belt.

               He sees Rob now, and he and Justin bolt for the door.  Rob 
               doubles back.

                                     ROB
                         DICK!  THE DOOR!

               Dick sees Vince and Justin too late.  Rob is right behind 
               them and as they get out the door, he reaches... and comes 
               up with the back half of a skateboard.

               EXT. RECORD STORE - DAY

               Rob emerges behind them, Vince's skateboard in hand.  They 
               have enough distance to bolt, but they can't leave that board 
               behind.

                                     ROB
                         Okay, fuckos.  How much is this deck 
                         worth to you, and how many CD's did 
                         you rip off?  Can you do the math?

               Justin pulls two CD's out and slides them over to Rob.

                                     ROB
                              (to Vince)
                         And what about you, dork?

               Vince pulls about six, and puts them down in a neutral spot.

               Rob picks all of them up and starts looking through them.

               Dicks pokes his head out of the door.

                                     ROB
                         Dick, call the police, please.

               Vince and Justin look at each other.

                                     ROB

                         us and, like, think you know what we

                                     ROB

                         I can't frisk you but the cops can.

               Justin reaches down again into his baggy shorts and comes up 
               with a tattered old book, "How To Make A Record."  He tosses 
               it over.

                                     ROB
                         Jesus.  That thing's been in the 
                         bargain bin for six months!  Was it 
                         just your criminal nature or what?  
                         Hell, I would've given it to you for 
                         free.

                         We don't know how it works.  Nobody 
                         even knows, so we wanted to check it 
                         out in that mag.

               Rob snorts.

                                     JUSTIN
                         Like, do you know how to actually 
                         make a CD?

               Rob can't resist edifying them -- the curse of the 
               underappreciated expert.

                                     ROB
                         Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple.  
                         You make the tracks -- recording 
                         studio -- deliver them to the pressing 
                         plant where a master is cut, the 
                         master is then dubbed to submasters, 
                         which are the "mothers," as their 
                         called, for each press in the plant.  
                         You press the CD's or records, put 
                         in your cover art, and that's it.

                         Records are those big round black 
                         things, right?

                                     ROB
                         Fuck off.

               Rob turns to go back in the store.

                         Hey, can I have my board?

               Rob drops it and enters the store.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RECORD STORE - NIGHT - QUICK CUTS:

               Barry emerges from the back with three opened bottles of 
               beer as the last customer goes out the door... The three 
               lean against the bins, tired and smiling.

                                     BARRY
                              (to Rob)
                         What?

                                     ROB
                         What do you mean, "what?"

                                     BARRY
                         What are you snickering about?

                                     ROB
                         I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling.  
                         Because I'm happy.

                                     BARRY
                         What am I missing?  What do you have 
                         to be happy about?

                                     DICK
                         Well we rang $900 today.

                                     ROB
                         Yeah but more than that.  I'm happy 
                         because I'm proud of us.  Because 
                         although our talents are small and 
                         peculiar, we use them to their best 
                         advantage.

               Dick and Barry look at each other.  They almost know how to 
               take a compliment.

               EXT. RECORD STORE - NIGHT

               Rob, now alone, turns the sign from "open" to "closed" shuts 
               the door behind him, and pulls the gate across.  Laura appears 
               from the next doorway.  He jumps.

                                     ROB
                         Shit!

                                     LAURA
                         Hi.

                                     ROB
                         Hi.

                                     LAURA
                         I thought I could give you a lift 
                         back.

                                     ROB
                         Are you coming home?

                                     LAURA
                         Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your 
                         house to get some things.

                                     ROB
                         My house?

               Laura turns and begins walking.  Rob looks at camera.

                                     ROB
                         First of all: The money.  The money 
                         is easy to explain: She had it and I 
                         didn't, and she wanted to give it to 
                         me.  If she hadn't, I would have 
                         gone under.  I've never paid her 
                         back because I've never been able 
                         to, and just because she's took off 
                         and moved in with some Supertramp 
                         fan doesn't make me five grand richer.  
                         So that's the money --

               Laura's CAR HORN is heard.  He heads off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAURA'S CAR - NIGHT

               They move down the street, and it's a little tense.  Laura 
               pushes a tape into the stereo.  Art Garfunkel's "Bright Eyes" 
               begins to play.  Rob turns away from her and makes a face, 
               but she knows he's making it.

                                     LAURA
                         You can make all the faces you want.  
                         My car.  My car stereo.  My 
                         compilation tape.

               Rob tries not to speak, but --

                                     ROB
                         How can you like Art Garfunkel and 
                         Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you 
                         support the Israelis and the 
                         Palestinians.

                                     LAURA
                         It's not like saying that at all, 
                         actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and 
                         Marvin Gaye make pop records --

                                     ROB
                         -- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, 
                         his father shot him in --

                                     LAURA
                         -- whatever, and the Israelis and 
                         the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel 
                         and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a 
                         bitter territorial dispute, and the 
                         Israelis and the Palestinians are.  
                         Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --

                                     ROB
                         -- Alright, alright but --

                                     LAURA
                         -- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, 
                         anyway?

               He reels on her.

                                     ROB
                         Hey!  Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It 
                         Up!" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye 
                         is responsible for our entire 
                         relationship!

                                     LAURA
                         Is that right?  I'd like a word with 
                         him.

                                     ROB
                         But don't you remember?

                                     LAURA
                         I remember the song.  I just couldn't 
                         remember who sang it.

               Rob shakes his head in disbelief.

                                     LAURA
                         I can see why you prefer Gaye to 
                         Garfunkel.  I get it, really.  But 
                         there are so many other things to 
                         worry about.  They're only records, 
                         and if one is better than the other, 
                         well, who cares, besides you and 
                         Barry and Dick?  I mean really, who 
                         gives a flying fuck?

               Silence.

                                     ROB
                         You used to care more about things 
                         like Marvin Gaye than you do now.  
                         When I first met you, and I made you 
                         that tape, you loved it.  You said -- 
                         and I quote -- "It was so good it 
                         made you ashamed of your record 
                         collection."

                                     LAURA
                         Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, 
                         and I thought you were hot, and I 
                         didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted 
                         one.

                                     ROB
                         So you weren't interested in music 
                         at all?

                                     LAURA
                         Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am 
                         now.  That's life though, isn't it?

               The car slows, and Laura parks.

                                     ROB
                         But Laura... that's me.  That's all 
                         there is to me.  There isn't anything 
                         else.  If you've lost interest in 
                         that, you've lost interest in 
                         everything.

                                     LAURA
                         You really believe that?

               Laura turns the engine off and unbuckles her seat belt.

                                     ROB
                         Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- 
                         the apartment.  What else do I have, 
                         other than records and CDs?

                                     LAURA
                         And do you like it that way?

                                     ROB
                         Not really.

               She half smiles.

                                     LAURA
                         Let's go in.

               She gets out of the car.  Rob turns to camera, speaking 
               quietly and urgently.

                                     ROB
                         Okay, Number two: The stuff I told 
                         her about being unhappy in the 
                         relationship, about half looking 
                         around for someone else: She tricked 
                         me into saying it.  We were having 
                         this state of the union type 
                         conversation and she said, quite 
                         matter-of-factly, that we were pretty 
                         unhappy at the moment, and did I 
                         agree, and I said yes, and she asked 
                         whether I ever thought about meeting 
                         someone else.  So I asked her if she 
                         ever thought about it, and she said 
                         of course, so I admitted that I 
                         daydream about it from time to time.  
                         Now I see that what we were really 
                         talking about was her and Ian, and 
                         she suckered me into absolving her.  
                         It was a sneaky lawyer's trick, and 
                         I fell for it, because she's much 
                         smarter than me.

               He scrambles out of the car.

               INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

               The lock turns and Rob enters, holding the door for Laura 
               who slips by, her coat in her hands.  She glances down at 
               the table by the door and sees Ian's envelope.

                                     ROB
                         You can take it with you if you want.

               She slips it into her purse.  He stands facing her for a 
               moment, then crosses to her, takes her coat and tosses it on 
               a chair.  She opens the closet and takes out a big laundry 
               sack.

                                     LAURA
                         Have you tackled the Great 
                         Reorganization yet?

                                     ROB
                         Don't you think there are more 
                         important things to talk about than 
                         my record collection?

               She begins putting books and other things into the bag...

                                     LAURA
                         You bet.  I've been saying that for 
                         years.

               Having no comeback, Rob goes for the moral high ground.

                                     ROB
                         So.  Where have you been staying for 
                         the last week?

                                     LAURA
                         I think you know that.

                                     ROB
                         Had to work it out for myself, though, 
                         didn't I?

               Laura looks suddenly tired and sad, and looks away.

                                     LAURA
                         I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair 
                         to you.  That's why I came here to 
                         the store this evening.  I feel 
                         terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, 
                         you know.

                                     ROB
                         Good.
                              (beat)
                         So.  Is it my job?

                                     LAURA
                         What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is 
                         that what you think?  That your not 
                         big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, 
                         gimme a little credit, Rob.

                                     ROB
                         I don't know.  It's one of the things 
                         I thought of.

                                     LAURA
                         What were the others?

                                     ROB
                         Just the obvious stuff.

                                     LAURA
                         What's the obvious stuff?

                                     ROB
                         I don't know.

               She stands and walks toward the bathroom.

                                     LAURA
                         I guess it's not that obvious, then.

                                     ROB
                         No.

               As soon as she shuts the door behind her, he turns to camera.

                                     ROB
                         And number three: The Pregnancy.  I 
                         didn't know she was pregnant.  Of 
                         course I didn't.  She hadn't told me 
                         because I had told her I was... sort 
                         of... seeing somebody else.  We 
                         thought we were being very grown-up, 
                         but we were being preposterously 
                         naive, childish even, to think that 
                         one of us could fuck around and then 
                         own up to it while we were living 
                         together.  So -- I didn't find out 
                         about it 'til way later.  We were 
                         going through a good period and I 
                         made a crack about having kids and 
                         she burst into tears.  I made her 
                         tell me what it was all about, and 
                         she did.  I felt guilty and so I got 
                         angry.  She told me that at the time 
                         I didn't look like a very good long-
                         term bet.  That it was a hard decision 
                         and she didn't see any point in 
                         consulting me about it...  When the 
                         whole sorry tale comes out in a great 
                         big --

               We hear the bathroom door open.

                                     LAURA (O.S.)
                         What?

                                     ROB
                              (covering)
                         What, what?

               Laura comes out with a toiletry bag and places it by the 
               door.

                                     LAURA
                         Did you say something?

                                     ROB
                         No.  So.  Is it working out with 
                         Ian?

                                     LAURA
                         Rob.  Don't be childish.

                                     ROB
                         Why is that childish?  Your living 
                         with the guy!  I'm just asking how 
                         it's going.

                                     LAURA
                         I am not living with him.  I've just 
                         been staying with him for a few days 
                         until I work out what I'm doing.  
                         Look, this has nothing to do with 
                         anyone else.  You know that, don't 
                         you?  I left because we weren't 
                         exactly getting along, and we weren't 
                         talking about it.  And I suddenly 
                         realized that I like my job, and I 
                         like what my life is could be turning 
                         into, and that I'm getting to a point 
                         where I want to get my shit together 
                         and I can't really see that ever 
                         happening with you, and yeah, yeah, 
                         I sort of get interested in someone 
                         else, and that went further than it 
                         should have, so it seemed like a 
                         good time to go.  But I have no idea 
                         what will happen with Ian in the 
                         long run.  Probably nothing.

                                     ROB
                         Well then why don't you quit it while 
                         you seem to not be ahead?

               Laura rolls her eyes and head off into the bedroom with the 
               laundry bag.  Rob turns back to camera.

                                     ROB
                         -- When the whole sorry tale comes 
                         out in a great big lump like that, 
                         even the most shortsighted jerk, 
                         even the most self-deluding and self 
                         pitying of jilted, wounded lovers 
                         can see that there is some cause and 
                         effect going on here, that abortions 
                         and Ian and money and affairs all 
                         belong to, all deserve each other.

               Laura reappears, her bag half-filled with clothes, and goes 
               to the book shelves next to the records.  She starts topping 
               off the bag with books.

                                     LAURA
                         Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll 
                         get it together, you and me.  Maybe 
                         I'll never see either of you again.  
                         I don't know.  All I know is that 
                         it's not a good time to be living 
                         here.

                                     ROB
                         So, what, you haven't definitely 
                         decide to dump me?  There's still a 
                         chance we'll get back together?

                                     LAURA
                         I don't know.

                                     ROB
                         Well, if you don't know, there's a 
                         chance, right?  It's like, if someone 
                         was in the hospital and he was 
                         seriously ill and the doctor said, I 
                         don't know if he's got a chance of 
                         survival or not, then that doesn't 
                         mean the patient's definitely going 
                         to die, now does it?  It means he 
                         might live.  Even if it's only a 
                         remote possibility.

                                     LAURA
                         I suppose so.

                                     ROB
                         So we have a chance of getting back 
                         together again.

                                     LAURA
                         Oh, Rob, shut up.

                                     ROB
                         Hey, I just want to know where I 
                         stand.  What chance --

                                     LAURA
                         -- I don't fucking know what chance 
                         you fucking have!

               She abandons her attempt at packing.

                                     ROB
                         Well if you could tell me roughly it 
                         would help.

                                     LAURA
                         Okay, okay, we have a nine percent 
                         chance of getting back together.  
                         Does that clarify the situation?

                                     ROB
                         Yeah.  Great.

                                     LAURA
                              (shaking her head)
                         I'm too tired for this now.  I know 
                         I'm asking a lot, but will you take 
                         off for a while so I can get my stuff 
                         packed up?  I need to be able to 
                         think while I do it and I can't think 
                         while you're here.

                                     ROB
                         No problem.  If I can ask one 
                         question.

                                     LAURA
                         Fine.  One.

                                     ROB
                         It sounds stupid.

                                     LAURA
                         Nevermind.

                                     ROB
                         You won't like it.

                                     LAURA
                         Just ask it!

                                     ROB
                         Is it better?

                                     LAURA
                         Is what better?  Better than what?

                                     ROB
                         Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with 
                         him better?

                                     LAURA
                         Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really 
                         what's bothering you?

                                     ROB
                         Of course it is.

                                     LAURA
                         You really think it would make a 
                         difference either way?

                                     ROB
                         I don't know.

                                     LAURA
                         Well the answer is that I don't know 
                         either.  We haven't done it yet.

                                     ROB
                         Never?

                                     LAURA
                         I haven't felt like it.

                                     ROB
                         But not even before, when he was 
                         living upstairs?

                                     LAURA
                         No.  I was living with you, remember?  
                         We've slept together but we haven't 
                         made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell 
                         you one thing.  The sleeping together 
                         is better.

                                     ROB
                              (trying not to smile)
                         The sleeping together is better but 
                         not the sex because you haven't done 
                         it was him yet.

                                     LAURA
                         Will you please just go?

               INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Rob shuts the door behind him and does a crazy 
               Charleston/Cabbage-Patch/Boxstep/Touchdown dance of pure 
               elation, then bounces down the stairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Rob bounces along, a smile wider than we have seen yet.

               Maybe even jumping to touch an awning.  He lands and tells 
               us:

                                     ROB
                         I feel good!  I feel great!  I feel 
                         like a new man.  I feel so much 
                         better, in fact --

               INT. WEEDS BAR - NIGHT

               Rob moves through the room, still grinning a bit like a proud 
               new father, toward the table where Barry, Dick, Marie and T-
               Bone sit, listening to a story T-Bone is telling.

               Marie turns to him.

                                     ROB
                         Hi, Marie.

                                     MARIE
                         Everything go alright?

               Rob glances at Barry, who averts his gaze.

                                     ROB
                         She just wanted to pick up some stuff.  
                         No big thing.  A relief, actually.

                                     MARIE
                         God, I hate that time.  That pick up 
                         stuff time.  I just went through 
                         that before I came here.  You know 
                         that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I 
                         play?  That's about me and my ex 
                         dividing up our record collections.

                                     ROB
                         It's a great song.

                                     MARIE
                         Thank you.

               Rob glances at T-Bone, his mind calculating the new info.

                                     ROB
                         Is that why you came to Chicago in 
                         the first place?  Because of, you 
                         know, dividing up your record 
                         collection and stuff?

                                     MARIE
                         Yup.

               Marie slides closer, turning her back on the others.  The 
               loop is closed.

                                     ROB
                         You share a place with T-Bone?

                                     MARIE
                         No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I 
                         wouldn't want to listen to all that 
                         stuff happening on the other side of 
                         the bedroom wall.  I'm way to 
                         unattached for that.

                                     ROB
                         I understand completely.

               SERIES OF CUTS - ELAPSED TIME

               Rob and Marie lean in to each other, everyone else out of 
               focus.

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I 
                         agreed that what really matters is 
                         what you like, not what you are 
                         like...

               ROB AND MARIE - LATER

                                     MARIE
                         Yeah, but if you heard this band 
                         called the Crumblers, you'd --

                                     ROB
                         What do you mean, the Crumblers?  
                         You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's 
                         heard the Crumblers.  Except me.

                                     MARIE
                         Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought 
                         a used Blasters album in New York 
                         about ten years ago and somebody 
                         left a Crumblers single in it.  My 
                         everything changed for a couple of 
                         weeks.

               Rob glows --

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         Books, records, films -- these things 
                         matter.  Call me shallow but it's 
                         the damn truth, and by this measure 
                         I was having one of the best dates 
                         of my life.

               ROB AND MARIE

                                     ROB
                         Yeah, but you know what's his best 
                         film and nobody's even seen it?

                                     MARIE
                         The Conformist.

                                     ROB
                         Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!

                                     MARIE
                              (laughs)
                         You haven't even seen it!

                                     ROB
                         Nor have you!

               They just laugh and laugh --

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         References, titles, lyrics, flew and 
                         met each other in mid-air embraces.  
                         The evening goes with breathtaking 
                         precision.

               INT. MARIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Rob and Marie are kissing standing up.

                                     MARIE
                         Are you okay?

                                     ROB
                              (nodding)
                         Yes.  You?

                                     MARIE
                         For now.  But I wouldn't be if I 
                         thought this was the end of the 
                         evening.

                                     ROB
                         I'm sure it isn't.

                                     MARIE
                         Good.  In that case, I'll fix us 
                         something else to drink.  You sticking 
                         to the whiskey or you want coffee?

                                     ROB
                         Whiskey.

               Marie goes into the kitchen, and they keep talking around 
               the corner.

                                     MARIE
                         Tops off two whiskeys and starts 
                         into the other room where she sees 
                         Rob, standing and holding his jacket.

                                     ROB
                         I'd better go.  I gotta get up early.  
                         Go over to my parents'.

                                     MARIE
                         When I said before that I hoped it 
                         wasn't the end of the evening, I 
                         was, you know... talking about 
                         breakfast and stuff.

               She plants the whiskeys firmly on the coffee table.

                                     MARIE
                         I'd like it if you could stay the 
                         night.

                                     ROB
                              (as if it is dawning 
                              on him)
                         Oh, right.  Alright.

                                     MARIE
                         Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged 
                         you for a master of understatement, 
                         beating around the bush and all that 
                         buzz.

                                     ROB
                         I use it but I don't understand it 
                         when other people use it.

                                     MARIE
                         So you'll stay?

                                     ROB
                         Yeah.

                                     MARIE
                         Good.

               Marie picks up the drinks again and exits to the bedroom.

               Rob just stands there... and the LIGHTING CHANGES.

                                     ROB
                              (to camera)
                         Over nine million men in this country 
                         have slept with ten or more women.  
                         And do they all look like Richard 
                         Gere?  Are they all as rich as Bill 
                         Gates?  Charming as Oscar Wilde?  
                         Hell no.  Nothing to do with any of 
                         that.  Maybe fifty or so have one or 
                         more of these attributes, but that 
                         still leaves... well, about nine 
                         million, give or take fifty.  And 
                         they're just men.  Regular guys.  
                         We're just guys, because I, even I, 
                         am a member of this exclusive, nine 
                         million member club.  In fact, Marie 
                         is my seventeenth lover. "How does 
                         he do it?" you ask. "He wears bad 
                         sweaters, he's grumpy, he's broke, 
                         he hangs out with the Musical Moron 
                         Twins, and he gets to go to bed with 
                         a recording artist who looks like 
                         Susan Dey-slash-Meg Ryan.  What's 
                         going on?  Listen up, because I think 
                         I can explain, with all modesty aside: 
                         I ask questions.  That's it.  That's 
                         my secret.  It works precisely because 
                         that isn't how you're supposed to do 
                         it, if you listen to the collective 
                         male wisdom.  There are still enough 
                         old-style, big-mouthed, egomaniacs 
                         running around to make someone like 
                         me appear to be refreshingly 
                         different.  If you can't hack this 
                         simple strategy, there are some women 
                         out there, of course, who want to 
                         get pushed around, ignored and mowed 
                         over, but do you really want to be 
                         with them anyway?

               ...he goes through a door into the bedroom.  Marie is taking 
               off her earrings.

                                     ROB
                         Would you like me to turn the lights 
                         out?  Or would you like them on?

                                     MARIE
                         God, you ask a lot of questions.

               INT. MARIE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

               Rob stares at the ceiling as Marie sleeps on next to him.

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         But in the morning we were just two 
                         people, slightly hung-over, who were 
                         not in love, sharing the same space.  
                         And I feel...

               Rob looks to the camera.

                                     ROB
                         Sex is about the only grown-up thing 
                         that I know how to do; It's weird, 
                         then, that it's the only thing that 
                         can make me feel like a ten-year-
                         old.

               CUT BACK TO:

               EXT. MARIE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

               The two of them come out of the building and into the street.

                                     ROB
                         Which way are you going?

                                     MARIE
                              (points left)
                         That way.  You?

                                     ROB
                              (points right)
                         That way.

                                     MARIE
                         And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.

                                     ROB
                         I'll call you.

                                     MARIE
                              (smiles)
                         Right.

               INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

               Empty.  Dick prices records out on the floor.  Rob leans 
               against the register.  Barry sits on a stool next to him.

               They're top-fiving it.  Rob's heart isn't in it.

                                     ROB
                         Okay.  Top five side one track ones.  
                         Number one... "Janie Jones," the 
                         Clash, from The Clash.

                                     BARRY
                         Ehh.

                                     ROB
                         "Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, 
                         from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen 
                         Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.

                                     BARRY
                         Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough.  
                         Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?

                                     ROB
                         Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin 
                         Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," 
                         Radiohead, from OK Computer.

                                     BARRY
                              (sarcastic)
                         Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's 
                         sly declaration of new classic-status 
                         slipped into a list of old classics!  
                         Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't 
                         you make it more obvious than that?

                                     DICK
                         Rob.  Phone.
                              (whispers)
                         It's Laura.

               Rob springs to his feet, takes the phone and walks to the 
               end of the cord.  Deep breath.

                                     ROB
                         Hi.

               LAURA - INTERCUT

                                     LAURA
                         Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope 
                         of my receipts from last month and 
                         I'm thinking I didn't take them with 
                         me.  Have you seen them around?

                                     ROB
                         I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?

                                     LAURA
                         I'm sorry to call, but I need that 
                         stuff...

                                     ROB
                         Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at 
                         home.  I'll call you when I find it, 
                         and then we'll talk.

                                     LAURA
                         We'll talk some other time.

                                     ROB
                         Great... That's great.

               Rob comes back to the counter and hangs up the phone.

                                     BARRY
                         Rob!  What about the Beatles?  What 
                         about the fucking Rolling Stones?  
                         What about fucking... fucking...  
                         Beethoven?  Track one side one of 
                         the Fifth Symphony?  You shouldn't 
                         be allowed to run a record shop.  
                         You shouldn't be allowed to --

               SFX: BARRY'S VOICE FADES OUT.  Rob's mouth slacks and he 
               stares off.

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         There's something different about 
                         the sound of her voice... And what 
                         did she mean last night, she hasn't 
                         slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does 
                         "yet" mean, anyway?  "I haven't 
                         seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does 
                         that mean?  It means you're going to 
                         go, doesn't it?

               SFX: BACK TO THE ROOM.

                                     BARRY
                         -- You're like a little squirrel of 
                         music, storing away dead little nuts 
                         of old garbage music, musical lint, 
                         old shit, shit, shit --

                                     ROB
                         -- Barry, if I were to say to you I 
                         haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what 
                         would that mean?

               Barry just looks at Rob.  He pulls out a Game Boy and begins 
               playing.

                                     ROB
                         Just... come on, what would it mean 
                         to you?  That sentence? "I haven't 
                         seen Evil Dead II yet?"

                                     BARRY
                         To me, it would mean that you're a 
                         liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with 
                         Laura -- oops -- once with me and 
                         Dick.  We had that conversation about 
                         the possibilities of the guy making 
                         ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth 
                         Century.

                                     ROB
                         Yeah, yeah, I know.  But say I hadn't 
                         seen it and I said to you, "I haven't 
                         seen Evil Dead II yet," what would 
                         you think?

               Barry shuts off the Game Boy.

                                     BARRY
                         I'd think you were a cinematic idiot.  
                         And I'd feel sorry for you.

                                     ROB
                         No, but would you think, from that 
                         one sentence.  That I was going to 
                         see it?

                                     BARRY
                         I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling 
                         here.  I don't understand any part 
                         of this conversation.  You're asking 
                         me what I would think if you told me 
                         that you hadn't seen a film that 
                         you've seen.  What am I supposed to 
                         say?

                                     ROB
                         Just listen to me.  If I said to you --

                                     BARRY
                         "-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," 
                         yeah, yeah, I hear you --

                                     ROB
                         Would you... would you get the 
                         impression that I wanted to see it?

                                     BARRY
                         Well... you couldn't have been 
                         desperate to see it, otherwise you'd 
                         have already gone...

               Rob brightens.  Barry finally considers.

                                     BARRY
                         ...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you 
                         know what, I'd get the impression 
                         that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise 
                         you'd say you didn't really want to.

                                     ROB
                         But in your opinion, would I 
                         definitely go?

                                     BARRY
                         How the fuck am I supposed to know 
                         that?  You might get sick of people 
                         telling you you've really gotta go 
                         see the movie.

               Rob darkens.

                                     ROB
                         Why would they care?

                                     BARRY
                         Because it's a brilliant film.  It's 
                         funny, violent, and the soundtrack 
                         kicks fucking ass.

               They look at each other for a strange moment.

                                     BARRY
                         I never thought I would say this, 
                         but can I go work now?

                                     ROB
                         Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a 
                         customer in four hours.

               Barry stands.

                                     BARRY
                         Fine by me.  I still want pay to 7 
                         o'clock.

                                     ROB
                         Ha.

                                     DICK
                         I can't go to the club tonight, guys.

                                     BARRY
                         Why?

               Dick smiles sheepishly.

                                     BARRY
                         Who are you going to see?

                                     DICK
                         Nobody.

               Barry's eyes widen.

                                     BARRY
                         Rob, looky looky.  Dick!  Are you 
                         getting some?!

               Silence.

                                     BARRY
                         Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out 
                         on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie 
                         LaSalle, and the best-looking and 
                         most intelligent of all of us isn't 
                         getting anything at all.

                                     ROB
                         How do you know about that?

                                     BARRY
                         Oh come on, Rob.  What am I, an idiot?  
                         I'm more bothered by Dick's thing.  
                         How did this happen, Dick?  What 
                         rational explanation can there 
                         possibly be?  What's her name?

               Barry is going a little hard.  Dick shrinks back.

                                     DICK
                         Anna.

                                     BARRY
                         Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna 
                         Conda?

                                     DICK
                         Anna Moss.

                                     BARRY
                         Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing.  
                         The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green 
                         and furry?

                                     ROB
                         Shut the fuck up, Barry.

                                     BARRY
                         Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't 
                         you?  You two have to stick together 
                         now.  Boners United.  United in 
                         getting some.

               Barry picks up his bag and heads for the door.

                                     ROB
                         Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find 
                         true love someday.

                                     BARRY
                         Suck my ass.

                                     ROB
                         Terrific.

               Rob looks to Dick, who looks guilty.

                                     ROB
                         Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's 
                         an asshole.

                                     DICK
                         Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, 
                         Rob.

               Dick exits.  Rob watches the door close behind him, and looks 
               out over the empty store.  He TALKS TO CAMERA as he goes to 
               the light switches and begins shutting them off, one by one...

                                     ROB
                         Why does it bother Barry that much 
                         that Dick is seeing someone?  He's 
                         worried about how his life is turning 
                         out, and he's lonely, and lonely 
                         people are the bitterest of them 
                         all.

               ...until all the lights are out.  Rob's silhouette slips out 
               the door.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               A downpour is on.  Rob has himself wedged into a phone booth, 
               the little kind.

                                     ROB
                              (into phone)
                         Hi.  It's me... I'm right outside...  
                         I know... I know... I figured I could 
                         just walk you to the train and you 
                         could go... home.  Or whatever it 
                         is... No!  Of course not -- okay.  
                         I'll be right here.

               EXT. OFFICE BUILDING

               Rob stands under the overhang, watching Laura walk the long 
               hallway from the elevators to the door.

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         Laura looks different.  Less stress-
                         out, more in control.  Something has 
                         happened, maybe something real, or 
                         maybe something in her head.  Whatever 
                         it is, you can see that she thinks 
                         she's started out on some new stage 
                         in her life.  She hasn't.  I'm not 
                         going to let her.

               She emerges from doors, says something to him and they start 
               walking, sharing her umbrella.

               INT. OLDE TOWNE ALE HOUSE - NIGHT

               Rob and Laura have just sat down in a booth.

                                     LAURA
                         So, how are you?

                                     ROB
                         Have you slept with him yet?

                                     LAURA
                         I told you I slept with him.

                                     ROB
                         No, not -- I mean have you, you know --

                                     LAURA
                         Is that why you wanted to see me?

                                     ROB
                         I guess.

                                     LAURA
                         Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to 
                         say?

                                     ROB
                         I want you to say that you haven't, 
                         and I want it to be the truth.

               She looks past him.

                                     LAURA
                         I can't do that.

               She starts to say something else but Rob is up and out.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Rob pushes through the rush hour raincoats, seeming to be 
               the only one going his way.

               INT. ROB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Rob is soaking, slumped in his chair, his headphones on and 
               the stereo lit up behind him.  He talks a little loud, due 
               to the headphones.

                                     ROB
                         Tonight we're gonna figure out the 
                         five best angry songs about women.  
                         Let's go...

               He holds up a stack of records and CDs.

                                     ROB
                         You kind of have to start with Elvis 
                         Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" 
                         "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy 
                         Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records 
                         should be sealed in cases that say 
                         "in case of vicious betrayal, smash 
                         glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last 
                         Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson 
                         or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair 
                         track.  There are a couple to get 
                         angry at instead of being angry with.  
                         Some devil's advocate stuff.  The 
                         Silver Jews could be good when you're 
                         ready to start putting it all behind 
                         you...  But I think we're getting 
                         ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan.  
                         Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan 
                         would --The phone rings.  He pulls 
                         off his headphones and picks it up 
                         but says nothing.

                                     LAURA (O.S.)
                         You must have known it would happen.  
                         You couldn't have been entirely 
                         unprepared.  Like you said, I've 
                         been living with the guy.  We were 
                         bound to get around to it sometime.

               She laughs a bit nervously.

                                     LAURA (O.S.)
                              (machine)
                         And anyway, I keep trying to tell 
                         you, that's not really the point, is 
                         it?  The point is we got ourselves 
                         into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you 
                         there?  What are you thinking?

                                     ROB
                              (barely a whisper)
                         Nothing.

                                     LAURA (O.S.)
                         We can meet for another drink if you 
                         want.  So I can explain it better.  
                         I owe you that much.

                                     ROB
                         Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you 
                         know.

                                     LAURA (O.S.)
                         Will you call me?

                                     ROB
                         I don't have your number.

                                     LAURA (O.S.)
                         Call me at work.  We can arrange to 
                         meet properly.  I don't want this to 
                         be the last conversation we have.  I 
                         know what you're like.

                                     ROB
                         You do, huh.

               He hangs up and stares at the wall for awhile.  He gets a 
               beer from the fridge and sits back down.  He picks up the 
               phone and dials.

                                     ROB
                         Yes, a residence, a Mr. Ian Raymond, 
                         North Side... thank you.

               He writes down a number and hangs up, then looks to camera.

                                     ROB
                         You know the worst thing about being 
                         rejected?  The complete lack of 
                         control due to loss of control.

               He picks up the phone and dials, while continuing to talk to 
               us --

                                     ROB
                         If I could only control the when and 
                         how of being dumped by somebody then 
                         it wouldn't seem as bad.  But then, 
                         of course --

               He hangs up quickly --

                                     ROB
                         -- it wouldn't be rejection, would 
                         it?  It would be mutual consent.  It 
                         would be musical differences.  I 
                         would be pursuing a solo career.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. IAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Rob is tucked into a phone booth across the street.  He can 
               see the silhouettes of Laura and Ian in the window.  He picks 
               up the phone, drops a quarter, and hits the numbers hard as 
               he dials... a muffled male "hello?" is heard and Rob hangs 
               up.  He does it again.  And again.  And again.  Until --

               INT. IAN'S APARTMENT - INTERCUT

               Still an unpacked box or two, but it's set up: a framed 
               "Woodstock - The Movie" poster, stacks of new fiction, a 
               bread maker -- you get the idea.  Ian is shorter than Laura, 
               scruffier than Rob, and looks not unlike Leo Sayer/Steve 
               Guttenberg.  He stares at Laura with amused exasperation.

               She picks up the phone --

                                     LAURA
                         Hello.

                                     ROB
                         It's me.

                                     LAURA
                         I figured it was.
                              (re: traffic noise)
                         Where are you?

                                     ROB
                         I think the big question here is 
                         where are you, if you don't mind my 
                         saying so, and I think I know where 
                         you are.  You're running.  On the 
                         run.  You're running from a point 
                         that everyone hits in any 
                         relationship, and you're just going 
                         to hit it again with Ian but it's 
                         going to be with a World Music bunny-
                         rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing 
                         "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't 
                         really understand you, not the way 
                         that I do and will more in the future, 
                         and you'll have just wasted more 
                         time and arrive in the exact same 
                         place that you're in now, only later.  
                         And with... him.

                                     LAURA
                         I'm not -- hold on...

               She walks into another room, shutting the door behind her.

               On a bookshelf is a picture of a younger Ian in a tunic, 
               emoting on some college stage.  She turns it face down.

                                     LAURA
                         I'm not in love with Ian, okay?

               She wanders over to the window, looking out absently.  She 
               sees Rob down there at the phone booth.

                                     ROB
                         Are you still in love with me?

                                     LAURA
                         Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to 
                         you later.

                                     ROB
                         Think about what I said.  I mean, if 
                         you want to experiment, or whatever --

                                     LAURA
                              (indignant)
                         I'm not experimenting.  Why don't 
                         you go experiment.

                                     ROB
                         I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I 
                         love you.

                                     LAURA
                         You don't ever think about other 
                         people?

                                     ROB
                         No... not really... I mean, I think 
                         about it... but no, I don't really 
                         think about it.

                                     IAN (O.S.)
                              (through the door)
                         Laura?  Are you okay?

                                     LAURA
                              (covering the 
                              mouthpiece, to Ian)
                         I am fine...
                              (to Rob)
                         I gotta go.  Goodbye.

               She clicks the phone off.  The door cracks and Ian sticks 
               his head in.

                                     IAN
                         Are you sure you're okay?

               She moves past him back into the apartment.

                                     LAURA
                         Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.

                                     IAN
                         You look upset.

                                     LAURA
                         I'm upset, but I'm fine.

                                     IAN
                         Maybe I should talk to him.

                                     LAURA
                         Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.

                                     IAN
                         Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.

                                     LAURA
                         Nothing to resolve, Ian.  Let's get 
                         a drink.

               She grabs her coat and opens the door.  The phone begins to 
               ring.

                                     LAURA
                              (waving toward the 
                              door)
                         C'mon, c'mon.

               EXT. IAN'S APARTMENT

               Rob stands on the sidewalk in the rain, Ian's building behind 
               him and down a few doors.

                                     ROB
                         I wish I could be one of those guys 
                         who doesn't call, the kind of guy 
                         that gets broken up with and appears 
                         not to give a shit.  He doesn't make 
                         an ass out of himself, or frighten 
                         anybody, and this week I've done 
                         both of those things.  One day Laura's 
                         sorry and guilty, and the next she's 
                         scared and angry, and I'm entirely 
                         responsible for the transformation, 
                         and it doesn't do my case any good 
                         at all.  I'd stop if I could but I --

               His head turns at the sharp SOUND of a door opening -- Ian 
               and Laura are coming out of the building.  He jumps behind a 
               tree, peering around it as they fade down the street.

               INT. GREEN MILL - NIGHT

               Rob sits alone, nursing a scotch.  Rob looks up into the 
               mirror behind the bar and sees an older woman, MRS. ASHWORTH, 
               sitting alone a few stools down.

                                     ROB
                         Do I know you?

                                     ALISON'S MOM
                         I don't know.

               Rob remembers, and his gaze has a new found seriousness.

                                     ROB
                         You're Mrs. Ashworth.  I'm Rob.  An 
                         old boyfriend of you're daughter's.

               Alison's Mom's brow furrows and her face darkens.

                                     ROB
                         Alison's.

                                     ALISON'S MOM
                         Really.

                                     ROB
                         Long time ago.  I was just thinking 
                         about her.  I was her first boyfriend.

               ALISON'S MOM What did you say your name was?

                                     ROB
                         Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior 
                         high...

                                     ALISON'S MOM
                         I hate to quibble with you Rob, but 
                         she married her first boyfriend.  
                         Kevin Bannister.

                                     ROB
                         You gotta be kidding me.

                                     ALISON'S MOM
                         That's right.  Kevin.  She's Mrs. 
                         Kevin Bannister.  She lives in 
                         Australia.

               She doesn't seem too happy that Alison lives in Australia.

               Rob is thrilled.

                                     ROB
                         Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior 
                         high sweetheart... What chance would 
                         I have had against that?  None, no 
                         chance.  That's just fate.

                                     ALISON'S MOM
                         I beg your pardon?

                                     ROB
                         Technically, I'm number one.  I went 
                         out with her a week before Kevin 
                         did.  Her first boyfriend.  Me.

               She stands.

                                     ALISON'S MOM
                         Well Rob, I'll tell her you said 
                         hello.  If she remembers you.

               Alison's Mom strolls out.

                                     ROB
                              (calling after her)
                         I think she will.  But it's okay if 
                         she doesn't.  I'm fine now.

               Rob turns to the bartender, smiling giddily.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Rob walks through Uptown toward the train.

                                     ROB
                         And suddenly I am fine.  For the 
                         moment there is not one extra pound 
                         on my chest.  This is fate.  Alison 
                         married Kevin.  You get it?  That's 
                         fate.  That's got nothing to do with 
                         me, that is beyond my control, beyond 
                         my fault...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ROB IN HIS CHAIR

               Rob into camera, digging through a box, fishing through 
               pictures and letters, concert tickets and other mementos.

               He begins to assemble a small pile of pictures of women.

                                     ROB
                         I want to see the others on the Big 
                         Top Five.  Penny, who wouldn't let 
                         me touch her and then went and had 
                         sex with that bastard Chris Thompson.  
                         Sarah, my partner in rejection who 
                         rejected me, and Charlie, who I have 
                         to thank for everything: my great 
                         job, my sexual self-confidence, the 
                         works.  There's this Springsteen 
                         song, "Bobby Jean," off Born in the 
                         USA.  About a girl who's left town 
                         years before and he's pissed off 
                         because he didn't know about it, and 
                         he wanted to say goodbye, tell her 
                         that he missed her, and wish her 
                         good luck.  Well, I'd like my life 
                         to be like a Springsteen song.  Just 
                         once.  I know I'm not born to run, 
                         and it's clear that Halsted Street 
                         is nothing like Thunder Road, but 
                         feelings can't be that different, 
                         can they?  I'd like to call up all 
                         those people and ask them how they 
                         are and whether they've forgiven me, 
                         and tell them that I have forgiven 
                         them.  And say good luck, goodbye.  
                         No hard feelings.  And then they'd 
                         feel good and I'd feel good.  We'd 
                         all feel good.  I'd feel clean, and 
                         calm, and ready to start again.  
                         That'd be good.  Great even.

               INT. ROB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Rob holds an old crumpled address book in one hand and the

                         Penny Hardwick?  This is Rob Gordon... 
                         From High school... Yeah.

               EXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

               Rob and Penny walk out of the theater mid-conversation.

               They look happy as they walk down the street.

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         Penny is as beautiful as she was in 
                         high school when I broke it off with 
                         her because she wouldn't sleep with 
                         me.  In fact she's even more 
                         beautiful, and really grown into 
                         herself.

               INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               A mid-scale trattoria.  Rob and Penny sit at table laughing 
               and talking.  If we didn't know better we might think there 
               is chemistry.

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         She tells me about her life, and I 
                         get it.  And I tell about mine, and 
                         she's interested.

               CLOSE-UP -- ROB TALKING

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         And then, with no real explanation, 
                         I just launch into it: I tell her 
                         about Laura and Ian, and Charlie and 
                         Marco, and about Alison Ashworth and 
                         Kevin Bannister...

                                     ROB
                         ...and you wanted to sleep with Chris 
                         Thompson instead of me, and... and I 
                         thought you could help me understand 
                         why it keeps happening, why I'm doomed 
                         to be left, doomed to be rejected 
                         and...

               He slows to a stop.  We see Penny as she goes from happy to 
               livid.

                                     PENNY
                         Rob.  I was crazy about you.  I wanted 
                         to sleep with you, one day, but not 
                         when I was sixteen.  When you broke 
                         up with me -- when you broke up with 
                         me -- because I was, to use your 
                         charming expression, tight, I cried 
                         and cried and I hated you.  And then 
                         that little shitbag asked me out, 
                         and I was too tired to fight him 
                         off, and it wasn't rape because I 
                         said okay, but it wasn't far off.  
                         And I didn't have sex with anyone 
                         else until after college because I 
                         hated it so much.  And now you want 
                         to have a chat about rejection?  
                         Well, fuck you, Rob.

               Penny stands and leaves.  Rob just sits.

                                     ROB
                              (cheerful)
                         So that's another one I don't have 
                         to worry about.  I should have done 
                         this years ago.

               Rob indicates to an off-screen waiter.

                                     ROB

                         Sarah's easy to find.  She still 
                         sends me Christmas cards with her 
                         address and phone number on them.  
                         They never say anything else, except 
                         for "Merry Christmas, Love Sarah." I 
                         send her equally blank ones back.

               INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHT - ROB'S POV

               of a door opening, revealing Sarah, a few years older but 
               still pretty in her mousey way.  She looks at Rob with a bit 
               too much in her eyes.

               INT. CARMEN'S PIZZA - NIGHT

               Rob and Sarah face each other over a half-eaten pizza.

                                     SARAH
                         I can't believe I left you for him... 
                         Crazy.

               Sarah looks down at her plate, shaking her head, blushing.

               Rob looks uncomfortable.  This is more than he was looking 
               for.

                                     ROB
                         Well... probably seemed like a good 
                         idea at the time.

               She looks up again...

                                     SARAH
                         Probably.  I can't remember why, 
                         though.

               ...and back down again.

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         I haven't got the heart for the 
                         rejection conversation.  There are 
                         no hard feelings here, and I am glad 
                         that she ditched me, and not the 
                         other way around.

               INT./EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Sarah, in the doorway, smiles painfully.  It's clear she 
               doesn't want to shut the door, but she does.  Rob turns and 
               walks down the hall toward the door to the street as he talks 
               TO CAMERA.

                                     ROB
                         I could've ended up having sex back 
                         there.  And what better way to 
                         exorcize rejection demons than to 
                         screw the person who rejected you, 
                         right?  But you wouldn't be sleeping 
                         with a person.  You'd be sleeping 
                         with a whole sad single-person 
                         culture.  It'd be like sleeping with 
                         Talia Shire in "Rocky" if you weren't 
                         Rocky.

               CLOSE-UP: PHONE BOOK

               as Rob's finger moves down the column, then stops.

               Rob looks up with a little shock, almost recoiling from the 
               phone book.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Charlie's in the fucking phone book.  
                         She has come to assume such an 
                         importance, I feel she should be 
                         living on Mars.  She's an 
                         extraterrestrial, a ghost, a myth, 
                         not a person with an answering 
                         machine, in the phone book... I call 
                         and hang up on her voice mail a couple 
                         of times, then I leave my name and 
                         number and throw in a "long time-no-
                         see..." I don't hear anything back 
                         from her for a few days.  Now that's 
                         more like it, if you're talking about 
                         rejection: someone who won't even 
                         return your phone messages a decade 
                         after she rejected you.

               INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

               Rob hears the door open as he stocks shelves, and turns.

               It's Ian.  Rob reacts, gunfighter eyes.

                                     ROB
                         Can I help you?

                                     IAN
                         Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray.  
                         Ian.

               Rob says nothing.

                                     IAN
                         I thought maybe we should talk.  
                         Sort a few things out?

               Rob is disoriented on the way to angry.  Dick and Barry's 
               ears perk up.

                                     ROB
                         What needs sorting out?

                                     IAN
                         Come on, Rob.  My relationship with 
                         Laura has obviously disturbed you a 
                         great deal.

                                     ROB
                         Funnily enough I haven't been too 
                         thrilled about it.

                                     IAN
                         We are not talking jokey 
                         understatement here, Rob.  We're 
                         talking actionable harassment.  Ten 
                         phone calls a night, hanging around 
                         outside my house...

                                     ROB
                         Yeah, well, I've stopped all that 
                         now.

                                     IAN
                         We've noticed and we're glad.  But, 
                         you know... how are we going to make 
                         peace here?  We want to make things 
                         easier for you.  What can we do?  
                         Obviously I know how special Laura 
                         is, and I know things can't be good 
                         for you at the moment.  I'd hate it 
                         if I lost her.  But I'd like to think 
                         that if she decided she didn't want 
                         to see me anymore, I'd respect that 
                         decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?

                                     ROB
                         Yeah.

                         Good.  So shall we leave it at that 
                         then?

                                     ROB
                         I dunno.

                         I've already left it, you pathetic 
                         rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli 
                         stink out of my store.

               Ian leaves, rattled.

                         We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.

               Rob springs toward Ian, but Barry blocks his way.  Dick helps 
               hold Rob back.

                                     DICK
                         Don't do it, Rob!

                         He's not worth it!

               Rob reaches a pointed finger over Barry's shoulder.

                                     ROB
                         Leave town.  Leave the country, you 
                         little bitch, because you're gonna 
                         look back on walks by the house and 
                         ten phone calls a night as a golden 
                         age.  Get ready, mutherfucker.

               Ian trips backward and scurries out the door.

               Rob, Dick, and Barry just beating the living shit out of 
               Ian, Rodney King style.  Ian lies on the floor trying to 
               cover himself.  Dick, already out of breath, breaks from the 
               pack and jerks the air conditioner from the wall and hefts 
               it over his head, preparing for the death blow.

                         Think about it, Rob.

               Ian walks out.  Rob looks spent.  He shuffles toward the 
               back of the store.

               INT. RECORD STORE - BACK ROOM - DAY

               Rob is laying on his back, staring at the ceiling.  Dick

                                     ROB
                         Hello?

               INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - INTERCUT

               Charlie looks even better than when we saw her in college.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call.  
                         In LA on business.  You know how it 
                         gets.

                                     ROB
                         Yeah, sure...

                                     CHARLIE
                         Good.  Great.  Yeah... Wow.  Rob 
                         Gordon.  Seems like a 100 million 
                         years ago now.

                                     ROB
                         Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are 
                         you?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Fantastic but I'm a little busy right 
                         now.  Listen.  Do you want to come 
                         to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some 
                         friends over and I need a spare man.  
                         Are you a spare man?

                                     ROB
                         Uh...yes, at the moment.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.

               INT. CHARLIE'S DINING ROOM

               SERIES OF SHOTS OVER THE COURSE OF DINNER

               Sexy version of a hip wine commercial: a small mid-thirties 
               crowd of successful, beautiful people.  Rob sits at the table 
               silently as the other guests talk and eat.  Rob's central 
               activities are working his way through maybe a few too many 
               wines making sure his cigarette smoke doesn't get in anyone's 
               face.  His eyes occasionally dart around the table, but he 
               says nothing to anyone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHARLIE'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

               Rob is a little too settled into the couch, somewhat bleary.

               Everyone gone but the two of them, Charlie plops down into a 
               chair across from Rob.

                                     ROB
                         Hey Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hey Rob.

                                     ROB
                         Why did you break up with me for 
                         Marco?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (on her feet)
                         Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going 
                         through one of those what-does-it- 
                         all-mean things.

                                     ROB
                         Huh?

                                     CHARLIE
                         There's been a rash of them, recently.  
                         I find it a little unnerving.  In 
                         fact Marco called a few months back, 
                         and he wanted to see me, and rehash 
                         the past as they say, and I wasn't 
                         really up for it.  Do all men go 
                         through this?

                                     ROB
                         C'mon, just answer the question.  
                         You can say what you like.  What the 
                         hell?

               Charlie looks off at a corner of the ceiling, musters a look 
               of "contemplation."

                                     CHARLIE
                         It's all kind of lost in the... in 
                         the dense mists of time now... It 
                         wasn't that I really liked Marco 
                         more.  In fact I thought you were 
                         more, shall we say, attractive than 
                         him.  It was just that he knew he 
                         was good-looking and you didn't, and 
                         that made a difference somehow.  You 
                         used to act as if I was weird for 
                         wanting to spend time with you, and 
                         that got kind of beat, if you know 
                         what I mean.  Your self-image started 
                         to rub off on me and I ended up 
                         thinking that I was strange.  And I 
                         knew that you were kind and 
                         thoughtful... you made me laugh, and 
                         I dug the way you got consumed by 
                         things you loved... and Marco seemed 
                         a bit more, I don't know, glamorous?  
                         More sure of himself?
                              (pause)
                         Less hard work, because I felt like 
                         I was dragging you around, sort of.
                              (pause)
                         A little sunnier.  Sparkier.
                              (pause)
                         I don't know.  You know what people 
                         are like at that age.  They make 
                         very superficial judgements.  Do you 
                         think that's superficial?  He was a 
                         clown, if it's any consolation.

                                     ROB
                         Did you tell that to Marco when he 
                         did his what-does-it-all-mean thing 
                         with you?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Oh God, no.  I didn't want to hurt 
                         his feelings.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Rob to camera.

                                     ROB
                         I wanted the works and I got it.  
                         None of Alison Ashworth's fate, none 
                         of Sarah's rewriting of history, and 
                         no reminder that I'd got all the 
                         rejection stuff a little backward, 
                         like I did about Penny.  Just a 
                         perfectly clear explanation of why 
                         some people have it and some don't.  
                         All I've learned from Charlie is 
                         that maybe my one talent, my genius 
                         for being normal, is a little 
                         overrated.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

               Rob enters the already open store, in a bad mood, to find 
               Barry putting up a poster.  It reads:

               "BARRYTOWN/appearing Saturday night/Bucktown Pub"

                                     BARRY
                         Hey.

                                     ROB
                         What the fuck is that?

                                     BARRY
                         My band.

                                     ROB
                         What band?

                                     BARRY
                         The band that found me and asked me 
                         to join.

                                     ROB
                         You are not in a band, Barry.  You 
                         are not a musician.  And no posters.

                                     BARRY
                         Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really 
                         appreciate it.

                                     ROB
                         Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no 
                         end to your arrogance?

                                     BARRY
                         I didn't make up the name.  It's the 
                         Steely Dan song.  And it was in The 
                         Commitments.

                                     ROB
                         You can't be called Barry and sing 
                         in a group called Barrytown.

                                     BARRY
                         They were fucking called that before 
                         I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my 
                         idea.

                                     ROB
                         That's why you got the gig, isn't 
                         it?

               Barry says nothing.

                                     ROB
                         Isn't it?

                                     BARRY
                         That was one of the reasons they 
                         asked me to join originally, yes.  
                         But --

                                     ROB
                         Great!  That's fucking great!  They 
                         only asked you to sing because of 
                         your name!  You can stick it above 
                         the browser racks over there.

                                     BARRY
                         How many tickets can I put you down 
                         for?

                                     ROB
                         None.  Christ!

                                     BARRY
                         You're not even coming?

                                     ROB
                         Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look 
                         like I'd want to listen to some 
                         terrible experimental racket played 
                         in some hideous cave?  Where is it?
                              (looks at the poster)
                         The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!

                                     BARRY
                         So much for friends, then.  You're a 
                         bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?

                                     ROB
                         Bitter?  Because I'm not in Barrytown?  
                         You should be shot like a lame horse, 
                         you jerk.
                              (re: the poster)
                         Just keep that out of my window.

               INT. ROB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Rob opens the door to find Laura filling a duffel bag in the 
               living room.

                                     LAURA
                         I called and called but you were 
                         out.  I thought I'd be gone before 
                         you got back.

                                     ROB
                         Is that the last of it?

                                     LAURA
                         Yep.  I might have missed some stuff.  
                         I'm so used to some things being 
                         here that I don't even notice them.

                                     ROB
                         Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?

                                     LAURA
                         He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe 
                         he went to the store.  I'm mortified, 
                         actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had 
                         no right to do that, and I told him 
                         so.

                                     ROB
                         It was kind of funny.

               They smile.

                                     LAURA
                         I'm sure.

                                     ROB
                         You still together?  Going all right?

                                     LAURA
                         I don't really want to talk about 
                         it, to be honest.

                                     ROB
                         That bad, eh?

                                     LAURA
                         You know what I mean.

               Rob flops onto the couch and surveys the room.

                                     ROB
                         It's a dump, isn't it?

               Laura sits down, on the other side of the couch.

                                     LAURA
                         Fix it up.  It'll make you feel 
                         better.

                                     ROB
                         I'll bet you can't remember what you 
                         were doing here, can you?  I mean, 
                         how much are you making now?  Sixty?  
                         Seventy?  And you were living in 
                         this shitty place.

                                     LAURA
                         You know I didn't mind.  And it's 
                         not as if Ray's place is any better.

                                     ROB
                         I'm sorry, but can we get this 
                         straight?  What is his fucking name, 
                         Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?

                                     LAURA
                         Ray.  I hate Ian.

                                     ROB
                         I hate him too.  So I just call him 
                         "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis 
                         the Sissyboy."

               Laura starts laughing, laying on the couch on her back, very 
               close to Rob.  Rob leans in, sort of looking down into her 
               eyes.

                                     ROB
                         This is where you're supposed to say 
                         that you haven't laughed this much 
                         in ages, and then you see the error 
                         of your ways.

                                     LAURA
                         You make me laugh much more than Ray 
                         does, if that's what you're getting 
                         at.  But I already knew you could 
                         make me laugh.  It's everything else 
                         I don't know about.

                                     ROB
                         You know I'm a good person.

                                     LAURA
                         Mmm hmm.

                                     ROB
                         You know that I can cook my ass off 
                         when I feel like it.

                                     LAURA
                         Oh ho, so very infrequently.

               He moves a little closer.

                                     ROB
                         You know my favorite beverage is 
                         your bath water.

               She laughs.  He moves in, not really trying to kiss her but 
               leaving the door open for her... She almost goes for it, but 
               instead gets to her feet.

                                     LAURA
                         Time to go.

               She goes to her bags.  Rob points to a pile of CDs.

                                     ROB
                         Don't forget your CDs.

                                     LAURA
                         Those aren't mine.

                                     ROB
                         Sure they are.

                                     LAURA
                         They're not really, though, are they?  
                         I know you bought them for me, and 
                         that was really sweet of you, but 
                         that was when you were trying to 
                         turn me into you.  I can't take them, 
                         I know they'd just sit around staring 
                         at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by 
                         them and... they don't fit in with 
                         the rest of what's mine, do you 
                         understand?  That Sting record you 
                         bought for me... that was a present 
                         for me.  I like Sting and you hate 
                         him.  But the rest of this stuff...
                              (bending down to the 
                              pile)
                         Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram 
                         Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't 
                         know these people.  I...

                                     ROB
                         Okay, okay.  I get the picture.

                                     LAURA
                         I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I 
                         don't know, there's a lesson here 
                         somewhere, and I want to make sure 
                         you get it.

                                     ROB
                         I got it.  You like Sting but you 
                         don't like Gram Parsons, because 
                         you've never heard of him.

                                     LAURA
                         You're being deliberately obtuse.

                                     ROB
                         I guess I am.

                                     LAURA
                         Well, think about it.

               She hefts the duffel bag, opens the door and exits.

                                     ROB
                         Fuck.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ROB IN HIS CHAIR

               Rob to the camera.

                                     ROB
                         What's the point in thinking about 
                         it?  If I ever have another 
                         relationship, I'll buy her, whoever 
                         she is, stuff that she oughta like 
                         but doesn't know about -- that's 
                         what new boyfriends are for.  And 
                         hopefully I won't borrow money from 
                         her, or have an affair, and she won't 
                         need to have an abortion or run away 
                         with the neighborhood, and then there 
                         won't be anything to think about.  
                         Laura didn't run off with Ian because 
                         I bought her CDs she wasn't that 
                         keen on, and to pretend otherwise is 
                         just... just... psychowank.  If she 
                         thinks that, then she's missing the 
                         Brazilian rainforest for the twigs.  
                         If I can't buy the Plastic People of 
                         the Universe's first album for new 
                         girlfriends, then I might as well 
                         give up, because I'm not sure I know 
                         how to do anything else.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET - MORNING

               Rob walks toward the record store, and looks into a Starbuck's 
               window he passes.  He stops for a second, seeing Ian at the 
               counter, chatting merrily with the espresso jockey.  Rob 
               keeps walking.

               INT. RECORD STORE - BACK ROOM - DAY

               Rob tosses his coat down and picks up the phone and dials...

                                     LAURA (O.S.)
                              (muffled, almost a 
                              whisper)
                         Hello.

                                     ROB
                         Hey, how ya doin'?

               No answer.

                                     ROB
                         Guess who I just saw, right by my 
                         store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, 
                         huh?

                                     LAURA (O.S.)
                         I can't talk right now.

                                     ROB
                         God, that's a cold and a half.  Maybe 
                         you should bet back in bed.

               No response.

                                     ROB
                         Are you alright?

                                     LAURA (O.S.)
                         Pigsty.

                                     ROB
                         Don't worry about it.  Just get into 
                         bed.  Worry about that when you're 
                         better.

                                     LAURA (O.S.)
                         Pig died.

                                     ROB
                         Who the fuck's Pig?

                                     LAURA (O.S.)
                              (louder)
                         My dad died.  My dad, my dad.

               She hangs up.

               FRONT ROOM

               Rob comes out of the back, in a daze.  Dick and Barry notice.

                                     BARRY
                         What's up?

                                     ROB
                         Laura.  Her dad died.

                                     BARRY
                         Ooh.  Drag.

               Barry goes back to his comic book and burrito.

                                     DICK
                         I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --

                                     ROB
                         You're a horrible person, Barry.  I 
                         mean it.

               Barry looks up at him, shrugs, then gets an idea.

                                     BARRY
                         Hey.  Top five songs about death.  A 
                         Laura's Dad Tribute list.

               Nobody can help thinking about it.

                                     BARRY
                         Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." 
                         The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle 
                         and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," 
                         Jan and Dean...

                                     DICK
                         Did you know that after that song 
                         was recorded, Jan himself crashed 
                         his --

                                     BARRY
                         -- It was Dean, you fucking idiot.

                                     ROB
                         It was Jan, and it was a long time 
                         after--

                                     BARRY
                         Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love 
                         Her." That'd bring the house down.  
                         Laura's mom could sing it.

                                     ROB
                         Fuck off, Barry.

                                     BARRY
                         I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness.  
                         And "You Can't Always Get What You 
                         Want."

                                     ROB
                         Because it's in The Big Chill.

                                     BARRY
                         Haven't seen it.

                                     ROB
                         Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence 
                         Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.

                                     BARRY
                         Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about 
                         that.  I wasn't biting the idea.

                                     ROB
                         Not really.

               The phone RINGS.  Rob picks it up.

               INTERCUT - IAN'S APARTMENT

               Laura is curled up on the couch.  Dick and Barry keep listing.

                                     LAURA
                         I'm sorry.

                                     ROB
                         No, no.  When are you going home?

                                     LAURA
                         In a minute.  When I get it together.

                                     BARRY
                              (to Dick)
                         What about Sabbath?  Or Nirvana?  
                         They're into death.

               Rob tries to signal to them to shut up but they don't see 
               him.  He moves as far away as the cord will let me.

                                     ROB
                         Can I do anything?

                                     DICK
                         "Abraham, Martin, and John." That's 
                         a nice one.

                                     BARRY
                         "Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz. 
                         "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus.  
                         It's got that creepy Halloween 
                         feeling.

                                     LAURA
                         No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to 
                         the funeral.  It's on Friday.

                                     ROB
                         Me?

                                     LAURA
                         My dad liked you.  And Mom never 
                         told him we'd split, because he wasn't 
                         up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I 
                         don't really understand it.  I think 
                         she thinks he'll be able to see what's 
                         going on.  It's like...
                              (small laugh)
                         He's been through so much, what with 
                         dying and everything, that she doesn't 
                         want to upset him any more than she 
                         has to.

                                     ROB
                         Do you want me to be there?

                                     LAURA
                         I don't care.  As long as you don't 
                         expect me to hold your hand.

               Rob is silent.

                                     LAURA
                         Look, are you coming or not?

                                     ROB
                         Yes, of course.

                                     LAURA
                         Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows 
                         where to go and everything... I don't 
                         have time to talk, Rob.  I've got 
                         too much to do.

                                     ROB
                         Sure.  I'll see you on Friday.

               She hangs up.

                                     BARRY
                              (to the tune of "Candle 
                              In the Wind")
                         "Goodbye Laura's dad/blah blah la di 
                         da di da/
                              (belting it out)
                         Seems to me/you lived your life/like 
                         a dentist in the wind...

               Rob stomps toward Barry, who jumps over the counter to keep 
               singing --

               INT. LIZ'S CAR - DAY

               THUNDERCLAPS and RAIN.  Rob is in a somber suit, looking 
               through the windshield wipers as Liz drives.

                                     ROB
                         So the minister says nice things, 
                         and then, what, we all troop outside 
                         and they bury him?

                                     LIZ
                         It's a crematorium.

                                     ROB
                         You're kidding.  A crematorium?  
                         Jesus.

                                     LIZ
                         What difference does it make?

                                     ROB
                         Is Ray going?

                                     LIZ
                         No.  They don't know him.  And Ken 
                         liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for 
                         your benefit, you know.  It's like 
                         everybody's a supporting actor in 
                         the film of your life story.

                                     ROB
                         Isn't that how it is for everybody?

               INT. CHAPEL TWO

               Liz and Rob sit in the back of the dark, smallish 
               nondenominational room.  At the front is a coffin, resting 
               on a stand.  Laura, her younger sister JO, and her mother 
               sit in the front row, listening to the MINISTER.

                                     MINISTER
                         ...Now and forever, Amen.

               He nods "offstage," and a muffled mechanical noise is heard.

               The coffin begins to lower through a trap door beneath it.

               A low, baleful human HOWL is heard, starting quietly but 
               gaining in volume.

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         I hear something in Laura's voice, 
                         but I know what it is, and at that 
                         moment I want to go to her and offer 
                         to become a different person, to 
                         remove all trace of what is me, as 
                         long as she will let me look after 
                         her and try to make her feel better...

               INT. CHAPEL PARLOR

               Rob stays back, watching mourners approach Laura and her 
               mother, hugging them.  After awhile, Laura sees Rob through 
               the throng, hanging back.  She breaks through and to him, 
               holding him close for a long time...

                                     ROB (V.O.)
                         ...And when she let's go of me, I 
                         feel I don't need to become a 
                         different person.  It's happened 
                         already.

               INT. LAURA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - AFTERNOON

               A cozy old Victorian house, full of things -- furniture, 
               paintings, ornaments, plants -- which don't go together but 
               which have obviously been chosen with care and taste.  Rob 
               and Liz stand, drinking wine.  Jo approaches them.

                                     LIZ
                              (to Jo)
                         How are you?

                                     JO
                         I'm all right, I suppose.  And Mom's 
                         not too bad.  But Laura... I dunno.

                                     LIZ
                         She's had a pretty rough few weeks 
                         already, without this.  It's hard 
                         when you're putting all of your 
                         efforts into one part of your life 
                         and it doesn't work out.

               She glances at Rob, embarrassed.

                                     ROB
                              (sincere)
                         Don't mind me.  No problem.  Just 
                         pretend you're talking about somebody 
                         else.

               Jo smiles, Liz gives him a look.

                                     LIZ
                         We are talking about somebody else.  
                         Laura.  Laura and Ray, actually.

               Rob begins to turn red.  Anger, sorrow, everything else 
               building.

                                     ROB
                         Enough, Liz.

                                     LIZ
                         Enough of what?

                                     ROB
                              (getting louder)
                         I know I can't speak now because 
                         Laura's father died, and I just have 
                         to take it because otherwise I'm a 
                         bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, 
                         self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking 
                         not, not all the time, anyway, I'm 
                         really sorry Jo.
                              (lowering his voice)
                         But you know, Liz... I can either 
                         stick up for myself or believe 
                         everything you say about me and end 
                         up hating myself.  And maybe you 
                         think I should, but it's not much of 
                         a life, you know?

                                     LIZ
                         Maybe I've been a little unfair.  
                         But is this really the time?

                                     ROB
                         Only because it's never the time.  I 
                         can't go on apologizing my whole 
                         life, you know?

                                     LIZ
                         If by "we" you are referring to men, 
                         then I have to say that just the 
                         once would do.

               Rob looks around the room, beginning to hyperventilate and 
               near tears.  He sees Laura in a corner of the room surrounded 
               by four or five mourners.  He crosses to them and breaks 
               through to her.

                                     ROB
                         I'm sorry.

               He breaks away from her and slips out the front door.

               EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - AFTERNOON

               So darkened by weather that it is almost night, raining 
               torrents and big sheets.  Rob emerges from the front door of 
               Laura's parents' house and begins walking down the street, 
               hands thrust into his pockets.  The rain almost immediately 
               soaks him.

               EXT. ANOTHER STREET

               In the distance, Rob runs toward us.  As he gets to us we 
               move with him down the street.  He is drenched.  We hear the 
               rain, and his ragged breath.  Headlights appear behind him 
               and backlight him, getting brighter as the sound of an engine 
               gets louder.  Rob takes a look over his shoulder, looks 
               desperately left and right, and vaults himself over a small 
               brick wall and into a flower bed, landing on his back in the 
               black wet earth.

               The big drops of rain splash mud on his face, and he burrows 
               deeper into the dirt and flowers with his back, panting and 
               staring up at the sky.  Off-camera the car engine catches 
               up, and a door opens and shuts.  He sighs and shuts his 
               eyes...

               He opens his eyes again, to see Laura's face, wet as well, 
               staring down at him.  It is difficult to distinguish rain 
               from tears.

                                     LAURA
                         Are you going to lie in that flower 
                         bed all night?

                                     ROB
                         Uh... No.

               But Rob keeps lying there.  Laura pulls herself to a sitting 
               position on the wall just above him.

                                     LAURA
                         You're soaking.

                                     ROB
                         Mmnn.

                                     LAURA
                         You're also an idiot.

               Rob pulls his muddy self to his feet and sits on the wall 
               next to her.

                                     ROB
                         I can see why you say that.  Look, 
                         I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last 
                         thing I wanted was... that's why I 
                         left, because... I lost it, and I 
                         didn't want to blow my top in there, 
                         and... look, the reason I fucked 
                         everything up was because I was 
                         scared.  I just wanted you to know, 
                         that's all.

                                     LAURA
                         Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't 
                         reciprocate.

                                     ROB
                         What do you mean?

                                     LAURA
                         I didn't mess things up because I 
                         was scared.  I slept with Ray because 
                         I was sick of you.  And I needed 
                         something to snap me out of it.

                                     ROB
                         Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't 
                         want to take up any more of your 
                         time.  You get back, and I'll wait 
                         here for a bus.

                                     LAURA
                         I don't want to go back.

                                     ROB
                         What do you want to do?

                                     LAURA
                         C'mon.

               They swing their legs over the wall and walk to Laura's VW.

               INT. LAURA'S CAR - NIGHT

               They drive sort of aimlessly through Laura's old neighborhood.  
               Laura sees something on her left, and makes a sudden turn up 
               a narrow road through some overgrown trees.  They come to a 
               stop in a formerly paved clearing, looking out on a field 
               with an old abandoned school on the other side.  Laura shuts 
               down the engine.

                                     ROB
                         When are you going back?

                                     LAURA
                         I don't know.  Sometime.  Later.  
                         Listen, Rob, would you have sex with 
                         me?

                                     ROB
                         What?

                                     LAURA
                         I want to feel something else than 
                         this.  It's either that or I go home 
                         and put my hand in the fire.  Unless 
                         you want to stub cigarettes out on 
                         my arm.

                                     ROB
                         I've only got a couple left.  I'm 
                         saving them for later.

                                     LAURA
                         It'll have to be sex, then.

               She pulls herself over him, staddling him in the passenger 
               seat and kissing his neck.  She pauses and regards him from 
               above.

                                     LAURA
                         Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago 
                         that I looked at you from here.

                                     ROB
                         Hi.

                                     LAURA
                         I knew there was a reason I wore a 
                         skirt today.

               Laura reaches down and unzips his pants, as they keep kissing.

                                     ROB
                         You know, with Ray...

                                     LAURA
                         Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through 
                         that again.

                                     ROB
                         No, no.  It's not... are you still 
                         on the pill?

                                     LAURA
                         Yes, of course.  There's nothing to 
                         worry about.

                                     ROB
                         I didn't mean that.  I mean... was 
                         that all you used?

               Laura looks at him, motionless, then begins to cry.

                                     ROB
                         Look, we can do other things.

                                     LAURA
                         I lived with you.  You were my partner 
                         just a few weeks ago and now you're 
                         worried I might kill you, and you're 
                         entitled to worry.  Isn't that a 
                         terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?

               She rolls off of him into her seat.  They sit there in 
               silence, watching the rain run down the windshield.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                     ROB
                         Later, I wonder if I was really 
                         worried about where Ian has been.  I 
                         have no idea where he's been, and 
                         that gives me every right to insist 
                         on protection.  But in truth, it was 
                         the power that interested me more 
                         than the fear.  I wanted to hurt 
                         her, on this day of all days, just 
                         because it's the first time since 
                         she's left that I've been able to.

               INT. BAR - LATER

               Rob and Laura lean back in a booth, facing each other.  We 
               get that feeling that not another word has been spoken since 
               we last saw them.

                                     ROB
                         Laura...

                                     LAURA
                         I'm too tired not to go out with 
                         you.

               Rob leans forward.

                                     ROB
                         So if you had a bit more energy we'd 
                         stay split.  But things being how 
                         they are, what with you wiped out, 
                         you'd like us to get back together.

                                     LAURA
                              (nodding)
                         Everything's too hard.  Maybe another 
                         time I would have the guts to be on 
                         my own, but not now I don't.

                                     ROB
                         What about Ian?

                                     LAURA
                         Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what 
                         that was all about, except that 
                         sometimes you need someone to lob 
                         into the middle of a bad relationship 
                         like a hand grenade, I guess, and 
                         blow it all apart.

                                     ROB
                         Mission accomplished.

                                     LAURA
                         I know it's not very romantic, but 
                         there will be romance again at some 
                         stage, I'm sure.  I just... I need 
                         you, Rob.  That's it.  And we know 
                         each other and we care for each other, 
                         and you've made it clear that you 
                         want me back, so...

               She looks up at him.

                                     LAURA
                         Let's go home.  Okay?

                                     ROB
                         Okay.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         But wouldn't you know it?  Suddenly 
                         I feel panicky, and sick, and I want 
                         to run around and sleep with female 
                         recording artists...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ROB AND LAURA'S APARTMENT - MORNING

               Post-lovemaking.  Rob and Laura lie on their backs.

                                     ROB
                         C'mon.  I want to know.

                                     LAURA
                         Want to know what, exactly?

                                     ROB
                         What it was like.

                                     LAURA
                         It was like sex.  What else could it 
                         be like?

                                     ROB
                         Was it like good sex or was it like 
                         bad sex?

                                     LAURA
                         What's the difference?

                                     ROB
                         You know the difference.

                                     LAURA
                         Look, we're okay now.  We just had a 
                         nice time.  Let's leave it at that.

                                     ROB
                         Okay, that's cool, okay.  But the 
                         nice time we just had... was it nicer, 
                         as nice, or less nice than the nice 
                         times you were having a couple of 
                         weeks ago?

               Laura is silent.

                                     ROB
                         Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something.  
                         Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking 
                         you questions and it'd make me feel 
                         better.

                                     LAURA
                         Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, 
                         because you'd know I was lying.

                                     ROB
                         Well why the fuck would you want to 
                         lie, anyway?

                                     LAURA
                         To make you feel better.

                                     ROB
                         Oh, great...

               Rob begins to get out of bed.  She grabs his hand and pulls 
               him back down.

                                     LAURA
                         Look, Rob.  If great sex was as 
                         important as you think it is, and if 
                         I was having great sex with him, 
                         then we wouldn't be lying here now.  
                         And that is my last word on the 
                         subject, okay?

                                     ROB
                         Okay.

               She pulls him close and they lie there, the matter seemingly 
               settled.

                                     LAURA
                         I wish your penis was as big as his, 
                         though.

               He turns slowly to her.  A giggle from her turns into a laugh, 
               then a howl, a roar --

               EXT. LAKEFRONT - TWILIGHT

               Rob and Laura walk the cement breakfront.

                                     LAURA
                         ... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or 
                         New York, even.

                                     ROB
                         Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, 
                         tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box 
                         full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on 
                         the Sub label, and I'll pay for it 
                         that way.

                                     LAURA
                         I'll pay for you.  Even though you 
                         owe me money.  We have to do something 
                         with the money I earn.  I need to.  
                         I deserve it.  You can just think of 
                         it as winning the lottery.

                         Money does not matter.  I do not 
                         care how much you earn.  I'd just 
                         like you to be a little happier in 
                         your work, but beyond that you can 
                         do what you like.

                                     ROB
                         But it wasn't supposed to be like 
                         this.  When I met you we were the 
                         same people and now we're not, and...

                                     LAURA
                         How?  How were we the same people?

                                     ROB
                         Well, you were the kind of person 
                         who came to the Artful Dodger and I 
                         was the kind of person who deejayed 
                         at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans 
                         and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I 
                         still do, and you don't.

                                     LAURA
                         Because I'm not allowed to.  I still 
                         do, after work.  So, what?  Should 
                         we just break up?  Is that what you're 
                         saying?  Because if you are, I'm 
                         going to run out of patience.

                                     ROB
                         No, but...

                                     LAURA
                         But what?

                                     ROB
                         But why doesn't it matter that we're 
                         not the same people we used to be?

                                     LAURA
                         You haven't changed so much as a 
                         pair of socks in the years I've known 
                         you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm 
                         the one who's done the growing, and 
                         all I've done is change jobs.

                                     ROB
                         And hairstyles and clothes and 
                         attitude and friends and...

                                     LAURA
                         I can't go to work with my hair dyed 
                         pink.  And I can afford to go shopping 
                         more now, and I've met a couple people 
                         I like over the last year or so.

                                     ROB
                         You're tougher.

                                     LAURA
                         More confident, maybe.

                                     ROB
                         Harder.

                                     LAURA
                         Less neurotic.  Are you intending to 
                         stay the same for the rest of your 
                         life?

                                     ROB
                         I'm alright.

                                     LAURA
                         Yeah, you're alright.  But you're 
                         certainly not happy.  So what happens 
                         if you get happy?  And yes I know 
                         that's the title of an Elvis Costello 
                         album, I use the reference 
                         deliberately to catch your attention.  
                         Should we split up because I'm used 
                         to you being miserable?  What happens 
                         if you, I don't know, start you're 
                         own record label, and it's a success?  
                         Time for a new girlfriend?

                                     ROB
                         You're being stupid.

                                     LAURA
                         How?  What would be the difference 
                         between you having a record label 
                         and me going from legal aid to private 
                         practice?

               Rob is silent.

                                     LAURA
                         All I'm saying is, you have to allow 
                         for things to happen to people, most 
                         of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's 
                         the use?

                                     ROB
                         No use.

               INT./EXT. RECORD STORE - DAY

               Rob comes out of the stock room and walks toward the counter 
               where Dick and Barry stare at the tape deck like two concerned 
               doctors, listening to a song that is raw and moody and lyrical -- 
               Minor Threat meets Brian Eno, if that's possible.  Rob joins 
               them in contemplation.

                                     ROB
                         What is this.

                                     DICK
                         It's Vince and Justin.

                                     ROB
                         Who's that?

                                     BARRY
                         The little skate-fuckers.

                                     ROB
                         No way.

                                     BARRY
                         Yes way.  It's really...

               Rob and Dick look at him, ready to pounce --

                                     BARRY
                              (pained to say it)
                         It's really fucking good.

               Dick and Barry look to Rob, who continues to just listen...

               He takes a deep breath and walks to the front door and out, 
               seemingly with a mission.

               Vince and Justin are doing noisy skate tricks against the 
               curb across the street.  When they see Rob they stop, get 
               ready to flee.  He walks across to them.  Dick comes out and 
               hovers in the background.

                                     ROB
                         Your tape.  It's good.

               They mumble thanks.

                                     ROB
                         It's rough.  But it shows promise.  
                         We record a couple of songs right, 
                         in a studio.  I'll take care of the 
                         rest.  I'll put out your record.  
                         Any profits after recouping expenses 
                         get split down the middle, between 
                         us and you guys.

                                     VINCE
                         Wait a minute.  Island Records charged 
                         U2 a million five against their 
                         overhead for one plane ride.

                                     ROB
                         We're not there yet, Justin.

                                     VINCE
                         I'm Vince.

                                     ROB
                         Whatever.

               He begins to move toward the store.  Vince and Justin look 
               at each other.  Rob gets to the door but stops and turns.

                                     ROB
                         Hey.  What's the name of your band?

                                     JUSTIN
                         The Kinky Wizards.

                                     ROB
                         What?

                                     VINCE
                         We saw this ad in the personals for 
                         two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance 
                         fair.

                                     ROB
                         Nice.

                                     VINCE
                         What's the name of your label?

               Rob looks at them.  Then at Dick.  Then through the window 
               at Barry, inside looking out.  Then at his own reflection in 
               the window.  Then back at them.

                                     ROB
                         Broken Records.  Welcome aboard.

               Rob walks back inside.  He seems to be shaking a little.

                                     BARRY
                         What the fuck is that?

                                     ROB
                         What?

                                     BARRY
                         I heard you, man.  Don't give me 
                         that "what" shit.  You just told 
                         them that you're gonna put out a 
                         record with them.

                                     ROB
                         So?  You even said they're good.

                                     BARRY
                         HELLO.  DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around 
                         here with a band, Mr. Branson?  Mr. 
                         Phil Spector?

               Rob waves him off and disappears into the stock room.  Laura 
               enters.

                                     LAURA
                         Hey, Barry.

                                     BARRY
                         Oh, hi.

                                     LAURA
                         Where's Rob?

                                     BARRY
                         The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street 
                         is in his executive suite.  Do you 
                         have an appointment?

                                     LAURA
                         What are you talking about?

                                     BARRY
                         Just that Rob seems to think it would 
                         be wiser to start a record label by 
                         putting out a record with business-
                         crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters 
                         than with someone he knows in his 
                         bitter jealous heart is a musical 
                         visionary.  That's all.

               Laura puts it together, and smiles.  She goes to the back 
               and crack the door, finding Rob sitting on a box, thinking.

                                     ROB
                         Hi.

                                     LAURA
                         Hi.  What are you doing?

                                     ROB
                         Nothing.

                                     LAURA
                         Wanna go to dinner?

                                     ROB
                         Where?

                                     LAURA
                         At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from 
                         work.

                                     ROB
                         Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along.  
                         Paul and I.

                                     LAURA
                         I know.  But you've never met.  It 
                         just seems like a stone unturned in 
                         your relationship with him.

                                     ROB
                         Ha.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ROB IN HIS CHAIR

               Rob to camera.

                                     ROB
                         We're at a point where I can't really 
                         walk away from gauntlets she might 
                         throw down, and so I go.  And wouldn't 
                         you know it, I sort of fall in love 
                         with Paul and Miranda -- with what 
                         they have, and the way they treat 
                         each other, and the way they make me 
                         feel as if I'm the new center of 
                         their world.  I think they're great, 
                         and I want to see them twice a week, 
                         every week, for the rest of my life.  
                         Only right at the end of the evening 
                         do I realize I've been set up.

               INT. PAUL AND MIRANDA'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

               After dinner.  Rob ambles in from the dining room.  Laura 
               close behind.  He looks through the bookshelves until he 
               finds a meager little grouping of CDs.  He moves up to them 
               and scans the titles: Tina Turner.  Billy Joel.  Kate Bush.  
               Pink Floyd.  Simply Red.  The Beatles.  The Windham Hill 
               Sampler...

                                     PAUL
                         Lame, right?

               Rob turns around to see PAUL behind him.

                                     ROB
                         Oh, I don't know.  The Beatles are 
                         okay.

               Paul laughs.

                                     PAUL
                         We're kinda out of date.

                                     ROB
                         Hey, to each his own, I say.

                                     PAUL
                         Maybe we can come by your store and 
                         you can hook us up.

                                     ROB
                         Sure, sure.  Any time.

                                     LAURA
                         Better hurry, though, Paul.  Rob 
                         started a record label, so he's gonna 
                         be in the shop less and less.

               Rob looks at her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ROB AND LAURA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               as they come in the door.

                                     LAURA
                         ..."To each his own!" Unbelievable!  
                         You!  Rob Gordon said that.  You 
                         even sounded like you meant it.

               They throw their jackets over a chair.  Rob turns on the CD 
               player and "Call Me A Liar" by Palace begins to play.

                                     ROB
                              (smiling)
                         You did that deliberately.  You knew 
                         all along I'd like them.  It was a 
                         trick.

                                     LAURA
                         I tricked you into meeting some people 
                         you'd think were great.  I thought 
                         it would be fun to introduce you to 
                         someone with a Tina Turner album and 
                         then see whether you still felt the 
                         same way.

               She moves to Rob and wraps her arms around him.  They look 
               deeply at each other.  She breaks away from him and walks 
               into the bedroom.  He turns off the stereo and follows her.

               EXT. CLARK STREET - MORNING

               Rob walks to work, drinking his coffee.  He stops and backs 
               up a few feet, and stares at a poster on a plywood board-up.

               "'I SOLD MY MOM'S WHEELCHAIR'/the debut single from The Kinky 
               Wizards/on Broken Records/Record release party July 20 at 
               The Artful Dodger/Featuring the triumphant return of DJ ROB 
               GORDON/"Dance Music For Old People"

               Rob scowls, and storms off.

               INT. ROB AND LAURA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Rob paces, Laura sits on the couch, smiling.

                                     LAURA
                         I called Dan Koretzky because he --

                                     ROB
                         Has Drag City Records, I know, I 
                         know.  You told Dan Koretzky about 
                         this?

                                     LAURA
                         Yeah, and he said it's a good way to 
                         break out a record.  Especially for 
                         what he said, and I quote, "would be 
                         a highly anticipated event, locally." 
                         He helped me put out a press release.

                                     ROB
                         WHAT?

                                     LAURA
                         Just local, of course.

                                     ROB
                         And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob 
                         Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"

                                     LAURA
                         I had that idea when I was living 
                         with Ian and it was such a good idea 
                         that I was annoyed we weren't together 
                         anymore.  It might even be why I 
                         came back.

                                     ROB
                         You had no right.  Supposing I was 
                         doing something that couldn't be 
                         cancelled?

                                     LAURA
                         What do you ever do that can't be 
                         cancelled?

                                     ROB
                         That's not the point.  I mean, what 
                         if the single isn't done in time?

                                     LAURA
                         Barry said its done.

                                     ROB
                         Barry?  Barry knows about this?

                                     LAURA
                         Yeah.  His band is playing a set.

               Rob wheels on her.

               INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

               Rob and Barry.

                                     ROB
                         Like fuck you are.

                                     BARRY
                         Laura said we could.  If we helped 
                         out with the posters and stuff.  And 
                         we did.  And we are.

                                     ROB
                         I'll give you 10% of the door if you 
                         don't play.

                                     BARRY
                         We're getting that anyway.

                                     ROB
                         What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.

                                     BARRY
                         No.  We need the gig.

                                     ROB
                         110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm 
                         not kidding.  That's how much it 
                         means to me not to hear you play.

                                     BARRY
                         We're not as bad as you think, Rob.

                                     ROB
                         You couldn't be.  Look, Barry.  
                         There's going to be people from 
                         Laura's work there, people who own 
                         dogs and babies and Tina Turner 
                         albums.  How are you going to cope 
                         with them?

                                     BARRY
                         We're not called Barrytown anymore, 
                         by the by.  They got sick of the 
                         Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called 
                         SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.

                                     ROB
                         Sonic Death Monkey.

                                     BARRY
                         What do you think?  Dick likes it.

                                     ROB
                         Barry, you're over thirty years old.  
                         You owe it to yourself and your 
                         friends and to your parents not to 
                         sing in a group called Sonic Death 
                         Monkey.

                                     BARRY
                         I owe it to myself to go right to 
                         the edge, Rob, and this group does 
                         exactly that.  Over the edge, in 
                         fact.

                                     ROB
                         You'll be going over the fucking 
                         edge if you come anywhere near me 
                         next Friday night.

                                     BARRY
                         That's what we want.  Reaction.  And 
                         if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends 
                         can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 
                         'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll 
                         be ready.

               Barry wanders off laughing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ROB AND LAURA'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Rob and Laura.

                                     LAURA
                         They'll go on early.  Nobody will 
                         even be there yet and I told them 
                         they can't play for more than a half 
                         hour.

                                     ROB
                         It's no joke.  I'm responsible for 
                         what happens, you know.  Embarrassment 
                         aside, there's a lot of money and 
                         effort in this, at least by my 
                         standards.  I have to put down a 
                         deposit for the room.  I have to pay 
                         the pressing plant for the records, 
                         sleeve them, sticker them --

                                     LAURA
                         We took care of that.

               Rob's brow furrows.

                                     LAURA
                         Barry and Dick and me.  Look in the 
                         bedroom.

               Rob goes to the bedroom door and opens it.  It's sort of 
               like Christmas: hundreds of Kinky Wizards CD singles, 
               painstakingly packaged and stacked on the bed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                     ROB
                         I suddenly feel choked up.  It's not 
                         the money, it's the way she's thought 
                         of everything: one morning I woke up 
                         to find her going through my records, 
                         pulling out things that she remembered 
                         me playing when I deejayed and putting 
                         them into the little carrying cases 
                         that I used to use and put away in a 
                         closet somewhere years ago.  She 
                         knew I needed a kick in the ass.  
                         She also knew how happy I was when I 
                         used to deejay.  From which every 
                         angle I examine it, it still looks 
                         as though she's done all of this 
                         because she loves me.

               CUT BACK TO:

               INT. ROB AND LAURA'S APARTMENT

               Rob turns from the bedroom and goes to Laura, putting his 
               arms around her.

                                     ROB
                         I'm sorry I've been acting like a 
                         jerk.  I do appreciate what you've 
                         done for me, and I know you've done 
                         it for the best possible reasons, 
                         and I do love you, even though I act 
                         like I don't.

                                     LAURA
                         That's okay.  You seem pissed off 
                         all the time, though.

                                     ROB
                         I know.  I don't get it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         But if I had to take a wild guess, 
                         I'd say that I'm pissed because I 
                         know I'm stuck with Laura, bound to 
                         her, and I don't like it.  That dreamy 
                         anticipation you have when you're 
                         fifteen or twenty or thirty even, 
                         that the most perfect person in the 
                         world might walk into your store or 
                         office or friend's party at any 
                         moment... That's all gone, I think, 
                         and that's enough to piss anybody 
                         off.  Laura is who I am now, and 
                         it's no good pretending otherwise...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

               Rob is standing shelves.  A very pretty young woman, CAROLINE, 
               comes through the door and looks around.  She sees Rob.

                                     CAROLINE
                         Excuse me?

               Rob looks up and takes her in like a dish in a window.

                                     ROB
                         May I help you?

                                     CAROLINE
                         I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.

                                     ROB
                         Uh.  That's me.

                                     CAROLINE
                         I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader.  
                         I want to do a story on you.

                                     ROB
                         Right.  Why?

                                     CAROLINE
                         Well, I used to go to the Dodger on 
                         your nights, and I saw you're doing 
                         it again and that your putting out a 
                         record, and it's sort of a then-and-
                         now story against the backdrop of 
                         the Chicago music scene with the 
                         emphasis on now.

                                     ROB
                         Oh.  Okay.

                                     CAROLINE
                         I thought I would ask you a few 
                         questions if that's okay.

                                     ROB
                         Huh.  You used to come to the club?  
                         I shouldn't have let you in.  You 
                         must have only been about sixteen.

               Rob realizes what he must be sounding like.  He blushes and 
               retreats.

                                     ROB
                         What I mean is, I didn't mean you 
                         look young.  You don't.  You don't 
                         look old either.  You look just as 
                         old as you are.  A bit younger maybe, 
                         but not a lot.  Not much.  Just right.

                                     CAROLINE
                         So.  Is now a good time?

               Rob looks around: there is absolutely nothing going on in 
               the store.  He nods.  She pulls out a pad and pencil.

                                     CAROLINE
                         Right.  So.  You must have an enormous 
                         record collection.

                                     ROB
                         Yeah.  I could show it to you if you 
                         want to come over and see it.

               He winces immediately.

                                     CAROLINE
                         Yeah, well... Let's see... What are 
                         you're all-time top five records?

                                     ROB
                         Pardon me?

                                     CAROLINE
                         Your desert island top-five.

                                     ROB
                         Oh boy... In the club, or at home?

                                     CAROLINE
                         Is there a difference?

                                     ROB
                              (a little too shrill)
                         OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin 
                         City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers 
                         is an all-time top five, but I 
                         wouldn't play it at the club.  It's 
                         a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd 
                         go home.

                                     CAROLINE
                         Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.

                                     ROB
                         What do you mean, four more?

                                     CAROLINE
                         Well if one of them is this "Sin 
                         City" thing --

                                     ROB
                         Can I go home and work this out and 
                         let you know?  In a week or so?

                                     CAROLINE
                         Look if you can't think of anything, 
                         it doesn't matter.  I'll do one.  My 
                         five favorite from the old days at 
                         the Dodger.

               Rob is aghast, humiliated, quietly outraged.

                                     ROB
                         Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... 
                         "Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned. 
                         "Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic. 
                         "Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, 
                         Japanese import, no horns, or 
                         different horns, anyway... um... 
                         "Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley...  
                         And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and 
                         the Family Stone.  A bit 
                         controversial, I know, but...

                                     CAROLINE
                         Fine.  That's great.

                                     ROB
                         Is that it?

                                     CAROLINE
                         Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, 
                         if you got the time.

                                     ROB
                         Sure, but is that it for the list?

                                     CAROLINE
                         That's five.  So.  Why did you decide 
                         to deejay again?

                                     ROB
                         Well it was a friend's idea, really, 
                         and the record release party seemed 
                         like a good place to do it.  So...
                              (looking over her pad 
                              at the list)
                         I should really put a James Brown in 
                         there --

                                     CAROLINE
                         Nice friend.

                                     ROB
                         Yeah.

                                     CAROLINE
                         What's his name?

                                     ROB
                         Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is 
                         Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a 
                         girl.

                                     CAROLINE
                         "Music for Old People." What does 
                         that mean?

                                     ROB
                         Look, I'm sorry about this, but I'd 
                         like "the Upsetter" by Lee "Scratch" 
                         Perry, in there.  Instead of "Sin 
                         City."

               She scribbles and writes.

                                     CAROLINE
                         Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"

                                     ROB
                         Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't 
                         too old for clubs but they're too 
                         old for acid jazz and garage and 
                         ambient and all that.  They want to 
                         hear old funk and Stax and New Wave 
                         and Old School Hip Hop and some new 
                         stuff all together and there's nowhere 
                         for them.

                                     CAROLINE
                         And the new label?  And the Kinky 
                         Wizards?

                                     ROB
                         Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- 
                         you know what?  Why don't I just 
                         make you a tape?

                                     CAROLINE
                         Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could 
                         have deejay Rob Gordon play in my 
                         own home.

                                     ROB
                         Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I 
                         love making tapes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         A good compilation tape, like breaking 
                         up, is hard to do and takes ages 
                         longer than it might seem.  You gotta 
                         kick off with a killer, to hold the 
                         attention.  Then you have to take it 
                         up a notch, but not blow your wad, 
                         so maybe cool it off a notch, and 
                         you can't put the same artist twice 
                         on the tape, except if some subtle 
                         point or lesson or theme involved, 
                         and even then not the two of them in 
                         a row, and you can't woo somebody 
                         with Joni Mitchell's "Big Yellow 
                         Taxi" and then bash their head off 
                         with something like GBH's "City Baby 
                         Attacked by Rats," and... oh, there 
                         are a lot of rules.  Anyway, I worked 
                         hard at this one.

               INT. ROB AND LAURA'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Rob sits Indian-style on the floor in front of the stereo.

               He has a pad of paper with scrawled titles and cross-outs, 
               and is surrounded by piles of CDs and records.

                                     LAURA
                         Who's that for?

               Rob winces, turns.  He's busted.

                                     ROB
                         This?  Oh, just that woman who 
                         interviewed me for The Reader.  Carol?  
                         Caroline?  Something like that.

               Laura turns and walks out of the room.

               INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

               Rob is tucked into the corner, on the phone.

                                     ROB
                         Hi, Caroline... Oh, it's Rob.  Yeah, 
                         listen, I have a new list for you 
                         and -- Oh.  Yes.  Of course...  Well 
                         maybe next week they could print a, 
                         uh, retraction.  Or a correction.  
                         Because the list I have now it really 
                         much more -- right.  Okay.  Anyway, 
                         I have your tape.  That's right.  
                         Shall I mail it to you?  Or... would 
                         you like to have a drink?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ROB IN HIS CHAIR

                         How are you not going to fall for 
                         someone who wants to interview you?  
                         Now Caroline is all I can think about.  
                         And in the daydreams I imagine every 
                         detail, the entire story of our future 
                         relationship, until suddenly I realize 
                         that there's nothing left to actually, 
                         like, happen.  I've done it all, 
                         lived through it all in my head.  I 
                         know the whole plot, the ending, and 
                         the good parts.  Now I'd have to 
                         watch it all over again in real time, 
                         and where's the fun in that?  And 
                         fucking--when is it all going to 
                         stop?  Am I going to jump from rock 
                         to rock for the rest of my life until 
                         there aren't any rocks left?  Am I 
                         going to bolt every time I get itchy 
                         feet?  Because I get them about once 
                         a quarter, along with the store's 
                         tax bill.  I've been thinking with 
                         my guts since I was fourteen years 
                         old and, frankly speaking, I've come 
                         to the conclusion that my guts have 
                         shit for brains.  You know what's 
                         wrong with Laura, what my problem 
                         is?  What's wrong with Laura is that 
                         I'll never see her for the first or 
                         second or third time.  That's all.  
                         Fuck it.  I'll probably mail the 
                         tape.  Probably.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NORTH SIDE TAVERN - DAY

               Rob sits at a table in the bar, nervous.  He watches the 
               door, sits up straight when it opens, and follows someone 
               with his eyes, all the way to his table.  She sits.  It's 
               Laura.

                                     LAURA
                         A drinking lunch on a school day.  
                         What a nice surprise.

               Rob says nothing.

                                     LAURA
                         Are you worried about tomorrow night?

                                     ROB
                         Not really.

               He plays with his drink.

                                     LAURA
                         Are you going to talk to me, or shall 
                         I get my paper out?

                                     ROB
                         I'm going to talk to you.

                                     LAURA
                         Right.

               He plays with his drink some more.

                                     LAURA
                         What are you going to talk to me 
                         about?

                                     ROB
                         I'm going to talk to you about whether 
                         you want to get married or not.  To 
                         me.

                                     LAURA
                         Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.

                                     ROB
                         I mean it.

                                     LAURA
                         I know.

                                     ROB
                         Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.

                                     LAURA
                         I'm sorry.  But two days ago you 
                         were in love with that girl who 
                         interviewed you for The Reader, 
                         weren't you?

                                     ROB
                         Not in love, exactly, but...

                                     LAURA
                         Well forgive me if I don't think of 
                         you as the world's safest bet.

                                     ROB
                         Would you marry me if I was?

                                     LAURA
                         No.  Probably not.

                                     ROB
                         Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?

                                     LAURA
                         Don't sulk.  What brought all this 
                         on?

                                     ROB
                         I don't know.

                                     LAURA
                         Very persuasive.

                                     ROB
                         Are you persuadable?

                                     LAURA
                         No.  I don't think so.  I'm just 
                         curious about how one goes from making 
                         tapes for one person to marriage 
                         proposals to another in two days.  
                         Fair enough?

                                     ROB
                         Fair enough.

                                     LAURA
                         So?

                                     ROB
                         I'm just sick of thinking about it 
                         all the time.

                                     LAURA
                         About what?

                                     ROB
                         This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I 
                         want to think about something else.

                                     LAURA
                         I've changed my mind.  That's the 
                         most romantic thing I've ever heard.  
                         I do.  I will.

                                     ROB
                         Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.

                                     LAURA
                         I mean, maybe you're right.  But 
                         were you really expecting me to say 
                         yes?

                                     ROB
                         I dunno.  Didn't think about it, 
                         really.  It was the asking that was 
                         the important thing.

                                     LAURA
                         Well, you've asked.

               She leans over and takes his hands in hers, smiles at him.

                                     LAURA
                         Thank you.

               INT. ARTFUL DODGER - NIGHT

               TWO TURNTABLES

               with the mixer in the middle. "Just Begun" by Jimmy Castor 
               spins on turntable #1.  A hand reaches in, and begins to 
               draw the slides down, quieting the music.

               Rob looks up from behind the deejay table, set up amongst 
               the instruments.  The place is packed with people, and 
               everyone seems to be having a great time.

               Almost everyone -- Rob sees Barry, who pretends to nod off 
               when Rob catches his eye, and Justin, who looks back at him 
               and mocks a bulimic act.  Rob gives him the finger.  He sees 
               Laura, and she beams at him.  He comes to the front of the 
               stage, and taps a microphone.

                                     ROB
                         Uh, thanks for uh, coming out tonight.  
                         I hope you have a good time.  And I 
                         hope you like the record.  The one 
                         by the Kinky Wizards.  The record 
                         that we're having this record release 
                         party for.
                              (hoots from the crowd)
                         Thanks.  Listen to it first, though.
                              (laughs)
                         Okay.  We'll get to that later.  
                         Right now, I'd like to introduce...
                              (mumbles)
                         Sonic Death Monkey.

               Good-natured applause.  Rob steps down and bee-lines to Laura.  
               Barry and his crew mount the stage.  Rob takes a big gulp of 
               beer.

                                     ROB
                              (to Laura)
                         I'm an idiot.  I should have played 
                         the record first.  This place is 
                         about to get burned down.

                                     LAURA
                         It's gonna be fine.  These people 
                         are ready for anything.

                                     BARRY
                              (dubious)
                         Yeah, well...

               Barry stands in front of the mic, surveying the crowd with a 
               smile.  He and the band all wear suits and ties.

                                     BARRY
                         Thanks for the enthusiastic intro, 
                         Rob.  We're not called Sonic Death 
                         Monkey anymore, though, ladies and 
                         gentlemen.  We might be on the verge 
                         of becoming the Atavistics, but we 
                         haven't decided yet.  But tonight, 
                         we are... BARRY JIVE AND THE UPTOWN 
                         FIVE!  ONE TWO THREE --And they launch 
                         into Marvin Gaye's "Got To Give It 
                         Up," almost flawlessly faithful to 
                         the original.  Barry is transformed -- 
                         shuffling footwork, a wide smile, 
                         and when the intro winds up, an almost 
                         perfect falsetto.  The crowd goes 
                         nuts, filling the floor.  Rob is 
                         stunned, begins to smile.  Laura 
                         takes his hand and leads him out 
                         into the crowd...

               THE END

          EXT. MARSHLAND - DUSK
                         
          We move across smoldering embers and reach a small grass
          fire. Dirt is thrown over the flames before a BOOT finishes
          stamping them out.
                         
          SUPER: PLAINFIELD, WISCONSIN, 1944
                         
           HENRY GEIN (O.S.)
           We're just lucky it didn't reach the
           trees...
                         
          We move up two dirty pairs of overalls to find HENRY and ED
          GEIN sweating away as they continue shovelling out the
          flames. Both are in their forties and wearing flannel shirts.
          Ed wears an Elmer Fudd hat.
                         
           HENRY GEIN (CONT'D)
           There's gonna be a lot more jobs at that
           factory by Milwaukee come June. I could
           put in a word.
                         
                          ED GEIN
           You can't leave us, Henry. She needs both
                          OF US--
                         
                          HENRY GEIN
           Can you stop being a momma's boy for one
           second?
                         
          Henry looks at Ed and he shrinks back.
                         
           HENRY GEIN (CONT'D)
           I'm not trying to hurt you but Jesus you
           got to live your own life someday. That
           woman can take care of her own goddamn --
                         
          CLANG. Henry is hit by the shovel in the back of the head and
          goes down.
                         
          Ed steps slowly forward and puts down the shovel. The look on
          his face isn't anger. It's BLANK. He pulls at the flaps of
          his Elmer Fudd hat... then calmly walks away.
                         
          The camera pans until we discover :

          in his trademark black Mariani suit. He's been watching the
          whole thing, standing in the smouldering field only a few

           Good evening.
                         
          He places his cup daintily back on the saucer.

           Brother has been slaying brother since
           Cain and Abel, yet even I did not see
           that coming. I was as blind-sided as poor
           Henry over there.
                         
          He glances back over at the murder scene.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           Apparently the authorities shared my
           naivete and believed the young man's tale
           that Henry fell and hit his head on a
           stone and died of smoke asphyxiation.
                         
          He shrugs: `Who would've thought it?'
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           Of course if they hadn't believed him, Ed
           never would have had the opportunity to
           commit the heinous acts for which he
           became famous... and we wouldn't have our
           little movie. Instead, we'd have more
           nice, safe, predictable ones like
           these...

          He shudders with distaste. As if on cue the sky THUNDERS
          LOUDLY above him. He looks up and from behind the tree stump
          produces an umbrella.

          Step out into a sea of FLASHBULBS. Hitch basks in the
          limelight while Alma, his razor-sharp, charming wife of over
          30 years stands in the background, uncomfortable with all the
          attention.
                         
          Hitchcock's agent LEW WASSERMAN, 45, dynamic, charismatic,

           No, when I was planning North by

          soaks in the tub. The champagne glass beside him, his
          corpulent frame is covered only by the London Times he's
          reading. Even in this deeply vulnerable state, he maintains
          the air of a haughty mischievous emperor.
                         
          At the sound of a bedroom bureau being opened, Hitch's eyes

          Hitchcock watches enthralled. He puts down his glass and

          the sides.

          from the drawer.

          Luxurious, wood-paneled and very British. Hitch sits
          restlessly behind his desk, receiving his morning shave from
          his private barber, SILVIO. His longtime assistant, PEGGY
          ROBERTSON, 40s, crisp, British, fiercely protective of her
          boss, is going through a list of potential projects.

           picture waiting for Miss Frank to
           discover the corpse I'd hidden in the
           attic. Wouldn't you agree, Silvio?
                         
                          SILVIO
           Si.
                         
          Hitch reaches for a carrot stick and CRUNCHES it.

           Doesn't she know I just made that movie?
           It's called North by Northwest. And
           "style" is merely self-plagiarism.
                         
          Silvio nods, then recommences the shave.

           Without expensive stars like Cary Grant
           or Miss Kim Novak to pretty it up.
                         
          Silvio unintentionally nicks Hitch's face.

          Hitch motions for the barber to hold up the mirror. The image
          of his face overflows the small frame. Repulsed, he leans
          back his head and makes a hand motion for Silvio to SLIT HIS
          THROAT.

          Alma lunches with screenwriter-novelist WHITFIELD COOK.
          "WHIT," 50s, is Hitchcock's physical opposite -- dashing,
          razor-sharp and sophisticated. In fact he'd be at home in one
          of his movies.
                         
                          WHITFIELD COOK
           ... Thank God I had a pocketful of
           pretzels. I was hiding in that props
           cupboard all night.
                          (THEN)
           That'll teach me to use a bedroom set
           instead of the real thing.
                         
                          ALMA
           Serves you right.
                         
          They laugh uproariously, quite at ease with each other.
                         
                          ALMA (CONT'D)
           Hitch always said your private life was
           in danger of being more entertaining than
           any of your plots.
                         
          He pours Alma another glass of wine, not remotely insulted.
                         
                          WHITFIELD COOK
           I can't believe he let me have you all to
           myself for a whole afternoon. Especially
           looking this beautiful.
                         
          He clinks her glass.

           That is one lucky garden.
                         
          Whit brings out a set of galleys and slides them across the

          dressed KIM NOVAK-TYPE WOMAN hurrying along to some
          appointment or assignation... Hitch cranes to see who she's
          meeting, but she moves tantalizingly out of sight.
                         
          Hitch turns back with a sigh towards his desk, covered with
          discarded newspaper clippings and boring story proposals.

          faced away from him.
                         
                          ED GEIN
           Aren't you cold, ma?
                         
          She doesn't answer. We follow him to the dresser where he
          lingers a little too long over his mother's open underwear
          drawer before grabbing the blue coverlet on the side.
                         
          He comes over and spreads the extra blanket over her. Still
          wearing his jacket, he takes off his shoes, gets into bed and
          crawls up next to her.

           Don't be afraid, ma... I'm here...
                         
          As he puts his arm around her and pulls her close, we reveal
          his mother's ghoulishly embalmed face.
                         
          INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          A slant of moonlight finds Alma fast asleep until a FINGER
          nudges her awake. She lifts her satin sleep mask to see
          Hitchcock holding out his copy of "Psycho."
                         
                          ALMA
           Oh God.
                         
          The look of obsession on his face is unmistakable.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           Read the bit in the motel bathroom.
                         
                          ALMA
           Now?
                         
          He switches on the light by her bedside. She sits up, puts on
          her glasses and reads from the opened page.
                         
                          ALMA (CONT'D)
           "Mary started to scream, and then the
           curtains parted further and a hand
           appeared, holding a butcher's knife. It
           was the knife that, a moment later, cut
           off her scream... and her head."
           (handing him back the book)
           Charming. Doris Day should do it as a
           musical.
                         
          She hands him back the book.
                         
                          ALMA (CONT'D)
           This is nothing but low-budget horror
           movie claptrap.
                         
          She turns off the light again and goes back to bed. A deep
          voice sounds from the darkness...
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           But what if someone really good made a
           horror movie?
                         
          EXT. HITCHCOCK'S GARDEN - MORNING
                         
          The Hitchcocks eat breakfast on the terrace watching the
          GARDENERS trim the bushes and rake leaves from the pool.

           Just think of the shock value. Killing
           off your leading lady halfway through.
                         
          Alma can feel Hitch looking at her, waiting for a response.
          Clearly he isn't going to let this one go.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           You're intrigued. Admit it.
                         
          She butters her toast, casually taunts him by adding a large
          spoon of marmalade.
                         
                          ALMA
           Actually, I think it's a huge mistake.
                         
          Hitch falls silent, a chastised schoolboy.
                         
                          ALMA (CONT'D)
           You shouldn't wait till halfway

          Hitch heads for his office, in no mood for wise cracks. He
          spreads out the articles on the desk. Photos and magazine

           I don't want anyone to find out the
           ending until they see it in the theater.
                         
          Peggy shakes her head.
                         
                          PEGGY
           All that celery's affecting your brain.
                         
          She walks over, notices the LIFE MAGAZINE headline : "HOUSE
          OF HORRORS STUNS NATION." Stark black and white photographs
          expose the nightmarish decay of the Gein house...
                         
                          PEGGY (CONT'D)

           That's exactly the point, my dear.
                         
          Peggy watches uneasily as Hitchcock pores over the articles
          with delight.

          The other columnists scribble down the quote.
                         
           HEDDA HOPPER TYPE
           Am I the only one who finds this

                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           I was hoping everyone would. I mean life
           is deeply offensive and disgusting, isn't
           it?
                         
          Hitch glides off without missing a beat, past the Servers
          arriving with more hors d'oeuvres from the kitchen.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           Try the finger sandwiches -- they're real

          He snags a martini and collars Peggy while he's at it.

           Peggy. I'm going to need some research

           secretary from Phoenix, Arizona.
                         
          He looks over at the pantry, where Alma can be glimpsed
          through the swinging door, putting food onto trays.

          Hitch sees WHIT lean into view and innocently whisper
          something into Alma's ear making her laugh.

           weekends off?
                         
          Hitchcock doesn't notice the joke. He now only has eyes on
          the pantry ahead.
                         
          He forges on through the guests only to get waylaid by Lew.
          It is a classic Hitchcock moment, a character needing to get
          someplace being held up by someone who wants to chat --
                         
                          LEW WASSERMAN

           for the drive-in crowd.
                         
          Hitch smiles tightly and extricates himself, heading on to
          the kitchen through more annoying guests --

          the next round of hors d'oeuvres coming in from the kitchen.
                         
                          WHITFIELD COOK
           Now, if this were a Hitchcock picture

          Suddenly, over Whitfield's shoulder, Alma sees Hitch looming
          in the doorway. Whit notes the tiny change in her eyes and
          turns.
                         
           WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)
           Speak of the devil.
                         
          Hitch stares blankly at him while Alma turns and busies
          herself over the sink, hiding an almost imperceptible blush.
                         
           WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)
           I have to admit, Hitch, I ran all over
           town looking for a copy of "Psycho" but
           couldn't find a single one.

           I wonder how that could have happened.
                         
          Hitch sips his martini, a picture of innocence. Then leans in
          to Whit's ear and whispers - just like Whit leaned into
          Alma's ear a moment earlier.

          Peggy appears in the pass-through, beckoning Hitch to hurry
          back into the living room.
                         
          INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Hitch returns to see the other GUESTS are now passing around
          the GEIN PHOTOS. They look utterly confused and horrified...
          a couple of them are even gathering their coats.
                         
          ON LEW, PEGGY AND HITCH
                         
          standing together watching.
                         
                          LEW WASSERMAN
           I've seen happier faces on a school bus
           going over a cliff.
                         
                          PEGGY
           I told you it would be too much.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           But they can't stop looking, can they?
                         
          He slurps his martini, sharing a smile with Lew.
          INT. PARAMOUNT BOARD ROOM - DAY
                         
          Paramount President BARNEY BALABAN, 70s, ferocious,
          righteous, sits behind his impressive desk flanked by two
          CONSERVATIVELY-ATTIRED EXECUTIVES.
                         
          Hitchcock and Wasserman sit across from them.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           Audiences want to be shocked, Barney.
           They want something different. And this
           is it.
                         
          He gestures to the untouched copy of "Psycho" in front of
          Balaban.
                         
                          BARNEY BALABAN
           The truth is, Hitch, every time you want
           to do something "different" like The
           Wrong Man or Vertigo, someone loses
           money.
                         
          Hitchcock stares unblinking, giving nothing away.
                         
                          LEW WASSERMAN
           So we should stop trying to give them
           something new?
                         
                          BARNEY BALABAN
           You owe Paramount one last picture,
           Hitch. Can't you do something like North
           by Northwest but for us this time instead
           of for MGM?
                         
          Hitch's stare remains inscrutable.
                         
           BARNEY BALABAN (CONT'D)
           We've offered you dozens of perfectly
           good properties.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                          (IMPERIOUSLY)
           "Psycho."
                         
          Wasserman gives Balaban the same glacial stare. The Paramount
          executives shift uncomfortably.
                         
                          BARNEY BALABAN
           No one respects the name Hitchcock more
           than Paramount. But even a talented man
           sometimes backs the wrong horse.

           Are you telling me "no?"
                         
          Balaban maintains a calm, pleasant front.
                         
                          BARNEY BALABAN
           I think you know me better than that,
           Hitch. I would never say "no" to you.
                         
          Hitch's suppressed rage is building...but Balaban says
          nothing.
                         
          EXT. PARAMOUNT COURTYARD - DAY
                         
          Hitch and Lew walk down the stairs and through the leafy
          courtyard past Hitch's office.
                         
                          LEW WASSERMAN
           What a putz. You know what his family did
           before they built those movie palaces?
           Ran a grocery store.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           My father ran a grocery store.
                         
                          LEW WASSERMAN
           Exactly. That's what I'm saying. He
           should show some respect.
                         
          Hitch turns to Lew.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           They think I've lost my touch, Lew.
           My association with television has
           cheapened me.
                         
                          LEW WASSERMAN
           Are you referring to that deal I got you
           where Bristol-Meyers pays you twenty-nine
           grand an episode and you own the
           negative? That's my kind of cheap.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           They just want the same thing over and
           over. They've put me in a coffin and now
           they're nailing down the lid.
                         
          Lew puts a comforting hand on him...
                         
                          LEW WASSERMAN
           Hitch, I will never let that happen.

          ALMA does afternoon laps in the pool. A contemplative
          Hitchcock wanders down to the pool side wearing black
          sunglasses and a business suit. He watches Alma a moment.
          Finally she notices him.
                         
                          ALMA
           You're back early.
                         
          He shrugs, then sits at the table to pour himself a glass of
          lemonade. Alma gets out and towels herself off.
                         
                          ALMA (CONT'D)
           I'm disappointed you didn't give Whit's
           book a chance.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           What about him?
                         
                          ALMA
           He knows you well enough.
                         
          She sits down next to him, noticing a tiny hole in her
          swimsuit. It's starting to look a little threadbare.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           Enjoy the pool now. We might not have it
           for that much longer.
                         
          He looks off cryptically.
                         
                          ALMA
           Why?

           Why not wait?
                         
          He doesn't reply. She knows him well enough too and doesn't
          question him further.

                          ALMA (CONT'D)
           Tell me and I won't ever ask again. Why

           many people are telling you 'no,' is it?

          Balaban takes in their inscrutable stares. Not unimpressed by

          bedside table. All traces of his bravado are gone...

           If this picture fails, Alma, we'll be in
           for a long, humiliating bout of crow-
           eating.

          PUDGY FINGERS part the slats of the blind. Hitch stares out
          hoping for some human moment to spy on. He's restless...
                         
          Peggy ushers JOSEPH STEFANO, 30s, into Hitch's office.
                         
                          JOSEPH STEFANO
           Joe Stefano. Good to meet you.

          Hitchcock leaves Stefano's hand dangling in mid air and sits
          down at his desk.
                         
           JOSEPH STEFANO (CONT'D)
           Sorry I was late. My shrink session ran
           overtime. I see him every day and it's
           still not enough.
                         
                          PEGGY
           I thought only director's assistants
           needed psychiatrists, not writers.
                         
          Stefano laughs off the barb and takes a seat as Peggy slips
          out.
                         
          The two men stare at each other but Stefano's not remotely
          intimidated.
                         
                          JOSEPH STEFANO
           Do you see a shrink, Mr. Hitchcock?
                         
          Hitch's eyes follow a plume of cigar smoke curling up to the
          ceiling...
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           No.
                         
          His gaze remains pointedly fixed on the ceiling.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           I must say it boggles the mind to imagine
           what you and your "shrink" could possibly
           talk about daily.
                         
                          JOSEPH STEFANO
           The usual: sex. Rage. My mother.
                         
          Hitchcock lowers his gaze, suddenly intrigued.

          Alma sits with the Hitchcocks' ACCOUNTANT who's consulting a
          ledger. She sits at her desk in the corner of the kitchen.
                         
                          ACCOUNTANT
           There's still the federal income tax

           mention the absence of any salary while
           he's actually making the film...

          The Accountant takes off his glasses, plucking up the courage
          to look his favorite client in the eye.
                         
                          ACCOUNTANT
           Hitch wasn't exaggerating. If the film's
           a flop, you're going to have to sell the
           house.
                         
          Alma digests this.

          Alma's moved to the kitchen table and is sorting through the
          accounts herself, the dogs at her feet. Her face is now
          properly filled with concern.
                         
          Hitch enters, holding out some typed pages. Alma covers her
          worry. He puts the pages on the table next to her.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           I got Joe Stefano to write out the first
           few scenes. Why don't you take a look?
                         
          Alma takes Stefano's pages and starts to read...Hitch goes to
          the fridge and opens the door.
                         
                          ALMA

           need anything else.
                         
          He shuts the door. Leans against the fridge door. Hitch waits
          but she gives nothing away...until she off-handedly places
          the pages on the table...

          INT. PRODUCTION CODE ADMINISTRATION OFFICE - DAY
                         
          The intimidating plaque for the MPAA's "PRODUCTION CODE
          ADMINISTRATION OFFICE" on the wall.
                         
          Stefano's TITLE PAGE is tapped angrily by GEOFFREY SHURLOCK,
          70s, the much-feared administrator for the Motion Picture
          Production Code. He sits at the head of a big table with TWO
          ASSISTANTS. Sitting opposite are Hitchcock, Peggy and several
          silent PARAMOUNT EXECUTIVES.
                         
                          GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
           The Code will absolutely not permit you
           to show a knife penetrating a woman's
           flesh.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           I assure you, Geoffrey, my murders, are
           always models of taste and discretion.
                         
                          GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
           Is there any improper suggestion of
           nudity in this murder scene in the
           shower?
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           She won't be nude. She'll be wearing a
           shower cap.
                         
          Shurlock makes a note. A man utterly devoid of any sense of
          humor.

                          GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
           We might accept a shot from outside the
           bathroom window with Marion in silhouette
           above the shoulders -- provided the glass
           is frosted.
                         
          Hitch greets the suggestion with barely concealed contempt.
          Shurlock turns the page.
                         
           G EOFFREY SHURLOCK
           Then -- this scene with the toilet.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           It's completely necessary. Marion flushes
           evidence later found by her sister. It's
           a clue to the girl's disappearance.
                         
                          GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
           No American movie has ever found it
           "necessary" to show a toilet, let alone
           to flush it.
                         
          Hitch turns to Peggy and a Paramount Executive.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           Perhaps we ought to shoot the film in
           France and use a bidet instead?
                         
          No response from Shurlock's end of the room. Peggy stares
          down at the table.
                         
                          GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
           Mr. Hitchcock, if this office denies you
           a seal, and we're certainly heading in
           that direction, your movie will not be
           released in a single theater in this
           country. Will you be making jokes then?
                         
          Hitchcock gives a slow but meaningful shrug.
                         
           GEOFFREY SHURLOCK (CONT'D)
           Good. Now why don't we go all the way
           back to page two...

           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           You'll have to excuse me, doctor. I'm not

          Now Hitch claws at his tie. It's hot in here.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           It's just that, more and more lately,
           I've been having these... impulses.
                         
          The analyst's MONTBLANC pen makes a note on a pad. We notice
          that his hands are surprisingly coarse.
                         
                          ANALYST'S VOICE
           What kind of impulses?
                         
          Finally Hitchcock is still. He stares up at the ceiling.

          stack of chicken breasts and moves to an upturned GRAPEFRUIT
          HALF at the back of the shelf.

          under the hollowed out grapefruit.
                         
          He's about to devour it when he catches sight of his
          DISTORTED REFLECTION in the chrome shelving.
                         
          He backs away, disgusted at this monster before him, the

          and teases out a bulging MANILA FOLDER. A hidden stash of
          some kind.
                         
          The DESK LIGHT is switched on revealing HITCH. He carefully
          extracts the contents of the folder and lays them onto the

          A MASS OF PHOTOS OF ALL HIS BLONDE LEADING LADIES
                         
          A personal collection lovingly kept. He settles in to study
          it, picking out his favorites, arranging them in order.
          They're all in the same pose, all with hair pinned up into a
          perfect bun.
                         
          He looks at each image with intensifying desire. He's created
          all of them. Every detail.

          A row of HANDSOME ACTOR HEADSHOTS on a table. HITCH glares at
          the waiting ACTORS in the hallway through the blinds. He
          turns back to Peggy and Alma and pulls a face.

          Hitch returns to the table to ponder yet more headshots.
          Peggy shares a glance with Alma, then slides over RODDY

                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           Well, Norman is the logical extension of
           the boys in those movies. Appealing,
           sensitive, suffering the terrible burden
           of being forced to pretend to be
           something he is not.
                         
          Hitchcock's deeply-felt remark lands with Perkins.
                         
                          ANTHONY PERKINS
           My only worry is that playing Norman
           might cut too close to home.

                          ANTHONY PERKINS
           I was incredibly close to my mother. So
           close I remember wishing my father would
           drop dead. And then when I was five, he
           did just that...He keeled over from a
           heart attack.

           You see I've been guilty my whole life,

                          ANTHONY PERKINS
           Not to be prudish, but how far do you
           plan to push Norman's relationship with
           his mother?

          Hitchcock's RED SWEATING FACE as he grunts and heaves. He's
          dressed in gardening gear, laboring in the full bloom of the
          rose garden. Alma pushes a WHEELBARROW filled with manure.
                         
          She shovels the manure around the rosebushes.

           If you'll excuse me.
                         
          Alma's had enough. Janet's smile falters as she watches Alma
          get up and head to the restroom. She's unsure of what just
          happened but Hitch carries on regardless, either entirely
          oblivious or not caring at all...
                         
          INT. CHASEN'S RESTAURANT, LADIES ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Alma enters and looks in the mirror, quietly devastated. She
          looks up to find another reflection in a mirror behind her.
                         
          FULL LENGTH MIRROR
                         
          Alma is SUDDENLY TRANSFORMED into a Technicolor Hitchcock
          blonde. In a beautiful Edith Head gown, her skin is velvet
          perfection, her hair blonde and impeccable.

           Oh, come off it, old girl.
                         
          A bitchy STUDIO HEAD'S WIFE snaps Alma out of her reverie,
          joining her at the sink to powder her face.
                         
           STUDIO HEAD WIFE
           Alma, dear, how lovely to see you.

           Hello Lillian.
                         
           STUDIO HEAD WIFE
           You're looking a little pale. No wonder
           with that thing your husband's working on
           now. You can't possibly approve.
                         
          She's had a drink too many but the throwaway comment still
          hits Alma hard.

          PERFECT PINK ROSEBUSHES
                         
          Like in a Douglas Sirk movie. The same roses that are the
          `color' of Janet Leigh. Alma hovers with her secateurs for a
          moment and then starts SNIPPING off their heads with a
          Caligula-like lack of mercy.
                         
          INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - MORNING
                         
          A vase of flowers, none of them pink, in the center of the
          table. Hitch STARES into a refrigerator filled with boring
          tasteless health-conscious food.
                         
          Alma enters briskly and holds up a handwritten LIST.

           I've made a list of places where we can

          She places the list on the table.

          Hitch goes over and picks it up, and reads.

           The gardeners only once a week and
           weekends off for the driver? No.
           Absolutely not. We'll find other places
           to cut.
                         
                          ALMA
           There aren't any other places. And
           furthermore, they'll be no more shipments
           from Maxim's either. We can't afford it.
                         
          She snatches the list out of his hand.

          She leaves Hitch to resume contemplating the contents of the
          fridge...but there's nothing there to satisfy his growling
          hunger. He SLAMS the fridge and --

          Suddenly we're moving through an empty living room, prowling,
          just like in a Hitchcock movie as we hear CLUNKING, then move
          over to catch a glimpse of Ed as he drags A WOMAN'S BODY,
          feet-first up the stairs. The clunking is from her head on
          the steps, which is wrapped in her dress.
                         
          INT. ED GEIN'S HOUSE, BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Ed approaches the shower curtain, then yanks it open with a
          METALLIC SCREECH. He pushes the body into the tub. Pulls the
          dress off her head and drops it on the floor.
                         
                          ED GEIN
           Stay here. I'm going to get the knives.
                         
          We pan to REVEAL HITCHCOCK standing in the corner. He looks
          terrified but completely enthralled -- he can't resist
          creeping forward for a thorough inspection. Hitch's POV as he
          steps closer to the tub and glimpses the woman's blood-
          spattered WHITE BRA and GIRDLE.
                         
          Suddenly -- FINGERS CLUTCH the rim of the tub.

           Help me.
                         
          Hitch recoils but she LURCHES UP and GRABS his throat.

          Inside, it's a hive of quiet purposeful activity. A.D. HILTON
          GREEN escorts VERA MILES across the far side of the stage.
          She's 30, a classic blonde porcelain beauty in the Grace
          Kelly mold.

          Hitch sits in his director's chair reading a copy of the
          London Times.

           I've still got her under contract. I may

          the A.D. leads her through the maze of hazardous cables and
          light stands towards the fitting room.

          carefully. They are all perfectly nice, if a little staid.
                         
          Her eyes suddenly catch a COLORFUL SWIMSUIT on the end of the
          rail. It's striking, even a little risque. She looks at the
          price tag. It's insanely expensive.
                         
          She turns to go... stops... then impulsively turns back and
          grabs it, heading into the changing room and closing the door
          behind her.

          She unhooks her bra and crosses to hang it on a hook right
          near the HOLE where we just saw Hitchcock's eye. His eye is
          gone, only darkness from the other side. Vera feels a chill

          As he escorts her onto the soundstage, Tony comes up to greet
          them.
                         
                          ANTHONY PERKINS
           I want to thank you again for this
           opportunity, Mr. Hitchcock.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           It's just "Hitch", Tony. Hold the cock.
                         
          Janet caught that -- she's clearly amused. Tony gives her a
          gracious peck on the cheek.

           and girl nextdoor...
                         
          Janet flicks a glance back at Hitch.
                         
                          JANET LEIGH
           And we're about to move to a whole new
           neighborhood.
                         
          Already, Tony can't help feel a little excluded from Hitch
          and Janet's little clique. Hitch ushers them across the
          soundstage where the crew are assembling.

          He steers her towards a line of laughing CREW MEMBERS forming
          a circle with the rest of the cast.
                         
          He takes Janet by the hand, placing her right next to him and
          officiously raises his right hand. The cast and crew duly
          follow suit, all except for Vera.

          Everyone cracks up, but Hitchcock's only interested in the
          reaction of his new blonde, standing in pride of place, right
          beside him.

          She looks out at the swimming pool, sparkling in the
          sunlight... then turns to the expensive-looking SHOPPING BAG

          vigorous, surprisingly so.
                         
          She drives the length of the pool, her arms slashing through
          the water with increasing speed, her feet kicking out with
          rising intensity... harder and harder... faster and faster...

                          ANTHONY PERKINS
           Now, Hitch, explain to me why I'm
           watching Marion undress?
                         
                          JANET LEIGH
           I feel like I should take offense at
           that.
                         
          She and Tony laugh. Hitch's eyes light up at this display of
          mischief from her.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           I don't know...Perhaps as a boy, Norman
           secretly watched his mother preparing for
           her nightly bath.
                         
                          JANET LEIGH
           Maybe there was a transom over the
           bathroom door?
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           Yes -- one he could access with a chair
           so long as he was stealthy.

           Well, a boy's first glimpse of a naked
           woman is usually his mother.

           You're the actor. You figure it out.
                         
          Tony flinches at Hitch's brusque response.
                         
          They arrive at the set wall, where Hitch removes a painting
          to reveal the PEEPHOLE.
                         
                          JANET LEIGH
           Hitch, I have a question. Why is the hole
           much larger on this side?
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           All the better to see you at the greatest
           possible angle my dear...
                         
          Janet simply steps up and presses her face to the hole. Hitch
          studies her profile, quietly thrilled at her curiosity. Tony
          hangs back, watching Hitch watching her...
                         
                          JANET LEIGH
           Wow. You really do your research, don't

                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           It's just my Jesuit work ethic.
                         
          He takes a quick peek through the hole now too...then puts
          the painting carefully back into place over it.

                          (SHARP)
           No. They have to look like they were
           bought at Sears and Roebuck. I want every
           woman in the audience to look up at Janet
           having sex with John Gavin and think,
           `that could be me'.
                         
          Janet reads the label. It's "Maidenform."

           This is the brand I wear.

          HITCHCOCK'S HANDS have now become THE CAMERA, recording the
          scene already underway and now watched by HITCHCOCK, his
          DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY and CREW from across the stage...
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (V.O.)
           We pan over and discover John and Janet
           on the bed.
                         
          ...the camera moves to Janet and John making out on the bed.
          It's serious stuff.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           She'll be wearing only her undergarments
           and a large glow of satisfaction...
                         
          JANET smiles up at John contentedly.

          Alma drives the gleaming black Cadillac through the UNIVERSAL
          GATES and pulls up to the production office outside the
          stage.
                         
          EXT. HITCHCOCK OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY
                         
          Alma collects the script pages off the front seat and walks
          into the production office just missing Whit as he strolls
          back towards the writers building with a couple of pretty
          SECRETARIES.
                         
          Whit pauses when he spots the Hitchcocks' CADILLAC.
                         
                          WHITFIELD COOK
           You girls go on ahead.
                         
          The PRETTIEST ONE stops to make Whit light her cigarette
          before catching up with the others.

          Peggy reads the final pages while Alma inspects the

           that counts.
                         
          As she makes a few more changes to the schedule. Alma turns
          to Peggy whose face tightens as she continues reading.
          Clearly it's strong stuff.

          She puts the pages down.

           Alma, you always know the answer. Is this
           really going to work?
                         
          A candid moment between the two women... but Alma doesn't
          answer, just leaves.

          Alma emerges into the sunshine and looks across at the
          soundstage, wondering whether she should go over there...
                         
                          WHITFIELD COOK
           Hello, stranger.
                         
          She turns to see Whit leaning against the Cadillac.
                         
                          ALMA

                          ALMA
           In a state of unbridled ecstacy now that
           he's back on the set.

           Not bad. I've got eight hundred words to
           do for Reader's Digest on what it's like
           to be married to a man obsessed by
           murder.
                         
          He looks at her a moment.
                         
                          WHITFIELD COOK
           I've got a better idea.
                         
          He steps closer.
                         
           WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)
           Why don't we drive out to Santa Barbara?
           We'll have Emilio fry up those juicy
           steaks we like at El Encanto.
                         
          He playfully tugs at her sleeve.
                         
           WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)
           No shoptalk ... No silly magazine
           articles...just a wonderful meal...
                         
          Alma's expression gives away nothing as we pan over to the
          WINDOW of the production office and notice the tell-tale BEND
          in the blinds.

          Hitch looks out at Whit and Alma through the window, just
          like he did with the other couple earlier. Except this little
          interaction is far from dull.

          INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY
                         
          - and puts the grocery bags down on the counter. She listens.
          The house is eerily quiet, until, from behind --
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           Was there a line at the market?
                         
          Alma looks up, but doesn't turn round, well used to Hitch's
          cryptic ways.
                         
                          ALMA
           No. Actually, I'm back sooner than I
           expected.
                         
          She puts on an apron and gets to work, preparing dinner.

           No.

           And you shouldn't either.
                         
          Hitchcock stops. Pulls out a CELERY STICK from one of the
          bags and bites it.

           I was filming all day with John Gavin --
           a good-looking chap but, really, plywood
           is more expressive. His love scene with
           Janet may be most horrifying thing in the
           picture.

          He takes another BITE, searching her face for some tell-tale
          sign of guilt.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           Even your friend Whitfield Cook would be
           better in the scene.
                         
                          ALMA
           You should tell Whit that. He'd be
           flattered.
                         
          She gets to work preparing a salad. Hitch studies the back of
          her tiny, vulnerable neck, the delicate sinews and muscles as
          they rise and flex.

                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           Maybe I was too dismissive about your
           friend Whitfield's book. Perhaps he and
           Elizabeth could come over this weekend
           and he can walk me through it.
                         
          Alma's radar activates but Hitch continues oh-so-
          nonchalantly.

           Lovely woman, Elizabeth...
                         
          He carefully folds his blanket as if wrapping a murder
          victim. She's not exactly sure what he's implying but she
          knows she doesn't like it.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

           I'll see how my day shapes up.
                         
          She turns onto her side away from him. Pulls the blankets
          around her, her eyes still WIDE OPEN.

          Janet emotes for Hitchcock's CAMERA while "driving" a PARTIAL
          CAR, being rocked by STAGE HANDS.
                         
          Peggy and other CREW time and mark the takes. ELECTRICIANS
          AND GAFFERS turn mounted lamps that rake across Janet's
          worried face like car headlights.

           You could return the money secretly, but
           what would be the point?
                         
          He wipes his brow, getting more intense...
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           You, Marion Crane. The prim and proper
           girl who's always been so tight and
           respectable. So perfect and untouchable.
           Well, they know all about your dirty
           little secret, don't they? Your messy,
           sticky lunchtime trysts. Yes, your boss
           Mr. Lowery could even smell the sex on
                          YOU--
                         
          SUDDENLY THE REAR SCREEN film breaks and a frame burns.
                         
          It's a good thing because Janet is starting to look a little
          uncomfortable -- was that meant to be funny? As technicians
          yell and hustle, Hitchcock turns to Peggy --

           He starts by choosing your hairstyle and
           clothes and then he wants to choose your
           friends and decide how many children you
           should have.
                         
          Janet finds this a little hard to believe. Vera leans in,
          lowering her voice.

           That poor, tortured soul Jimmy Stewart
           played in Vertigo? That's Hitch, only
           younger, slimmer and better-looking.
                         
          That may well be true but it doesn't bother Janet.

           Compared to Orson Welles, he's a
           sweetheart.
                         
          They both turn, sensing something -- and see HITCHCOCK'S
          DISTINCTIVE SHADOW PROFILE in the hallway. The shadow
          lingers, then recedes like in a scary ghost story.

          They laugh nervously.

          Alma comes in from her gardening, and settles on the sofa
          with a cup of tea, a circled copy of TV Guide next to her.
                         
          On television -- the 1950 Hitchcock classic Stage Fright.
          The credits come up: "Screenplay by Whitfield Cook,
          Adaptation by Alma Reville."
                         
          Alma watches, thrilled at the sight of her name and Whit's
          together.
                         
          ON THE TV
                         
          The words "DIRECTED BY ALFRED HITCHCOCK" overwhelm the small
          screen. Alms puts down her fork, no longer hungry.
          INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, HALLWAY - DAY
                         
          ALMA heads back to the kitchen, only to pause at the open
          door to Hitch's study -- there's something on the desk.

          THE HITCHCOCK BLONDES
                         
          Hitch's personal collection. Alma enters and starts to go
          through them. Each photo is turned over a little more roughly
          than the last. It's hard to tell whether she's more angry at
          the photos or the fact that they've been deliberately left
          for her to find...
                         
          Alma takes off an earring, picks up the phone and starts to
          dial...

          As the crew prepares the car set to go again, Hitch strides
          over to PEGGY who's dialing a phone.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           What's the hold up?
                         
                          PEGGY
           It's still engaged.
                         
          He takes the phone himself just as Vera Miles emerges from
          her dressing room, script in hand.
                         
                          VERA MILES
           Hitch, I'm stuck on Lila's first scene. I
           don't know how strongly I should confront
           Sam and the detective and I --

          He turns his back on her and dials. The ENGAGED TONE blares
          in his ear. His eyes narrow at some crew members fussing with
          bits of LIGHT and SOUND EQUIPMENT.

          He raps the receiver button, more intensely this time, and
          redials.

          But Alma's still on the phone to Whit, basking in his charm.
          Her feet are up. There's a drink in her hand.
                         
           WHITFIELD COOK (ON PHONE)
           Well, I think that sounds like a fabulous
           idea. We'll have a late lunch. I'll make
           the reservation for one thirty.

          She hangs up, toying with her earring, feeling better already
          when the PHONE rings again very quickly. She picks up without
          even thinking --

          Pudgy fingers clench the coiled PHONE CORD as we move up to
          Hitch's face. He's silent as a burglar, not even daring to
          breathe...

           Whit? Is that you?
                         
          The blood drains from Hitch's face as he very slowly and
          carefully replaces the receiver. His mind starts to spin.
          He's got to get out of there...
                         
          CROSSING THE STAGE
                         
          Hitch lurches towards the production office, starting to
          sweat, but his path is blocked by GRIPS laying cables. The
          set is suddenly a cacophony of noise and chaos.
                         
          A PR FLACK appears --

          Hitch brushes past him to find another route but more grips
          are moving a ladder. He turns, kicks a platter of healthy
          snacks out of the way, only for an ARCLIGHT to swivel in his
          face and blind him.

          HITCH exits the soundstage doors, only to find the humorless
          face of BARNEY BALABAN blocking his office door.
                         
                          BARNEY BALABAN
           Hello, Hitch. How's the picture? I'm

           It's a wonder you can hear anything over
           the noise coming from the Shurlock
           office.
                         
          Balaban offers up his handkerchief. Hitchcock waves it away
          even though he's now covered in sweat.
                         
                          BARNEY BALABAN
           I shouldn't be in a position of just
           hearing things, Hitch. It's time you
           showed me some footage.

           Your contract also says Paramount isn't

          She turns to see Hitch wedged uncomfortably into his seat.

           just how diabolical Herr Hitler was.
                         
          She notices him eyeing the half-eaten bag of CANDY CORN on
          the dashboard (the kind Norman Bates enjoys throughout
          "Psycho".)

           Help yourself.
           (letting him in on it)
           I pinched them from Tony's dressing room.
                         
          He takes one and chews it curiously.

           So this is what they eat at the drive-
           ins...
                         
          He takes the whole bag and sets to work, popping them in one
          after the other.
                         
                          JANET LEIGH
           I thought you only ate Fauchon chocolate.

          He's so deadpan but now there's no way to tell if he's joking
          or not. She puts the car into gear, sensing his despair.

           I don't mind that he uses his obsession

           when he uses it against me.
                         
                          WHITFIELD COOK
           He's like any great artist. Impossible to

           Did you know when we started out I was

           director.
                         
          Whit watches as she picks up some sand, lets it run through
          her fingers...

           I cast her as the lead in Vertigo. Then

           pregnant.
                         
          He screws up the empty bag of candy and looks over at Janet.
          Then, almost like a child --

          Alma enters the beach house cautiously and looks around. It
          is old and falling apart with only a few functional
          furnishings.
                         
                          WHITFIELD COOK
           I'm just leasing it for the offseason. A
           place to get away from the wife and kid
           and write.

           You might find that room interesting.
                         
          Alma looks. The door is partially open -- she sees the one
          conspicuously new item of furniture. A double bed.
                         
                          ALMA

           perfect hideaway.
                         
          She lets this sink in, entranced by the incredible view and
          the crashing surf.
                         
          Then, she steps out onto the deck and up to one of the
          typewriters. Gives the key an approving TAP.

          It's his collection of PHOTOS by the TELEPHONE. They're all
          neatly stacked.

          Finally, the sound of the car comes up the driveway.
                         
          He turns onto his side and pulls up the blankets, listening
          to the sound of the front door ... and Alma's footsteps down
          the hall.
                         
          She quietly slips into the bathroom and shuts the door before
          turning the light on. He watches her shadow through the strip
          of light at the bottom of door.
                         
          When the bathroom light switches off again Hitch hurriedly
          closes his eyes.

          He silently picks up her HANDBAG and takes it to the window.
          Using the moonlight he searches its contents. Car keys.
          Lipstick. Purse.
                         
          And the first few pages of a story outline:

          A GLISTENING MOUND OF FOIE GRAS spooned into Hitchcock's
          mouth straight from the MAXIM'S OF PARIS tin. Hitch stands in
          the glare of the open fridge, a beast feeding in its cave,
          shoving in mouthful after mouthful. It's almost pornographic
          in its indulgence.
                         
          GEIN steps out of the shadows and puts a comforting hand on

           are awfully like things we already did
           better hundreds of years ago in The Lady
           Vanishes. And your villain is weak. But
           the biggest failure is the relationship

          Alma is entirely stunned. Hitchcock has delivered the killer
          blow he intended. He gets up and goes over to the garden

          Around them, the crew frantically finalize the CAMERA and
          LIGHT SETUPS. MALE CREW MEMBERS look uncomfortable and
          excited by the unprecedented sight of a virtually nude movie

          Saul Bass comes over with his boards and Hitch and he discuss

           Ah. There's our murderess.
                         
          Into frame steps Anthony Perkins' FEMALE STUNT DOUBLE, MARGO,
          wearing a gingham dress, silver wig and BLACK MAKEUP TO MASK
          HER FACE. She wields a large PROP KNIFE and almost blocks our
          view of Janet in the white-tiled stall.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

                          JANET LEIGH
           My mother always said, "Have confidence
           in yourself and you can lick anything."
                         
          Hitchcock takes Janet's hand, and with tremendous sincerity :
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           My mother used to say the same thing.

           Let's go for a take. Quiet everyone.
                         
          Over and over, Margo attacks with the knife and Janet tries
          deflecting the blows but both women are timid and Janet is
          clearly guarding her modesty and covering her body.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           Cut. More intensely. Let's go again.
                         
          Margo's KNIFE comes at Janet uncertainly and every which way.
          Naked and exposed, Janet defends against the knife blows as
          they come at her but Margo's still pulling her punches--
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           No. More angry. You are possessed with

          Everyone falls silent, unsure how to respond. Hitchcock HOLDS
          OUT HIS HAND.

           Props. Bring in more blood.
                         
          A FEMALE MAKEUP ASSISTANT squirts more CHOCOLATE SYRUP
          "blood" onto Janet from a PLASTIC BOTTLE OF BOSCO.

                          CREW MEMBER
           Ready, sir.
                         
          Hitchcock nods. The camera whirs. Hitchcock hoists the knife
          into the air with terrifyingly convincing power and
          malevolence.
                         
          THE SHOWER CURTAIN GETS YANKED BACK --
                         
          We see in the shower from Hitchcock's POV not Janet but
          GEOFFREY SHURLOCK. Hitchcock SLASHES the censor a killer blow
          that sends him reeling.
                         
          THE SHOWER CURTAIN GETS YANKED BACK AGAIN --
                         
          Shurlock is replaced by BARNEY BALABAN. Hitchcock stabs him
          with unleashed fury and hate.
                         
          THE SHOWER CURTAIN GETS YANKED BACK AGAIN --
                         
          WHIT turns, he's naked and smiling. Hitch plunges the knife
          into his back, and he drops, revealing ALMA, arms around his
          waist.
          THE SHOWER CURTAIN GETS YANKED BACK AGAIN --

          gives the `performance' of a lifetime.
                         
          Hitchcock stops stabbing. His heart pounds. He's soaked with
          sweat. The only sound is the drip-drip-drip of the shower...

          Rita escorts the shaken and exhausted Janet off set, passing
          Vera who's witnessed the whole thing. She's wearing a
          bathrobe. Janet gives her a look as if to say `Now I

          He staggers towards the water cooler, fumbling for a cup.
                         
          Ed steps forward and pours him some water, pats his shoulder.

           I know you told me only to call in an
           emergency, but I'm not sure how else to
           describe this.
                         
          Hitch lies slumped on the floor. A compress over his
          forehead. His head lolls to one side as he slips in and out
          of consciousness...
                         
           FADE TO BLACK.

          Disarray on the set.
                         
          MARTIN BALSAM watches as SAUL BASS, cameraman JACK RUSSELL
          and A.D. HILTON GREEN argue about the best way to proceed
          with the staircase sequence. Hitch is conspicuous by his
          absence.
                         
          As they bicker we find Tony Perkins off to one side, sitting
          in his Mrs. Bates costume, unable to cope. He puts the wig
          back on his head. There, that feels better...
                         
          Balsam's finally had it with all the arguing. He walks off
          past Peggy who's arriving with the PHONE.

           It's official. The inmates are running
           the asylum.
                         
          Peggy hands Hilton the phone.

           Hilton. I have Mr. Hitchcock for you.
                         
          She gives him a warning look. "Watch out. He's in a terrible
          mood." He waves away her concern. It can't be that bad.
                         
                          HILTON GREEN
           Hey there, Hitch. We're still working on
           it.
           (looking over at the
                          CONTINUING ARGUMENT)

          boards on a bed tray. The phone receiver is pressed to his

           We tried it ten different ways and it

           No. It has to be a high angle. You'll tip
           off the big surprise! Just get the
           process shot.
                         
          Hitch slams down the phone.

          He shakily tries to get to his feet.

          Crew members sit around eating donuts. Assistant director
          Hilton Green and cameraman Jack Russell are still arguing
          over the mechanics of the shot with more crew members joining
          in. It's near pandemonium.
                         
          Then Alma steps in the door, and everything stops. Every crew
          member snaps to attention as Alma passes by. It's like the
          school principal arriving after the substitute teacher has
          lost control.

           salaries.
                         
          Alma takes a seat in Hitch's DIRECTOR'S chair. As her eyes
          dart around the set, it's clear that she IS TAKING EVERYTHING
          IN. Peggy flanks her.

          Hilton looks at Russell. Perfect. He sets ANTHONY PERKINS in

          Hitchcock lies in bed, tossing and turning, the fever only

           Closer.
                         
          Hitch gets down on his hands and knees. He runs his
          fingertips across the smooth white tiles. They start to
                         COLLECT --
                         
          GRAINS OF SAND

          Hitch gets up, opens the medicine cabinet and takes out a
          BOTTLE OF BAYER ASPIRIN.
                         
          He empties the tablets into the sink and very carefully,
          sweeps the SAND into the aspirin bottle. He caps it, slips it
          into his robe pocket and turns off the light.

          He takes a step towards Hitch's empty chair, but Alma moves
          to block his path. It may be a small gesture, but it's highly

          steps out into the sunlight not far behind them. As she

           Mrs. Hitchcock?
                         
          She turns to see Janet walking over in Capri pants and a
          sleeveless top. She's carrying an elegantly wrapped package.
                         
                          JANET
           I hope you don't mind. I heard Hitch was
           sick so I got him a little something.

           Janet, you've been very... professional.
           It hasn't gone unappreciated.

          sincerity.
                         
          She can't help but notice the second glances Janet is
          provoking from passers-by now...
                         
          She's an impossible rival for any woman.

          On the stereo. Alma finds Hitch on the sofa swaddled in a
          blanket and eating ICE CREAM.
                         
                          ALMA
           May I turn that down?
                         
          She silences the stereo. Hitch doesn't react.
                         
                          ALMA (CONT'D)
           You'll be pleased to know order has been
           restored.
                         
          He still doesn't look at her, masticating loudly.
                         
                          ALMA (CONT'D)
           A thank you would be nice.

                          ALMA
           I already cancelled the wrap party.
           That'll save us two thousand right there.

           and cake.
                         
          She pulls at the bowl of ice cream. He refuses to let go.

           With good reason.

          He slowly pulls the ASPIRIN BOTTLE from his robe pocket,
          building suspense as he unscrews the lid and pours SAND into
          a tiny pile on the coffee table in front of him.

          He puts down the bottle, looking for a reaction.
                         
                          ALMA
           That's where Whit and I are writing. He's

           "Psycho"?
                         
          She reaches for the ASPIRIN BOTTLE to throw it away but Hitch
          grabs it first --
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK

           Don't be absurd. He's working on
           something new and needs a little help,
           that's all.

           Might I remind you that I have weighed-in
           on every aspect of this film so far, as I
           have done on every picture you've done in
           the last three decades. And the first
           time you show the film, it will be my
           notes that you want. I celebrate with you
           if the reviews are good and I cry for you
           if they are not. I host your parties and
           put up with those fantasy romances with
           your leading ladies. And when you're out
           promoting this film around the world, I
           will stand beside or, rather, slightly
           behind you, smiling endlessly for the
           press even when I'm ready to drop, being
           gracious to people who look through me as
           if I were invisible because all they can
           see is the grand and glorious "Alfred
           Hitchcock."

           Now, for the first time in years, I dare
           to work on something that isn't "an
           Alfred Hitchcock Production" and I'm met
           with accusation and criticisms. This work
           I'm doing with Whit gives me pleasure and
           purpose.

          in the gathering gloom. He's not the only one who can deliver
          a killer blow.

          A NAKED LIGHT BULB dangles from the ceiling as STAGE HANDS

          Hitch watches as VERA reaches out to touch the shoulder of
          Mrs. Bates. We zoom in on her as she reacts in silent horror,
          her HAND flying up to hit the light bulb, throwing crazy
          shadows all over the set.

          She considers the question and the man asking it, sensing
          something different about him now. She continues wiping off
          her make-up.
                         
                          VERA MILES
           Unlike Grace Kelly, I can pick up my dry
           cleaning. I've got a family, Hitch. A
           home. That will always mean more to me
           than all of this.

          Hitch gives a very slight bow, touches her on the shoulder,
          then leaves. Vera watches him go, struck by his rare show of
          vulnerability.
          EXT. BEACH HOUSE, SANTA BARBARA - DAY
                         
          Wind blows sand off the dunes. Alma sits in the parked car
          outside the beach house, contemplating the typed pages on the
          seat next to her. An inkling that they may not be as magical
          as she had hoped.
                         
          No matter. She checks her reflection in the rearview and
          applies some lipstick, readying herself.
                         
          She collects the pages and heads up the steps to the deck.
          She sees two typewriters and paper, but no sign of Whit.
          Something doesn't feel right.
                         
          She turns and in the bedroom, through the window, she sees
          Whitfield Cook making love to a young woman -- it is the
          pretty SECRETARY from the studio lot. Alma and Whit's eyes
          meet. Whit is horrified at being caught.
                         
          Alma ducks her head, wheels around in shock.

          She struggles to get the key in the ignition. He puts his
          hand desperately on the car door.

           WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)
           Alma -- you're incredibly talented. But,
           after all... we want him to read the
           script with an open mind.
                         
                          ALMA
           Oh, I wouldn't worry about that, Whit.
                         
          She starts the car and drives off.
                         
          Whit watches, deflated, knowing he's ruined everything, his
          receding figure swallowed up by flickering white light...
                         
          INT. SCREENING ROOM, PARAMOUNT STUDIOS - DAY
                         
          WE PLAY THIS SCENE ONLY OVER THE FACES OF A SMALL INVITED
          AUDIENCE -- THEIR EXPRESSIONS TELL US THAT THE FOOTAGE THEY
          ARE SEEING IS NOT GOING OVER WELL. NOT AT ALL.
                         
          Lew sits with Barney Balaban and two executives. Lew
          discreetly checks his watch out of boredom. Shurlock and his
          two Assistants look appalled. Composer BERNARD HERRMANN, late
          40s, prickly, sits in the back row looking suicidal. He
          glances back at Hitchcock who stands near the screening room
          door looking worse, if that could be possible.
                         
          EXT. SCREENING ROOM, PARAMOUNT STUDIOS - LATER
                         
          Shurlock exits and approaches Hitchcock who's waiting in the
          foyer.
                         
                          GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
           You're going to have to cut all that
           nudity.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           What nudity? It was suggested.
                         
                          GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
           I definitely saw that knife jabbing her.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           We did no such shot.
                         
                          GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
           I'd stake my reputation on it. I'm
           recommending you cut the shower scene
           entirely.
                         
          Hitchcock is livid but holds his tongue.

           I'll go over it frame by frame and set up
           another screening.
                         
          But Shurlock is already walking away...
                         
          Wasserman emerges from the screening room conversing with
          BALABAN. Hitch searches their expressions for some indication
          but Balaban strides off without saying a single word to him.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           What's the verdict?
                         
                          LEW WASSERMAN
           Let's just say it was a four-letter
           review and it wasn't `good'.
                         
          The harsh reality devastates Hitchcock.
                         
           LEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D)
           Screw him. It's too late for Paramount to
           back out no matter what Balaban says.
                         
          Hitch just stands there.
                         
           LEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D)
           The other route is to recut it as a two-
           parter for the TV series. Because of the
           budget and the Hitchcock name, we stand a
           good chance of breaking even.
                         
          Still, Hitch doesn't say a word.
                         
           LEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D)
           Look, I made Jimmy Stewart a millionaire
           of Winchester 73 and that was a dog. At
           least I could sit through your picture.
                         
          Hitch stares bleakly off. He can't help noticing the KIM
          NOVAK-TYPE he spied on earlier outside, hand in hand and
          kissing her date.

           More importantly, what does Alma think?
                         
          INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY
                         
          Alma sits with the Hitchcocks' ACCOUNTANT going over the
          books again, looking at the revised figures. They close the
          books and sit back and look at each other.
                         
                          ALMA

           We'll just have to wait and see how the
           movie turns out.
                         
          Alma gets up and crosses to the window. Stares out at the
          pool reflecting a leaden sky... and the clumps of dead leaves
          floating across its surface...
                         
                          ALMA

          The dogs, GEOFFREY and STANLEY, lap away at a water bowl in
          the study. A splash or two of something is added to the bowl
          from above. It's being poured from Hitch's brandy glass.
                         
                         HITCH
                         
          pours himself another glass, leaving the dogs lapping happily
          away as he goes over to the Steinway Grand. There's a bank of
          silver-framed PHOTOS on top. He pauses to take a proper look
          at them.
                         
          His and Alma's life together in movies. Smiling at Premieres
          with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. On vacation with Jimmy and
          Gloria Stewart. At a black tie event with Ingrid Bergman and
          Gregory Peck.
                         
          But it's the PHOTOGRAPH tucked away at the back that he wants
          to see most.
                         
          A BLACK AND WHITE PUBLICITY STILL taken on the set of The
          Mountain Eagle in 1926. He picks it up and looks at it:
                         
          The young Hitchcock in front of the camera, dramatically
          calling "Action!" on his first film. His eyes don't have to
          move far to find ALMA, standing just behind him, making notes
          on her clipboard, the same intense, serious look on her face.
                         
          They look so young...
                         
          Hitch turns to look out the window, thoughtful -- Hitch's
          POV. It's SNOWING outside.

          by a single oil lamp.

          We find Gein sitting at his workbench. Hitchcock is perched
          on a stool nearby watching him.
                         
          Trash and newspapers are piled everywhere. There is grime and
          dark stains on the cabinets and counters.

           the doors and leave the world behind.
                         
          Hitch watches Gein as he threads a needle, stitching
          something expertly together. He notices there's no hint of a
          tremble in Gein's hands.

          feeling a chill.

          As we hear CARS pull up -- a lot of them. The sound of MEN,
          shouting. Flashing RED AND BLUE LIGHTS. LOUD KNOCKING at the

          all shapes and sizes...JARS OF PRESERVED BODY PARTS...and TWO
          SEVERED HANDS, FOLDED IN PRAYER.

          He exits with the dogs padding after him. She turns back to
          the screen and more of that stilted, mannered dialogue.
                         
          Tears well in her eyes.
                         
          EXT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          A full moon. The ONLY LIGHT from inside the house is the one
          in the kitchen.
                         
          We glimpse the figure in the window. A corpulent man in
          profile, like a Hopper painting.
          INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - LATER
                         
          Hitch sits in his nightgown, pushing some VEGETABLES around
          his plate -- his healthy midnight snack.
                         
          Alma enters in her robe. Hitch watches her. She goes to the
          fridge, opens the PRODUCE DRAWER and from under the brussel
          sprouts pulls out a tiny hidden jar of BELUGA CAVIAR.
                         
          She gets the crackers, a plate and a spoon and sits down at
          the table next to him.
                         
                          ALMA
           I don't think I can stand both of us
           being maudlin.
                         
          She fixes several crackers, each with an appropriate dollop
          of caviar on top, and puts the plate in the middle.
                         
                          ALMA (CONT'D)
           There is one solution to all this, you
           know.
                         
          She offers him one of the crackers.
                         
                          ALMA (CONT'D)
           We could both get to work -- together.
                         
          Tentatively, Hitch accepts it.
                         
                          ALMA (CONT'D)
           That tiresome little Hitchcock imitation
           I've been helping Whit finish is done.
                         
          Hitch remains quiet, delicately consuming his cracker.
                         
                          ALMA (CONT'D)
           So I suggest, for everyone's sake, we
           start whipping Psycho into shape
           tomorrow. You may not be the easiest man
           to live with but you know how to cut a
           picture better than anyone.
                         
          Hitch puts the lid back on the caviar.

          A series of quick shots as the editing room comes to life :
          CANS OF FILM ARE BROUGHT IN BY ASSISTANTS, STRIPS OF
          CELLULOID ARE PULLED OUT, INSPECTED AND MARKED WITH CHALK
          WHILE OTHERS ARE SPLICED TOGETHER.
                         
          HITCH and editor GEORGE TOMASINI wait quietly like
          schoolboys, while Alma reviews the footage on the Moviola.
                         
                          ALMA
           You'll need to cut those six or seven
           frames where she blinks after she's
           supposed to be dead.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           We've seen the footage a thousand times.
           She doesn't blink.

          their way down the line, inspecting each new assembly.

           Cut it tighter. The minute I lose one
           person I've lost the whole audience.
                         
          TWO PAIRS OF HANDS. Hitchcock's and Alma's. They work like a
          pair of twenty-year-olds at a pair of MOVIOLAS cutting the
          picture.

           No. This isn't Vertigo, Bernie. This is
           different. The images have to work on
           their own.

          We move across HITCH, ALMA, TOMASINI and PEGGY'S faces as
          they watch the Moviola.
                         
          The impact of the music is instant and unimaginably powerful.
                         
          They are all moved. Gripped. Stunned.
                         
          Hitchcock looks down. Peggy is gripping his arm tightly.

           It's getting there.
                         
          Alma turns to him and Hitch nods slightly. Was that the
          tiniest acknowledgement that her instinct may have been

           stabbing and the nudity. We're denying
           your seal, Mr. Hitchcock.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           I take your opinion very seriously. But
           what you think you're seeing is purely
           informed by the power of suggestion. I
           assure you that once you view the final
           version with Mr. Herrmann's lovely,
           lyrical score...
                         
                          GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
           A "lyrical score" won't change my
           opinion. All that innuendo and half-naked
           groping -- really, Hitch.

          Shurlock gestures his staff out. Hitch moves closer.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           I have a modest proposal to make. If
           you're willing to leave the shower
           sequence as it is, I will reshoot the
           opening love scene to your exact
           specifications.
                         
          Shurlock reacts with surprise.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           In fact, I'd welcome your personal
           supervision on the set.
                         
          Shurlock is more flattered than he'd care to admit.

                          PEGGY
           He's been harassing you since you
           announced this project, you invite him to
           the set, and he doesn't even show up?
           What did you tell him?
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           That I respected him. Deeply.
                         
          Peggy laughs. Now she understands.

           Ladies and gentleman, that is a wrap.
           Thank you all.
                         
          The crew starts breaking things down. The actors are baffled.
          Janet walks over to him.
                         
                          JANET LEIGH

           No need. The charade is over.
                         
          Hitch holds out his arm for her and walks her back to the
          dressing room.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           See, I wasn't that much of a monster to

                          JANET LEIGH
           Not at all.
                         
          He offers his hand and she shakes it, determined to be
          professional to the end.
                         
           JANET LEIGH (CONT'D)
           I just hope I was sufficiently loyal to
           the cause.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           Worthy of a Purple Heart, my dear.
                         
          She leans in and gives him a peck on the cheek. A moment of
          unexpected heaven that leaves Hitch speechless.

          She walks away to her dressing room. Hitch watches as she
          steps inside and closes the door.
                         
          After a moment we hear a PIERCING SCREAM --
                         
          INT. JANET LEIGH'S DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Janet recoils at the sight of A MRS. BATES PROTOTYPE "PROP
          MASK" grinning lewdly from her chair, and wearing one of
          Janet's brassieres.
                         
          Hitchcock peeks inside as crew members come running.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           I hope you don't mind, I told Mrs. Bates
           she could have your dressing room.

          She can't believe she's been caught out. She closes the door
          on everyone... and then after a moment SCREAMS AGAIN... but
          this time not out of shock.

           We have our seal from Shurlock's office.

           Now, we lead the lambs to the slaughter.

                          LEW WASSERMAN
           The front office confirmed. They're only
           opening the movie in two theatres, as we
           suspected. And no premiere. If we don't
           get word of mouth we're dead.

           Furthermore, because Psycho is so
           terrifying and unique, the guards can

           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (V.O.)
           "To further emphasize the sheer,
           unrelenting shock and suspense of Psycho,
           right after the closing title "THE END,"
           we strongly recommend that you close your
           house curtains over the screen for a full
           thirty seconds."
                         
          Inside the theatre, the manager makes sure the CURTAINS open
          and close correctly then turns to face the vast, empty
          auditorium.

          powerless.
                         
          There's nothing for him to do but wait.

          And then -- finally -- the sweetest sound in the world A
          BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM.
                         
          Soon the WHOLE AUDIENCE SCREAMS IN TERROR... then breaks into
          LAUGHTER again... nervous laughter this time, the best kind.

          leaving only relief and satisfaction... and making way for a

                          THEATER MANAGER
           Mr. Hitchcock, what do I do now that my
           wife won't take a shower after seeing
           your movie?
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           Have her dry-cleaned.
                         
          Laughter as Lew appears.
                         
                          LEW WASSERMAN
           I just got off the phone with Balaban. I
           couldn't resist telling him we're sold
           out for the next two weeks.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           What did he say?
                         
                          LEW WASSERMAN
           He said "Tell Hitch congratulations. A
           well deserved triumph as we always knew."
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           "As we always knew..."
                         
          The two friends a look.
                         
                          PEGGY
           Does this mean I can take the weekend off
           now?
                         
          Hitch playfully shrugs, "we'll see".
                         
                          THEATRE MANAGER
           I'm sorry, Mr. Hithcock but there are
           photographers outside. They heard you
           were here.

          A few photographers snap Hitch as he emerges and heads past
          the line of ticket buyers towards the waiting car. Hitchcock
          gestures for Alma to take her place next to him instead of
          behind him. She shyly waves him away but eventually, and
          appreciatively, relents.
                         
          As the flashbulbs start to POP --

                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           Our career, Alma.
                         
          He looks into her eyes with nothing but deep, intense
          gratitude and joy. As more flashbulbs pop --
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           I've realized I'll never be able to find
           a Hitchcock blonde as beautiful as you.
                         
                          ALMA
           You do realize I've been waiting decades
           to hear you say that.
                         
          He gives her a gentle peck.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK

          It is a utilitarian institutionalized dining room. Several

           What?
                         
                          ORDERLY
           Claudine and I are driving to Chicago
           with her folks to see that Psycho movie.
                         
          The Attendant pulls the orderly aside, and whispers to him,
          nodding toward Ed. The Orderly's jaw drops! It is the coolest
          thing he's ever heard. He looks at Ed like he's a movie star.
          Meanwhile, Ed yawns, content. Utterly oblivious.
                         
                          CHET
           I think you're the happiest guy I've ever

                          ED GEIN
           I'll tell you. You live your life, and
           it's unbearable sometimes but there's
           this secret, Chet; a big secret no one
           else knows or wants to tell...
           (he leans a little closer)
           ... there is a God and he's so big and
           powerful, he doesn't always remember
           you're there...
                         
          He takes a huge bite blueberry pie.
                         
           ED GEIN (CONT'D)
           ... but if you can get his attention and
           he sees you're suffering, he'll notice
           and he'll take care of you. My mother
           used to tell me -- she's passed, God
           bless her -- the one thing God truly
           loves and understands is suffering.
                         
          He takes a long drink of milk.
                         
           ED GEIN (CONT'D)
           After all, he invented it.
                         
          We pan to discover HITCHCOCK has been watching all this. He
          turns to the camera.

           And so, gentle viewer, Psycho -- the
           picture everyone predicted would bring me
           to wrack and ruin -- was such a hit that
           Alma and I got to... Well, let's just say
           that we got to keep our house -- and the
           swimming pool. And the same critics who
           despised it went on to call it one of my
           greatest achievements.
                         
          He produces a CIGAR and wanders towards the exit doors.

           Of course for me, it was just another

           But you know what they say in Hollywood:
           "You're only as good as your last
           picture." So, now, if you'll excuse me, I
           must toddle off to begin the exhaustive
           search for my next project.

           Unfortunately I find myself once again

          A SMALL BIRD
                         
          Alights on his cigar tip and FLAPS its wings. Hitchcock can't
          resist blowing a sadistic plume of smoke at the bird which
          promptly flies away. He gives the camera a final
          characteristically deadpan look...

           Good evening.
                         
          The distinctive THEME TUNE to his TV show starts up and Hitch
          toddles back up the front lawn and toward the terrace, where
          Alma can be seen laying out a delicious healthy lunch...

          A burning white sun high in a clear blue sky,
          
                                                                     PAN DOWN TO:
          
          A rundown (sixties) airport, peeling in the heat.
          
          A mad traffic jam of cars, vans, motorbikes all stopped at a checkpoint
          where a RWANDAN POLICEMAN blows his whistle, waves some and stops
          others as bored Rwandan soldiers look on.
          
          CLOSE ON: A white van pulls out of traffic, a balls-out case of line
          jumping. HORNS, OBSCENITIES.
          
          A HAND: Extends from the passenger side of the van, Rwandan francs
          pressed neatly between thumb and palm.
          
          The van stops next to the policeman.

          Mr. Rusesabagina, good morning.
          
          In the passenger seat PAUL RUSESABAGINA, late 30's, flashes a smile. He
          is dressed in a sharp blue suit (always dressed in a neat suit and tie,
          it is a matter of pride).
          
          A quick shake of hands. Money passes from one to the other.

          An airport baggage handler approaches the van.

          Zozo throws the van into gear and speeds off.

                      It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach
                      it is like the bus to Giterama.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      That is why they call it coach?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Maybe. But in business class there are
                      fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
          
                                  ZOZO
                           (impressed)
                      You have taken business class?
          
                                    PAUL
                      Many times.
          
          Suddenly, Zozo slows.
          
          Paul looks up, SEES: a gathering on the side of the road -- a large
          crowd of men dressed in exotically, yet identically colored shirts.
          They're members of the INTERAHAMWE - the Hutu Militia.
          
          
          
                                                                             3.
          (Interahamwe - the Hutu Militia will de distinguished by these wildly
          colored shirts) They chant, drink beer, dance onto the road,
          obstructing cars, threatening the occupants. Several of them perform a
          rhythmic dance - the INTERAHAMWE war dance to thumping drumbeat music
          from a boombox.
          
                                   PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Turn off.
          
          Zozo, scared, looks for a side road, studies the traffic behind.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      There is nowhere to turn, sir.                                
          As the van approaches,
          
                                   PAUL
                      Slow down.
          
          The van pulls up beside the Militia.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Boys, do you know the way to Mr.                              
                      Rutagunda's warehouse?
          
          Some Militia approach. They are suddenly friendly, helpful.
          
                                  MILITIA MAN #1
                      It is one more mile on this road.
          
          Paul reaches into his pocket, takes out some Rwandan dollars.
          
                                  PAUL
                      This is thirsty work, let me treat you to
                      some beers.
          
          As the van pulls away Zozo looks to Paul, relieved.
          
          
          INT. RUTAGANDA'S WAREHOUSE. DAY
          
          At his desk in front of a fan. GEORGE RUTAGUNDA, late 30's, huge, gold
          chains, Rolex watch, (like an African Mafia boss) but the same
          Interahamwe shirt. He squeezes an orange rind into a cup of espresso.
          
          Behind him, through his office window, the white van is being loaded
          with cases of beer.
          
          George holds out his massive shirt.
          
                                  GEORGE
                      You will join us at the rally today?
          
          Paul sits opposite, sipping coffee.
          
                                                                            4.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I will try my best George but these days
                      I have no time for rallies or politics.
          
                                  GEORGE
                      Politics is power, Paul. And money.
          
          Paul studies his watch.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Time is money, George. We need extra beer
                      today.
          
                                  GEORGE
                      Business is good at the hotel?
          
                                    PAUL
                      Very good.
          
                                  GEORGE
                      I am always glad to see you Paul.
          
          George leads Paul out into the warehouse.                                 
          As a forklift lifts A WOODEN CRATE, George angers.
          
                                  GEORGE (CONT'D)
                      Hell man, that is not beer, put it back!
          
                                  DRIVER
                      But, sir, the Carlsberg is behind...                          
                                  GEORGE
                      Forget the Carlsberg, give him Grolsch.
                           (to Paul)                                                
                      I won't charge extra.                                         
                                    PAUL
                      Thank you.
          
          The driver of the forklift, anxiously, spins the machine to return the
          crate but it slides off and CRASHES onto the floor: MACHETES, hundreds
          of them, spill out.
          
          An awkward moment then George picks one of the crude blades.
          
                                  GEORGE
                      A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents
                      each, I'll get a dollar.
          
                                    PAUL
                      At least.
          
          Off Zozo terrified.
          
                                                                              5.
          
          
          EXT. KIGALI AIRPORT TARMAC. DAY
          
          A Sabena airliner lands. Passengers disembark via a roll-up staircase.
          
          Paul's van pulls up by the luggage belt.
          
          A large polystyrene box comes down the conveyor belt. It has Brussels -
          Kigali destination stickers all over it.
          
          As Zozo picks it up, water sloshes from the lid.
          
                                  PAUL
                      The ice has melted!
          
          Zozo goes to open it.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Don't. Let's go.
          
          Paul slips money to two customs officials.
          
          
          EXT. KIGALI STREETS. DAY
          
          The van speeds through traffic. More traffic jams, Zozo edges up on the
          sidewalk. Then at an intersection they see.
          
          THE INTERAHAMWE PARADE - a mass of young men and women, most in the
          same colorful uniform. Line after line, waves all performing the
          INTERAHAMWE war dance, in wild hypnotic sync, many wave sticks, spears,
          wooden imitation guns. A large banner reads, "Hutu Power."
          
          A flatbed truck, speakers blare drumbeat music. On it GEORGE RUTAGUNDA
          dances the DANCE and waves a machete to the crowd.
          
          Zozo sinks down behind the wheel.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract
                      attention to yourself.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      Boss, some of those men are my neighbors,
                      they know I'm Tutsi.
          
          The parade passes. As they wait Paul takes out the wad of notes George
          gave him, peels off a few dollars.
                                  P
          
                                  PAUL
                      Here, Zozo, for your trouble.
          
          Zozo takes it.
          
                                                                               6.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL ENTRANCE. DAY
          
          The van turns off the street into The Milles Collines Hotel driveway
          and HONKS twice as it pulls down a short drive lined with tall shrubs.
          An ARMED GUARD rushes from his booth and lifts the gate. Perfectly
          timed. The van doesn't even have to slow as it passes. A sign on the
          guard house reads "WELCOME TO THE HOTEL MILLE COLLINES".
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Lush tropical gardens, peacocks wander the well-manicured lawns,an
          exotic African paradise. The van heads to a magnificent colonial
          building.
          
                                  PAUL (V.O.)
                      Pull up at the front door.
          
          A valet opens the front door of the hotel and looks shocked. It's
          unheard of for a service van to stop out front.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (urgent, to the valet)
                      Help Zozo.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul leads Zozo and the valet into a magnificent lobby, a tasteful
          blend of Africa and Europe. Guests stare as water sloshes and spills
          from the crate.
          
          GREGOIRE, early thirties the receptionist behind the desk throws a look
          of disapproval. Paul, imperial, snaps his finger toward him.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (re: spilled water)                                       
                      Gregoire. Take care of this.
          
          Gregoire engages a guest in chit-chat, ignores Paul.
          
                                   PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Gregoire!   See to this right away.
          
          The elevator door opens and reveals BIK the Belgian hotel manager, mid-
          40's, reading some reports. He looks up, sees Paul and Zozo carrying
          the box as they step in. Bik looks puzzled.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      It's an emergency, sir.                                        
          Now Bik sees the wet floor.
          
          
          
                                                                              7.
          
                                    BIK
                      Paul!
          
                                  PAUL
                      Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
          
          The elevator doors shut. Bik's left standing in disbelief.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL KITCHEN. DAY
          
          The crate is hefted onto a counter. The top pried off. A crowd of
          cooks gathers around Paul and Zozo as they peer in.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      Any of them make it?
          
                                  HEAD CHEF
                      Into the sink!
          
          They hoist up one end of the crate and LOBSTERS spill out. Many make
          it into the sink, but some miss and slide across the counter and fall
          onto the floor.
          
          The cooks sort the living from the dead.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      Twelve are dead.
          
                                    PAUL
                      How dead?
          
          The cooks smells a dead lobster, shakes his head no.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Dump the bad meat, save the shells, fill
                      them will ah, a stuffing, something
                      local.
          
                                  COOK
                      Cassava, and Tipali.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Yes. Call it 'fresh Scottish Lobster in a
                      cassava and Tipali crush'.
          
          Paul fixes his tie, very pleased, another crisis solved.
          
          
          INT. BANQUET ROOM/HOTEL MILLE COLLINES. DAY
          
          Paul inspects the tables' fresh flowers, sparkling crystal glasses. He
          looks to the bar - Grolsch on ice.
          
                   
          
          
                                                                            8.
          
          The sound of African drums fills the air.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul emerges, as a troupe of African male dancers in ceremonial costume
          - Leopard skin dress, ostrich feather head dress, spears and shields
          perform a greeting dance for a the American Ambassador and a crowd of
          European dignitaries.
          
          The male dancers are joined by a troupe of young female dancers in
          similar ceremonial dress. The ceremony comes to a foot stomping finale.
          The guests break into LOUD APPLAUSE. Paul flings open double doors to a
          reception room and the crowd moves in.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Mr. Ambassador, please come in.    
                                      
                                  US AMBASSADOR
                      Thank you, Paul.    
                                                     
          A UN Colonel, OLIVER, middle aged, Canadian,follows the US Ambassador.     
          The Colonel wear the blue berets and armbands of UN Peacekeepers. (all     
          UN troops will be distinguished by their bright blue berets, white
          helmets and arm bands)

                                  US AMBASSADOR

                      Please, serve the hors d'ouvres now.
          
          A waiter whispers to him.

          INT. HOTEL BAR. DAY
          
          A luxurious lounge/club called the Kigali Club - an African
          Casablanca, complete with animal heads, a statue of a mountain gorilla,
          grand piano in the corner. Rwandan Hutu army officers, (distinguished
          by their crisp khaki uniforms, in the style of the French army), arms
          dealers, government dignitaries, businessmen and reporters mingle
          freely. The few tourists stand out.
          
          PAUL heads to a table. The center of attention and conversation is
          General BIZIMUNGU, 40's, dressed in a crisp, heavily decorated
          uniform, a strong figure, relaxed, in control. 
                                      
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Paul, this scotch is exceptional.
          
                                  PAUL
                      It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I
                      thought you'd like it. Anything you need,
                      gentlemen, let me know.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Oh, Paul, talk to the coat check, please.
          
          Paul heads for the lobby. He's intercepted by an zealous young Tutsi
          reporter BENEDICT who covers the political scene for the local
          independent newspaper.
          
                                  BENEDICT
                      Paul, Paul, a moment please.   
                                          
                                  PAUL
                      Yes, Benedict, what can I do?  
                                          
                                  BENEDICT
                      Can you get me into the Ambassador's
                      reception?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'm sorry, it's a private function.
          
          Benedict takes out his reporters notebook.
          
                                  BENEDICT
                      At least tell me who is attending. The
                      newspaper will be grateful.
          
          Paul laughs.

                                  PAUL
                      I will be grateful if you keep my name
                      out of your newspaper. Wait here and you
                      will see who has attended as they leave.

          Paul fixes a floral arrangement as he passes then arrives at the clock
          room hatch.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (to the coat check)
                      Did General Bizimungu bring a briefcase?
          
                                  COAT CHECK
                      Yes, sir.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Take it to the bar storeroom. Put three
                      bottles of Glenmorangie...                                     
                            he writes it down on a pad)                              
                      ...GLEN-MOR-AN-GIE, into it.          
                                   
          Paul moves off as the coat check scurries away.
          
                                   ONNIE DENVER (O.S.)
                      Oh, Paul, Paul
          
          An American woman, CONNIE DENVER, rich, blonde, surgically enhanced,
          stands by the door of the tourism office.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL TOURISM OFFICE. DAY
          
          Paul walks into the tourism office. It is decorated with posters and
          photos of Rwanda's single most important economic asset - the rare
          silver back mountain Gorillas. There's a picture of the real-life Diane
          Fossey next to the movie poster for "Gorillas in the Mist". Numerous
          books and video cassettes. CONNIE DENVER's older husband, BOB, and four
          American friends wait.
          
                                  CONNIE DENVER
                      Paul, Paul. Our trip has been cancelled.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Yes, I'm sorry Madame Denver, it is
                      because of the rebels.
          
                                  CONNIE DENVER
                      Rebels? What rebels?

                                  BOB
                      Don't be stupid for Christ sake. The
                      Watusis are invading the country. I told
                      you not to come here.
          
                                  PAUL
                      The Tutsi rebels are far away on the
                      border. And soon there will be peace.
          
                                  BOB
                      Tutsis, Watutsis they'll still shoot you.
          
                                  CONNIE DENVER
                      But I came here to see the gorillas?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I will try to arrange something.

                                  US AMBASSADOR
                      Things will calm down when the president
                      signs the peace agreement with the
                      rebels.

                      Our intelligence, Mr. Ambassador, is that                  
                      the Hutu government has been stockpiling
                      weapons and are preparing a massacre.
          
                                   US AMBASSADOR
                      That's not what I hear. Excuse me. Paul.
                            Paul comes over)

                                  PAUL
                      How was your meal, sir?     
                                         
                                   US AMBASSADOR

                      General what a genius this man is. You
                      want anything, this man can get it?
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                 
                      How about a battalion of U.S. Marines.

                                     US AMBASSADOR
                         Now, General, don't ask for the
                         impossible.
          
          Paul smiles.
          
                                     PAUL
                         I have heard, Mr. Ambassador, that they
                         have discovered oil here, under Lake                        
                         Kivu.
          
          Oliver bursts out laughing. 
                                                         
                                     COLONEL OLIVER                                  
                         You're right, Mr. Ambassador, Paul knows
                         how to get anything, even U.S. troops. 
                               
          The ambassador takes Paul's hand, shakes it warmly.
          
                                     US AMBASSADOR
                         Thank you for a wonderful meal, Paul.
          
          Paul moves away graciously, and in one smooth move checks out, then
          pockets, the hundred dollar bill the ambassador palmed him.

          Paul notices the General.
          
          The General raises his briefcase and waves.
          
          Paul waves back. Another favor rendered.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL GROUNDS. NIGHT
          
          It is night now. Floodlights bathe the hotel in a warm glow. Tiki oil
          lamps illuminate the walkways and spread scented citronella smoke among
          the trees. Wild birds CALL OUT.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL REAR CAR PARK. NIGHT
          
          Paul walks to the employee car park at the rear.
          
          He sees Gregoire and another male reception clerk tossing Zozo's
          pillbox porter's hat between them with Zozo trapped in the middle
          trying to jump and catch it. Gregoire thinks this tease is great fun.
          
                         
          
          
                                                                              13.
          
                                  GREGOIRE
                      Come on, Zozo, cockroaches can jump, some                      
                      of them can fly.
          
           he clerk sees Paul just as he's about to throw, miscalculates, the hat
          sails over Gregoire's head and lands at Paul's feet. Zozo scampers to
          pick it up.
          
                                    PAUL
                      No.
                            (points to Gregoire)                                      
                      You pick it up.
          
          Gregoire doesn't move.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      How are your dish-washing skills,                              
                      Gregoire?
          
          Gregoire bends, picks up the hat, hands it to Zozo, who walks away
          quickly. Gregoire and his friend turn to head back into the hotel.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in
                      this hotel, do you understand?

                      Cockroaches?
          
          Bik has walked out of the rear door and overheard.
          
                                  BIK (CONT'D)
                      Don't tell me we have cockroaches, Paul?                       
          A sly smile breaks on Gregoire's face as he uses Bik's arrival to
          disappear inside.

                      No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.   
                                 
                                  BIK
                      That's what I came to talk to you about.
          
                                   PAUL
                      Excuse me?
          
                                  BIK
                      The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to                         
                      say they would be here on the sixth for
                      the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the
                      banquet room for that day, a reception to
                      broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you
                      organize monitors and check the satellite
                      dish?
          
                                                                               14.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Leave it to me.
          
          Bik leans slightly closer.
          
                                  BIK
                      Also, could you remember to use the
                      service entrance at all times?
          
                                    PAUL
                      Of course.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. NIGHT
          
          Paul hops in his car and tosses a box of Belgium chocolates on the seat
          next to him.
          
          
          EXT. KIGALI STREETS. NIGHT
          
          Paul speeds through the streets of Kigali HUMMING along to music on the
          radio and eating chocolates from the box. He passes bicycles laden
          with produce. The song on the radio ends and local news comes on.
          
                                  RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                      Good Hutus of Rwanda, beware. The
                      dictatorship of the Tutsi cockroach is
                      near. Watch your neighbor. Identify these
                      cockroaches. Then rise up and stamp out
                      this murderous infestation...
          
          Paul turns the station.    Finds another with music.
          
          
          EXT. KIGALI NEIGHBORHOOD. NIGHT
          
          Lights burn in windows. Kids play soccer in dusty lots. Paul's van
          turns onto a residential street and slows. He HONKS twice. The metal
          gate to a walled compound swings open. A GUARD(old, peaked hat, bare
          feet, pathetic) stands just inside. Paul waves to him and pullsinto
          the courtyard, two cars are already parked there.
          
          
          EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE. NIGHT
          
          A neat bungalow and gardens behind the high wall. Paul parks and gets
          out. A DOG runs and greets him, BARKING.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Down, Pealiss.
          
                                 
          
          
                                                                           15.
          
          His wife, TATIANA, a woman of great natural beauty, emerges from the
          house, beside her an even taller, very elegant woman, she has a
          doctor's bag and a stethoscope in her hand. This is ODETTE, their
          family doctor and close friend.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Good evening, Odette, who is sick this                      
                      time?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      I asked Odette to take a look at little
                      Anais. She has a rash.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Your brother's here?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Yes, with Fedens and the children.
                       e wants some advice.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      Good to see you, Paul.     
                                           
          Paul embraces Odette warmly, kisses Tatiana.
          
                                  ODETTE (CONT'D)
                      I must go, Paul.            
                                          
                                  TATIANA
                      You will not stay for dinner.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      No thank you, Tatiana.   
                                             
                                  PAUL
                      My best to Jean Baptiste.
          
          
          EXT: PAUL'S HOUSE. NIGHT
          
          The old guard opens the gate, Odette drives off.
          
          
          EXT. PAUL'S GARDEN. NIGHT
          
                                  PAUL
                           (a sigh)
                      Thomas wants advice?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      He wants your wisdom.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Let's have dinner first.
          
                                   
          
          
                                                                              16.
          
                                      TATIANA
                        Of course.
          
          His brother-in-law THOMAS and sister-in-law FEDENS come out to greet
          Paul the Patriarch. They hug. Kids run everywhere. Paul spots his twin
          nieces Anais (in blue) and Carine (in yellow), four years old. He
          scoops them up, one in each arm.
          
                                      PAUL
                        Hello, Anais.                                                 
          She laughs.
          
                                      CARINE
                        I am Carine.
          
                                    PAUL
                        You are not Anais?  
                                                    
                                      ANAIS
                        I am Anais.
          
                                    PAUL
                        Oh, Carine, that is a shame. I have a                         
                        present for Anais.
          
          Anais reaches out her hand. Paul sets them on the ground, takes a
          chocolate from his chocolate box, deliberately hands it to Carine.
          Anais jumps up and down.
          
                                    ANAIS
                        It is for me.
          
                                    PAUL
                        Goodness, I cannot tell. I guess I must
                        find another present.
          
          He takes a chocolate gives it to Carine, then hands out the   chocolates
          to his children who are gathered around.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S KITCHEN. DAY
          
          A crowded family table. Tatiana, Paul's four children, Thomas and
          Fedens, and the twins Anais and Carine.
          
                                    PAUL
                        Roger, your turn.
          
          Paul's eldest, ROGER, 12, bows his head.
          
                                    ROGER
                        For food and clothes, and all that grows,
                        etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           17.
          
                                     PAUL
                         Thank you, Roger.
          
          Food is passed around. Roger gobbles his down.
          
                                     PAUL (CONT'D)
                         Why the hurry, Roger?
          
                                     ROGER
                         Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
          
                                     PAUL
                         No, I don't want you going on the street.
          
                                      OGER
                         Please, papa, I have a secret path.  
                                 
                                     PAUL
                         Who is this Simon?
          
                                     TATIANA
                         Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
          
                                      PAUL
                         Homework?
          
                                      ROGER
                         It's done.
          
                                     TATIANA
                         And he did extra chores.
          
                                     PAUL
                         Wash your things, and be back soon. 
                                  
          Roger takes off at a run.
          
          
          EXT. PAUL'S GARDEN. NIGHT
          
          Roger runs to a wooden fence, gets down, moves two boards and squeezes
          through into a path, almost a tunnel in dense reeds.
          
          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S (SIMON'S) YARD. NIGHT
          
          Roger crawls along his path. There's a gap a little way down, and Roger
          shoots through it into the wide open of the neighbors yard. He runs to
          a back window of the house and taps on it. Soon SIMON, 12, appears. He
          slides it open.
          
                                     ROGER
                         Let's feed it.
          
          
          
                                                                           18.
          
          Simon lets Roger in.
          
          
          INT. NEIGHBOR'S (SIMON'S) HOUSE. NIGHT
          
          Roger holds a WILDLY COLORED SNAKE in a jar. Simon has a bag of bugs.
          Waves the bag in front of the snake. It's forked tongue goes wild.
          
                                  ROGER
                      Let me.
          
          Simon hands him the bugs. Roger lifts the lid, drops one bug in, and
          the snake strikes. The boys jump back, laugh.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S KITCHEN. NIGHT
          
          After dinner coffee for the adults. Tatiana, Thomas and Fedens at the
          table. Paul, in his usual position, at the head, listening, like
          Solomon.
          
                                  THOMAS
                      I've heard bad things, Paul. My assistant
                      says we should get out of Rwanda.
          
                                  FEDENS
                      Why should we leave? I have a new job,
                      things have never been better for us.
          
                                  THOMAS
                      What good is it if we are murdered in our
                      bed?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Your assistant, he is Hutu?
          
                                  THOMAS
                      Yes, and he is in the Hutu Power Militia.
          
                                  CARINE
                      He wants your job.
          
                                  THOMAS
                      No, he is a friend, but he tells me to
                      listen to the radio. All day they talk
                      about the great slaughter.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      That station is filth.
          
          PAUL has listened, now he decides to speak.
          
          
          
                                                                             19.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Today I talked to my friend the American
                      Ambassador and Colonel Oliver of the                           
                      United Nations. They are preparing a
                      banquet for the peace signing. The BBC
                      are flying in their best reporters. The
                      world is watching. There will be peace.
                      Don't listen to this man.
          
          Solomon has spoken. Fedens smiles, Tatiana rubs Paul's arm.
          
          
          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S (SIMON'S) YARD. NIGHT
          
          Roger crawls along his grass tunnel. Then he hears something. He looks
          through the reeds toward the street.
          
          HE SEES: Military boots, a cluster of Hutu soldiers in their crisp
          Khaki uniforms.
          
          He hears whispering.
          
                                     OLDIER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                      That house.
          
          
          EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE. NIGHT
          
          Paul, Tatiana, are by Thomas's car. They say good night to their
          guests. Anais and Carine sleep in the car.
          
          Paul nods to the old guard to go open the gate. Just then Roger emerges
          from the thicket, wide-eyed, afraid.
          
                                  ROGER
                      There are soldiers.
          
                                    PAUL
                      Where?
          
                                  ROGER
                      On the street.
          
          Paul nods to Tatiana to take Roger inside. Thomas and Fedens grab the
          sleeping twins from their car.
          
          Paul goes to his big metal gates and peers through the two inch gap
          E
          between the gate hinge and the gate post.
          
          
          EXT. VICTOR'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
          
          HE SEES: (two houses down) the group of Hutu soldiers, clustered around
          jeeps, they whisper and point. It's a raid.
          
                                   
          
          
                                                                           20.
          
          Now they move rushing out of view.
          
          The sounds of SPLINTERING WOOD, GLASS BREAKING, CHILDREN'S CRIES, WOMEN
          SCREAMING.
          
          Suddenly there's a face, beside Paul's. It's Tatiana.
          
                                    TATIANA
                      What is it?
          
          She looks, sees the soldiers, as they drag a middle-aged man onto the
          street.
          
          He is crying, pleading, like a whipped dog.
          
                                  TATIANA (CONT'D)
                      Oh, my God, it's Victor. Why do they want                      
                      Victor?
          
          They watch as Victor is beaten to the jeep. At this point Victor looses
          it completely, stops pleading, grabs on to a soldier, clinging,
          screaming like a terrified child - like a man who knows he is going to
          die. It's a horror.
          
                                  TATIANA (CONT'D)
                      Do something.
          
                                    PAUL
                      What?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Call your friends in the army. Call
                      someone. Victor is harmless. This is a
                      mistake.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Please, be quiet.
          
          Tatiana, moves toward the gate handle.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      I'm going to talk to them.
          
          Paul grabs her.
          
                                    PAUL
                      No.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      We must do something.
          
          Paul takes her by the arm, leads her to the house.
          
                                                                         21.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What would you have us do? Argue with                     
                      these madmen? We cannot interfere.                        
          
          INT. PAUL'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Thomas and Fedens wait, anxious, as Paul appears.
          
                                  PAUL
                      You better stay the night, it is too
                      dangerous to be on the streets.
          
          Tatiana hides her anger.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      I'll fix a bed.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
          
          Paul lies in bed unable to sleep.   The clock reads 3:00 am.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Why didn't you call your contacts in the
                      army?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I couldn't help.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      You could have asked for a favor.
          
                                  PAUL
                      No, I could not. What do you know about
                      favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
                      All day long I work to please this
                      officer, that diplomat, this tourist. To
                      store up favors so that if there is a
                      time when my family need help I have
                      powerful people I can call upon. Now you
                      would have me waste a precious favor on a
                      stranger.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Victor was not a stranger, he was our
                      neighbor.
          
                                  PAUL
                      He was not family. Family is all that
                      matters. Do you think if you or I were
                      being dragged from here, any one of them
                      would lift a finger to help us?
          
          
          
                                                                            22.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      They do not have your connections.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Connections? I have no connections, only
                      favors. If I call to help Victor, a
                      General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is
                      a fool. He thinks my favors are so
                      numerous and so insignificant as to waste
                      them on everybody." Then my hard work is
                      doubly squandered. I insult the General
                      and I do not get to use my favor at all.
                      Please leave these things to my good
                      judgment.
          
          His turn away indicates the discussion is over.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FRONT GATE. MORNING
          
          Paul's car rolls up to the hotel's guard house.
          
          SUPER THE TITLE: APRIL 6th, 1994.
          
          An army jeep is parked just inside. General Bizimungu is in the
          passenger seat, talking into a walkie-talkie.
          
          The General gives an I'll see you soon wave.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          The hotel entrance is a mini-jam of airport buses, white UN jeeps,
          foreign news crew Land Rovers, and a TV repair van unloading monitors.
          Paul marches in, past Zozo the bell hop, who helps the TV men unload.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Welcome, gentlemen.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          The lobby buzzes with activity. At the reception, Gregoire is
          surrounded by a BBC news crew: GLORIA, young, chic female
          reporter/producer, and JOCK, tough, experienced Scottish cameraman, and
          his local sound guy Peter. Gloria is upset.
          
                                  GLORIA
                      We reserved five rooms not two
          
                                  GREGOIRE
                      I'm sorry, ma'am, but I see only two here
                      in the computer.
          
                        
          
          
                                                                            23.
          
          Jock sees Paul.
          
                                  JOCK
                      Paul, how the hell are ya'?    
                                        
                                  PAUL
                      I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
          
                                  JOCK
                      They moved you from the Diplomat?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Promoted. House Manager.
          
                                  JOCK
                      Good for you.
          
                            (moves closer)                                          
                      We're having a little trouble, Paul. We
                      booked five rooms, but...
          
          Paul moves behind the desk.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Let me check.
          
          He punches into the computer.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Ah, I see the mistake. You were reading
                      CBC - the Canadian broadcasting people
                      instead of BBC Gregoire.
          
          Close on the computer: It clearly states BBC - two rooms.   Gregoire
          looks to Paul with a mix of puzzlement and anger.
          
          
                      Of course, the BBC, five rooms.
                            (lies)                                                  
                      They are being prepared as we speak. I
                      have ordered fresh flowers and
                      complimentary champagne.
          
          Gloria picks up her bag.
          
                                  GLORIA
                      Great, I really need a shower.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Just give me a moment to get your keys.
          
          Paul better come up with three rooms fast. Then he spots the reporter
          Benedict hovering at the door.
          
          
          
                                                                           24.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (to Gloria)
                      Excuse me for one second.
          
          Paul hurries over to Benedict.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Benedict, you should meet the BBC people.                     
                      They could use your expertise.                                
          
          Benedict is delighted. They head back across the lobby.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                            (whisper)                                                
                      Benedict, General Bizimungu will be here
                      any moment. The BBC should talk to him.
          
          They join the BBC team.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Madame, this is Benedict Nangori, one of
                      our best journalists. He covers all the
                      big stories. I thought you should meet.
          
          Gloria, a consummate news producer, turns on the charm.
          
                                  GLORIA
                      Benedict, beautiful name. I'm Gloria
                      Fleming. BBC.
          
          Paul moves off to the desk, Gregoire can barely disguise his pleasure.
          
                                  GREGOIRE
                      There are no more rooms.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Give me the phone.
          
          Gregoire hands it over. Paul dials.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Madame Denver. I have very good news. I
                      have a present for you, in return for the
                      cancellation of your gorilla expedition I
                      have arranged a safari at Lake Kivu
                      lodge. A wonderful experience. No, no

          Paul hangs up, turns to Gregoire.

                      Call Kivu Lodge, ask for George, tell him
                      I need three rooms. And send a team of
                      maids up to the Americans. I want those
                      rooms turned around in twenty minutes.

                      Nonsense. At this moment we are making

                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Of course, the president is a clever man,
                      he knows what he is doing. Thank you for
                      coming to Rwanda. (on the move). You will

          Paul turns, walks past porters ferrying the BBC luggage. He puts his
          hand out. Gregoire hands him keys.
          
          Paul does his rounds. He double checks the banquet room where
          technicians install several TV monitors and test the signal.
          
          He looks in the kitchen, frenzied activity.
          
          He wanders behind the bar. Everything is 'under control'.
          
          He returns to the lobby, greets Connie, her flustered husband and their
          friends, followed by a team of porters and luggage.

                      to miss the lunch buffet on the paddle

                      spectacular sight in all Africa.

                      Exactly, we can't have our guests                              
                      starving. What would they think of the

          Gen. Bizimungu, takes Paul's arm, pulls him aside, hands him his empty
          briefcase.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

                      me.
          
          As the General disappears into the bar, Paul waves over the coat check,
          hands her the briefcase.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Same as last time.
          
          She nods, hurries off just as the BBC crew appears. Paul hands out
          keys, greets each.

                      accord between the Tutsi rebels and his
                      Hutu army there remains strong doubts
                      that the extremist Hutu Power will abide
                      by the accords. But for now hope has
                      returned to Rwanda for the first time in
                      many years.
          
          All the African reporters in the room CHEER.
          
          Fireworks go off outside the hotel.

                      Paul, join us.
          
          It's General Bizimungu, he is sitting with George Rutagunda now in a
          shiny blue suit. A bottle of whiskey on the table is almost gone.          
          Bizimungu and Rutagunda watch the peace celebration across the lobby.

                      Have a drink.
          
          He pours. George points his glass toward the Europeans.

                      Look at them, they want to see the tribes
                      dance to their tune. Here is our dance.
          
          Rutagunda staggers to his feet, launches into a drunken version of the
          Hutu Militia War Dance.
          
                                  GEORGE (CONT'D)
                      Come on, Paul. Show them our dance.
          
          Paul takes George's arm, does two steps of the dance, then   appears to
          stumble and shoulder bumps the big man.
          
          George falls into his chair.

                      Forgive me, George, my step was off.
          
          Rutagunda bursts out laughing, toasts:
          
                                  GEORGE
                      To our president. May he find peace.
          
          As Paul is forced to join in the toast, Rutagunda laughs, Bizimungu        
          smiles at some insider joke.

          Reporters and crews pack up their equipment. Paul shakes hands, orders
          porters to pick up cases. Then a porter whispers a message to Paul.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Excuse me, gentlemen.

                                  THOMAS
                      My assistant, the Hutu Power man, says we                      
                      should get out now, that soon it will be
                      very bad.
          
          Paul stifles his anger.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Give me this man's name.

                      a friend, he likes me. He told me there
                      is a signal. It is "Cut the tall trees."                       
                      When they hear the signal, the militia                         
                      are to go to war.

                      Thomas, Fedens, I am a man who looks
                      after his family. If there were danger I
                      would be the first to leave?
          
          BANG - a distant explosion, a flash of light on the far side of the
          city. Fedens jumps.

                       Excuse me, Paul, you have a call. 
                                    
          Zozo hands Paul a cordless phone.
          
                                   PAUL
                        ello. Tatsi. Yes, they are here. Yes. I
                       know but I want them to calm down.
          
          THOMAS and Fedens listen.
          
                                   PAUL (CONT'D)
                       Already the press are packing their bags.
                       The BBC man told me there's no story
                       here. We are boring now. I'll be home
                       soon.
          
          He hangs up.
          
                                   PAUL (CONT'D)
                       Let us all go home and sleep.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. EVENING
          
          Paul escorts Fedens and Thomas to their car.
          
                                   PAUL
                       Call when you get home.   And don't worry,
                       Thomas. Good night.
          
          
          INT.   PAUL'S CAR. NIGHT
          
          Paul's at the wheel, driving. A thick mist. Barely a car on the road.
          Shadows dart past faint house lights. The windscreen clouds. Paul
          switches on his wipers. A Toyota truck, loaded with Militia, appears
          from the mist, speeds past. Paul switches the preset buttons on the
          radio as he drives. He can only find fevered drum-based MUSIC.
          
          
          
                                                                             31.
          
          
          EXT. PAUL'S STREET. NIGHT
          
          Paul turns onto his street. The houses are dark: windows shuttered;
          gates closed; not a soul about. Paul stops before his gate. HONKS
          twice. The gate doesn't open. He hops out and opens it with a key.
          Gives it a push and pauses as he heads back to the car. He hears the
          far off sound of gunfire. Distant explosions light the night sky.
          
          
          EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE. NIGHT
          
          Paul drives in. His compound is curiously dark.     His headlights sweep
          across his pitch-black house.
          
                                                                         UT TO:
          
          The gates swing shut. We PULL BACK as Paul turns and faces his house.
          Paul whistles for the dog, nothing. He goes back to the car, gets a
          flashlight, heads for the front door.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
          
          The door slowly opens. Paul steps in quietly, tries the light switch,
          nothing. He listens. The only sounds are distant explosions and
          gunfire. The beam of his flashlight cuts the blackness, illuminating:
          magazines arranged on a coffee table; an empty chair; children's toys
          in a basket.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S KITCHEN. NIGHT
          
          Paul continues his search. Scans the counter. There's food on the
          stove. The table is set. He hears a GROWL, quickly cut short, from one
          of the bedrooms.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S HALL. NIGHT
          
          Paul shines the light into a room. Looks for a second, then closes the
          door, and walks to the next. He stops and listens with his ear to the
          door. Nothing. He pushes it in.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
          
          Paul's light sweeps across the room and illuminates:
          
          Eyes - terrified eyes, a room full of faces, staring back.
          
          THEIR POV: A dark figure behind a blinding light.
          
          The dog breaks free, runs to Paul.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           32.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Pealiss!
          
          From among the faces, Tatiana's voice heavy with relief.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Paul!
          
          Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded
          into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband
          Jean Baptiste.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Jean Baptiste!
          
                                  JEAN BAPTISTE
                      Our house has been burned.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What is going on?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      The president has been murdered.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Murdered! By whom?
          
                                  ODETTE
                      The radio says Tutsi rebels.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Nonsense. Why would the rebels kill the
                      president when he agreed to peace?
          
          Tatiana pulls Paul aside.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Where are Thomas and Fedens?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I sent them home. Go and call them.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      I tried already. The phones do not work.
          
          Jean Baptiste turns on his tiny radio.
          
                                  RADIO ANNOUNCER
                      Our great president is murdered, by the
                      Tutsi cockroaches. They tricked him, then
                      they killed him. We must cleanse this
                      country, Good Hutus of Rwanda. We must
                      clear the brush. Clear the brush of all
                      cockroaches. Clear the brush!!!
          
          
          
          
                                                                           33.
          
          The words are cut short as a grenade blast rattles the window. Everyone
          jumps, children whimper. Paul is shocked but tries to pull things
          together.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Come on, everyone out of this room, find
                      a seat in the living room.
          
          He holds the door open, they file out, frightened. Tatiana is last, he
          stops her, steps back in, closes the door.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (in hushed anger)                                         
                      Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      They came through the bushes, over the
                      wall. What could I do?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Send them home. We are not the police.
                      What do we have to protect them?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The
                      militia will not come here, they know you                      
                      are a Hutu with influence.
          
                                  PAUL
                      They know you are Tutsi!
          
          The door knocks.   Paul gets up, angry.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Please, Paul, 'til first light.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Dawn. Then they go.
          
          Paul opens the door, it's Odette, holding the hand of Paul's eldest
          daughter.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      Forgive me, Paul. Danielle says that
                      Roger has gone.
          
          Tatiana comes over instantly, worried.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Gone where? Tell me, Danielle.                                 
          Their daughter Danielle answers.
          
                                                                                    
          
          
          
          
                                                                           34.
          
                                     DANIELLE
                         Next door, mama. He was afraid for his                     
                         friend Simon. He went to fetch him.
          
          
          EXT. UNDERGROWTH. NIGHT
          
          Roger crawls between the shrubs.      He hears ANGRY VOICES.
          
          He peers through the long grass.
          
          Sees: Hutu soldiers boots, feet in sneakers, bare women's feet. And
          among them the glint of machetes, hoes, a club spiked with nails, a
          length of chain CLANGING on the ground.
          
          
          EXT. PAUL'S GARDEN. NIGHT
          
          Tatiana rushes out the front door, Paul after her.
          
          Paul catches her and puts his hand over her mouth.
          
                                     PAUL
                         Shhhhh.
          
          SHOUTS next door. Paul pulls Tatiana behind the car. A beat. More
          SHOUTS. Paul takes his hand from her mouth. She's sobbing.
          E
          
          
             EXT. NEIGHBOR'S YARD. NIGHT
          
          Roger crawls to the gap in the shrubs. Feet, a crowd, leaving, through
          a gate. Engines rev.
          
          Roger crawls from the bushes.
          
          Crawls across, the driveway, crawls through a puddle.
          
          Then stops, SEES SOMETHING, AN (UNSEEN) HORROR!
          
          
          EXT. PAUL'S GARDEN. NIGHT
          
          Paul and Tatiana exit the back of the house with flashlight in hand
          headed towards the rear gate.
          
          Paul searches along the chain link fence, finds a section loose, he
          pulls it back, clambers underneath it.                                    
          Tatiana clasps her mouth, afraid to utter a cry.                          
          
          EXT. UNDERGROWTH. NIGHT                                                   
          Paul crawls through this scrub tunnel.                                    
          
                                 
          
          
          
                                                                            35.
          
          Then he hears BRANCHES SNAPPING.                                           
          He moves toward the sound.                                                 
          Discovers Roger, terrified, thrashing in a tangle of bushes.               
          He grabs Rogers shirt, pulls him as the little boy startles.               
                                    PAUL                                             
                      Ssshh!                                                         
          Paul drags his son through the chainlink fence, whisks him up in his       
          arms and rushes him to the house.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S KITCHEN. NIGHT
          
          Paul bursts through the back door and sets Roger down.   Tatiana is
          beside them.
          
                                    TATIANA
                      Roger!
          
          Paul turns the flashlight on Roger. Tatiana pulls back in horror:
          Roger is covered in blood. Her SCREAMS, stifled by fear.
          
                                    TATIANA (CONT'D)
                      Oh, my God!                                                    
                                  PAUL
                      Where are you hurt, son?
          
           oger stares blankly. Odette is beside them now.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      Get his clothes off.
          
          Hands pull and tear his clothes off. Towels wipe him down. Odette
          looks all over his body with the flashlight. Despite the blood Roger
          has no injuries.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What happened, son? Where did you get
                      this blood?
          
          But Roger, trembling, just stares, totally traumatized. Children cry.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      He's not injured.
          
          His paralysis freaks the women in the room. Paul turns angrily to them.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Leave us, give us some space.
          
                                                                           36.
          
          He ushers the neighbors out of the room, closes the door.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (to Tatiana)                                              
                      The neighbors must go at dawn.
          
          Tatiana hugs her son.
          
          
          EXT. KIGALI. DAWN
          
          The faintest grey of dawn over the city. Then a flock of birds rises as
          one in the distance. A millisecond later, the cause of their flight, a
          grenade explosion, echoes.
          
          The birds dart, in another direction as the STACCATO of a machine gun
          rips the air.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM. DAWN
          
          PAUL sits on the edge of the bed, staring out the window.
          
          Behind him Tatiana has Roger cradled in her arms, he still trembles
          wide eyed as she tries to get him to talk.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Will you take a little milk?
          
          Nothing.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Let him sleep.
          
          The door knocks. The old guard calls in frightened.
          
                                    OLD GUARD (O.S.)
                      Mr. Paul.                                                      
                                  PAUL
                           (to Tatiana)
                      It is time for the neighbors to leave.
          
          He heads for the door.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S LIVING ROOM. DAWN
          
          Paul steps out, closes the door behind him. A small delegation of the
          men wait nervously.
          
                                    JEAN BAPTISTE
                      It is true.
          
          
          
                                                                              37.
          
          He holds up the tiny radio, tuned to the BBC World service, a crackly
          Brit voice. (It's Gloria the reporter.)
          
                                  GLORIA THE REPORTER (O.S.)
                      The Hutu president's plane was struck by
                      a ground-to-air missile as he returned
                      from signing the peace accord with the
                      Tutsi rebels. There were no survivors.
                      The Hutu government has already blamed                         
                      the Tutsi rebels. The rebels have denied                       
                      the accusation. Already there are reports                      
                      of reprisal killings on the streets.  
                                   
          As they listen, a young woman lets out a SQUEAL, and flees the window
          where she's been sitting.
          
                                  WOMEN (O.S.)
                      They are here.
          
          Hysteria in the room, women and children push toward the bedroom. Paul
          manages to make it to the window, nervously steals a glance and sees:
          
          A HUTU ARMY SOLDIER sits on the high wall by the gate. He pulls another
          up beside him.
          
           anic in the room now. Paul turns.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Shut up!
          
          PAUL'S POV: The soldiers drop into his garden. They draw pistols.
          
                                  TATIANA (O.S.)
                      What is it, Paul.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Stay with the children.
          
          PAUL'S POV: The soldiers go to the gate, slide the bolt, swing it open.
          
          Two jeeps, jammed with heavily armed SOLDIERS, sit in the drive like
          many-limbed beasts of war. Paul watches as the jeeps rumble into his
          garden. The soldiers jump out.
          
          INSIDE THE ROOM:
          
          Nothing can stop the women and children from fleeing into the bedrooms.
          Paul is frozen at the CRASH of rifles on the door.
          
          The door gives, SOLDIERS flood in.
          
          They are startled by the crowd in the living room, rifles raised,
          SHOUTS.
          
                                                                           38.
          
                                  SOLDIERS
                      Out, get out now!
          
          Paul pulls himself together, marches over to the soldier.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Who is in charge?
          
          A Captain is at the door.
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                      Who are you?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of
                      General Bizimungu.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      We are looking for you.
          
          He takes Paul by the arm, leads him outside.
          
          
          EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE. DAWN
          
          The Captain stops by his jeep, studies his clipboard.
          
          Tatiana with Roger in her arms, her kids and all the neighbors herded
          together.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What is this about?
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      Let me see your identity card.
          
          Paul pulls it from his pocket, hands it to the Captain.
          
          CLOSE ON: Paul's ID - it reads Ethnicity: HUTU.
          
          The Captain studies him, waves for the soldiers to back off.
          
                                  CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                      You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered
                      our president.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
          
                                  PAUL
                      No. I work at the Mille Collines.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           39.
          
          The Captain looks confused. Paul quickly:
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      I used to work at the Diplomat.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      Do you know how to open the safe there?
                           (Paul nods)
                      Our government needs to use the hotel and
                      the room keys are in the safe. You must
                      open it.
          
                                   PAUL
                      Of course.
          
          Paul sees out into the street behind the jeeps: a group of Militia in
          their colored shirts armed with machetes, have gathered, trying to see
          what is going on.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Captain, I must take my family.
                      It is not safe here.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      Where is your family?
          
          Tatiana is beside him now.
          
                                  TATIANA
                           (interrupts)                                              
                      This is them.
          
          Tatiana points to the huddled neighbors. Paul is stunned.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      All of them! I cannot take them.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      No, no, good Captain, you do not have to.
                      We have the car and our van.
          
          She points to the Mille Collines van.
          
           he Captain looks doubtful, then his two-way radio barks - an urgent
          message. He listens.
          
          Tatiana drags the kids and ushers everyone toward the van. In a second,
          they are all clambering in.
          
                                   CAPTAIN
                      Let's go.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           40.
          
          Paul jumps behind the wheel of the van. Neighbors are jammed in like
          sardines, 15, more, inside. Tatiana and their kids are squashed
          together on the front bench.
          
          The convoy (jeep - van, car - jeep) starts up and turns out into the
          street.
          
          The Militia men wave sticks, machetes.
          
          
          INT. VAN TRAVELING - DAY
          
          Paul looks back as they speed off down the street.
          
          Sees: The Militia looters pour into his gateway.
          
          As they pass the Caringa home, Militia looters carry off a TV and push
          a stove on a child's skateboard.
          
          TATIANA has Roger on her lap, she cradles his head.
          
          
          EXT. KIGALI STREET. DAY
          
          The convoy speeds through the deserted streets. Slowing only to
          maneuver through makeshift roadblocks where Militia wave machetes,
          nailed clubs and spears as they dance.
          
          FURTHER ALONG THE ROAD: a group of Militia swarm over a car, smashing
          the windshield, the windows. Inside a family huddles together in
          terror, waiting for the windows to give way.
          
          In the gutter by the side of the road, three dead bodies.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (to Tatiana)                                             
                      Don't look.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL DIPLOMAT. DAY
          
          The convoy pulls up at this older, shabbier hotel. There are other
          jeeps, and several staff in a panic. The janitor, ROBERT, sees Paul,
          bursts into waves of joy.
          
                                  ROBERT
                      Mr. Paul, sir. Oh, Mr. Paul. We must open                     
                      every door right now for the government.
          
          Paul jumps out of the van, hurries to the lead jeep.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (to the Captain)                                         
                      The safe is in the manager's office.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           41.
          
          The Captain nods to two soldiers.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      Go with him, get the keys.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL DIPLOMAT LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul runs through the lobby. The staff look petrified.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL DIPLOMAT MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          Paul bursts into the room. The two soldiers follow.
          
          He goes to the hotel's big old combination safe, spins the combination
          a few times, tries the handle, clunk! It doesn't open. He's forgotten
          the number.
          
          The soldiers look at him impatiently. Paul improvises.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Gentlemen, you'll find some chocolate,
                      and maybe a few beers in the fridge.
                      Don't let them go to waste.
          
          The soldiers fall over each other to get to the fridge.
          
          Paul tries the safe numbers again, clunk! It opens.
          
          He sees: a big bunch of keys, a wad of dollars, Rwandan francs, a check
          book, and several bottles of the best cognac, whiskey, some Cristal.
          
          He looks round nervously but the two soldiers are busy fighting over
          the beer and chocolates in the fridge.
          
           s they do, Paul, hands trembling, stuffs the wads of notes, into his
          belt, pulls his shirt over and shuts the safe door.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      I've got them.
          
          He is about to leave.
          
                                  SOLDIER 1
                      Wait!
          
          Paul looks back at the soldier.
          
                                  SOLDIER 1 (CONT'D)
                      Sit down.
          
          Paul sits, as the two soldiers guzzle beers and stuff chocolate into
          their pockets.
          
                                                                           42.

          Paul hurries through the lobby toward the entrance.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL DIPLOMAT ENTRANCE. DAY
          
          Paul emerges to see:
          
          All of the occupants of the van, Tatiana, his kids, Odette on their
          knees, with their hands on their heads.
          
          The Captain hovers over them, pistol in hand, turns, sees Paul. He
          marches toward him and SLAPS HIM HARD on the face.
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                      Traitor!
          
          Paul reels from the blow, but manages to stay on his feet.
          
          The Captain snatches a bunch of ID cards from a soldier, hurls the
          cards in Paul's face.
          
                                  CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                      They are all Tutsi cockroaches.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Let me explain.
          
          He grabs Paul by the scruff of the neck, pushes him toward the kneeling
          captives. The Captain snatches a pistol from one of his soldiers,
          shoves it into Paul's hand.
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                      SHOOT THEM!
          
          Paul looks at him.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Please, I don't use guns.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      There is nothing to it.
          
          The Captain raises his own pistol and FIRES it. Everyone jumps with
          fright.
          
                                  CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                      Shoot them now or you die first.
          
          The Captain aims his pistol at Paul's head. Cocks the hammer.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           43.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Captain, what could I pay you not to do
                      this?
          
          The Captain laughs.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      You want to pay me?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Why not? These are not rebels, look at
                      them. Soon they will be worthless to you.
                      Why not take some money, for your work?
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                      How much?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Name a price.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      Ten thousand francs for each one.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I don't have that much.
          
          The Captain laughs, snatches the gun from Paul, marches toward them.
          
                                    PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Wait! Wait!
          
          Paul reaches into his pocket, pulls out the bunch of dollars.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty
                      thousand francs for my family. To let us
                      drive off to the Mille Collines.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      How many in your family?
          
                                    PAUL
                      Six.
          
          The Captain looks at his soldiers, at the wad of notes.
          
                                   APTAIN
                      Pull your family out.
          
          Paul runs over, grabs Tatiana, Roger, the three girls. Odette kneels
          beside Tatiana. Paul whispers.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Have you any money?
          
                                                                            44.
          
                                    ODETTE
                      Nothing.
          
          Paul pushes his family toward the van, looks back, sees the Captain
          pocket the dollars, move toward the line.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Paul, don't let them die.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (urgent)
                      Get in.
          
          Paul pushes them into the van, shuts the door, digs into his soul for
          all the courage he can muster, then turns back.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Captain, let these people give you some
                      money, whatever they have.
          
          The Captain hesitates. Paul sees this, runs over to the line of
          neighbors.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Give me everything, everything you have.
          
          A pathetic rain of Rwandan francs, useless coins, watches, jewelry
          falls onto the ground. Paul scoops it all up.
          T
          
          he Captain looks at it, takes it, then:
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      There is only enough for one cockroach.
          
          The Captain raises his pistol.
          
                                  CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                      Pick one to take with you.
          
          Now each terrified neighbor looks to Paul, begging.
          
                                    PAUL
                      Wait, wait.
          
          Paul counts the kneeling figures: ten adults, four kids.
          
                                    PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Ten.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      And four children?
          
          
          
          
                                                                              45.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'll give you a hundred thousand francs
                      for all of them.
          
          The Captain points the gun.
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                      Give me it.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I don't have it here. At the Mille
                      Collines. I can get it for you.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      You will run into the hotel and hide
                      behind the U.N.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand
                      francs, enough for a house. I will get
                      the money, you keep them outside.
          
          The Captain smiles.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      I will keep your family outside. Let's
                      go.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FRONT GATE. DAY
          
          The convoy pulls up at the outer gates of the Mille Collines. It's
          manned by ARMED UN PEACEKEEPERS.
          
           he Captain walks to Paul in the van.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      Go with my soldiers. And hurry back if
                      you want to keep these cockroaches.
          
          The Captain nods to Paul's children.
          
          Paul jumps into the Rwandan army jeep.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (to UN Peacekeepers)                                      
                      I am the manager. Open the gate.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Chaos - UN jeeps, hotel vans, dismayed tourists, frightened Tutsi
          refugees.
          
          
          
                                                                              46.
          
          CLOSE ON: Bik, the Dutch manager, bag packed, anxious, sees Paul.
          YELLS.
          
                                  BIK
                      Paul, I have to talk to you ...
          
          But Paul ignores Bik, barrels his way through the din and crush of the
          parking lot.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul rushes in:   The lobby is filled with Tutsi refugees, and scared
          white tourists.
          
            solitary receptionist, besieged by anxious guests, is relieved to see
          Paul.
          
                                  RECEPTIONIST
                      Oh, sir, please can you...
          
          Paul rushes to the accounting room behind the reception desk, closes
          the door.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL OFFICE. DAY
          
          Paul pulls bundles of dollars from the hotel safe.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL. DAY
          
          Paul pushes through the mob at the door. Bik comes up.
          
                                  BIK
                      Paul...                                                        
                            grabs Paul)                                              
                      ...I have to talk to you.                                      
                                   PAUL
                      I'll be back.
          
          Paul breaks free and hurries over to the Army jeep.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (hops in)                                                 
                      Let's go.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FRONT GATE. DAY
          
          Paul jumps from the jeep. Waves to Tatiana in the van, then gives the
          money to the Captain.
          
          
          
                                                                           47.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Now let them go.
          
          No response. Money in hand, the Captain eyes Paul with malice.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Don't be foolish. There's more money to
                      be made here.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask
                      for Captain Naramunju.
          
          The Captain smiles, then jumps in his jeep and speeds off. Paul runs to
          the van and jumps in.
          
          INSIDE THE VAN
          
          Jubilation, in the rear of the van. Odette is in tears.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      Thank you, thank you, Paul.
          
          Paul doesn't reply. Tatiana hugs him. He gives her a look - a mix of       
          relief and anger - the crowd in the back almost cost him his family.       
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Paul's van arrives. Bik hangs from a minibus.
          
                                  BIK
                           (shouts)                                                  
                      Paul, I have to go. The staff have fled
                      Kivu Lodge. I have to close it.                                
          
          He flings office keys to Paul.
          
                                  BIK (CONT'D)
                      While I'm away, you're in charge.                              
          
          Bik's van takes off. A group of tourists hears Bik's words.
          
                                  TOURISTS
                      Hey, hey, we need our passports, we want
                      to get a flight.
          
          Paul looks at them.
          
                                  TOURIST
                      They're in your safety boxes. We need
                      them right away.
          
                  
                                                                              48.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Come inside.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          At the desk, the same receptionist is overwhelmed.
          
                                  TOURIST (O.C.)
                      He's in charge, that's him.
          
          Paul goes behind the desk. Rumors fly among the crowd of tourists.
          
                                  TOURISTS
                      (staccato) to the airport...my embassy
                      ...tried to call... the airport is closed
                      ... refund... this is outrageous ...
          
          Behind the tourists, Tatiana and the neighbors look lost.
          
          Paul addresses the frightened Western tourists.  
                                    
                                  PAUL                                               
                      Please, I am the house manager. Return in                      
                      thirty minutes and we will deal with all                       
                      your requests, thank you.     
                                           
          Paul turns to the room key boxes, nearly all are empty.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)                                      
                      What happened to all the rooms?
          
          Finally he finds a key, pushes through to Tatiana, hands a key to
          Odette and Jean Baptiste.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Take this room. Tatiana, bring the
                      children.
          
          Paul starts to lead his family away.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      (re: neighbors) What about them?
          
          Paul looses it.                                                            
                                  PAUL                                               
                      Them. They almost got us all killed. I                         
                      have done enough for them! We cannot look                      
                      after them anymore.
          
                                                                           49.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What are you going to do? You cannot
                      drive them out onto the road. They can                      
                      stay with me.    
                                                     
                                  PAUL                                            
                      What!          
                                                       
                                  TATIANA
                      I will not have them on my conscience.                      
                      They will stay in my room.  
                                          
                                  PAUL
                           (to Zozo)
                      Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms.
                      Put these people in them.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      Yes, sir.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY
          
          Paul hurries his family along the corridor. Rwandan refugees wander
          aimlessly pulling their meagre possessions.
          
                                  REFUGEE
                           (calls out)                                            
                      Moses, Moses Seradungu.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Can I help you?
          
                                  REFUGEE
                      I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What is his room number?
          
                                  REFUGEE
                      I don't know.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Go downstairs, I will help you.
          
          Paul finds his room and opens the door.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAY
          
          PAUL leads his family into a one-bedroom suite. The kids drop to the
          beds exhausted. Tatiana picks up the phone and dials.
          
                                                                           50.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What are you doing?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Trying Thomas and Fedens. We've got to
                      get them here.
          
          Paul paces the room. The maids clearly haven't cleaned it since it's
          last occupants: the beds are unmade; towels are on the floor; and a
          newspaper is scattered across the desk.
          
                                  PAUL
                      (re: room) This won't do.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      It will do just fine.
          
          So Paul tidies the place. As he does,
          
                                  PAUL
                      Any luck?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      No answer. Please send someone to get
                      them, please.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'll try.
          
          Paul leaves.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Paul waits, then a car pulls up, an Indian businessman, Mr. Garindi,
          gets out, shakes hands, he's shaken.
          
                                  MR. GARINDI
                      Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies                      
                      everywhere. I cannot stay here.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I need a great favor.
          
          He hands Mr. Garindi an address.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      I need you to go to this address and
                      bring my brother-in-law and his family.
          
                                  MR. GARINDI
                      No, no. This is a very dangerous part of
                      town. I cannot do this.
          
                                                                            51.
          
                                  PAUL
                      This would be an enormous favor to me. I                     
                      am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this                    
                      nonsense is over I will be most grateful.    
                          
                                  MR. GARINDI
                      I will see what I can do.
          
          Mr. Garindi climbs back into his car.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul stops just shy of the lobby. Around the corner is a mob of angry
          guests. Paul takes a moment to gather himself: straightens his tie;
          button his jacket; flick a piece of lint from his shoulder. Then he
          takes a breath and steps around the corner.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Thank you for your patience, ladies and                      
                      gentlemen. Now, how can I help you.    
                                
          The mob rushes him.
          
                                                                      CUT TO:
          
          Paul works the front desk as angry guests surge all around him. Zozo
          emerges from the office with two tourists.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Where are the receptionists? Where's
                      Gregoire?
          
                                  ZOZO
                      He has taken the presidential suite.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What!
          
          Paul storms off.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY
          
          CLOSE ON: A door with a placard reading "Presidential Suite".   Paul
          knocks. The door opens. Gregoire answers, half-naked.
          
                                   GREGOIRE
                           (surprised)
                      Mr. Manager.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Gregoire, what are you doing here?
          
          
          
                                                                           52.

                      Who is it?
          
                                  GREGOIRE
                      What do you want?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Get out of this room and get back to
                      work.
          
                                  GREGOIRE                                           
                      I don't have to listen to you anymore. 
                                  
                                  PAUL                                                                           
                      I am in charge now. Get back to work or
                      I'll fire you. 
                                                          
                                  GREGOIRE                                           
                      Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice                      
                      a smell of cockroaches? If I were to                           
                      leave this room, I'm sure I could find                         
                      this smell. I know people who could                            
                      cleanse it.(stares) But maybe it doesn't                       
                      bother you? Why is that? Are used to this                      
                      smell? Not me, I need a clean room to                          
                      escape it.         
                                                      
          Gregoire closes the door. Paul's eyes burn with anger, but this battle     
          will have to wait.                                                         
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul comes into the lobby and discovers Colonel Oliver, he is escorting    
          a tall, well-dressed man, the Tutsi Minister of Finance XAVIER and his
          family.
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                     
                      Paul, you know who this is?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the                              
                      Minister of Finance.
          
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                                    
                      Get him a room, but tell no one he is

          There's a commotion by the door. Paul goes over.
          
          A valet stops a group of Tutsi refugees from entering.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)

                      Sir, they have no reservations.
          
          Paul studies the group, - a ragged bunch, no way are they Mille

          shorts bursts out from among the trees and flees to the middle of the
          driveway. It's the journalist, BENEDICT, covered in blood. His ear has
          been chopped off.
          
          PANDEMONIUM. As Paul runs to him, calls to Zozo.
          
                                      PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Get Odette!

          Paul grabs Benedict, tries to calm him.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      What happened?
          
                                  BENEDICT
                      They're killing everyone. The Lady
                      Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the
                      gate.
          
          He points down the driveway. This sparks many of the women refugees,
          and white guests, to flee inside the hotel.
          
          Odette arrives with her bag, leads Benedict inside.
          
          Jock has been filming all of this.

          Now Jock runs, camera still on his shoulder, toward the gate.
          
          Paul takes off after him.
          
          More Tutsi refugees running up the driveway in fear.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FRONT GATE. DAY
          
          As Jock films, Paul arrives by the gate house. UN soldiers watch the
          outside road. Engines roar, then.
          
          A convoy of Toyota trucks circle on the road outside the gate. Drunken
          Militia men on the back wave spears, machetes, one, in a woman's disco
          wig, waves a cordless power drill. The drill bit is red with blood.
          
          In the next truck, TWO Militia MEN triumphantly taunt the UN soldiers
          as they hold blue UN helmets high on sticks. The helmets are shot
          through with holes.
          
                                  MILITIAMAN #1

          ENRAGED UN SOLDIERS cock their weapons, aim.
          
          A UN armored car races past the Militia and turns into the driveway.
          The back door opens, UN Colonel Oliver jumps out.  
                                 
                                  COLONEL OLIVER
                      Hold the line here. Do not shoot!
          
          The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive     
          by. Paul approaches Oliver

          Oliver shakes his head. He helps Paul clamber into the armored car.

          surround them.

          There's a clank of metal. Paul looks and sees:                            
          A waiter struggling with a trolley of food by a door.                     
          He hurries to help the waiter as Jock opens, indicates quiet, waves
          Paul and the waiter in.

                      her?
          
          The businessman shakes his head no. Tears run down Tatiana's face. She
          holds Paul's arm to stop from falling to the floor.
          
                                  PAUL
                      This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they
                      fled or could not make it home. There is
                      hope.
          
                                  TATIANA
                           (to the businessman)
                      Please go back, bring the children to us.
          
                                  MR. GARINDI
                      (frightened)No ma'am, I cannot do that.
                      The roadblocks are everywhere. They are
                      looking for children. They shout, "Kill
                      the babies to clear the infestation."
                      Leave them be, they are safe. I have to
                      go now.
          
          Paul takes a small wad of notes from his pocket, presses it into the
          businessman's hand.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Thank you for your help.
          
          He leaves. Tatiana pulls Paul to her.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      My sister is dead, Paul. They would not
                      leave the children.
          
                                  PAUL
                      No. They are not dead. Stop this.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul and Tatiana push through the French tourists and AID workers
          running across the lobby.
          
                                                                            64.
          
                                   FRENCH TOURISTS
                       Mon Dieu, Merci.
          
          Cheers break out. Paul and Tatsi peer from the crowd and through the
          lobby window see:
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL DRIVEWAY. DAY
          
          French and Italian special forces pull into the parking lot, standing
          tall in their jeeps, macho western super troops, triumphant. Salvation!
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Wild cheering, flowers draped around necks, kisses. Westerners,
          Rwandans, dance and sing in celebration.
          
          Paul SEES: Colonel Oliver off to the side, with the commanders of the      
          French special forces.
          
          
                      OLIVER
          CLOSE ON:                                                                  
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                                    
                       You have a battalion, you could stop this
                       now. The Hutu army is no match for you.
          
                                   FRENCH COMMANDER
                       Those are not our orders.
          
          Oliver pulls off his blue beret, throws it on the ground, points his       
          finger at the French and Italian officers.
          
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                                    
                       You will remember this day for the rest
                       of your lives.
          
          He walks off, returns, picks up his beret.
          
          Paul watches as he storms into the lobby.
          
          Paul follows.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL BAR. DAY
          
          Paul follows the Colonel into the Kigali Club. The place is empty, the     
          bartender missing, gone to celebrate.
          
                                   PAUL
                       Colonel, what can I get you?                                  
          Paul gets behind the bar.
          
                                                                           65.
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                    
                      Anything. Strong.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Canadian Club?
          
          Oliver cracks a weary smile. Paul pours two drinks, slides one across.    
          He raises his glass.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved                      
                      us all.
          
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                                   
                            (raw cynicism)
                      Congratulations. You should spit in my
                      face.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Excuse me, Colonel.                                           
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                    
                      We think you are dirt, less than dirt,
                      worthless.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I don't understand.
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                    
                      Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the
                      smartest man here. You have them all
                      eating out of your hand. You'd own this
                      fucking hotel, except for one thing.
          
          Paul doesn't answer.
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER (CONT'D)                           
                      You're fucking black! You're not even a
                      nigger, you're African!
                           (downs his drink)
                      They're not staying to stop this thing.
                      They're gonna fly right out of here with
                      their people.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (shocked)
                      Their people?
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                    
                      They're only taking the whites.
          
                               
          
                                                                           66.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL PAUL'S ROOM. DAY
          
          Paul opens the door. Tatiana and the kids pack bags, prepare to leave.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Children, go into the hallway.
          
          Tatiana and the children stop what they're doing, puzzled.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      (to the kids) Please, go.
          
          The kids leave.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What's wrong?
          
          Paul takes her hands in his.
          
                                  PAUL
                      All the whites are leaving.
          
          Tatiana's grip tightens.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      They are being evacuated.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What about us?
          
                                  PAUL
                      We have been abandoned.
          
          Tatiana clings to hope.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      The soldiers will stop the killers.
          
          Paul looses it.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Listen to me woman. I said all the whites
                      are leaving. The French, the Italians,
                      even the Belgian UN soldiers.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      But who is left?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN                      
                      has three hundred soldiers for the whole
                      country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis.
          
          
          
          
                                                                              67.
          
          He looks up at her.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      The most the Colonel can spare for the                           
                      hotel are four men, and they're not
                      allowed to shoot.
          
          He takes her hand, makes her sit down.
          
                                   PAUL (CONT'D)
                      If anything should happen, if the Militia
                      arrive, you must take the children and go
                      to the roof.
          
          Tatiana's eyes are wide with fear.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What for?
          
          Paul takes his anger out on Tatiana.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Do what I say, woman. You hear me? I will
                      meet you there.
          
          He storms out.
          
                                                                         CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          REVEAL: A chaos of luggage, white tourists, AID agency people, Italian
          and French soldiers, elite, slick.
          
          On the edges, clumps of Rwandans, watching, silent, fearful.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          A torrential African rain storm soaks everything. Porters with big
          umbrellas run the white evacuees to the buses.
          
          French and Italian commanders check off names on clipboards.
          
          Jock films the evacuees boarding buses.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          At the front desk, Paul, dripping wet from working the convoy,    listens
          to a French tourist who refuses to pay his bill.

                                     FRENCH TOURIST
                         Why should I pay to stay in a, in a
                         holocaust? Tell me.
          
          Paul, stone-faced, polite, destroys this asshole.
          
                                     PAUL
                         You are not staying sir, you are leaving.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Paul watches in the rain as the final agency people are being loaded
          onto buses.
          
          Several white aid workers weep uncontrollably as they are dragged away
          from frightened Rwandan coworkers.
          
             PAUL in the rain.
          
           cross the parking lot Colonel Oliver watches from his jeep.              
          Jock and his sound man embrace two beautiful young HOOKERS.
          
          One girl begs Jock to take her with him.
          
                                     HOOKER
                         Please, please, they will put me on the
                         street. They will chop me.
          
                                     JOCK
                         Darlin', believe me, if I could...
          
          He digs in his pockets, pulls out money, cigarettes. Everything he has
          he gives to her.
          
          Then he pulls her toward Paul, digs out his wallet.
          
                                       JOCK (CONT'D)
                         Here. Here.
          
          He pushes two Visa cards into Paul's hands.
          
                                     JOCK (CONT'D)
                         Give her what she wants, room, food,
                         anything. Charge it all. Don't you put
                         her out, Paul.
          
                                     PAUL
                         I would never do that.

                         I know that, Paul. I'm sorry.                              
                         Here take this.

          Jock pulls a Rolex off his wrist.  
                                                  
                                  PAUL
                      This is a Rolex, I can't take it.   
                                     
                                  JOCK                                               
                      Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a                       
                      fucking aeroplane.       
                                                
          Jock embraces Paul, tears in his eyes.
          
          Gloria watches from the doorway. Embarrassed by Jock, She becomes
          officious.

                           (turns on her)
                      Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are
                      we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are
                      you? Well, are ya'?

                      You're drunk.
          
          Gloria marches onto the bus.

                           (to a French soldier)
                      What are we waiting for?
          
                                  FRENCH SOLDIER
                      We have to evacuate some nuns from a
                      convent. They are on their way.
          
          Jock kisses the hooker, heaves his camera onto the bus.
          
          Then there is a disturbance on the driveway.
          
          A group of French nuns, along with maybe a hundred Tutsi women and
          children come running up the driveway. They are all terrified. One nun
          leads them with a French flag.
          
          French soldiers run forward. A commander orders them to form   a line,
          blocking the refugees.
          
          French soldiers begin pulling nuns from the terrified crowd.
          
          Several nuns begin hysterically weeping, pulling Rwandan children with
          them. Panic breaks out among the crowd.
          
                                                                           70.

          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Nuns cling to young children. French soldiers wrench the nuns away,
          lift them off their feet, carry them to the bus.
          
          JOCK films, as A FRENCH OFFICER screams at him.
          
          The last nun is dragged onto a bus.
          
          Jock looks to Paul, then gets on the bus.
          
          The convoy - French jeeps, buses, Italian jeeps, UN jeeps takes off,
          through the refugees, turns a corner, gone.
          
          Paul, drenched, is left alone to fend for his new guests:                 
          Weeping women, frightened children.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FRONT GATE. DAY
          
          The convoy passes the gate house.
          
          Across the road, two jeeps of Rwandan Army soldiers watch the convoy
          leave. They get on the radio.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Where five minutes before the lobby was a frenzy of wealthy Europeans
          and aid workers, the groups of clustered black faces are silent except
          for the crying of babies and sobbing mothers. Paul picks his way among
          them. Zozo catches up.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      What do we do with all these people?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Open up the ballroom, we'll put them
                      there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make
                      rice and beans - a lot of it.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL PAUL'S ROOM. DAY.
          
          Paul enters, drops to the bed. Tatiana curls up next to him.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      You could leave, Paul.
          
                
          
          
                                                                           71.
          
                                    PAUL
                        What are you saying, Tatsi?
          
                                    TATIANA
                        Your card says Hutu. Take our children,
                        go and get the twins, pay money at the
                        roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
          
                                    PAUL
                        Enough of this. We stay together. Let me
                        rest, I will feel better then.
          
          Paul puts on his walkman earphones, presses play, the rich cowboy drawl
          of Don Williams singing ???
          
          Close on: Paul as his eyes droop and to the music.
          
          A kalidiscope of colors filter through drooping eyelids as
          
          Close on Paul's face, as the music plays.
          
          His eyes open wide, disturbed, music playing
          
          Paul's POV, an Army lieutenant stands over him, other soldiers around.
          
          The lieutenant reaches down, pulls the earphones from Paul's ears.
          
                                    LIEUTENANT
                        You are the manager?
          
                                    PAUL
                        Yes, sir. What is wrong?                                     
                                    LIEUTENANT
                        Everyone must leave the hotel now.
          
                                    PAUL
                        Why sir?
          
                                    LIEUTENANT
                        It's an order. Get everyone out now.
          
                                    PAUL
                        I...ah...need some time. Please give us
                        twenty, thirty minutes. People are
                        sleeping.
          
          The lieutenant is not impressed.
          
                                    PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Please, have some cold drinks. I will be
                        as quick as I can.
          
          'Cold drinks' softens the soldiers' attitudes.
          
          
          
                                                                           72.
          
                                  LIEUTENANT
                      We will be outside, ten minutes.
          
          The soldiers march off. Paul goes back inside. The kids, sensing the
          menace, sit still and wide-eyed on the floor. Suddenly Tatiana notices     
          Roger is missing.                                                          
                                  TATIANA                                            
                      Where's Roger?        
                                                   
          Danielle points to under the bed.    
                                                
          CLOSE ON:                                                                  
          Roger trembling under the bed, as Paul's face appears.   
                            
                                  PAUL                                               
                      Come on son, everything is all right.                          
          He slides him out, clutches him in his arms, then turns him over to
          Tatiana as he phones the front desk. 
                                                
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)                                      
                           (on phone)                                                
                      Who is this? Zozo. I know. Get them beer.                      
          
          He turns to Tatiana.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Go to the roof now.
          
                                  TATIANA
                           (terrified)
                      What for Paul.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (forceful)
                      Do as I say. I will be there soon.
          
          He hurries out.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY
          
          Paul's door opens, his head appears round the corner.
          
          The corridor is empty of soldiers. Now, frightened Tutsis peer out from
          their rooms. A group of men, among them the politician Xavier, are
          gathered in the hallway. Paul spots one man holding a pistol. He runs
          up.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (to the man with the pistol)
                      Are you mad? They will gun us all down.
          
                                                                           73.
          
                                  PISTOL MAN
                      Better to die by the bullet than the
                      machete.
          
          Paul pulls the gun off him.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Wait here, please.
          
          Paul hands the gun to Xavier, hurries off.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          Paul bursts in, sits by the phone and dials.
          
                                  PAUL (ON PHONE)
                      Good day, General Bizimungu please. Do
                      you know where he is? Please ask him to
                      call Paul Rusesabagina. It is urgent.
          
          Phone again.
          
          A SERIES OF FLASH CUTS: increasingly frantic calls.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Colonel Bagsora. Where? Can you find him?
          
          ANOTHER CALL:
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Who would order such a thing?
          
          ANOTHER CALL:
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Did you find the General?
          
          Paul hangs up the phone defeated. He looks at his watch. His head flops
          onto the desk, onto the Sabena logo. He sees it.
          
          
          INT. SABENA PRESIDENT'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          The Sabena president and two VPs sit on couches.
          
                                  PRESIDENT
                      If British Airways abandons the route we
                      should bid for it.
          
          His intercom buzzes, he's annoyed then.
          
                            
          
                                                                             74.
          
                                  SECRETARY (ON PHONE)
                      I'm sorry, sir. I have a call from Paul
                      in Kigali. He says it's urgent.
          
          The president goes to the phone, hits the speaker button.
          
                                  PRESIDENT
                      Paul. Are you alright?
          
                                  PAUL (O.S.)
                      We have a big problem. The Hutu army have
                      come and ordered us all of us out of the
                      hotel.
          
          The president is baffled.
          
                                   RESIDENT
                      Out? Where are you going?
          
                                   PAUL
                      I do not know, sir. I think they will
                      kill us all.
          
          The president can barely form words to reply.
          
                                  PRESIDENT
                      All. What do you mean all?
          
                                  PAUL
                      The staff, the guests.
          
                                  PRESIDENT
                      The staff and guests! How many?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Now we have eight hundred guests and one
                      hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.
                      I wish I could have done more, sir.
                      Please, thank all my friends at Sabena.
                      You have been good to me and my family.
          
                                  PRESIDENT
                      (panicked) Paul, wait, wait, I'm going to
                      put you on hold for one minute, stay on
                      the phone.
          
          He hits the hold button. Looks to the other executives. They are
          stunned to silence by Paul's profound farewell.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          Paul listens to music on the phone.
          
          
                                                                           75.
          
          
          INT. SABENA EXTERIOR OFFICES. DAY
          
          Pandemonium - the president has everyone working the phones.
          
                                  PRESIDENT
                      Get the prime minister's office. Call
                      General Chareaux. Louis get the UN. Tell
                      them this is Belgian property.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          The music is suddenly interrupted.
          
                                  PRESIDENT (O.S.)
                      Paul, are you there?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Yes, thank you Mr. President.
          
                                  PRESIDENT (O.S.)
                      Paul, if you have one call in all the
                      world to stop this, who would you call?
          
          Paul thinks.
          
                                  PAUL
                      The French. They supply the Rwandan army.
          
                                  PRESIDENT (O.S.)
                      Paul, do everything you can to buy time.
                      I will call you back.
          
          Paul hurries from the room.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Zozo at the computer, printing something. Paul walks up, sees: The
          Hotel's Registry printing. Paul grabs it, studies.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What are you doing?
          
                                  ZOZO
                      The lieutenant wants the register.
          
          He pushes Zozo toward the elevator.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Go and get more beer.
          
          Now Paul is on the computer, typing.
          
                                                                           76.
          
          ON SCREEN: The register shows that day's date: April 13.
          
          Paul hits a few keys.
          
          ON SCREEN: The date above the register is April 4.
          
          Paul hits the print button. The printer clicks to life.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Paul with the printed registry and Zozo with beer walk to the jeeps.
          The soldiers don't wait for the Captain's order, they mob Zozo, grab
          beers. The lieutenant marches up to Paul.
          
                                  LIEUTENANT
                      Where's the guest list?
          
          Paul hands him the printout. He studies it, reads.
          
                                  LIEUTENANT (CONT'D)
                      Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
          
                                  PAUL
                      The guest list. It hasn't been updated
                      since the murder of the president.
          
          The lieutenant grabs Paul by the shirt.
          
                                  LIEUTENANT
                      Are you trying to make a fool of me?
                      There are no Europeans left in that
                      hotel. Get me the names of all the
                      cockroaches in there.
          
                                  PAUL
                      That will take time.
          
                                  LIEUTENANT
                      You don't have time. If I do not have the
                      names, so that I can pick out the
                      traitors, then I will kill everyone here
                      in this car park. Get in there now.
          
          Paul turns to walk back in. The lieutenant hurries to his men, pulls
          beers from their hands, smashes them on the ground. One soldier comes
          running to him with a radio. Paul watches. The lieutenant listens, then
          calls to Paul.
          
                                  LIEUTENANT (CONT'D)
                      Hey you, come here.
          
          Paul returns.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           77.
          
                                     LIEUTENANT (CONT'D)
                         Who did you call?
          
                                      PAUL
                         Call, sir?
          
                                     LIEUTENANT
                         Don't lie to me. What's your name?
          
                                     PAUL
                         Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
          
                                     LIEUTENANT
                         I will remember that name. (turns to his
                         soldiers) Let's go.
          
          The soldiers roar off down the driveway.
          
             ZOZO looks to Paul, a thank you Jesus look.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL ROOF. DAY
          
          Paul emerges onto the roof, sees Tatiana, his children, and many of the
          neighbors sitting huddled together. (They do not know the soldiers have
          left.)
          
          Tatiana is frozen to the spot.
          
                                     PAUL
                         They have gone.
          
          Tatiana grabs him. Tears of joy. Paul's neighbors swarm him, touch him,
          thank him like a messiah. This effects him. He seems genuinely moved as
          he shakes hands and hugs them.
          
                                     ZOZO
                         Sir. The president of Sabena is on the
                         phone for you.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          Paul arrives behind the front desk.
          
          Paul hits the button.
          
                                     PAUL
                         They are gone. Thank you, sir. What did
                         you do?
          
                               
          
                                                                            78.
          
          
          INT. SABENA PRESIDENT'S OFFICE. BRUSSELS. DAY
          
          Gotfroid is at his desk.
          
                                  SABENA PRESIDENT
                      I managed to get the President of France
                      on the phone.
          
                                  PAUL (O.S.)
                      Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
          
                                  SABENA PRESIDENT
                      Paul, I pleaded with the president to go
                      in and get you all. He told me it will
                      not happen.
          
                                     PAUL
                      Why?
          
                                  SABENA PRESIDENT
                      I can give you many political answers
                      Paul but the truth is that Africa is not
                      worth a single vote to all of them:
                      French, British, Americans.
          
          Silence.
          
                                  SABENA PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
                      You have to get out of there, Paul. I
                      will do whatever I can.
          
                                                                 SMASH CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          The elite of the Tutsi refugees, those with contacts or friends abroad,
          are gathered in the office.
          
                                  PAUL
                      There will be no rescue, no intervention
                      force. We can only save ourselves. Call
                      any foreigner you know, tell them what
                      will happen to us. Say goodbye but when
                      you say goodbye, say it as though you're
                      reaching through and shaking their hand.
                      Let them know if they let go of that
                      hand, you will die. (silence) We must
                      shame them into sending help.
          
          The others look stunned.
          
                                                                           79.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Get on the phones while we still can. At
                      least we can say they heard our cries.
                      Zozo come with me.
          
          Paul leaves.
          
                                                                      CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul looks around the lobby. It resembles a refugee center more than a
          five star hotel.
          
          He turns to a computer, calls up the register, then hits DELETE and
          erases the register.
          
          He picks up the phone, calls.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Send two of the housekeeping carpenters
                      to the lobby.
          
          Paul strides across the lobby, calls to Zozo.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Everyone gather together now. Zozo get
                      them all together.
          
          They herd together quickly.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      No one can remain in this lobby any
                      longer. I have rooms available. Who can
                      pay? The rental is six hundred francs per
                      day.
          
          About fifty percent of the hands go up.
          
                                  TUTSI WOMAN
                      I cannot pay?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Go with Zozo to the ballroom. We will
                      find you bedding. This is a hotel. No one
                      will be allowed to stay in the lobby.
          
          The carpenters arrive beside Paul.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Good. I want you to go around and take
                      all the numbers off the doors.
          
                                 
          
                                                                            80.
          
                                  CARPENTER
                      What shall we put in their place.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Nothing. I want no numbers on the doors.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY
          
          Paul going door to door, knocking. The rooms are all packed with Tutsi
          refugees. A door opens.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Good day. Here is your bill for the last
                      week. If you cannot pay, or think you
                      will not be able to pay, go to the

                                                                  DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY.
          
          Paul knocks on a door. The Tutsi politician Xavier opens the door, sees
          that it is Paul.
          
                                  XAVIER
                      Come in Paul.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LUXURY SUITE. DAY
          
          A beautiful two-bedroom suite. Xavier lives in comfort compared to the
          other refugees.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'm afraid you will have to move room.
          
                                  XAVIER
                      Move? Where to?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'm going to put you on the third floor.
          
                                  XAVIER
                      The third floor are low class rooms.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Yes they are. However if the army return
                      they will expect important people such as
                      yourself to be in these grand rooms.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           81.
          
                                  XAVIER
                           (to his wife)
                      Pack the bags, we have to move.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Also, this is your bill for the last
                      week.
          
          Paul leaves, Xavier looks shocked.
          
                                                                     FADE TO:
          
          
          MONTAGE
          
          Paul and influential refugees, Odette, Benedict (with a bandage over
          his missing ear), Xavier and others call, plead, write and send faxes
          all around the world. We see this NIGHT and DAY; DAY and NIGHT --
          
           hen Odette on the phone.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      Yes, that's right. I helped set up the
                      treatment center in Nairobi. I'm in the
                      Mille Collines Hotel right now with my
                      husband, Peter, and my two boys. If you
                      do not help us we will be murdered.
          
          Zozo arrives.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      Sir, General Bizimungu is here.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL POOL TERRACE. DAY
          
          The pool patio is deserted except for General Bizimungu and three
          soldiers who lounge at a table. Gregoire and his girlfriend sun on
          reclining deck chairs like movie stars. Paul and a waiter with a tray
          of drinks join the General.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      I am glad you are well.
          
          Paul hands the scotch to Bizimungu.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
          
                                   GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      As long as it is scotch.
                            (drinks)
                      Your white friends have abandoned you,
                      Paul.
          
                                 
          
                                                                          82.
          
                                  PAUL
                      The United Nations are still here.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      (laughs) The United Nations. Madmen are
                      on the streets, Paul. But I will take
                      care of you. (chugs his drink) Your
                      cellar is well-stocked, right?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I
                      overheard something that I think you
                      should know about.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      What did you overhear?
          
                                  PAUL
                      A discussion between an American Embassy
                      official and a UN Colonel.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      What did they say?
          
                                  PAUL
                      The American assured the colonel that
                      they would watch everything.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Watch everything? How? They are gone.
          
          Paul points surreptitiously to the sky. The General looks up.
          
                                    PAUL
                      Satellites.
          
                                    GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Satellites?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on
                      your shoulder.
          
                                   ENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      And what will they do with these
                      satellites?
          
                                  PAUL
                      The American said intervention is too
                      costly, better to get photographic
                      evidence and snatch up the high command.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      The high command? Our high command?
          
                         
          
                                                                           83.
          
                                  PAUL
                      'Snatch them up and put on a war crimes
                      trial. Lock them all away forever. No
                      political risk, and big publicity.'
                      That's what he said. (a beat) I thought
                      I'd better tell you.
          
          The General looks again to the sky then.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      The Americans! Who are they to put us on
                      trial. Let us imagine Paul when their
                      president Kennedy was shot, they said it
                      was a black man. Then their politicians,
                      their radio stations gave orders `we must
                      wipe out these black people before they
                      wipe out us.' What do you think would
                      have happened? No different.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL CELLAR. DAY
          
          Paul fills Bizimungu's briefcase with scotch, hands two six-packs of
          beer to Zozo. Paul notes his once packed storeroom, now considerably
          dwindled in stock.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Where has all our beer gone?
          
                                  ZOZO
                      Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
          
                                  PAUL
                      How much beer?
          
                                    ZOZO
                      Many beers.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL POOL TERRACE. AFTERNOON
          
          Paul arrives back at the pool, hands Bizimungu his briefcase. Zozo
          gives the beer to the soldiers.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I am worried about thieves and criminals
                      coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could
                      arrange for some police to guard us.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      The police are very busy.
          
          
                                                                             84.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I understand General, but when I last                            
                      talked to the president of Sabena he                             
                      promised me that anyone who helped                               
                      protect Belgian property would be                                
                      rewarded.                                                        
          
          Bizimungu understands this is a financial proposition.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU                                    
                      He did.                                                          
                                  PAUL                                                 
                      "Well rewarded" Those were his words.   
                                   
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      If I were to spare a few policemen, where
                      would I station them?
          
                                  PAUL
                      The front gate would be best, General.
                      They could check all guests.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      I will see what I can do.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I admire you, General. How do you keep
                      command of your men amidst such madness?
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I wish I were like you. Look at my staff,
                      they won't work, they listen to no one.
          
          Paul nods over toward Gregoire.
          
                                     ENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      He is staff?
          
           he General gets up.
          
          Gregoire, who is lying face down on the deck chair, doesn't see him
          approach. The General pulls the deck chair from underneath Gregoire and
          throws it into the pool. As Gregoire tries to scramble to his feet, the
          General propels him forward with a massive kick up the ass.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU (CONT'D)
                      Get to work, you slug.
          
          Gregoire races from the pool, followed by his girlfriend.
          
                                                                           85.
          
          The General clicks his fingers and his soldiers follow.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU (CONT'D)
                      Make sure, Paul, your guests are
                      generous.
          
          
          INT. LOBBY. DAY
          
          Benedict greets Paul in the lobby.
          
                                   BENEDICT
                      Paul, we would like to speak to you in
                      your office.
          
                                  PAUL
                      We, who is we?
          
                                  BENEDICT
                      A delegation.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          Paul walks in and discovers the office packed with the elite Tutsi
          refugees including Xavier, Odette and Jean Baptiste. Paul's puzzled,
          there's an air of tension in the room.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Yes.
          
          A brief silence, then a Tutsi bank manager speaks.
          
                                  BANKER
                      You have no right to charge us rent.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Why not?
          
                                  BANKER
                      This is no longer a hotel, it is a prison
                      and you are profiteering from our misery.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      That is not true.
          
          Another accuser speaks up.
          
                                  TUTSI ACCUSER
                      Yes it is. He charges for food, for
                      everything. Where is all this money
                      going? We hear he has a deal with
                      Bizimungu.
          
          
                                                                            86.
          
                                  TUTSI ACCUSER #2
                      It is said that you work for the murderer
                      George Rutagunda.
          
          Murmurs of agreement. Paul has heard enough.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I confess. ( a beat) It's true I have a
                      deal with General Bizimungu. He was just
                      here. I worked out another money making
                      scheme for him. New arrivals will be
                      taxed at the gate.
          
          Silence.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Do you know what my deal is with
                      Bizimungu. I pay him and he keeps you
                      alive. Anyone want to take their money
                      back?
          
          PAUL pulls money from his pocket, hands it around, offers it.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Here, here take it. And you don't have to
                      pay your bill. I will move you into the
                      ballroom or out into the gardens.
          
          He walks among them.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      And, yes, I work with George Rutagunda.
                      I buy rice and beans, beer and soap. I
                      will have to visit his warehouse soon
                      because we are running out of food. Who
                      wants to come with me?
          
          Paul holds the door open.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Anyone who wants to come with me stay
                      behind. If not, please leave.
          
          They hurry out, duly chastised. But Odette and her husband Jean
          Baptiste remain.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (laughs)
                      You are most certainly not coming with
                      me. You will get me killed.
          
                                  JEAN BAPTISTE
                      You can't go to that place, they know
                      what you are doing here.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           87.
          
                                  PAUL
                      George will not hurt me, I am too
                      profitable to him.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      What if he is not there?
          
          Paul hasn't got an answer for that one. He leads them out.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Roger is asleep, on a couch in the living room, several kids sleep on
          the floor.
          
          TO THE BED: Where Tatiana suppresses bursts of laughter as Paul relates
          the Gregoire story in whispers.
          
                                  PAUL
                      As soon as the General left he came
                      running back. (mimics Gregoire) Help me,
                      sir, I have been possessed by a witch.
                      (Paul's own voice now) A witch you say?
                      (mimics) Yes, yes, I did not know I was
                      in that room. The president's room, why
                      would I be in the president's room? (own
                      voice) Indeed, the General asked me the
                      same. (mimics) Asked you what? (own
                      voice) Does Gregoire think he is
                      president now?
          
          PAUL mimics Gregoire's whimpers of fear.
          
                                  TATIANA
                           (laughing)
                      Stop, stop, we will waken the children.
          
          Paul lifts the bottle of fine bordeaux, pours more.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or
                      fine rare beef.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      So where is the lamb?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
          
          They both chuckle, then Paul remembers, a cloud of anxiety comes over
          him.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What's the matter?
          
              
          
                                                                          88.
          
                                  PAUL
                      We're running out of beer and other
                      supplies.
          
          She kisses him.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      The foreigners abandon us and you do
                      inventory. You are so conscientious.
          
          She kisses him again, tries to cheer him.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I have to go out to get food.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Go out! Where?
          
                                  PAUL
                      To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      No, no.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I have to, Tatiana, we are only as                         
                      valuable as the service we provide.                        
                                  TATIANA
                      You cannot go alone.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire
                      with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants
                      to impress me now.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          The lobby is deserted except for Gregoire now neatly dressed.
          
                      G           PAUL
                       regoire it is good to see you back to
                      work.
          
                                  GREGOIRE
                      Please, except my humblest apologies...
          
                                  PAUL
                      Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I
                      must go to visit my good friend George
                      Rutagunda. You know George?
          
          Gregoire nods, impressed.
          
                                                                           89.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Fetch the van.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAWN
          
          A thick mist blankets the grounds as Paul and Gregoire emerge.
          
                                  GREGOIRE
                      (fearful) Where are we going, sir?
          
                                  PAUL
                      For supplies, you drive.
          
                                  GREGOIRE
                      The fog is too heavy, sir.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Just drive, Gregoire.
          
          
          INT. VAN. DAWN
          
          They pass the gate, the policemen are asleep in the box.
          
          The van passes along the deserted main road, past a wrecked car, over
          broken glass, the fog swirls around them.
          
          Then Gregoire hits the brakes.
          
          In front of them, a makeshift barricade, long poles stretched across
          two oil drums.
          
          They wait for someone to appear from the fog: No one.
          
                                  GREGOIRE
                      We should go back, sir.
          
          Paul wants to agree, but can't. He opens his door.
          
          
          EXT. ROAD. DAY
          
          Paul gets out, tentative.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Hello?
          
          Nothing. He moves to the barrier, lifts the pole, places it on the
          ground, hurries back to the van.
          
          
          
                                                                           90.

                                    PAUL
                      Let's go.
          
          They drive past the barricade.
          
          The van weaves through the fog-enshrouded streets.
          
           hey slow to check road signs in the fog - on one a woman's dress,
          shredded and soaked in blood, is draped like a banner.
          
          
          EXT. RUTAGANDA'S WAREHOUSE. DAWN
          
          The fog still hangs like a cloud. As they pull up, a group of young
          Militia emerge from Toyota trucks.
          
                                  MILITIAMAN #1
                      What do you want?
          
                                  PAUL
                      We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
          
                                  MILITIAMAN #1
                      The commander is not here.
          
                                  PAUL
                      He will be here.
          
                                  MILITIAMAN #1
                      Show me your ID
          
          Paul and Gregoire hand over their ID cards. The Militia man studies
          them, then pockets the cards.
          
                                    PAUL
                      Excuse me.
          
                                    MILITIAMAN #1
                      What?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Our cards, please.
          
                                    MILITIAMAN #1
                      What cards?
          
                                  PAUL
                      You have our cards.
          
          
          
          
          
                                                                           91.
          
                                    MILITIAMAN #1
                        No. But I make cards. Would you like me
                        to make you two cards?
          
                                      PAUL
                        How much?
          
                                    MILITIAMAN #1
                        One thousand francs.
          
          Then from out of the fog, three Toyota trucks roar up. George
          Rutagunda, heavily armed, in cut-off shorts and an open shirt, his
          barrel chest laden with bandoliers, jumps out.
          
           he Militia man pulls out the ID cards, hands them back.

                       joke.
          
          Rutagunda strides over.
          
                                    GEORGE
                        Paul. My old friend.
          
          Paul climbs out, greets George, as a Militia man swings open the doors
          of the warehouse. They walk in.
          
          
          INT. RUTAGANDA'S WAREHOUSE. DAY
          
          The warehouse is filled with looted televisions, artwork, cars. George
          points to the stacks of beer.
          
                                    GEORGE
                        Everything is double the price now, you
                        do understand that?
          
                                    PAUL
                        I need rice, beans, beer, and your best
                        whiskey.    G
          
                                     EORGE
                        Beer yes, but no whiskey.
          
                                    PAUL
                        You have no whiskey?
          
                                    GEORGE
                        No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich
                        cockroaches at the hotel, they will have
                        to do without their scotch. Anyway, I                       
                        have bled that cow enough Paul.                             
          
                    
          
          
          
                                                                           92.
          
          Paul counts out the Rwandan francs.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What do you mean George?                                     
                                  GEORGE
                      Their money is no good to them. Soon all                     
                      the Ineysi will be dead.                                     
                                  PAUL
                           (incredulous) )                                         
                      You cannot kill them all.
          
                                  GEORGE
                                                                                   
                      Why not? We are half way there already.
          
          Paul's stomach heaves. He hides it, turns over the money, gets in the    
          van with Gregoire. George comes to the passenger window.                 
                                   EORGE (CONT'D)
                      Let me give you a tip my friend, our                         
                      generals in the army say 'do not go near                     
                      the Mille Collines or they will send the                     
                      Belgian soldiers back here'. But the                         
                      generals are about to leave, and we will                     
                      be in charge. It is time to butcher your                     
                      cow for the meat. (a beat)                                   
                      You can help us Paul. You have some very                     
                      important traitors at your hotel. The                        
                      politician Xavier. The liar Benedict. If                     
                      we were to get them, then maybe we could
                      let one or two cockroaches get away. You                     
                      understand, Paul.
          
          Paul says nothing, but Gregoire has been listening very carefully.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Let's go.
          
                                  GEORGE
                      Take the river road back. It is clear.
          
          The van takes off.
          
          
          INT. VAN. DAWN
          
          The fog has gotten thicker. They can barely see a yard ahead.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Are you sure this is the river road?
          
                                  GREGOIRE
                      I saw the sign.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           93.
          
          The van begins to bump erratically. Bump, bump, bump.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Stop. You've driven off the road.
                      You'll put us in the river.
          
          The van jerks to a halt.
          
          
          EXT. RIVER ROAD. DAWN
          
          Paul clambers out, stumbles, falls.
          
          And discovers he's looking at the face of a dead child, a young Tutsi
          girl, her hands clasped on her ears as though to block the sound of her
          own death - an African Munz's Scream.
          
          Paul clambers to his feet, sees that the van is on a road littered with
          dead bodies, men, women, children.
          
           he bumps were dead bodies, the van has driven over them.
          
          A breeze from the lake blows the fog clear for thirty feet.
          
          REVEALING: a carpet of bodies, hundreds of them sprawled all along the
          road as far as Paul can see. Paul wanders stunned among misshapen
          corpses, made more ghostly by wisps of fog.
          
          Finally, Paul clambers shell-shocked back into the van.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Go back! Go back!
          
          Gregoire throws the van into reverse.
          
           hey bump back over the carpet of bodies, each shake and crunch another
          horror.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL REAR DELIVERY AREA. DAY
          
          The van pulls up at the rear suppliers entrance. Paul hops out, turns
          to Gregoire.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Tell no one what you saw, do you
                      understand?
          
          Gregoire, Zozo and the porters begin unloading the van.
          
                   
          
                                                                              94.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL GARDENS. DAY
          
          Paul wanders to a bench set back in a manicured grove of bushes. Beyond
          him a crowd of Rwandan refugee children play in the swimming pool,
          laughing, jumping, splashing like they were at a municipal pool in
          Central Park.
          P
          
          PAUL watches. Tears stream from his eyes, the stream grows into a
          flood, he buries his face in his hands.
          
          Then a voice.
          
                                    LITTLE BOY (O.S.)
                      Mr. Manager.
          
          Paul wipes his eyes, turns.
          
          A little boy stands behind him, holding out his arm.
          
                                  LITTLE BOY (CONT'D)
                      Mr. Manager, sir.
          
          Then Paul sees what is wrong. The boy Has a big thorn imbedded in the
          muscle of his arm. Paul studies it.
          
                                  PAUL
                      That's a big one. (pinches the thorn)
                      Here we go.
          
          Paul pulls on the thorn, the kid doesn't flinch.
          
          Paul picks him up, carries him to the pool, throws him in.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Tatiana feeds the children - rice and beans. Paul arrives.
          
                                  CHILDREN
                      Good evening, Papa.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Roger, you have no greeting for me.
          
          Roger tries to speak, struggles to mouth the words but nothing comes
          out, as though he has forgotten. Tears form in his eyes.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      There, do not worry, no tears.
          
          He hugs him, puts him back at his food, then takes Tatiana's hand,
          leads her to the door.
          
               
          
          
                                                                           95.
          
                                   TATIANA
                       (whispers) Where are we going?
          
          They slip out.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL ROOF DOOR. NIGHT
          
          Tatiana stops.
          
                                   TATIANA
                       Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the
                       roof?
          
                                   PAUL
                       It's alright. This is the only place I
                       can find some peace.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL ROOF. NIGHT
          
          Paul slips out onto the roof. Tatiana follows. Artillery and mortar
          fire rumble in the distance. Flashes silhouette along the far hills
          above Kigali.
          
          He leads her to a blanket, a candle, two glasses and the bottle of
          wine. They sit. He opens the wine.
          
                                   TATIANA
                       (laughs) I hear we must pay for
                       everything. How much for this?
          
                                   PAUL
                       A kiss.
          
          They kiss.
          
                                   TATIANA
                       You are a very good man, Paul
                       Rusesabagina.
          
           he kisses him again.
          
                                   PAUL
                       I have a confession. When we met...
          
                                   TATIANA
                       In Ruhengeri?
          
                                   PAUL
                       Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
          
                                   TATIANA
                       Yes.
          
          
          
                                                                          96.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I had you transferred to Kigali.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I bribed the Minister of Health to have
                      you transferred to Kigali.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Why?
          
                                  PAUL
                      To be closer. So that I could marry you.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What was the bribe?
                           (silence)
                      What am I worth to you?
          
                                  PAUL
                      It was substantial.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Tell me what it was.
          
                                  PAUL
                      A car.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What sort of car?
          
                                  PAUL
                      What does it matter.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      I want to know.
          
                                  PAUL
                      A Volkswagen.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      A Volkswagen!
          
           he slaps him playfully.
          
                                  TATIANA (CONT'D)
                      I hope it was a new Volkswagen.
          
          She kisses him, they lie back on the roof, kiss passionately.
          
          
          
                                                                           97.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Paul instructs the porters to clean around the entrance.
          
          The UN armored car comes up the driveway. Colonel Oliver gets out,       
          strides across the tarmac, he shakes Paul's hand.

                        Great news, Paul, we're going to get you
                        out of here.
          
          I
          The sweetest words Paul has ever heard.

              voice calls out.

                                  TUTSI WOMAN
                      Colonel, sir. Why not take us all to the                       
                      airport? We can wait there to obtain
                      visas.

                      I can't do that. Our camp at the airport
                      is overwhelmed already. We could not
                      defend you there. You are better to stay
                      here and work to get an exit visa.
          
           Oliver jumps from the stage, pushes through the crowd.                    
          Paul's POV: Odette and Jean Baptiste are silently devastated. He pushes
          through to the Colonel now surrounded by those who didn't make the         
          list.
          
                                   PAUL
                      Colonel, Odette Camundu ... she must be                        
                      on the list.
          
           Oliver shakes his head no.                                                
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                     
                      Paul, only those I called can get on the
                      trucks. I do not want to have to pull
                      people off, you understand?
          
          Paul nods yes. Tatiana arrives beside him, pulls him aside.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      I will not leave without the twins.
          
                                  PAUL
                      We have to get out of here Tatiana.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Please, please try one more time.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'll try but we have to leave, with or
                      without them. I want you to promise.
          
          She reluctantly nods yes.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Mr. Garindi waits nervously in the lobby.
          
          Paul arrives.
          
          
                                                                           99.
          
                                  MR. GARINDI
                      It is dangerous to be here. The radio
                      says this is a nest of cockroaches.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I need one last favor. Go back and get
                      the twins.
          
                                  MR. GARINDI
                      (emphatic) No, it is impossible. That
                      side of town has been destroyed in the
                      fighting. The children are dead.
          
                                  PAUL
                      How do you know?
          
                                  MR. GARINDI
                      Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the
                      bodies in the street. I have to go.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I will give you my house.
          
          The businessman turns back.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      It's a fine house. Here is a paper.
          
          Paul spots an elegant woman carrying laundry toward the elevator. He
          runs to her.            P
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Madame Kawunda, please.
          
          Paul leads her over.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      I need you to witness this signature.
                           (to the businessman)
                      Madame Kawunda is the Minister for
                      Agriculture. She is a very reliable
                      witness.
          
          Paul signs, then hands the pen to the puzzled woman.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Please witness this deed.
          
          She signs. Paul pushes the deed into the man's hand.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      There, now go and find them. They have no
                      papers. No one knows they are Tutsi. They
                      will be alive.
          
          
          
                                                                          100.
          
          The businessman heads for the door.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      You must be back by 7:00a.m. tomorrow.
          
          Paul watches him go.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Seven, remember.

          EXT. HOTEL GARDENS. NIGHT
          
          Paul skirts the little groups of poor families bivouacked on the lawn.
          The smoke of cooking fires has replaced the Tiki lanterns. The grounds
          are a mini refugee camp.
          
          Paul joins Tatiana, Odette and Jean Baptiste who sit at a table by the
          pool.
          
                                   DETTE
                      Don't worry, Paul, we will make the next
                      list.
          
          ZOZO arrives, with beers, serves them, is about to leave. Tatiana grabs    
          him by the arm.                                                            
                                  TATIANA                                            
                      Sit with us Zozo.  
                                                      
                                  ZOZO                                               
                      No ma,am, I am too busy.   
                                              
                                  PAUL                                               
                      Zozo you are family, join us.                                  
          Zozo is shocked by this breach of protocol but sits.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      You are my dearest friends. I promise you
                      before God that I will not sleep until I
                      have you out of here. All of you.
          
          He embraces Jean Baptiste
          
                                  JEAN BAPTISTE
                      It is good that you are going, Paul,
                      because now we know we have one person
                      who will save us.
          
          Odette hugs and kisses him.
          
                                                                            101.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      We owe you our lives.
          
          Paul takes Zozo in his arms.
          
                                  PAUL
                      You are my family now, Zozo, my brother.
                      I will get you out of here.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      Thank you, sir.

                      Let us remember this night and tell the
                      world that even in hell there are good

          and his wife; Benedict; and others.
          
          Some of the unlucky ones peer around the door of the ballroom. A UN
          officer stands in their way.

                      We wait until 7:00. If he is not here
                      with the twins he is not coming. We
                      leave. That was your promise. Go help the

          Paul is in a horrible mood. The refugees in the ballroom try to push by
          the UN officer. Paul joins him.

                         Zozo, tell those people to get back to
                         the ballroom. They can not be here.
          
          Zozo scampers off.

                         What are we waiting for? Come on.

          CLOSE ON: Gregoire watching from behind the front desk.
          
          Through the doors we see the trucks being loaded.
          
          Zozo returns.

                         Sir, the others want to speak to you.
          
          Reluctant, Paul walks over to the ballroom dwellers.

                         Yes.
          
                                      TUTSI WOMAN
                         Good, sir we have letters, please take
                         them for us.
          
          Paul reaches out for the letters, takes them, reads the addresses:
          President Nelson Mandela. Pope John Paul. President Clinton.
          
                                     TUTSI MAN #1
                         If you leave, we are certain to die.
          
                                     ZOZO
                         I have a letter, sir.
          
          Zozo hands Paul the letter. He studies the address. It reads "To the
          great man Muhammad Ali."
          
           thers crowd around.
          
                                     PAUL
                         I will get you all visas. I promise. I
                         will get you out of here.
          
          Paul's at a loss. He has to tear himself away.
          
              fraid to look back, he heads for the convoy.
          
             
          
                                                                           103.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          The last of the evacuees clamber onto the UN trucks. The children are
          on board but Tatiana waits.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Ask them to wait a little longer. For the
                      twins.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Get on the truck, Tatiana.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      No.
          
          He checks his watch, then takes her in his arms.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Look, our children are crying, please get
                      on the truck.
          
          Paul helps Tatiana on board. He looks toward the door.
          
          POV: The unlucky refugees are now crowded at the windows, lost souls
          watching out from their prison at the lucky ones.
          
          Paul whispers to Benedict as he boards.
          
          
          INT. TRUCK DAY
          
          Paul clambers on beside him.   He reaches Tatiana as Benedict sits
          beside her.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I have to stay.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      No! Sit down now.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I cannot leave these people. I will wait
                      for the twins.
          
          Paul backs off. Tatiana tries to follow. Benedict grabs her.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Let go. Let me off this truck.
          
          A commotion as she tries to get up.
          
                                  TATIANA (CONT'D)
                      Let me go. Children get off.
          
          
                                                                          104.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I will follow on the next plane. Go.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY.
          
          The truck starts up. Paul runs beside it, shouts to Tatiana.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I love you. Keep the children safe.
          
                                    TATIANA
                      Paul!
          
          Then another voice.
          
                                    ROGER
                      Papa! Papa!
          
          The convoy takes off down the driveway.
          
          Paul, Zozo and other refugees cluster by the door.
          
          ZOZO looks round,
          
          I
          Sees: Gregoire put a phone down.
          
          
          INT. UN JEEP. DAY

          proceeds unheeded.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL PAUL'S ROOM. DAY
          
          The room is still littered with clothes, kids drawings, the personal
          junk accumulated over four weeks.
          
          Paul tries to arrange things, then collapses on the bed, paralysed with
          doubt - Why did he do this?
          
          Then the door bangs.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      Boss, sir, quick, please, come quick.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY
          
          The door springs open, Paul confronts Zozo.
          
             
          
          
                                                                           105.
          
                                  ZOZO
                           (breathless)
                      Sir, the radio, you must hear, it is on
                      the radio.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL KITCHEN. DAY
          
          Paul and Zozo burst into the kitchen. The cooks and others are
          clustered, listening to the radio.
          
                                  RADIO ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

                                  ZOZO

          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul bursts out of the kitchen - enraged.
          
          Gregoire is at the front desk. Sees Paul - understands instantly.
          
          Gregoire takes off, running for his life.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL GARDENS. DAY
          
          Paul chases after him, through the door.
          
          Gregoire disappears into the thicket of trees.
          
          Paul after him.
          
          Through the trees.
          
          Gregoire, younger, faster, climbs the high wire fence.
          
          Finally, Paul reaches the fence.
          
          
          
          
                                                                            106.

          INT. JEEP TRAVELLING. DAY
          
          As the UN jeep turns a bend, Colonel Oliver SEES crowds of Interahamwe       
          swarming from beside houses, from gardens. They pull burning tires, old
          furniture, junk onto the road.
          
          
          INT. TRUCK TRAVELLING. DAY
          
          The UN truck suddenly lurches, then slows.    The refugees from the Mille

                                    TATIANA
                        What's happening?
          
          
          INT. HOTEL OFFICE. DAY
          
          Paul is on the fax phone, begging.

                        Please, General, I will give you money,
                        whiskey.

                        Please, I have money. They're driving
                        into an ambush, it's on the radio.
          
          
          EXT. KIGALI STREET JUNCTION. DAY
          
          Swarms of crazed Militia fill the road. Gun fire breaks out.
          
          Colonel Oliver steps from the jeep, waving his pistol in the air.
          M                                                                            
           ilitia men swarm around him, push past to the truck.
          
          INSIDE THE TRUCK:
          
              MACHETE SLASHES through the canvas.
          
           hildren scream, HANDS GRAB at people.
          
          Benedict is hauled off the truck. Beaten.
          
          Tatiana protects her kids in a corner, kicking at the hands that grab
          for her.
          
          
          
                                                                          107.
          
          ON THE STREET: Xavier falls to the ground.
          
          Screams, shouts, MORE SHOTS.
          
          Oliver fights his way through to Xavier.                                   
          Oliver points his pistol.                                                  
          The crowd backs off slightly.
          
          Xavier gets to his feet.
          
          BANG - more gun fire. IMMACULATA falls, wounded in the foot.
          
          More are dragged from the trucks. Machetes flash in the sun.
          
          Then HORNS, GUNFIRE - RWANDAN SOLDIERS drive through the crowd in two
          jeeps. The crowd scatters, then re-forms as Rwandan soldiers push
          between the Militia and the refugees.
          
          As they do, another Militia gunman steps out, fires wildly at the
          refugees, but wounds A RWANDAN SOLDIER in the stomach.
          
          Suddenly fights erupt between the Militia and the soldiers.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Paul paces up and down, he can hear gunfire in the distance.
          
          MACHINE GUNFIRE - THEN SINGLE SHOTS.
          
          Paul jumps in the van, guns the engine, drives.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FRONT GATE. DAY.
          
          Paul's van speeds toward the gate.
          
          THEN - A LOUD METALLIC SCREECHING NOISE
          
          As a UN JEEP, its tires shot out, sparks cascading from wheel rims,
          screams up to the guard house.
          
          Paul slams on the brakes.
          
          The jeep is followed by the two trucks, their canvas slashed fluttering
          in the wind.
          
          Paul throws the van into reverse and clears the way.
          
          The convoy pulls up in front of the hotel.
          
          Bloody and battered, the terrified refugees fall from the trucks.
          
                      
          
          
                                                                             108.
          
          Paul and Odette run among the casualties. Then he sees them:
          
          Tatiana, clothes torn, scratches on her face.
          
          The kids screaming in terror.
          
             PAUL runs to them, grabs, kisses, weeps louder.
          
          Battered refugees everywhere, other hotel residents looking on -
          equally terrified because: They know they are doomed.
          
          Paul sees Roger, trembling, tears soak his face.
          
                                       ROGER
                         Papa! Papa!
          
          He grabs Roger up. Tatiana struggles to Paul, embraces.
          
                                     PAUL
                         Thank God you are safe.
          
          Tatiana breaks from the embrace.
          
                                     TATIANA
                         Did he bring the twins?
          
          Paul shakes his head no.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL GARDENS. DAY
          
          Paul sits alone on his secluded bench in the garden.
          
              cloud of despair shrouds him.
          
          As he watches several women dip cooking pots into the pool.
          
              e hurries toward them.
          
                                     PAUL
                         What are you doing?

          P              There is no water from the pipes.
          
          PAUL heads for the front doors. He's intercepted by the two Rwandan
          policemen stationed at the gate by Bizimungu.
          
                                     GENDARME
                          here is our beer? You promised us beer.
          
                                     PAUL
                         Did you explain to the good General that
                         I have temporarily run out of stock?
          
          
                                                                  109.

                      He said to ask Mitterand and the French
                      to send you more.
          
                                  PAUL
                      You will get it in due time. Now, please,
                      get back to the gate.

          Paul enters, sees Zozo.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What is this about no water?
          
                                  ZOZO
                      It's true, sir, the water has been turned           
                      off.

          Paul enters. Odette, Benedict watch CNN on the TV.
          
          PAUL shakes his head in disbelief.
          
                                  PAUL
                      We can still get CNN here in hell.
          
          A state department woman gives a press conference.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      The Americans are talking about us.

                      From the reports we have received from
                      Rwanda it appears that acts of genocide
                      have been committed.
          
                                  REPORTER
                      Excuse me, how many acts of genocide does
                      it take to declare this a genocide?
          
                                  STATE DEPT. OFFICER
                      I, ahh, there is, ahh we have
                      terminology, that has been.
          
                                                                          110.
          
                                  BRIT REPORTER
                      You haven't answered the question. How
                      many acts of genocide before your
                      government will declare this a genocide?
          
                                  STATE DEPT. OFFICER
                      I'm not prepared to, nor am I able.
          
          Everyone in the room is dumbfounded.
          
          Then Benedict begins laughing, a maniacal laugh, then he bangs on his
          chest, and hoots like a chimpanzee.
          
                                  BENEDICT
                      I've got it. I have the answer. Watch.
          
          They all stare as he begins beating his chest, and hopping about like
          an ape.
          
                                  BENEDICT (CONT'D)
                      We must become mountain gorillas. Then
                      they can put us on the endangered species
                      list. Come on, try it. They think we're
                      halfway there already.
          
          Benedict hops up onto a desk.
          
          The door flies open. It's General Bizimungu.
          
          He surveys the room, then points at Paul.
          
                                   GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Come here.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY.
          
          Bizimungu looks terrible, an alcoholic suffering D.T.s.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Where are my supplies?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      You have cockroaches dancing on tables
                      and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did
                      they drink my whiskey?
          
                                  PAUL
                      No. We have no way of finding other stock
                      but I have money for you from the guests.
          
                                                                          111.
          
          Paul pulls a bundle of notes, hands them to the General.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Rwandan francs! They are only good now
                      for wiping your ass. There is nothing
                      more I can do for you people. No police.
                      No protection. You're on your own.
          
          The General storms off.
          
          
          INT. LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul walks through the lobby. He carries an ash tray to a trash can,
          the futile task of a dedicated hotel manager on auto-pilot. He sees a
          UN jeep pull up outside.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Paul meets the UN soldiers, (They are the four Ghanians who guard the
          gate). They look frightened.
          
                                  UN OBSERVER
                      The policemen have gone. What happened?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I ran out of whiskey. Please go down and
                      guard us.
          
          Then ROAR of an engine and the CRASH of splintering wood.
          
          As a battered Toyota pickup appears, it races up the driveway. The
          truck drags the wooden gatehouse on a rope behind.
          
          Crazed Militia pack the bed of the pickup.
          
          BANG, BANG, BANG. A Militia man fires a pistol into the air.
          
          The Tutsi refugees camped on the lawn flee in panic as the Militia
          truck speeds around the driveway.
          
          The Militia taunt and yell at the Tutsi refugees.
          
          The truck does a screeching turn and heads back down the driveway,
          leaving a trail of splintered wood.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Get down there and stop them, please.
          
          Now the Ghanians are really frightened.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Get down and stop them.
          
                                                                          112.
          
                                  UN SOLDIER
                      You know we cannot shoot.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What do you mean you cannot shoot?
          
                                  UN SOLDIER
                      We are peacekeepers, it is not in our
                      mandate to shoot.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Then go and pretend you are soldiers.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL GARDENS. NIGHT
          
          Paul and Tatiana pass the clusters of families around their cooking
          fires. They pass the pool, now just a third full. He sits her on the
          bench in the grove.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      We are almost out of water.
          
                                  PAUL
                      We are almost out of everything.
          
          He takes her hand.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      We had a good life, you and I. I want to
                      make our peace. To thank God for the time
                      we had.
          
          He kisses her, total love.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      We have to have a plan.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What sort of plan?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Our children cannot see us die first. If
                      the Militia comes, you must hurry up to
                      the roof. I will meet you there.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Please do not talk like this.
          
                                  PAUL
                      We have to. If I do not come, you must
                      take them all by the hands and jump.
          
          She puts her hands to her ears. He pulls them down.
          
          
                                                                          113.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      The machete is no way to die. Promise me
                      you will do it.
          
          She cries harder and squeezes his hand in fear.
          
           uddenly, A BANG, from behind them and then above their heads a trail
          of fire - an RPG rocket - zigzags toward the hotel.
          
          A HUGE EXPLOSION on the wall, one-story beneath the roof.
          
          Paul throws Tatiana to the ground, covers her.
          S
          
           moke and concrete dust fall around them.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL STORE ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Paul, Zozo stand amongst the debris: a gaping hole in a wall. The room
          is covered in burned note papers, menus brochures for Sabena's two
          hotels, the Mille Collines and the Diplomat.
          
          Odette appears carrying her medical bag.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      Was anyone hurt?
          
                                  PAUL
                      No. It was only a storeroom.                                   
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. NIGHT
          
          Colonel Oliver arrives in his armored truck. Paul, Odette, Benedict and    
          others gather around him.
          
                                  PAUL
                      They fired a rocket at us.
          
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                                    
                      Yes.   Where are the Rwandan police?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them
                      away.
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                     
                      That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you
                      this but we've heard rumors the Militia
                      are getting ready to storm the hotel.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Will you protect us.
          
          
          
          
                                                                       114.

                       I can't, I don't have the men.
          
                                   VARIOUS VOICES
                       We have no one...We will be killed.
          
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                              
                       There's one option.
          
                                     PAUL
                       What is it?
          
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                              
                       The rebels have fought their way into the
                       city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
                       They're willing to exchange them for you
                       all.
          
                                   ODETTE
                       Will the Hutu army agree?
          
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                              
                       I think so. They are in disarray now. The
                       rebels are winning, and the Hutu high
                       command are anxious to get some of their
                       men back.

                       By convoy.
          
                                   XAVIER
                       This time the Militia will kill us.
          
                                   PAUL
                       They will surely kill us here. It's over
                       here. We have to take the chance.
          
                                   TUTSI WOMAN
                       No, we'll be chopped on the street.
          
                                   PAUL
                       We'll be chopped here.
          
          The crowd disperses. Colonel Oliver takes Paul aside.  
                   
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                              
                       A man came to my headquarters, asked that
                       I give you this.
          
          Colonel   Oliver hands a letter.                                     
          
                                                                          115.
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER (CONT'D)                            
                      Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two.
                      I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I
                      will have to scrounge it.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I can't. I have nothing left to bribe
                      with. Can your men at the gate hold out
                      for another day?
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                     
                      No, Paul, they're afraid. They've
                      demanded to be moved back to headquarters
                      now.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Give me their uniforms. I will put people
                      at the gate, in disguise.
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                     
                      I wish I could, Paul. Try to hold out.
                      One more day.
          
          Colonel Oliver leaves. Their is nothing more Paul can do.                  
          
          INT. HOTEL PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Tatiana is beside him. He opens the envelope, finds his makeshift house
          deed and a note.
          
                                   PAUL
                      It's from Garandi.                                             
                           (reads)
                      I am sorry. There is no hope for the
                      twins. The old lady's house has been                           
                      destroyed.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Paul sleeps fitfully. It is almost dawn, then he sits up.
          
                                  PAUL
                      The Diplomat!
          
          Tatiana wakens, startled.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What's wrong?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I have to go to the Diplomat.
          
                                                                          116.
          
          
          INT. OFFICE. DAWN
          
          Paul is on the one working phone.
          
                                  PAUL
                      General, sir. I am glad to find you. I
                      have found you some supplies.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU   (O.S.)
                      Whiskey?
          
                                  PAUL
                      The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come
                      and I will get them for you.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU   (O.S.)
                      I'll be over.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Bring back your policemen...
          
          ...But the line is already dead.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Bizimungu's jeeps arrives at the hotel. Paul greets him.
          
                                  PAUL
                      We must go to the Diplomat.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Get in.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Your police are at the gate?
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      After the Diplomat!
          
          Paul clambers in the back.
          
          
          INT. JEEP TRAVELLING. DAY
          
          The jeep turns away from the Mille Collines front gate.
          
          They travel at high speed along the road. Then the driver sounds his
          horn, because...
          
          Paul sees: A large crowd of Militia marching along the road toward the
          hotel, waving machetes and sticks.
          
          
          
                                                                          117.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Where are they going?
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      They can go where they want. They are in
                      charge now.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What do you mean, General?
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      We have decided to move the government to
                      Gitarama.
          
                                  PAUL
                      When?
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Today.
          
          
          EXT./INT. DIPLOMAT HOTEL. DAY
          
          Paul arrives into the lobby of the Diplomat. Looters have stripped the
          place bare. The convoy pulls up. General Bizimungu stands with his
          pistol out. The looters see him and disperse.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Maggots!
          
          
          INT. DIPLOMAT HOTEL OFFICE. DAY
          
          Paul enters the manager's office, followed by the General. It has been
          stripped clean, except for the safe, which is pock-marked with bullet
          strikes.
          
          
          
           LOSE ON: Paul: he sees a big problem. The dial is damaged.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Do your work.
          
          Paul goes to the safe and turns the dials, tries the handle - nothing.
          It is incredibly hot, and Paul is soaked with nervous perspiration, he
          takes off his jacket.
          
                                  PAUL
                      It might be damaged, General.
          
          Bizimungu's look says: it better not be for your sake.
          
          
          
                                                                            118.
          
          Paul starts again, turns the dials more carefully, tries and opens the
          safe door. CLICK.
          
          He pulls it open, sees six bottles of Glenfiddich, four bottles of VSOP
          brandy.
          
          Bizimungu is joyous as Paul hands him a bottle
          
          Bizimungu sits on a window ledge, takes a swig.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Here. (offers) To celebrate.
          
          PAUL takes a swig.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU (CONT'D)
                      You know what the Scottish call it?
          
                                  PAUL
                      No.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on
                      a tour once of the finest single malt
                      distillery in the world. Have you ever
                      been to Scotland?
          
                                  PAUL
                      No, sir.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I
                      wonder - will I ever go back? What do you
                      think?
          
          
          
                                  PAUL
                      I hope we all get to do many things. Can
                      we go now?
          
          The soldier arrives with a box. He whispers to Bizimungu.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      (to the soldier) Pack those carefully,
                      put them in my jeep, and guard them.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (looses his cool)
                      Please, General, call and put your
                      policemen back at the gate.
          
          The soldier packs the bottles. Bizimungu pours into Paul's cup.
          
                                                                  119.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      I am going to do you a great favor.
                      (studies glass) I am going to take you
                      with us to Gitarama.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      You cannot go back to the hotel. The
                      crazy men are going there now. Better to
                      come with me.
          
          Paul is now terrified.
          
                                  PAUL
                      The Militia are at the hotel?! We must go
                      back now, General, please, for my family.
          
          Bizimungu, now tipsy, drinks more.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      We are better here.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (desperate, forceful)
                      Listen, you need me.
          
          Bizimungu laughs.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      You are a marked man.
          
                                   GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      How so.
          
                                  PAUL
                      The Americans, and the UN they have you
                      as a war criminal. You are on a list.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      I am on a list! What list?
          
                                  PAUL
                      When the Europeans left, their soldiers
                      gathered lists.
          
          Bizimungu grabs Paul.
          
                                   GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      You lie.
          
          
                                                                  120.
          
                                  PAUL
                      If you do not help me, you will stay on
                      that list.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      I committed no war crimes.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Who will tell them? You need me to tell
                      how you helped the hotel. The others who
                      have gone, they blame you for all their
                      misfortune. They say you led the
                      massacres.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      (nervous now) I led no massacres.
          
                                  PAUL
                      You think they will believe you?
          
                                   ENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      You will tell them the truth.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (defiant)
                      I will do nothing unless you help me now.
          
          Bizimungu reaches for his pistol.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      What are you going to do, shoot me? It
                      will be a blessing. Go ahead shoot. I
                      will pay you to shoot my family. You can
                      do nothing to me!
          
          Bizimungu jumps up, grabs Paul, pulls him.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      You will tell them I did nothing.
          
          
          EXT. DIPLOMAT HOTEL. DAY
          
          Paul and Bizimungu rush out to the jeeps.
          
          
          INT. JEEP TRAVELLING. DAY
          
          Paul almost overcome with anxiety. Bizimungu worried.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Militia swarm around the front of the hotel.
          
          
          
                                                                             121.
          
          The jeeps race through, scattering them. They screech to a halt.
          Several refugees sit, huddled and battered. Bizimungu jumps out,
          snatches an A.K. from a soldier, fires in the air.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Get back! (to his soldiers) Get them out
                      of here.
          
          PAUL does not wait.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul races into the hotel, past frightened refugees who flee.
          
          Then Paul sees a face he recognizes.
          
          It's Gregoire with the Militia! Paul ducks into the stairway.
          
          IN THE STAIRWELL
          
          He leaps the stairs four at a time.
          
          He makes it to the third floor, pushing past frightened refugees who
          race down the stairs.
          
          ON THE THIRD FLOOR
          
          He runs straight into a bunch of young Militia.
          
                                  MILITIAMEN
                      Rusesabagina. Show us Rusesabagina.
          
          They shove Paul along the corridor.
          
                                  MILITIAMAN #1
                      Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
          
                                  PAUL
                      They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
          
          The killers race off.    Paul gets to his feet and runs.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S ROOM. DAY
          
          Paul bursts in.    The place is a mess. And it's empty!
          
                                  PAUL
                      Oh God, please Lord.
          
          IN THE CORRIDOR
          
          He careens out of the room.
          
          
                                                                           122.
          
          And sees Gregoire coming with a group of Militia.
          
                                   GREGOIRE
                       That's him. That's Rusesabagina!
          
          They charge toward Paul.
          
          Then a roar of gunfire. The ceiling and walls around Gregoire explode.
          General Bizimungu's men run up with weapons drawn.
          
                                   HUTU SOLDIER
                       Get out, or I'll shoot you.
          
          Paul rushes to the stairs.
          
          More gunfire echoes (soldiers clearing the Militia).
          
          AT THE STAIRS - Paul races upward, falls, pushes past others struggling
          to get down.
          
          AT THE ROOF - now, there are clumps of refugees who have fled up there,
          including Xavier who huddles in a corner.
          
                                   PAUL
                       Tatiana! Oh God. Have you seen Tatiana?
          
          Paul runs to the edge of the roof, looks over.
          
          SEES: bodies -   women, and children, still, on the ground beneath, by a
          row of hedge.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      (screams in agony)
                   TATIANA!
          
          The bodies move, look up, it's not them. It's refugees hiding. Paul,
          delirious with fear, runs along the parapet.
          
          BELOW he sees soldiers herding the Militia.
          
          He runs back to the stairs.
          
          INSIDE THE STAIRCASE: He jumps four stairs at a time.
          
          INSIDE THE CORRIDOR: Soldiers are chasing off the Militia.
          
          TO HIS ROOM: Paul staggers in, crazed with fear. He looks under the
          bed.
          
          INTO THE BATHROOM - empty.
          
          He's about to run out again, sees the connecting door to the adjoining
          hotel room is slightly open.
          
          
          
                                                                             123.
          
          INTO THE ADJOINING ROOM: It's empty, then A WHIMPER.
          
          FROM THE BATHROOM, he moves in, cautious.
          
          IN THE BATHROOM: Nothing. He moves over, pulls back the shower curtain.
          
          Reveals: A cluster of women and children, the older ones holding hands
          over the mouths of the younger ones. And there at the back: Tatiana and
          his kids.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      It's alright, they're gone.
          
          Tears, hugs, women tremble.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAWN
          
          The grey of dawn, before the sunrise.
          
          Colonel Oliver in his jeep leads a convoy of UN trucks past the guard      
          house and Bizimungu's police and up the drive.
          
                                                                      CUT TO:
          
          THE UN TRUCKS
          
          Parked in front of the hotel. Tutsi refugees file up and are helped on
          board by UN soldiers.
          
          Paul helps Tatiana and the children onto a truck.
          
          An ARGUMENT breaks out towards the back of the convoy. Paul rushes
          toward Xavier and Benedict who argue.
          
                                  XAVIER
                      They should go one truck at a time. When
                      the first truck gets through to the
                      airport, then the others will follow.
          
                                  PAUL
                      We can't wait. We all go together or not
                      at all.
          
          Paul takes matters into his own hands. He locks the doors of the hotel.
          There is no going back.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      It is time to leave. The Mille Collines
                      is closed.
          
          Paul climbs onto the truck. The others follow, some reluctantly.
          
          Colonel Oliver gives the signal.                                           
          
          
          
                                                                          124.
          
          The trucks take off down the driveway.
          
          
          INT. TRUCK TRAVELLING. DAY
          
          Paul now at the front of the truck
          
          WATCHES out through a slice in the canvas.
          
          SEES, the convoy pull out of the Mille Collines.
          
          They travel along the road.
          
          Turn a corner, and the truck slows ...
          
          PAUL SEES: a great mass of Hutus fill the road:
          
          Militia, kids, soldiers discarding uniforms.
          
          No longer a mob, but a crush of Hutu refugees now fleeing toward them,
          fleeing the advancing of the rebel army.
          
          A crowd of Militia men wave their arms, shout at the trucks.
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                    
                      Don't stop. Push through.
          
          The driver reluctantly speeds up.
          
          A break in the mass of Hutu refugees.
          
          Then GUN FIRE ahead.
          
          Children begin crying, it becomes infectious, spreading to Paul's
          children, some of the women.
          
          Then ahead, a gang of Militia men break from the bushes beside the
          road.
          
          They're running fast toward the truck, some carry rifles.
          
          There's more gunfire behind.
          
          The Militia are almost upon them now.
          
          Colonel Oliver has his pistol drawn.                                      
                                    COLONEL OLIVER (CONT'D)                         
                      Keep going.
          
          The Militia are at the truck.
          
          But they run STRAIGHT PAST!
          
            
          
                                                                          125.
          
          As a platoon of Tutsi rebel soldiers (in bush camouflage and   red and
          blue headbands) burst from the brush.
          
          Pursuing, careful, professional.
          
                                   PAUL
                       It's the rebels.
          
          The crying stops. Silent disbelief.
          
                                   PAUL (CONT'D)
                       We've made it!
          
          Cheering breaks out. Children frightened again by the sudden euphoria
          break into cries of joy.
          
          A rebel soldier waves his AK 47 in the air.
          
          
          EXT. KIGALI SOCCER STADIUM. DAY
          
          The trucks crawl into the chaos of the stadium, a mass of refugees, the
          wounded, lost children, abandoned old people, hundreds crammed
          together.
          
          Paul, Tatiana, and the others clamber off the trucks. They hug, cry, an
          outpouring of relief. Then Tatiana spots someone among the crowds.
          
          She rushes over.
          
                                   TATIANA
                       Have you seen my sister Fedens?
          
          Heads shak `no'. Tatiana moves on, more frantic, pushing through the
          crowds.
          
                                   TATIANA
                       Two little girls, twins, an old woman had
                       them.
          
          More `nos'
          
          Now she's desperate, pushing, tripping through the crowds, and around
          her we see others doing the same, then
          
                                      OGER (O.C.)
                       Mama, mama.
          
          He reaches her, pulls at her dress.
          
                                     ROGER
                       Mama, wait.
          
          She takes his hand.
          
          
                                                                             126.
          
                                  ROGER
                      No, mama, look.
          
          Tatiana turns .... and sees Paul carrying the twins in his arms.
          
          She squeals with joy, runs to him, snatches one from his arms.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Oh, my babies.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Anais, it is so good to see you.
          
                                    CARINE
                      I'm Carine!
          
                                  ANAIS
                           (in Tatsi's arms)
                      And I'm Anais!
          
          Their laughter mix with tears of joy among the crushing mass of            
          survivors.

          A HUGE COMBINE enters frame and turns down a row. The camera
          follows it. We are in the middle of a massive corn field in
          SOUTHERN ILLINOIS. The wind creates swells in the corn like
          a great green and gold sea. The farm equipment accelerates as
          does Whitacre...

          .Bacon and eggs is really just
          corn and corn when you think about
          what they feed the chickens and the
          pigs. And when you're good and
          help with the trash, you know what
          makes the big green bags

          WHITACRE, 33, drives his young son ALEXANDER, 6, to school.
          Whitacre is as happy as God makes creatures. Alexander sips
          his half-pint carton of ORANGE JUICE.

                         WHITACRE
          Do you?

          Corn starch. But, Daddy's company
          didn't come up with that one--
          DuPont did...
          Whitacre tussles his hair. They drive by a GAS STATION in the
          middle of the cornfields. He continues his ode to corn in
          his head...

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          Ethanol is made of corn; that's
          ADM. Car corn. Like gasoline. But
          they also use it for scotch, gin
          and vodka ...Corn and tonic... corn
          gimlet...corn on the rocks.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          Porsche or Porsh-a. I've heard it
          both ways. Three years in Germany,
          I should know that. What's the
          German word for corn? The word I
          really like saying is
          "kugelschreiber." That's "pen"--
          all those syllables just for "pen."

          A PEN SIGNS A LEDGER
          Whitacre signs in with the security gate at ARCHER DANIELS
          MIDLAND headquarters in Decatur. A sprawling industrial
          facility that makes most of what America eats. Grain
          elevators, cooling towers, processing plants, loading docks
          and a six story concrete bunker of an office building. He
          parks his car in a monogrammed space.

          3 INTERIOR ADM HEADQUARTERS-CONTINUOUS 3
          Whitacre walks across the open trading floor where soy and
          corn futures from around the world are displayed on a tote
          board and into his glass walled office.
          He has a kind word for everyone. Smile flashing like a
          casino sign. He sees his pal Kirk Schmidt from accounting...

                         WHITACRE
          Hey there, howdy. Hey, Kirk, we
          got to get out and hit some
          balls ...Morning...Guten Tag...
          Whitacre scans the room full of busy co-workers. His
          secretary, LIZ TAYLOR, 35, wears earrings that are EARS OF
          CORN made of gold.

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          What do they pay Kirk. . .What does a
          guy like that get...100K...I bet he
          gets a 100. He's just going to sit
          behind that desk and ride it into
          the future...

          She hands him a folder. He opens it and scans the data. He
          nods.

          4 INTERIOR LYSINE PLANT- A FEW MINUTES LATER 4
          Whitacre walks among the giant fermenters-- he's joined by a
          DISCOURAGED FOREMAN. They check various gauges and dials
          showing proof of failure.

                         DISCOURAGED FOREMAN
          We adjusted the dextrose again, but
          the vrus keeps showing
          up-Thought we had it surrounded
          this time. We're starting a new set
          of cultures...

                         WHITACRE
          We'll Vet it. We just gotta stay
          after it. The things eat sugar and
          that's what we're giving them-- a
          warm place filled with sugar.
          They walk into a clean room full of flasks mechanically
          shaken like paint cans-- it's too loud to speak. Each flask
          is connected to a feed tube-- the cultures are administered
          to by a HALF DOZEN BIO TECH WORKERS. Whitacre watches. He
          focuses on one worker-- she's ASIAN. She adds some nutrients
          to the feed line.

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          A positive mental attitude is a
          real important thing. They've done
          studies where heart patients who
          have people praying for them
          actually do better than ones who
          don't. There's science for you.
          The cheerleaders might make a
          difference in the game after
          all...How do you know what the
          electrical energy of a thought
          actually does when it's out there
          in the world? It's gotta go
          somewhere...so you might as well
          smile. Takes less muscles than
          frowning...
          Whitacre closes the door on the very loud room.

          5 INTERIOR ADM BOARDROOM- LATER 5
           Whitacre sits with MICK ANDREAS, Vice Chairman, 45, and TERRY
          WILSON, 55, President. An overhead projector displays the
           desultory performance of Whitacre's division.

          We're not gonna get anywhere near
          that. We got 150 million dollars in
          costs over there guys. I can see
          the fucking thing from my swimming
          pool and it makes me want to drown
          myself every morning.

                         WILSON
          Did the Japanese have these kind of
          problems with lysine?

                         AN DREAS

                         (TO WHITACRE)
          I don't give a shit about the
          Japanese. You just gotta get the
          Goddamn lysine bugs to eat the
          dextrose and shit us out some
          money.

                         WHITACRE
          We're still having problems with
          this virus.

                         ANDREAS
          I don't want to hear about the damn
          virus anymore. Terry, what are we
          losing a month?

                         WILSON
          We're off like seven million per.

                         ANDREAS
          That's not gonna fly much longer.
          You want to go in there next
          quarter and tell the board that
          we're sucking hind tit on
          this...cuz' I sure don't.
          He gives Whitacre a cold, hard, we're--done-fucking-around-
          glare.

                         ANDREAS
          Fix the Goddamn plant, or we're
          gonna shut it down.
          The last light goes out.

          was Homecoming Queen then. Either would be hard pressed to
          envision a life without each other.

                         GINGER
          You're not hungry, Corky.
          Whitacre is distracted. Ginger cuts up Alexander's food.

          The pilgrims loved the corn-- they
          came for the religious freedom but
          they stayed for the corn-- but its
          missing three of your eight
          essential amino acids-- especially
          lysine. That's why the Indians ate
          it with beans or lime. You feed a
          chicken corn and it gets sick. Yo
          feed it corn and lysine and it goes
          from egg to supermarket fryer in
          six months instead of eight...
          Whitacre gazes over at a plate of fried chicken, and then at
          his wife. She has gotten dressed up for dinner. She looks
          pretty.

                         WHITACRE
          Mick you're not going to believe
          what the hell's happened. I think
          I know the reason why we've been
          having all these problems at the
          plant.

                         ANDREAS
          Well, I've only been asking you to
          come up with one for the past eight
          weeks. I'm all ears.
          Whitacre paces. His story comes out in a rush of words.
          Andreas listens silently.

                         WHITACRE
          It's not start-up problems like we
          thought. It's the Japanese. This
          guy Fujiwara from Ajinomoto, he's
          been calling me-- sometimes at
          work, sometimes at home cuz of the
          time difference-- you met him, he
          was here a couple of weeks ago.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         
           Draft: 1/15/03 9.

                          WHITACRE (CONT'D)
           Well last night he calls me at home
          just after 8, and Mick, he knew
           everything. He says to me, `You
          remember the total nightmare you
          had during May, June and July?'
          And before I can ask him what he
          means he says, `Those months when
          ADM was losing about seven million
          dollars a month in the lysine
          business?'
          Whitacre stares at Andreas in shock-- no one outside the
          company should know that. Andreas is still stone faced.

                         WHITACRE
          I couldn't believe it. But, Mick
          before I can even ask him how he
          got those numbers, he starts making
          little comments about us having
          microbe problems. Jokes, like he's
          toying with me.
          Whitacre is fuming now-- his voice unnaturally high.

                         WHITACRE
          And then he tells me that one of
          our highest paid employees is
          actually an employee of Ajinomoto
          and is sabotaging the plant.
          They're injecting some kind of
          virus into the dextrose and
          contaminating the whole deal.
          That's the problem. I'll tell you
          Mick, it's like Rising Sun, that
          Crichton book, it's just like it.
          Fujiwara even said that his boss,
          Ikeda, would have him killed if he
          knew he was calling. So I asked
          him why he was talking to me and he
          said-- he said-- he wants 10
          million dollars. 10 million and
          he'll tell us who the saboteur is
          and give us a new lysine bug that's
          immune to the virus. We could be
          up and running in three days...
          Andreas pauses, takes it all in, and then...

                         ANDREAS
          How well do you know this guy?

                         WHITACRE
          Uh, um, well I met him a few weeks
          ago when he came over. And then,
          he called a couple of times...

                         ANDREAS
          So, not very well?

                         WHITACRE
          Very well? No, I can't really say
          that.
          Andreas ponders the situation.

                         ANDREAS
          Okay, if you hear from him again--
          talk him down on the price. I want
          you to find out the least amount of
          money he'd settle for. If we can
          get a bug that's resistant to the
          virus, it might be worth it...But,
          I want you to keep this quiet, if
          there is a mole, we don't want him
          to know we're onto him.

          Whitacre stands with a cocktail in the fading light, looking
          at the foundation for the NEW HORSE STABLES being built
          across the road from the main house. There is not another
          home anywhere nearby.

          This'd be a great place for some
          outlet stores... People would come
          from all over Southern Illinois and
          probably Missouri, too. Famous
          name brand labels and appliances at
          savings of up to fifty per cent
          every day. Maybe a food court with
          a Mexican place. . .After the
          stables, maybe a tennis court or a
          little pitch and putt by the pool--
          that adds to resale value like
          nobody's business...
          Whitacre looks at the swarm of insects around a street
          light...

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          The birds eat the bugs, the cars
          eat the birds, the rust eats the
          cars and the new construction eats
          the rust...

          Whitacre shakes his head in disbelief. He paces nervously.
          Stunned by the news.

                         WHITACRE
          The FBI! God, no.
          Andreas and MARK CHEVIRON, 38, tell Whitacre of his upcoming
          FBI interview. Cheviron is a barrel chested, linebacker of a
          man. A former Decatur cop who is now Private Industry's
          version of a bouncer.

                         WHITACRE
          I thought I was supposed to be
          getting him down on the price.
          That's what you told me to do and I
          was doing it.

                         ANDREAS
          We're not gonna sit back and let
          the Japs fuck us sideways.

          I just don't understand, we weren't
          going to mention it and now he's in
          on it?

          Of course he's in. If we got a mole
          then it's a security issue...

                         CHEVIRON
          I'll be sitting in with the FBI.

                         WHITACRE
          But, I already told you guys
          everything I know. What's the
          point?
          Cheviron is annoyed by Whitacre's histrionics.

                         CHEVIRON
          We don't like the idea of talking
          to the FBI anymore than you do.
          Look, they're just going to tape
          the guy's calls-- and ask you a few
          questions. No big deal.
          Whitacre shakes his head, even more upset.

          The FBI? Why do you need to talk to
          the FBI? It's their factory. Let
          them talk to the FBI.

          WHITACRE (O.S.)
          I'm really uncomfortable about
          this, baby. There are a lot of
          things going on here.

                         GINGER

          15 INTERIOR ADM CONFERENCE ROOM- EVENING 15
           SPECIAL AGENT BRIAN SHEPARD, 43, sits with Cheviron and a
          very anxious Mark Whitacre. Shepard wears a rumpled dark
          suit and tie from the day Jay Edgar Hoover set a dress code.
          He has been stationed in Decatur where the odd dead body in a
          river and a convenience store robbery that traversed state
          lines have made up the last fifteen years of his life.
          Whitacre shifts restlessly in his seat. Cheviron on the other
          hand is an old hand at this. He watches Whitacre and says
          nothing. Shepard writes down everything.

                         WHITACRE
          He told me he wanted his payments
          deposited by wire transfer to
          numbered bank accounts in
          Switzerland and the Caribbean.

                         SHEPARD
          And when was your last contact with
          him?

                         WHITACRE
          Two days ago. But I think he's
          getting suspicious. I've dragged
          this out as long as I can. If we
          don't get back to him soon he may
          back out?

                         SHEPARD
          And these calls, they've been
          coming in on your home line?
          Whitacre looks at Cheviron-- there's clearly a right and
          wrong answer here.

          of his BLACK FBI TIE bobs up and down as he speaks.

          Shepard hands Whitacre his card. They shake hands.

          I'd like to come out tomorrow and
          get on that phone.

          wait.

          CHEVIRON (O.S.)
          Did you call the FBI?

                         WHITACRE
          It just happened. He wants an
          answer. Or, he said she's in
          trouble.

          CHEVIRON (O.S.)
          We'll talk about it in the morning.

                         WHITACRE
          I'm thinking about quitting. Moving
          my family out of here. I can't do
          this.

          CHEVIRON (O.S.)
          We'll talk in the morning.
          Whitacre puts down the phone and walks through the large,
          dark house. He opens the bedroom door and the wedge of light
          finds Ginger already half-asleep. He lies down next to her
          in bed fully clothed.

          You ever mention to Fujiwara where
          your daughter went to school?

          If the guy wants to threaten you--
          why not just call you?

                         WHITACRE
          He told her to write down the
          message.

                         ANDREAS
          I want her to tell the FBI what
          they said.
          Andreas moves toward the phone.

                         WHITACRE
          I don't want her talking to the
          FBI, definitely not.

                         CHEVIRON
          Why not, Mark? Come on, if she's
          really in danger.

                         ANDREAS
          Then I'll talk to her.
          Andreas picks up the phone. Whitacre doesn't want that
          either.

                         WHITACRE
          She's scared enough.

                         ANDREAS
          If someone's threatening her...
          A beat. Whitacre collapses-- there's more to this.

                         WHITACRE
          Don't call her...No one's
          threatening. I, uh...
          A long painful beat.

                         WHITACRE
          I made it up. I lied. There wasn't
          any threat.
          Cheviron shakes his head in disgust.

                         CHEVIRON
          Christ, what a waste of time.
          Andreas lowers his gaze at Whitacre-- he wants an
          explanation.

          I'm no good at this. The FBI guy
          really got to me last night.
          He's twisting in the wind.

                         WHITACRE
          I figured if you guys thought my
          daughter was in danger you'd just
          pay Fujiwara and all this FBI stuff
          would go away. It was a stupid
          move on my part.
          Whitacre's ashamed.

                          WHITACRE (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry. Stupid, stupid move.
          He gets up and leaves in humiliation. He wanders through the
          lobby of ADM in a daze.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          What am I supposed to do? I didn't
          get the FBI involved-- I was told
          we were paying the money. It's
          like, `Whitacre go out for a long
          pass,' and then we run the ball.
          Look, I admitted I made a mistake,
          that's more than I can say for most
          people. Hey, when they found out
          that Mick's Dad, Dwayne, wrote a
          check to the Watergate Burglars--
          did he admit it? Besides these guys
          probably own the FBI with the money
          they have. They probably wanted me
          to move into Dwayne's old house--
          because they've got it wired like
          in a Crichton novel...

          the used car version of a lysine salesman at the Club. Mauve
          draped tables, botanical drawings of the state flower on the
          wall. Bow-tied wait staff patrol the diners with pitchers of
          ice water. Sid and Ginger chit-chat-- Mark is distracted.

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          Someone told me they bugged the
          dining room-- the John, too. Might
          be paying off the waitresses here
          at the club. That's how business

                         SID HULSE
          You're telling me.
          Sid laughs. Ginger doesn't get the joke.

          She's still digesting what's on the card-- trying to act
          natural.

          into two and the second one of him
          drives away and the rest of the

          Mark, ADM is not more powerful than
          the FBI. You can't tell me that.

                         WHITACRE
          It's more complicated than that.
          Her face is a mask of determination.

          will.
          Behind him the drapes are illuminated by headlights in the

                         WHITACRE
          I can't, not now.
          The door bell rings. She opens the door.

          Whitacre pauses again. It's too late to turn back.

          What I'm about to tell you involves
          something very large. This
          extortion attempt by Fujiwara is
          nothing compared to it.
          Shepard says nothing.

          That's why they wanted me to lie.
          Fujiwara's calling on my home line.
          But, so are the people we fix
          prices with. They didn't want you
          to hear those conversations so they
          told me to say the Fujiwara calls
          came in on the ADM line. But, I
          knew if you guys ever started
          looking at the records you'd see
          all these calls I have to Japan.
          And that's what scared me. Nobody
          has more calls than me. If you ever
          figured out about the price fixing,
          I'd be the fall guy.
          Shepard considers the explanation.

                         SHEPARD
          Who told you to participate in
          these price fixing talks?
          Whitacre pauses, summons his conviction.

          You're not going to ask questions
          at ADM about all this? It'd be my
          job for sure.

          No, what was said here was

          to my superiors Mark, and then
          we'll be in touch.

          He seems like a real good guy...I
          mean just a straight shooter. I
          think we really got along-- I bet
          he wouldn't mind if I called him
          "Brian" instead of "Agent Shepard."
          "Bri." "Hey, Bri..." This must be
          very different for him. Talking to

          robber or a drug dealer...

                         WHITACRE (CONT'D)
          So, what do I do if this Shepard
          guy calls?

                         ANDREAS
          You let me know and I'll pass it on
          to my Dad. But, you're done
          talking to them...

          37 INTERIOR WHITACRE'S BARN- EVENING 37
          Whitacre sits with FBI agents Shepard and Paisley in the
          converted barn. A large open room looking more like a theme
          restaurant than anything that might have once involved
          agriculture. Outside, RUSTY the gardener, fishes leaves from
          the pool. Shepard explains the misunderstanding with the
          phones.

                         PAISLEY
          The only listening device was the
          recorder, Mark.

                         SHEPARD
          We had a trap and trace device on
          the home line-- but we can't listen
          in with that.

                         PAISLEY
          However, the phone company calling
          people and telling them about our
          Intel gathering is, well, our face
          is red on that one.

                         SHEPARD
          Did you bring the expense reports
          we talked about?
          Whitacre gives them a folder of paperwork.

          Paris and Mexico City.
          And under...Whitacre thinks about one thing while discussing
          another with the agents. He is a gifted man in this
          capacity. His thoughts take precedence here.

           WHITACRE WHITACRE (V.O.)
          Just last week Mick and Terry I read in the Geographic that
          were in Florida with the Corn the skin in ears grows from
          Refiner's Association. They the inside out-- conveyor
          would have their regular belt style. That's how they
          meetings during the day and stay clean. You could make a
          then at night they'd get dot with a felt tip inside
          together and work out the and watch it move down your
          price fixing... neck.

          .Six months later a liter of
          Pepsi costs five cents more.

                         SHEPARD
          When's the next meeting?

                         WHITACRE
          January-- somewhere in Asia.
          Paisley takes it all in. He cozies up to Whitacre.

                         AGENT PAISLEY
          Mark, I gotta ask you, why are you
          doing this? We know you lied to us
          about the phone line and you're
          afraid of that. But, now you're
          telling us all this other stuff out
          of the blue. I gotta ask you why?
          The light disappears from Whitacre's eyes.

                         WHITACRE
          Things are going on I don't approve
          of. I mean, I'm a biochemist-- But,
          they pulled me into the business
          side and they're doing things that
          are illegal. They said...

          ANGLE ON RUSTY
          He takes the net for cleaning the pool and walks around the
          barn to the attached six car garage filled with a Range
          Rover, Ferrari, Mercedes Coupe, BMW, and a Lincoln Town Car.

                         WHITACRE
          When they told me to lie, I had to
          lie. I lied to you guys and I feel
          real bad about it.
          This explains the bind Whitacre finds himself in.

                         SHEPARD
          You look at yourself as wearing a
          white hat and they're wearing black
          hats.

                         WHITACRE
          That's a good way to put it. You
          know, when I was a kid my folks
          died in an automobile accident. I
          was maybe six at the time and this
          wealthy man in Ohio adopted me. He
          owned amusement parks and he did
          real well for himself, real well. I
          got a big break-- went to a good
          school and all-- I adopted two kids
          of my own. I just want to do the
          right thing.

                         PAISLEY
          Well, Mark, do you think you'd be
          willing to go a few steps further
          in helping us?

                         WHITACRE
          What do you mean?

                         SHEPARD
          Would you be willing to wear a
          wire? We don't have any other
          sources at this time. We need your
          help.
          Whitacre considers the request-- a chance to be a hero.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Draft: 1/15/03 36.

                         PAISLEY
          Now you realize that by doing this,
          sometime down the line you could
          be the guy who has to testify
          against your fellow executives,
          people you've worked with now for
          years. That won't be easy.
          He looks around at the good life Whitacre has amassed.

                         SHEPARD
          I'll use my beeper to signal you
          when it's time to set up a meeting.
          Shepard gets out his beeper and hits a button- "BEEEEP."

                         SHEPARD
          When you hear this-- you call me.
          Then Shepard pulls a tape recorder out of his jacket-- a
          simple little Radio Shack Dictaphone model. He gives it to
          Whitacre.

                         PAISLEY
          You'll be risking a lot.
          Whitacre picks up the recorder. The idea of being a White
          Knight only becomes real when they hand you a sword.

          39 EXTERIOR COORS BREWERY- GOLDEN, COLORADO 39
          Whitacre, Wilson and Andreas get out of a Town Car in front
          of Coors Corporate headquarters. The Rockies loom in the
          background. The men walk toward the doors.

                         WHITACRE
          I was up in Wisconsin last week--
          and the guy who is running for

          I was told they want funds-- a
          campaign contribution, but I told
          them we're already at out limit.

                         ANDREAS
          You can go over the limit-- it's
          just a small fine.

                         WILSON
          That's what I was saying. If they
          want a thousand dollars-- you give
          a thousand. So what if it ends up
          costing us nine thousand after the
          fine.

                         WHITACRE
          Twelve thousand after taxes.
          The men laugh.

                         ANDREAS
          If the guy's asking you for money,
          try not giving it to him and see
          what happens. Just make sure Dad is
          behind it... Is Dad asking for them?

                         WILSON
          Yeah.

                         ANDREAS
          Okay then.

                         WHITACRE

          He gets out his cell phone and begins dialing. A FEDEX
          EMPLOYEE walks by with a BUTTERFLY BANDAGE on his nose.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          There are these butterflies in
          Central America-- they have poison
          in their wings. Just enough poison
          to stop a bird heart. But, the

                         WHITACRE
          Either way? What does "either way"
          mean?

          SHEPARD (O.S.)
          We really need to get together.
          Both Shepard and Whitacre are losing their patience.

                         WHITACRE
          I told you, it's a different
          attitude now, a different approach.

          Whitacre hangs up-- frustrated. He walks over to a table in
          the club where a middle aged German man is waiting-- REINHART
          RICHTER, 40. There are papers spread out in piles around the
          men-- stacks of loss, gain and opportunity.

                         RICHTER
          Everything OK?

                         WHITACRE
          Yeah, fine. Kids. Where we're we?
          Whitacre reaches underneath his suit coat into his shirt
          pocket and pulls out his pen.

                         RICHTER
          Uh, Mark...
          Whitacre's FOUNTAIN PEN has exploded in his shirt-- leaving a
          Rorschach across his chest. Richter gestures toward the
          stain. Whitacre stares at the STAIN.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          One of the Japanese guys told me a
          story-- this lysine salesman is in
          a meeting with someone from Conagra
          or some other company, I don't
          know-and the client leans forward
          and says, `I have the same tie as
          you... only the pattern is
          reversed."-- and then he drops
          dead. Face down on the

          Shepard and Herndon are waiting in the most generic of hotel
          rooms for Whitacre. They check their watches and peak out
          the drapes at a sparsely populated parking lot. They've been
          there awhile. Herndon eats a Granola bar and reads the side
          of the package.

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          .Maybe everyone has a sentence
          like that; a little time bomb..."I
          have the same tie as you... only the
          patterns reversed."

                         HERNDON
          There it is, "High Fructose Corn
          Syrup."
          Shepard isn't giving up on Whitacre, yet.

          marketing meeting.

                         HERNDON
          The government ought to charge him
          for the room.
          Shepard's cell phone rings. Herndon sighs--

                         HERNDON
          Here it comes.

          FBI... .Uh...huh. You're being
          honest with me, here... It's been
          months Mark-- we need some tapes.

          I gotta go Bri, Andreas is coming.
          Whitacre opens his brief case and takes out the micro
          cassette recorder. He looks at it like it's a murder weapon.

          SHEPARD (O.S.)
          (over the phone)
          Mark, we could be tracing this
          phone call...

          I can't live two lives. They just
          gave me a hundred thousand dollar
          raise. I can't risk my job for you
          guys. I've got a family. I'm
          building stables across the road.

          The windows of the BMW are fogging up.

          Mark, listen to me, the only
          logical thing for you to do is
          cooperate.

                         WHITACRE
          And what if I don't?

          SHEPARD (O.S.)
          Then somebody else will and you'll
          end up being a defendant.

                         WHITACRE
          For how long, Brian? How long does
          this go on for?
          Whitacre pushes the buttons on the recorder. He hits eject.
          There's no tape in the cradle.

          SHEPARD (O.S.)
          I wish I could answer that.
          Sometimes years. We'll need a lot
          of tapes-- maybe hundreds.

                         WHITACRE
          But, the tapes won't say anything.
          It's over. Mick said.. .New policy.

          SHEPARD (O.S.)
          Fine, if that's what he said, then
          I want to hear the tape. We need
          tapes, Mark.
          A beat-- he finally admits it. The windows are completely
          fogged.

                         WHITACRE
          I didn't make any, OK? I didn't
          make any because it's over. How can
          I prove it to you?

          pressure cuff and puts electrical clips on his fingers.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          I like my hands. I think they're
          probably my favorite part of my
          body. I think that can be used to
          my advantage in social situations--
          if I can get people focused on my
          hands then I can get a good result
          in the meeting.

          Herndon takes out a list of questions and watches Whitacre
          closely. Shepard watches the needle on the polygraph.

          SHEPARD WHITACRE (V.0.)

          at ADM?

          I know it's tough keeping it all

          secret. But, there's only one good
          choice for you. That's all there's
          ever been. There's something
          you're hiding, something you're
          keeping from us. But, the only way
          to protect yourself is to be
          completely honest.

                         WHITACRE
          Okay.
          Shepard gets another form out of his brief-case. Not a basic
          302 this time-- it's A CONFESSION.

          Shepard and Herndon cringe on his behalf. The floodgates

          about shutting us down and everyone
          was on me to fix it. 'Let's just
          blame it all on Whitacre.' That's

                         HERNDON

          and gets out of the car.

          He walks toward the building. As the camera arcs around to
          lead him we see that he is actually speaking out loud-- NOT
          IN VO. To nobody...

          Seven thirty A.M., Wednesday, March
          seventeenth, 1994. I have just
          parked my car and am now entering
          the office...
          Whitacre gets on the elevator with Terry Wilson. Whitacre's
          a little off this morning...
          s-- WHITACRE (CONT'D)
          Terrance Wilson, President of our
          corn businesses, did you speak with
          our friends in Japan?

                         TERRY WILSON
          He wasn't in.

                         WHITACRE
          I heard from Mimoto last night-- he
          is pissed. He said there's not
          going to be any peace in lysine
          until we bring production down like
          we promised.
          Theelevator doors opens.

                         TERRY WILSON
          In 92 we did exactly what we told
          them we would do in terms of
          volume. Exactly. Right now, there's
          no promise.

                         WHITACRE
          He said he'd like to talk to you at
          some point...

          "listen here you little mousy
          motherfucker."
          Wilson peels off into his office. Whitacre continues on
          across the open trading floor toward his office. He speaks
          under his breath to nobody-- smiling at the world.

                         WHITACRE
          That was Terry Wilson talking about
          setting volume and price levels
          with our Japanese competitor--
          Ajinomoto Corporation.
          Whitacre enters his own office--- talking to himself.

                         WHITACRE (CONT'D)
          By the way, there was no discussion
          with Mimoto last night. That was
          all for illustration purposes only.
          I wanna make that clear- no
          discussion with Mimoto last night.
          He turns off the tape recorder.

          Hey, Mark you don't really need to
          narrate the tapes for us when
          you're making them.

                         WHITACRE
          Right. Absolutely. Not a problem.

                         HERNDON
          And you can talk less.

                         WHITACRE
          I think I did on this one.
          Whitacre gives Herndon another tape and a small box.

                         SHEPARD
          Don't force the conversation.

          I've got well over two million
          frequent flier miles.. .maybe more.
          The equivalent of two trips to the
          moon. I'm pretty much platinum
          across the board. Free
          upgrades... sometimes they'll move
          me from business to first just cuz
          the computer tells them I'm

          walk in one day and he signs like a
          hundred while he's on the phone...
          Whitacre gets out of the car and walks into the embassy.
          Shepard meets him an ushers him into a room where a phone is
          hooked up to a recorder.

          opens the FOLDER. He removes the legal pad to reveal a

          definitely. There's no choices to

          I'm at a meeting. Tensing.
          Holding. And then releasing. And

          for a seal to pop up. They keep
          one paw over their nose so that
          they blend in. Cuz' they've got
          those black noses. They'd blend in
          perfectly if not for the nose...

          I'm just gonna hit the head here.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          So the question is. How do they
          know their noses are black? From
          looking at other polar bears? Do
          they see their reflections in the
          water? And think, "I'd be invisible
          if not for that." That seems like
          a lot of thinking for a bear.

          There's something great about
          walking into a conference room when
          there's a pad of paper and a pencil
          in front of every chair. . .Most guys
          with a science background don't get
          to see what goes on...

          Usually the hotel's name is
          embossed on the pencils and they
          have someone who sharpens them to
          perfect points like collie dog
          noses-- that's what they remind me
          of. Maybe they come from the
          factory that way. And there's
          always a plate of
          danish...danishes?-- an almond
          thing-- or a cheese danish with a
          big cherry blob in the middle...

          Good luck with the Japs. And as
          your lawyer I'd advise you to pat

          You gotta remember we have a lot
          more capacity than we're using. We
          could be growing twenty thousand

                         WHITACRE
          Okay.

                         SHEPARD
          Like I said, we can't give you any
          recording equipment.

                         HERNDON
          But, if you taped the meeting on
          your own and than gave us the
          tapes...

                         WHITACRE
          So you want me to make a tape.

                         HERNDON
          We're not allowed to say that. But,
          the sooner we get enough evidence,
          the sooner you can stop the taping.

                         WHITACRE
          What if I get caught there?

                         SHEPARD
          I don't know anything about
          Japanese laws, but if you're
          arrested, we may not be able to
          provide much help.

          I wonder if Brian and Bob are

          should've gotten them to sign

          Doesn't the dog ever get the bone?

                         TARRANCE
          Yeah, I hear it happens every once

          knock McDeere's teeth down his throat. His verbal assault is
          put to a halt when his phone rings. It's Holly Hunter
          calling from the nearby parking lot. She plays Tarrance an
          incriminating tape of what he has just said. McDeere is
          wearing a wire. McDeere has him now.

          She turns on the light to discuss her concerns. Mark is
          standing there without his shirt on-- A LARGE PATCH OF HAIR
          is missing from the middle of his chest.

                         WHITACRE
          What's wrong with that?

                         GINGER
          What's wrong? Why is your chest
          shaved, Mark? Why are there holes

          aren't you a part of this family
          anymore?
          Whitacre tries to laugh off her concern. He sits down on the
          bed and puts her hand on his smooth chest.

          I want to give this family

          plumes of white smoke into the blue sky. Shepard and Herndon
          sit in their SHIRTSLEEVES transcribing tapes in the tiny
          office. There's a knock on the door. Shepard checks to see
          who it is through the eye-hole. Whitacre enters wearing the

          Hey guys, I was in the

          And I've learned some important
          things recently. I've been told I'm

                         WHITACRE
          And that's not all. I'd say that
          ten of the products produced by ADM
          are price fixed.

                         SHEPARD
          Ten?

                         WHITACRE
          I would estimate that for all the
          companies involved, the total extra
          profit is in the range of 800
          million to one billion dollars.
          That's just from the price-fixing.

                         SHEPARD
          Can you tell us what products?
          Whitacre smiles-- he's got something else on his mind.

                         WHITACRE
          You know, Brian, if all these
          companies are charged, they're
          going to be paying an awful lot in
          fines. Don't you think?

                         SHEPARD
          I don't know, they might end up
          paying. But, nobody knows for sure
          how this will turn out.

                         HERNDON
          We still need to get everyone
          together making an actual agreement
          before we have a case.

                         WHITACRE
          Sure, sure I know that. But, I've
          taken a lot of risks and I need to
          think about my family.

                         SHEPARD
          What do you mean?

                         WHITACRE
          Well, I'd like it if, in their
          fine, ADM was ordered to pay me ten
          year's salary.

                         SHEPARD
          Well, Mark...

          I never expected this investigation
          would go on as long as it has. It's
          been almost two years and I think I
          should get total immunity if I
          agree to cooperate through the end.

          focussed the full power of the blower on it but it's not
          going anywhere. Three deer stand like statues in the yard,
          oblivious to the rain.

          We got a deer problem here.
          They're in the corn, they're eating

          away all the predators and that's

                         TERRY WILSON
          I'd like to welcome everybody here,
          glad everyone could make it and
          sorry for those who can't play golf
          tomorrow-- we're gonna have a good
          time.
          Whitacre's POV-- he scans the room.

          TERRY WILSON WHITACRE (V.0.)
          We have an old saying at ADM It's like that game on TV
          that applies here. It's where one guy knows a word
          better to have the elephants and tries to make the other
          inside the tent pissin' out, one say it... another word for
          than outside pissin' in. "deal"...how about
          "consensus," or
          "understanding." Maybe they'd
          take "deal"-- that's like
          "agreement."..

                         MIMOTO
          Outside piss?
          Language problem again.

                         TERRY WILSON
          It's better to be part of the
          group.

                         WHITACRE
          Competitors are our friends,
          remember? Customers the enemy.
          The group nods in agreement with Whitacre's translation. JM
          SUH of Cheil Corporation takes issue with this. The two
          argue... Whitacre looks at SUH, who is LOSING HIS HAIR...

          SUH WHITACRE (V.0.)
          I want to know why Cheil Male pattern hair loss can be
          Corporation has been excluded a real set back...I mean a
          from association in the past. lot of women, their father's
          are bald so they're kind of
          used to it...But, still
          seeing it in the drain every
          morning in your thirties,
          that's not fair at all and
          this Minoxidil thing-- it's
          not really, a cure...

                         MIMOTO
          I explain it to you on the phone
          many times...
          Suh is kind of a baby-- Mimoto doesn't like him. Wilson
          steps in.

                         TERRY WILSON
          If the market is what we think it
          is...
          There's a KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Conversation ceases.

                         WHITACRE
          We have a couple other people
          joining us I think?
          MR. CHAUDRET from EUROLYSINE is making himself a fruit plate.

          MR. CHAUDRET
          From Sewon in Korea.

                         MIMOTO
          And one from the FBI?
          Whitacre freezes. He's caught. He looks at the business
          men... DO THEY ALL KNOW?

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          That's why there can't be any
          leaves on the walk. They give it
          away-Like the ants-- they can see
          a trail of ants...
          Mimoto smiles right at Whitacre-- the walls close in, and
          then, the room bursts into laughter. Whitacre gets it. He
          smiles back.

                         WHITACRE
          And seven from the Federal Trade
          Commission.
          IT'S ALL A JOKE. More laughter and more knocks. Whitacre
          goes to the door. Mimoto calls out.

                         MIMOTO
          Yes? FTC?
          Whitacre opens the door to find HERNDON DRESSED LIKE A HOTEL
          EMPLOYEE-- he hands Whitacre the brief case.

                         HERNDON
          This was left in the lobby. The
          concierge thought it might belong
          to one of you gentleman.

                         WHITACRE
          Okay. Hey, thanks.
          Herndon closes the door.

          MR. CHAUDRET
          You forgot your briefcase in the
          lobby?

                         WHITACRE
          When I was signing for the food-- I
          must've left it.

          MR. CHAUDRET
          In Paris it would have already been
          sold.
          More laughter.

                         VIDEO MONITOR

                         SUH
          How can we know ADM will stay at
          agreed upon levels?

                         TERRY WILSON
          Our preference is to trust each
          other. If we find someone lyin'--
          then we hire some mafia figure and
          rub you out.
          The group laughs.

                         TERRY WILSON
          If we can't trust each other in the
          end, it ain't gonna work.

                         MIMOTO
          You are okay for that?
          A beat.

                         SUH
          Yeah, I'm all right.

                         WHITACRE
          So what are we saying then?
          Wilson looks at Whitacre like he's an idiot.

                         TERRY WILSON
          What, is there a language problem
          here?

                         WHITACRE
          So, everyone is, uh...
          They just said so. It's like Whitacre is playing Password.

          Agreed. Uh, five companies agree on
          quantity for the first time.
          The men all smile at each other-- hand shakes and high fives.

          95 INTERIOR DEPT OF JUSTICE CONFERENCE ROOM- CHICAGO 95
          Shepard and Herndon have been playing the new tape for Robin
          Mann and US ANTITRUST ATTORNEY JAMES MUTCHNIK. Shepard and
          Herndon beam with pride.

                         SHEPARD
          Agreement... you heard it.
          He hits rewind and plays it again.

          MUTCHNIK ROBIN MANN
          A jury's gonna love that. Congratulations.

                         MUTCHNIK
          Christ, how about this guy
          Whitacre? What's his story?

                         SHEPARD
          What do you mean?

                         MUTCHNIK
          What's his agenda? The guy's making
          350 grand a year, he's moving up
          the ladder and he turns informer.
          When does that happen? Is the
          money going up his nose? Some woman
          somewhere with a kid that he's
          seeing on one of these business
          trips? What's his story?
          Shepard and Herndon are offended on behalf of Mark. Herndon
          reaches into his briefcase and pulls out a GREETING CARD.

                         HERNDON
          I wanted everyone to see this.
          This is Mark Whitacre and his
          family.
          The group passes it around. A photo of Whitacre Family
          smiling in front of their Christmas Tree.

                         HERNDON
          I carry this picture with me all
          the time as a constant reminder
          that he is a real person with a
          real family depending on him.
          The only reason we have these tapes
          is because of this man.

          We want to know that when the time
          comes, if he loses his job, the
          government is going to stand behind
          him.

                         ROBIN MANN
          What's he looking for?

                         SHEPARD
          About eighteen grand a month.
          He hands her a folder of Whitacre's expenses.

          Whitacre rides down the shoulder of the two lane, past the
          towers of the grain elevators-- to a railroad crossing and
          rumbling out of the darkness, comes another 100 box cars of
          what America needs for tomorrow and each one of those cars
          says: ADM.

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          We took the kids one year to the
          Renaissance festival in
          Indiana.. .You get to be the White
          Knight.. .The kids get to ride in
          the joust against the forces of
          darkness with a helmet on. And the
          White Knight always wins, the
          forces of darkness fall onto an old
          mattress...It was maybe ninety
          degrees out and the heat and
          humidity index-- I can't even
          remember what the radio said.

          We were next in line and the mare
          collapsed-- went down in a heap.
          Ginger was eating ye olde drumstick
          and she dropped it in the dirt.
          The kids were crying and I remember
          this farmer saying he had a gun in
          his truck... Just like that. From
          the White Knight to a gun in the
          truck-How do you get that back?
          How does that get to be fair?

          Whitacre pulls into the parking lot in a brand new PORSCHE
          911. Shepard gets out of a black sedan and crosses the lot.
          He climbs into the shiny red car.

                         WHITACRE
          (off the Porsche)
          Hey, Brian, how do you like it?
          Shepard takes in the car.

                         SHEPARD
          It's a beauty. How was Hong Kong?

                         WHITACRE
          Real good-- we're going to be
          taking the lysine prices up again.
          He hands Shepard an envelope.

                         SHEPARD
          We're gonna wanna hear how the
          company responds when we move in.
          Shepard hands him some tapes and batteries. He grabs the
          BRIEF CASE off the backseat.

                         SHEPARD
          You want me to load you up right
          now?

                         WHITACRE
          That's okay, Brian. It's kind of
          packed with work anyway.
          Whitacre stops Shepard from opening the case-- he takes the
          tapes and puts them in his lap.

                         WHITACRE (CONT'D)
          I'll see you at the briefing.

          Mark, are you an idiot?

          Dwayne will be gone. Mick will be
          gone. Terry will be gone. I'm

          run ADM.

                         GINGER
          That's totally illogical. How can
          you possibly stay there when you've
          dust taken down the company? You
          think they're going to pat you on
          the back?

          Whatever happens tomorrow, it may
          be in your best interest to get an
          attorney who represents your
          interests alone.
          Whitacre is confused.

                         WHITACRE
          You want me to go and hire an
          attorney now?

                         MUTCHNIK
          The first thing that's going to
          happen is the company lawyers are
          going to come to all the executives
          with a list of attorneys for you to
          pick from. You gotta understand,
          these attorneys are being paid by
          ADM. They don't represent you. Do
          not take one of these attorneys,
          that's when you say to them that
          you have your own attorney.

                         SHEPARD
          Tell them you've decided to
          cooperate with the government.

                         MUTCHNIK
          It's perfectly reasonable for you
          to cooperate. It happens all the
          time.

                         WHITACRE
          Well, I know a lawyer in Decatur...

                         SHEPARD
          No, Mark. The town's too small.

                         MUTCHNIK
          I'm sure you've met lawyers in your
          business dealings who can handle

          Now, Mark once this thing starts
          it's going to be intense.
          They're going to know that somebody
          was on the inside working with us.
          They're going to do almost anything
          to find out who it is.

          You guys still think everything
          will work out okay for me at the

          No, it's true. Archer, The "A" in
          ADM, choked to death on a chicken
          bone in 1947.

          our deals with Tyson, Foster Farms--
          what's the body count?
          More laughter. The agents walk up to the table.

          to their client.

                         TERRY WILSON
          I have no idea what this is.

          step outside with Agent Shepard and
          Mr. Wilson, if you could have a

          The men move away from the table leaving the Visiting Client
          baffled and all alone-- a STUNNED WAITRESS approaches him.

          Who did you tell about the raid.
          Shepard is furious, he glares at Whitacre.

                         WHITACRE
          Hey, I had to tell my secretary. I
          told her a long time ago. I just
          said, "look I'm working with the
          FBI on some things, I may be out of
          touch for a while. That's all...
          Shepard still glares.

                         WHITACRE
          And, uh, I've probably mentioned
          Kathy Dougherty, in my division.
          She's a dear friend and a trusted
          ally. I didn't want her to be
          scared.

                         SHEPARD
          Why did you do that, Mark? Why did
          you tell Dougherty?

                         WHITACRE
          Like I said, I didn't want her to
          be scared. And I can trust her.
          Guys, I can trust her.
          Shepard glares in harder, his voice cracking.

                         SHEPARD
          Who else?

          him know it was okay to talk with
          you `cuz he might not on account of
          he's loyal to me.
          Shepard explodes.

                         SHEPARD
          You could have ruined this entire
          operation. Two and a half years...
          Herndon intervenes.

                         HERNDON
          Time out. Mark, you know what you
          did was wrong in our eyes...
          Whitacre starts to speak.

                         HERNDON
          Don't...Don't. Look, we can get
          past this. But is there anything
          else we need to know? Anything?
          A beat. Whitacre regains his composure.

                         WHITACRE
          No, I can't think of anything, Bob.

          Selenium deficiency in chicks
          causes reduced growth and
          pancreatic atrophy and increased

          know that? It's in my Ph. D.

          the slightest idea about what

          the chaotic trading area toward his office-- with them are
          two STARCHED AND SUITED OLDER MEN who can only be a LAWYERS--

          Sorry about the FBI arresting your
          son and investigating your

          representing ADM in this matter.
          And this is a colleague of mine
          John Dowd. Dwayne's told me about

          Aubrey defended Lt. Calley after
          the My Lai massacre in Viet

          walk for him.

                         AUBREY DANIEL
          We thought you might take some time
          and talk to John here.

                         MICK ANDREAS
          ADM's going to stand behind you on
          this, Mark. Dad and I want the key
          people to know we'll be paying
          their legal fees.

                         WHITACRE
          Great, that's great.

          Then we'll let you fellas get
          acquainted.
          Everyone leaves except for Dowd and Whitacre. Dowd gives
          Whitacre a warm, knowing look.

          Sure. Anything.

          shut. Through a crack in the drapes we see Whitacre and Dowd
          talk.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          It feels good to talk, to clear the
          air-- you get to be like a balloon
          after a while. A balloon looking
          for a pin to bump into and relieve
          the pressure. You could get sick
          from keeping it inside and get a
          tumor or something..I didn't ask
          for that. Why should I pay for my
          own legal fees when I'm not the one
          who started the price fixing.

          about their cases-Like in The
          Firm... You can tell them anything
          and they have to keep to themselves
          or they get in a lot of
          trouble-They're boxed. That's
          what they say, "boxed."

          A GROUP OF LAWYERS sit among boxes of pizza and beer. The

          Mick and the other lawyers stop what their doing and look up.

                         WHITACRE
          I need to tell you that I'm
          cooperating with the government.
          The FBI has hundreds of tapes. They
          know all about lysine. John here
          agrees I should be getting another
          lawyer.

                         JOHN DOWD
          No question about it.
          Dowd and Daniel share a knowing look. An uncomfortable
          silence follows.

                         WHITACRE
          I'm sorry for what's happened.

          Whitacre shakes Mick Andreas' hand and walks away. The men

          But, when he looks up AUBREY DANIEL is standing there--- all
          arrogance and anger concentrated into a very intense beam of
          language.

                         AUBREY DANIEL
          Mark, we'd like you off the

          up being witnesses. So Bob and I

          I never dreamed of being a whistle
          blower. And I would tell other

          140 INTERIOR ADM BOOKEEPING DEPT 140
          SCOTT ROBERTS, an ADM attorney, thumbs through records. He's
          examining a file entitled: ABP INTERNATIONAL.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          The bottom line is that I know my
          story will eventually be confirmed
          by the FBI. There's no reason for
          me to put out a story they're not
          going to confirm... It would be
          crazy.

          ANGLE ON THE PAPERWORK
          Contracts citing various sums of money and photo-copies of
          checks.

          ROBERTS HOLDS TWO PAGES UP TO THE LIGHT. AND THEN RUNS DOWN

          THE HALL WITH THE PAGES.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          It's all on tape, everything that
          happened.

          Mick, Dwayne, Roberts and Aubrey Daniel stand before the

          The two signatures eclipse each other perfectly.

                         ROBERTS
          You can see where he pasted it.
          Aubrey Daniel picks up the phone barely able to contain his
          glee.

          Hello, Mark? It's Aubrey Daniel.
          I think you forgot something?
          Whitacre pulls over onto the shoulder. He looks at the cell
          phone in dismay and stares at a Polaroid of himself from the
          Fortune Magazine photo shoot-- he's smiling in the picture.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          One of the things I've learned in
          business is that you should always
          use a person's name in conversation
          if you want them to feel
          important... Sid Hulse and Marty
          Allison think that and they're very
          successful salesman...

          143 EXTERIOR CHINESE RESTAURANT, TAYLORVILLE- DAY 143
          Whitacre gets out of an FBI cruiser with Herndon and Shepard
          and the three men walk toward the restaurant in rural
          Illinois.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          It makes people feel like they're
          definitely being told something
          they can use...
          They enter and the HOSTESS gives them a table up front.

                         WHITACRE
          You got anything open in the back?

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          Just by putting their name in there
          at the beginning or the end.
          The men sit at a table in the back.
          A beat.

                         WHITACRE
          Brian, Bob, my attorney's telling
          me not to say anything, but there's
          something I've wanted to talk about
          for awhile.

                         HERNDON
          Don't tell us anything. You have an
          attorney now. This isn't like
          before. Let's just talk.
          Shepard tries to change the subject.

          Whitacre doesn't want to "just talk."

                         WHITACRE
          They want to talk to me at ADM.

                         HERNDON
          Mark, you understand your lawyer
          has advised you not to discuss this
          matter?

                         SHEPARD
          We're not asking you.

                         WHITACRE
          Let me throw out some
          "hypotheticals." I'll talk about
          some financial situations and you
          tell me if they're wrong or how
          serious they might be, OK? For
          instance, suppose a company gave an
          executive a car, you know, a
          corporate car. But instead of
          driving it to work he drove his
          personal car and gave the company
          car to his daughter. Would that be
          a problem?

                         HERNDON
          That's it? That's the hypothetical?
          The agents try not to laugh. After what Whitacre has given
          the government-- a little undeclared perk is nothing.

                         SHEPARD
          That shouldn't be a problem.

                         WHITACRE
          What about if an executive used a
          corporate plane for personal use?

                         HERNDON
          Basically, it's the same thing.

                         SHEPARD
          There may be some IRS issues but...

                         WHITACRE
          What if, hypothetically, the
          activity involved kickbacks by
          corporate executives?

                         HERNDON
          There are plenty of ways companies
          try and attract business. Dinners
          for clients, tickets for sporting
          events...

                         SHEPARD
          It's not ethical but it's done.
          A beat. Then Whitacre goes on.

                         WHITACRE
          Uh, is this conversation on or off
          the record?

                         SHEPARD
          On. Definitely.
          Whitacre exhales.

                         WHITACRE
          What if the company regularly
          accepted kickbacks to executives in
          the form of cash?
          Shepard drops his fork. Hold on Shepard.

                         SHEPARD
          How much money are we talking about
          Mark?
          Whitacre pauses, clears his throat.

                         WHITACRE
          Five hundred thousand.

                         HERNDON
          How much???
          Whitacre shrinks from the admission like a puppy who just
          crapped on the rug.

                         WHITACRE
          It's how things were done there.

                         SHEPARD
          When did this start, Mark?

                         WHITACRE
          December of 1991.
          Shepard can't believe it.

                         SHEPARD
          You, You... And how were you paid?

          By check. They we're deposited in
          various accounts. And always under
          10,000 dollars.

                         SHEPARD
          And did any of these checks come in
          after we met?
          Whitacre pauses.

                         WHITACRE
          Maybe a couple.
          The agents try and control their anger.

                         SHEPARD
          Who else knows about this?

                         WHITACRE
          Nobody.
          Herndon loses it.

                         HERNDON
          Come on, Mark-- you just said it's
          how things were done at ADM. Now,
          is there anything else you're
          involved in? Anything else you need
          to tell us?

                         WHITACRE
          Just what I told you.

                         HERNDON
          I'm asking you one more time.

                         WHITACRE
          The 500 and that's it. Definitely.
          Whitacre nods. He asks hopefully...

                         WHITACRE
          This isn't going to affect the
          price-fixing case, is it?
          The three men get up to leave.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          I feel good about that. Hey, I
          don't see what the big deal is.
          They said help us with the price
          fixing and I did-- the two things
          are totally unrelated...

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          Besides, Mick knew about it,
          definitely... He's the one who
          taught me to do it in the first

          GENERAL GARY SPRATLING. An overhead projector displays the
          forged contracts on the wall.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          When you look at what went on with
          all the price fixing they did or
          the Federal Building being bombed
          in Oklahoma City, why are we
          focusing on me getting a half-
          million in kick-backs along with
          everyone else?

                         AUBREY DANIEL
          Two point five million dollars.
          Deposited in a bank in Switzerland
          while Mark Whitacre was on ADM
          business. We have sworn testimony
          from Mr. Lennart Thorstensson of
          the ABP Corporation that he's never
          seen this contract before and that
          his signature has been forged. He
          and his company never received this
          check...
          As Daniel speaks one of the younger lawyers passes out a
          folder of affidavits and other documents supporting his
          claims.

                         AUBREY DANIEL
          It is clear to us that Mark
          Whitacre, driven by his own
          boundless ambition to take over
          ADM, has attempted to frame his
          superiors in a price fixing
          conspiracy of his own invention so
          that he could seize control of the
          company...

          His cooperation with the government
          is merely a smokescreen for his
          lying and stealing. We have
          additional information that we are
          prepared to share with Attorney
          General Reno that the money has
          been moved to an account in Grand

          I wonder if there's a name for

          They need to dig deep, then they'll

          I want the specifics? Are they
          saying I'm in cahoots with the guy?
          Medford and Paisley don't want to answer this.

                         MEDFORD
          Paragraph eight in our agreement
          with Whitacre states that his
          actions are directly attributable
          to the FBI and the US...

                         SHEPARD
          But, how could we know what he was
          doing? He came to us...

                         PAISLEY
          The question they're asking isn't
          `how could we know?' It's `why
          didn't we know?'

                         HERNDON
          The question is `were they fixing
          prices?'
          Medford and Paisley share a look.

                         MEDFORD
          The investigation has shifted from
          ADM to Whitacre.

                         SHEPARD
          Of course, ADM decides Whitacre's a
          thief as soon as they find out he's
          working for us.

                         HERNDON
          Who's counting the money over there
          if they can just lose 2.5 Million
          dollars for a few years and then
          find it in a few hours?

                         SHEPARD
          We gotta call Mark.

                         PAISLEY
          I don't want you doing that.
          Shepard and Herndon are confused.

                         MEDFORD
          We're taking you off.

          That's it. We're done? I thought
          the FBI never hung a witness out to
          dry.

                         MEDFORD
          He's not a witness anymore--- he's a

          receipts and bank statements.

                         WHITACRE
          I only kept a million and a half--
          and Mick knew about it, he knew
          these things went on. They taught
          me how to do it.
          Zaideman and Epstein shake their heads.

                         EPSTEIN
          You can't bullshit these people
          tomorrow. Who knows what they know?
          If we're going in there we got to
          go in with the whole story. Because
          the way it gets bad for you is if
          you tell them you're confessing and
          you don't. Then you are sorely
          screwed.
          Whitacre looks at his shoe box. He nods.

                         WHITACRE
          This is everything Jim, what I'm
          telling you here. I looked
          everywhere for the bank statements
          and the records. This is every
          penny-- I'm not gonna hide anything
          from you guys.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          I was never really that good at
          chemistry in high school. So I
          kept taking it-- just to get good
          and wound up with so many chemistry
          credits I ended up going into Bio-
          Chem.

          Whitacre, Epstein and Zaideman- on the way into battle.
          Whitacre is strangely placid.

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          That's really the truth about that--
          I wanted to be a veterinarian when
          I was kid-- I raised chickens and
          rabbits ...Biochem was my advisor's
          idea...

                         WHITACRE
          Listen, I haven't been telling you
          the whole truth. I'll clear it up
          in there today.

                         ZAIDEMAN
          What?
          OH, SHIT. Epstein starts desperately hitting elevator buttons
          to stop the approaching doom.

                         EPSTEIN
          We got to get you out of here.
          But, it's too late the doors open. Whitacre steps out.

                         WHITACRE
          No. I want to tell them.
          Hold on Epstein.

          151 INTERIOR DEPT. OF JUSTICE CONFERENCE ROOM- CHICAGO 151
          Whitacre surrounded by Epstein and Zaideman who can only
          imagine which way their loose cannon will roll. Across from
          the DOJ lawyers as far as the eye can see.

                         ROBIN MANN
          Mr. Whitacre's conduct constitutes
          a breach of his agreement with the
          US government. He is no longer a
          cooperating witness.

                         EPSTEIN
          My client has given you years of
          his life, clearly he made mistakes,
          but he made your case.

                         ROBIN MANN
          We're not here to discuss the case
          against ADM.

                         I
          ED HERBST, early 50's, and MARY SPEARING, 40's, take over--
          they take no prisoners.

                         HERBST
          Mr. Whitacre, my name is Ed Herbst
          and I'm with the FBI Economic
          Crimes Unit. I'd like you to tell
          me when your criminal conduct at
          ADM began.

                         WHITACRE
          In early 1992. I learned how
          things were done there from Mick
          Andreas. He's the one who taught
          me how to use embezzlement and
          kickbacks to make money tax free.
          Epstein tries to do some damage control.

                         EPSTEIN
          My client is...

                         WHITACRE
          I know the frauds I committed are
          wrong, and I accept responsibility
          for them.

                         HERBST
          How did you receive the money?

                         WHITACRE
          Primarily by check. I deposited
          them in my bank account in Decatur.
          This seems unlikely. Spearing gets angry--

                         MARY SPEARING
          They paid kickbacks in checks?
          What company would pay kickbacks in
          checks? Come on...
          No one from the government has ever been aggressive toward
          Whitacre before-- he's thrown.

                         WHITACRE
          I don't really remember the exact
          name... something like
          AgriConsulting and Trading,
          something like that...

                         MARY SPEARING
          You don't remember the name of the
          company that paid you checks?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Draft: 1/15/03 127.

                         WHITACRE
          I. .I've got a lot going on in my
          life. It's hard to remember.

                         EPSTEIN
          Hey, we're coming to you guys.
          We're cooperating here and we're
          going to get the money back.
          Epstein looks at Whitacre-- this last part might be hard.

                         HERBST
          This might help your memory.
          He slides the forged ABP documents toward Whitacre.

                         WHITACRE
          Where did you get that?

                         HERBST
          These are ADM records showing the
          forging of signatures.
          Whitacre smiles and shakes his head. He sees the conspiracy
          plainly.

          WHITACRE WHITACRE (V.0.)
          See, that's how they keep Didn't these people see The
          people in the fold-- they Firm-- or read the book.
          tell you to take the money It's all there. Everything
          and then they use it against they did to me they did to
          you if you talk. It's how Tom Cruise... I'm not the one
          they control us. You gotta they should be mad at...
          realize who these people
          are...

                         MARY SPEARING
          Is there anything else you have a
          hard time remembering?
          Whitacre looks at Epstein. Epstein shakes his head "no" but
          Whitacre has other plans.

                         WHITACRE
          Umm...I have a few other things to
          tell you about.
          Epstein sighs.

                         WHITACRE
          There were some things I did in
          Mexico...

          PULL BACK FROM CONFERENCE ROOM
          As Whitacre spills his guts the lawyers look on in
          bewilderment ... The man is unhinged.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          I raised white mice, too. Chickens
          and goats and white mice in little
          cages. They couldn't come in the
          house. I took care of them-- that
          was my job outside. One got in one
          time, I don't know how, and he was
          found dead by my Mother. This had
          nothing to do with anything I had
          done-- he just had died and it was
          up to me to bring him back to life.
          I wanted to do the right thing and
          wear the white hat and that's why I
          tried to make it all right so he
          wouldn't have to be dead. All the
          things I did were for that-- but I
          couldn't.

          152 INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION LIVING ROOM- NIGHT 152
          Shepard, Herndon, Ginger and Whitacre. Mark looks used up--
          his hair seems to be graying around the edges. In front of
          him are a pile of newspapers-- Washington Post, WSJ, Chicago
          Tribune, etc. Each with a banner announcement of his sins.

                         HERNDON
          We can't see you anymore and if you
          call us and start to talk about it,
          we'll have to hang up...

                         SHEPARD
          You can talk to us about your
          feelings, but that's it.
          Shepard puts his coffee cup down near the newspapers.

          ANGLE ON WSJ
          7/13/95 Headline reads: YOU DIRTY RAT, SAYS DECATUR ILLINOIS-

          PEOPLE THINK MARK WHITACRE BETRAYED THEM AND ASR WHY HE

          TURNED TO THE FBI.
          Whitacre nods-- he can't play with his friends any more.

                         SHEPARD
          Mark, please understand. This
          isn't what we want. We've got no
          choice here.

                         WHITACRE
          I'll tell you what, my frustration
          and anger is all coming from my
          work with you guys. I mean, this
          stuff in the papers, my kids read
          that. It's all, "Dump on Mark
          Whitacre." It's not right. I'm
          harassed by the media and Mick and
          Terry are still going to work in
          the morning.

                         SHEPARD
          Remember, Mark, we told you it was
          impossible to predict what would
          happen when the case went overt.

                         HERNDON
          And you never told us about the
          Five Million Dollars you took...
          Ginger has heard this before and can't hear it again.

                         GINGER
          He worked for you for two and a
          half years, he risked his career,
          his home.. .And now you turn your
          back on him and leave us out here.

                         WHITACRE
          Ginger...
          But the damn has burst. She sobs.

                         SHEPARD
          The reason we came today is because
          we are concerned about your and
          Mark's well being.

                         HERNDON
          It's important that you tell the
          people in Washington everything
          tomorrow-- one hundred per cent.
          Whitacre nods. Ginger seethes.

                         GINGER
          You'd have nothing without him and
          you know it. He's just been used
          by the government and then thrown
          away cuz' it's a lot easier to go
          after Mark Whitacre than anyone
          named Andreas.
          Whitacre stares at the newspapers.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          I think a lot of people would come--
          a lot of friends... and people would
          be surprised by just how many there
          are. Even folks from ADM... The news
          media would be there for sure...

          153 INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- MASTER BEDROOM- DAWN 153
          Whitacre is sitting on the bed up and dressed when the alarm
          goes off. He lies across his wife on the bed-- more like a
          child than a husband.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          .Everything would come out.
          Brian and Bob would come and I bet
          one of them would say something
          about me. Rheinhard would come up
          from Mexico. Sid or Marty would
          tell people what kind of boss I was
          and how I always brought back
          presents...

                         WHITACRE
          You'll be OK here with your mom?
          Ginger nods groggily. Whitacre leaves the room-- grabbing a
          PICTURE OF HIS FAMILY from a bedside table.

          154 EXTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION GARAGE- MORNING 154
          Whitacre opens the garage door and we see the entire fleet of
          cars he has amassed-- 5 Million dollars buys a lot of
          steering wheels. Ferrari, Range Rover, Jeep, etc. Whitacre
          selects the BMW convertible. He gets in the car and puts his
          brief case in the seat next to him. He opens it and we see
          the contents: HUNDREDS OF ARTICLES ABOUT WHITACRE. A
          scrapbook from a roller coaster ride. He starts the car and
          guns the engine.

          ANGLE ON THE GARAGE
          The Beemer does not back up-- THE GARAGE DOOR COMES DOWN.

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          Jesus died on a cross to save
          others from their sins. Jesus was
          a hero. I know selfish suicide is

          RUSTY the gardener shows up for work. He gets out of his
          Pick-Up and kicks a few leaves off the driveway, he adds some
          chemicals to the pool and then walks toward the garage-- as
          he's fishing some keys out of his pocket he notices the sound
          of a car engine.

          157 INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION GARAGE- CONTINUOUS 157
          The air is thick with smoke. Whitacre is motionless sprawled
          in the backseat-- drenched in sweat clutching the PICTURE OF

          HIS FAMILY.

                         RUSTY
          Jesus, no. Somebody help.
          Rusty throws the car in reverse and pulls out.

          ANGLE ON WHITACRE
          He opens an eye, but as Rusty looks down at him again he
          closes it-- plays dead.
          The car is outside now. Rusty turns off the engine.
          Whitacre sighs heavily.

                         WHITACRE
          Bud, pull the car back into the
          garage. Pull back in before
          somebody sees me.
          Rusty pulls the car back in and turns it off. The smoke is
          still clearing.

                         RUSTY
          Jesus, Mark, what are you doing?
          Whitacre still stretched out in the backseat stares up at the
          ceiling-- explodes.

                         WHITACRE
          You...You fucking God. You owe me.
          You fucking God. After everything
          I did.
          Rusty is shocked by the outburst-- this is not the guy he
          knows at all. He backs away from the car and picks up the
          garage phone.

          Why? Rusty, what's wrong?

                         RUSTY
          I just need to talk to you.

                         GINGER
          I'm not coming down there unless
          you tell me what's wrong.

          Mark just tried to kill himself
          and...
          Ginger's piercing scream comes down the phone line. Whitacre
          is fetal in the backseat-- moaning.
          Ginger and HER MOTHER come flying out of the house screaming.
          They pull Mark out of the car toward the open air as he
          stumbles, coughing, the family picture clatters across the
          garage floor. Whitacre jumps on it like a grenade.

          That Goddam Dwayne Andreas did this
          to him, Mom. He ought to be

          genial, soft-spoken. This is not internal, it's therapy.

          .Walk back in with a bag full of
          jewelry.

                         MILLER
          You never thought you'd get caught?

                         WHITACRE
          That never occurred to me. I mean,
          I look respectable. Why would they
          search me? And now they're saying I
          stole 5 Million dollars. That's
          what I've been accused of.

                         MILLER
          Did you?

                         WHITACRE
          Yeah. They were paying me 500
          grand, but it wasn't enough, I was
          spending more like eight. So, I
          took kickbacks. Like I said, it's
          just what you did if you wanted to
          be part of the gang at ADM.

                         MILLER
          Is that how it was when you were a
          kid; you wanted to be part of the
          gang?

          One time I got a brand new, top of
          the line bicycle. And I bragged to
          everyone about it. I told
          everybody how much it cost.
          A beat. Then proudly.

                         WHITACRE
          It cost ninety dollars.

                         MILLER
          How did you come to work for the

          FBI?

                         WHITACRE
          They approached me.
          This doesn't make much sense to Miller.

                         MILLER
          How is it that they came to you?
          Did they know about the price
          fixing?

                         WHITACRE
          This agent, Brian Shepard came to a
          number of junior executives at
          ADM... That's why they approached
          me. The price fixing hadn't even
          started yet...
          Miller is confused by this.

                         MILLER
          But, uh, if no crime was,
          then-Mark, I'd like to have you
          checked into the hospital.

          I was always the one with the

          but that's changed too. Since he
          said he'd cooperate with the FBI--

          Have you ever heard that Mark told
          people he was adopted?

          NEVER SEEN BEFORE
          It was in the paper that he was
          adopted.

                         LAWYER
          Mark is your natural born son;
          isn't that correct?

          According to the adoption story
          Mark told, his parents we're killed

          He grew up in our house.

          Shepard.

          This is your chance to put

          the chance to redeem yourself, but
          if you're not going to be
          completely honest you should stop
          talking now.

                         WHITACRE
          I understand that. And I want to
          tell you I feel bad. I'm so sorry,
          and I feel worst about letting down

          Last time we talked I was under a
          great deal of stress and I said
          some things that weren't true. I'd
          like to clear that up.

          How much money did you receive
          through all your illegal
          activities?
          Whitacre takes a moment-- does the math in his head, mouthing
          to himself the various sources of his massive fraud.

                         WHITACRE
          Uh...7.7 Million dollars. But,
          Mick knew. Like I said, he
          endorsed these things.

                         D' ANGELO
          He endorsed you stealing 7.7
          Million dollars?

                         WHITACRE
          He might have though that was a bit
          much.

                         D' ANGELO
          Is there anything else you want to
          tell us?

                         WHITACRE
          Well, I think you did a real good
          job today-- I do know that ADM has
          been stealing microbes from the
          Japanese for years and that they
          use prostitutes to get information
          from the competition's facility in
          Iowa. I know that Mick Andreas
          uses cocaine and I have that on
          tape-- and there are illegal
          campaign contributions to both
          American and foreign politicians...

          ask yourself, was the US government
          taken in by Mark Whitacre, or did
          it help create him?

          Mark committed a crime. He stole
          nine million dollars. It's
          indefensible. But these guys from
          ADM stole hundreds of millions of
          dollars from innocent people all
          over the world. Mark showed you
          that four white guys in suits
          getting together in the middle of
          the day, isn't a business meeting.
          It's a crime scene. And not only
          did he tell you about it, he got
          you the evidence to prove it. Now,
          we're not looking for the moon and
          stars. We're looking for something
          in the area of three years.. .Or we
          can take it to trial. And in that

          that I basically better forget
          everything that's not on tape.

          the FBI did the same thing. They
          locked my husband in an

          around for three years threatening

          You've got to focus here. You
          stole nine million dollars. And
          then you lied about it. Maybe in

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          I read this study in Time magazine
          when I was at Cornell-- which is an
          Ivy league school-- and there were
          a lot of people who never believed,
          including my mother, that I would
          make it to an Ivy league school
          maybe just Ginger who I met in
          Marching Band in the 8th grade...

          ANGLE ON THE LETTER
          Fragments of the contents "This is to inform you of your
          lithium levels"..."Exacerbated by stress"..."A strict drug
          regimen..."

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          .and the study said that people
          had nice, sympathetic feelings
          about people who were adopted and
          treated them better. So I made up
          this adoption story-- and people
          did treat me better-- and when I
          got a job one of my professors told
          the people at Ralston Purina that I
          was this amazing guy that had
          accomplished all of this in spite
          of being adopted--
          Whitacre takes out a pair of SCISSORS and goes to work on the
          letter.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          .and so it was really other
          people who spread the story not me--
          although I admit it was wrong to
          start it and everything, it was
          other people who kept it going.
          Even the people at ADM.
          My new lawyer sees that.

          It's bigger than any of us, and
          it's ongoing. I know you're
          skeptical, but I've seen it. My
          client Mark Whitacre has shown it
          to me. Maybe I'm just a personal
          injury lawyer from Taylorville-

          Grandiosity and embellishment--

          embellish things-- those are the
          major symptoms of bipolar disorder.
          And the other, the second major
          symptom is poor judgement. And
          that's something Brian Shepard
          should have known ; The bipolar
          disorder is what made me believe
          I'd be President when it was
          over... Although there was a time
          when Mick told me, on a trip to
          Nebraska, that I could be headed
          for the top.

          You have the right to make a
          statement if you wish?
          Whitacre nods and stands.

                         WHITACRE
          I appreciate the opportunity to say
          a few words, it's been a long five
          years. I apologize to a lot of
          people in this room...

          this room for my actions. I
          realize I hurt a lot of people and
          I apologize greatly...I am here to
          accept my punishment. That's all.

                         JUDGE BAKER
          To observe that Mr. Whitacre is the
          usual felon is a gross
          understatement. He is well
          educated, has a loving wife and
          family, is respected in the
          community. It is not inconceivable
          that in due course he may have
          become CEO of Archer Daniels
          Midland...

          He smiles. He knew he could be CEO someday. . .We hear
          Whitacre in a calmer time.

          I like jail. I think it's been good

          But, the judge isn't done with him.

                         JUDGE BAKER
          However, the court can find no
          clear connection between Mr.
          Whitacre's bipolar disorder and the
          45 counts of criminal misconduct he
          has been charged with-- just garden
          variety greed. It is very
          difficult to tell when Mr. Whitacre
          is telling the truth...

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          But, I don't think what happened is
          fair when you look at what happened
          to me compared to Mick and Terry. I
          mean, if you go and hold up your

          only got three... So you tell me how
          it makes sense that I get nine. I

                         WHITACRE (CONT'D)
          I'd also like to take this
          opportunity to apologize to Special
          Agent Brian Shepard on behalf of
          myself and my wife Ginger, he never
          hit me with a brief case or told me
          to destroy tapes. The idea to sue
          him wasn't mine-- it came from
          someone at ADM and I shouldn't have
          listened. I can't remember who.
          when I was at ADM, I lived so many
          lives, I wasn't sure who I was.
          Today, I know more who I am and
          what I really want out of life.
          I've completed three post-graduate
          degrees while in detention. A J.D.
          which is, of course, a law degree
          and another advanced degree in the
          psychology of jury selection. I
          sleep better in prison than I have
          in years. My wife has forgiven me
          and believes that the ordeal with
          ADM has brought us closer together
          in a marriage of over 20 years. I
          hope you will allow me to leave
          here, so that I can re-join my life
          with my family and three kids. . .Two
          of whom are adopted... Especially
          when you consider that thanks in
          large part to my testimony the US
          government has been able to collect
          over a billion dollars in price-
          fixing fines from big business.
          That's it. Thanks.
          He smiles. The light goes out. The Cameraman starts packing
          up the equipment. Out of the shadows steps Bob Herndon.

          Good luck with the appeal, Mark.

                         WHITACRE
          Thanks for helping me remember
          everything Bob. I sure appreciate
          it. I wish Brian could've come.

          He still pretty angry.

          You tell him, I'm real sorry. Can
          you do that for me? The funny part
          is if I'd never gone undercover I
          would have never stolen 11 million.

          Did I say eleven? Boy, it was only
          nine. Definitely. The eleven is
          with interest.

          it now that there's less stress. It
          was just the stress of the FBI.

     black...

     INT. A JEEP, LEBANON - DAY

     And we're in a speeding SOVIET JEEP...  Two men in front,
     shouldering assault rifles.  HEZBOLLAH SOLDIERS...  And there
     are three MEN in the back.  A middle-aged Man wearing a tired
     suit and tinted sunglasses trying to hold on.  And on either
     side of him, two Men, blindfolded.  The man on one side is in
     his forties, hands pressed in the pockets of a well-travelled
     black-leather jacket...  A stocky man, with the edge of a
     J.D. Salinger character, he's seen everything at least once.
     But even he has lost some of his self-confidence, here,
     turning his head, sensing the wind, a blast of Arabic music
     that disappears behind him...  He's LOWELL BERGMAN.  On the
     other side of the man in the tired suit is a lanky Man with a
     voltmeter around his neck, NORMAN.

     EXT. THE BEQA'A VALLEY, BAALBEK, LEBANON - DAY

     The Jeep races up narrow winding streets of a Lebanese
     village.  It's shadowed by a Jeep in front, and in back, each
     carrying personnel armed with AK's and a few RPG's...  And in
     the third Jeep are two blindfolded, not very threatening
     Lebanese soldiers.  And as the speeding convoy passes a
     captured Israeli Armored Personnel Carrier covered with
     Arabic graffiti, looking down on them from huge murals are
     the stern visages of the Ayatollah Khomeini, and a Hezbollah
     religious leader, the Sheikh Fadlallah...  And, suddenly the
     convoy skids to a stop...  And blindfolded Lowell and Norman
     are roughly taken out, and pushed, stumbling, through the
     cloud of dust without sight...  The lanky cameraman is
     stopped, told to wait, while Lowell is pushed past armed men
     guarding a small stone house, and inside...

     INT. A HOUSE IN LEBANON - DAY

     A round-faced Man in his mid-forties, with large-framed
     glasses, black hair and a grey-black beard, wearing a
     dullbend, a turban, sits informally at a kitchen table...
     It's the Sheikh Fadlallah whose face stares out at us from
     walls.  A Gunman cradling an AK-47 sits in an incongruous
     purple armchair in a corner.  A torn poster of the Seychelles
     is on one wall.  Another Gunman stands by a window.  Lowell
     is sat down in a chair at the kitchen table...

                         THE SHEIKH
               Coffee?

                         LOWELL
               Yeah...  Thank you.

                         THE SHEIKH
               How have you liked your stay?

                   (droll)
               What I've seen...I've liked.

     The Sheikh smiles.  And the smile passes as quickly as it
     came.  A steaming cup of coffee in a small Arabic demitasse
     is put down.

                         THE SHEIKH
               Please to explain, why I should agree to
               interview...with pro-Zionist American
               media?

                         LOWELL
               Because I think Hezbollah is trying to
               broaden into a political party right now.
               So you care about what you're thought of
               in America.  And in America, at this
               moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a
               face.
                   (confident)
               That's why.

     And we've first realized this man is not a hostage; he's come
     here voluntarily.

               Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity
               and I see the questions first.  Then I
               decide if I grant the interview.

                         LOWELL
                   (blunt)
               No.  We don't do that.

               we are the highest-rated, most-respected,
               TV-magazine news show in America.

     The Sheikh quietly looks out his glasses at him, studying
     him.  And Lowell "closes":

                         LOWELL (cont'd)
               So.  Mr. Wallace.  Should he get on a
               plane or not?

     The Sheikh thinks it over and then...

                         THE SHEIKH
               Tell him I will see him day after
               tomorrow.

                         LOWELL
               That's good.  That works.
                   (after a beat)
               Uh, you know, I want to ask you
               something...I know it sounds odd...but...

     It's quiet...too quiet...

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
               Hello, Sheikh...?
                   (no answer)
               Hello, Sheikh...?

     Silence.  He hesitates, starts to lift his blindfold...  He
     lifts it.  And he sees the Sheikh, and his gunmen, are gone.
     The house empty.  Only his Cameraman, the lanky man, left
     there, standing by the door still in his blindfold...

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
               Norman.

                         NORMAN
               What?  What?

                         LOWELL
               Take your blindfold off.

     The lanky man does and we see the cameraman is Asian-
     American.

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
                   (sarcastic)
               Welcome to the world.

     Norman gives Lowell an ironic look and tests the local
     current at an electrical outlet.

                         NORMAN
               Fluctuating all over the place.  Anywhere
               we shoot, here, it's gonna be portable
               gennies and we'll run cable...

     Lowell nods and opens the curtains from this commanding
     height.  Baalbek and the Beqa'a Valley below gold-domed
     mosques.  A moment of triumph.  He dials his cell phone...

                         MIKE WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER)
               Hello?

                         LOWELL
                   (into phone)
               Mike, it's me.  We're on...

     AND WE HEAR PEOPLE LAUGHING AND ENCOURAGING "GO AHEAD...
     OPEN IT..."

     INT. A LABORATORY, BROWN & WILLIAMSON, LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY
     - DAY

     We're in a SCIENCE LABORATORY...  OUT OF FOCUS LAB
     TECHNICIANS, in white lab coats, celebrating a heavyset Black
     woman's birthday...  Half her presents are opened.  Balloons,
     incongruous, floating above the lab...  And there's a sense
     that somebody is watching...  And from the waist up, a
     disembodied figure comes into FOCUS behind a glass partition,
     as if quarantined, isolated, an expressionless MAN in his
     late forties, watching them...

     INT. JEFFREY WIGAND'S OFFICE - DAY

     The office soundproofed, he watches the people laughing,
     their lips moving.  His hair not yet settled on grey, his
     face is changing, always interesting.  Born in the Bronx,
     educated in Upstate New York, he retains little of the accent
     and much of the directness.  He's JEFFREY WIGAND.  He turns
     to resume gathering things from his desk...some technical
     books, a medical text on asthma...putting them in his
     briefcase.  And as he leaves the office, the silent party
     like a bizarre mime behind him...

     INT. LOBBY, BROWN & WILLIAMSON BUILDING - DAY

     Briefcase in hand, Jeffrey appears from the elevator from
     ABOVE, from WIDE and in FRONT, his eyes, frozen pools...  And
     like a bad dream, a broad-shouldered Man, leaning against the
     wall near the reception island in a suit he's not comfortable
     in, wearing an earphone, saying something into a lapel
     microphone after Jeffrey's passed.

     INT. WIGAND'S CAR, LOUSIVILLE - DAY

     Light mottled through trees reflects off the car window...
     Jeffrey's face goes in and out of the tunnel of light and
     shadow...down this tasteful, suburban Louisville street of
     neat houses and manicured lawns...  He pulls into driveway
     behind a 3 series BMW.  It's a grey French provincial
     replica...

     INT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, FOYER - DAY

     Jeffrey comes in and a young Girl, six, is watching
     television in the den...BARBARA.

                         WIGAND
               Hi, honey.

                         BARBARA
               Hi, Daddy.

                         WIGAND
               What's new?

                         BARBARA
               Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.

                         WIGAND
               Yeah?  What for?

                         BARBARA
               For reading.

     He pours himself a drink at a wet bar.

                         WIGAND
               That's great...  Little early for
               cartoons, isn't it?

                         BARBARA
               Okay.

     Dutiful, she shuts off the TV, going upstairs.

                         BARBARA (cont'd)
               Deborah?  Debbie?

     He looks outside.  A Woman is sitting on the back porch
     drinking wine, reading a paperback book, drinking wine.
     There's something like a Hockney painting about her against
     the manicured lawns.  Right now the Woman comes in.  She's
     pretty, tall, languid, reserved, somebody it would be nice to
     wear on your arm.  LIANE WIGAND.  She has an odd delay
     between a thought and her speech...

                         LIANE
               Oh, I didn't know you were home...  It's
               early...  Isn't it?

     He doesn't say anything...

                         LIANE (CONT'D)
               Gotta take Debbie to ballet...

     And it all feels suburban, familiar.  Suddenly there's a
     shout...

                         BARBARA'S VOICE (OVER)
               Mommy!

     Jeffrey goes quickly up the stairs into...

     INT. WIGAND'S HOUSE - DEBORAH'S BEDROOM - DAY

     And a little girl, eight, sitting on the floor in a ballet
     leotard, her head back, wheezing, her neck muscles
     contracting and bulging, her face pale, lips white, and her
     eyes filled with fear as rapid, shallow breathing induces a
     sense of suffocation.  DEBORAH WIGAND is having a severe
     asthmatic attack...

                         WIGAND
               Sweetheart, c'mon.  C'mon.

                         BARBARA
               She was playing with my Pooh doll
               again...

     Jeffrey sits her on the side of her bed next to which is a
     Nebulizer, an air compressor to deliver medication via a tube
     into a circular mouthpiece.

     The compressor whirs.  Deborah breathes in the medication.
     Jeffrey brushes the hair back from her face and wipes
     perspiration from her forehead as...

                         WIGAND
               Slow down.  Slow down.  Slow down.
               Breathe deep.  Breathe deep.  Slow down,
               honey.  Slow down.  Slow down.

     Liane rushes in with rolled-up towels, kneels in front of
     Deborah, smiling to mask anxiety, and goes into the bathroom
     with the towels and turns on full blast the bathtub's hot
     water.  We don't know why yet...

     Deborah's chest heaves.  She's scared.  Jeffrey gets in front
     of her and talks to her to arrest her attention.

                         WIGAND (cont'd)
               Here we go.  Deep breaths, deep breaths.

                         BARBARA
               She was playing with the Pooh doll.

                         WIGAND
               Pooh's dusty, sweetheart...he's dusty,
               and you breathed him in, okay?  So what's
               - what's happening to you now is... cells
               called mast cells told your lungs "don't
               breathe any more of that dust in."
                   (beat)
               ...and the airways in your lungs are like
               branches.  And when the branches close
               up, you get an asthmatic attack.  And, we
               give you medicine, and you get better.
               Huh?  Okay?  You're better already,
               aren't you?

     And the medication's taking effect and she's calmer.

     Liane, hands clutched in her lap, smiles at Deborah.  Now she
     takes Deborah's hand and exchanges a look with Jeffrey.
     Jeffrey's a good father, a natural caregiver.

                         WIGAND (cont'd)
               Okay, baby?

     INT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - EVENING

     Jeffrey, Liane and the two Girls silently eating dinner,
     Deborah in a bathrobe.

                         DEBORAH
               Can I go to dance tomorrow?  I'm
               better...

                         LIANE
               ...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to
               soccer and take you to dance after...

                         WIGAND
               I can take her.

                         LIANE
               Don't you have to be at the office?

                         WIGAND
                   (instead, getting up)
               Is there any more rice...?

                         LIANE
                   (nods)
               Yes, it's on the stove...

     He goes into the kitchen, to the stove, seeing...

                         LIANE (cont'd)
               Do you want more rice?

                         DEBORAH
               Maybe later.

                         LIANE
               How about you?

                         BARBARA
               I'll take some.

                         WIGAND
               Instant rice...?

                         BARBARA
               Can I go over to Janeane's house?

                         LIANE
               I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my
               coffee mug...?

                         WIGAND
               Try the car.

     And Liane going outside...

     EXT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE - EVENING

     She opens Jeffrey's car looking in the front seat at the cup
     holders.  She turns to leave and sees the backseat filled
     with two boxes and the books we saw him take...

                         LIANE
               Uh, what are those boxes?

                         WIGAND
               I'm going to the store.  You need
               anything?

                         LIANE
               What do you need at the store?

                         WIGAND
               Soy sauce...

                         LIANE
               Right now?

                         WIGAND
                   (meaning in the car)
               That's my stuff from the office...

                         LIANE
               Why did you take your stuff from the
               office?

                         WIGAND
                   (simply)
               I didn't want to leave it there...

                         LIANE
                    (confused)
               I don't understand.

                         WIGAND
                   (matter of fact)
               I got fired this morning...  Where else
               am I gonna take it?

                         LIANE
               Why?  Who said?

                         WIGAND
                   (specifically)
               Thomas Sandefur...

                         LIANE
                   (stunned, fearful)
               What are we supposed to do...?  What
               about our medical coverage; what about
               our health?  What about our car payments?
               The payments on this house?

     He looks at her.  There's an unspoken moment when it seems
     he's desperate for her to ask how he's feeling...  But she
     doesn't and now there's a wall up and the moment passes...

                         WIGAND
                   (a beat, specific)
               There's a severance agreement...  It
               includes cash payouts over time and
               continuing medical coverage...
                   (beat)
               Sure you don't need anything?

                         LIANE
               No, thank you.

     She's stunned.  He leaves.  And as Liane's completely still,
     her accessories seeming literally to weigh her down, she
     wants to ask how he is, how he must be feeling, and she turns
     into CAMERA towards him to do that.  But he's driven off down
     the street.

                         LIANE (cont'd)
               Jeffrey...!

     INT. ANOTHER HOUSE IN BAALBEK - DAY

     The Sheikh, wearing a fresh white robe and skull cap, comes
     into the room...

                         THE SHEIKH
               I am very pleased to receive you as my
               guest, Mr. Wallace.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Thank you for having us...

     REVERSE:  Norman's camera crew is setting up.  MIKE WALLACE
     is there.  A dangerous combination of intelligence,
     arrogance, and celebrity, there's a kinetic quality about
     him.

     Wallace sits across from the Sheikh on a dais of patterned
     linoleum in incongruous armchairs against a wallpaper mural
     of a French formal garden.  A Sound Technician wires the
     Sheikh and Mike with microphones.  Norman says something to
     Lowell and then goes out.

                         NORMAN
               I think I've got a problem with the
               gennie.  I have to go outside.

                         LOWELL
                   (going outside)
               Norman...?

     Mike turns his chair to face and slides it closer to the
     Sheikh's chair.  The Head Bodyguard barks something in
     Arabic.  The Interpreter says something back in Arabic.  The
     Sheikh, absorbed in his notes for the upcoming interview,
     ignores all of this.

                         INTERPRETER
               He says you must not sit so close.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               What?
                   (re:  Bodyguard)
               I can't conduct an interview from back
               there.

     The Bodyguard, bristling at Wallace's tone, barks more
     confrontational Arabic.

                         INTERPRETER
               You must move back your chair.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Will you tell him that when I conduct an
               interview, I sit anywhere I damn please!

                         INTERPRETER
               There is no interview.

     As Mike leaps forward, moving inches from the Bodyguard's
     face with such sudden ferocity, even the Bodyguard flinches.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               You!  I'm talking to you!

     More armed men start to enter.

                         MIKE WALLACE (cont'd)
               What the hell do you think I am?  A 78-
               year-old assassin?  You think I'm gonna
               karate him to death with this notepad?
                   (to Interpreter)
               Are you interpreting what I'm saying?

                         INTERPRETER
               Yes.

                         LOWELL
               We're there.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Good, well ask him if Arabic is his
               second language.

                         LOWELL
                   (to Interpreter)
               Don't interpret that!
                   (to both)
               Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it!  Slow,
               slow!!
                   (to the Sheikh)
               Sheikh, do you mind...if you would just
               turn your chair a little bit to face Mr.
               Wallace?

     The Sheikh looks up from his notes, nods, fixes his chair,
     goes back to his notes...

                         LOWELL (cont'd)
               Is that okay?

                         INTERPRETER
               Okay.

                         LOWELL
                   (Bodyguard assents; to Mike)
               Are you ready?  Or you want to keep
               fucking around and warm up some more...?

                         MIKE WALLACE
               No.
                   (wry)
               ...that's got my heart started.

     They know each other well.  Lowell smiles.  Wallace sits
     down.

                         LOWELL
               Alright, Todd, give me the three-button
               on Mike, please.  Okay.  We are rolling.
               Okay, Mike.

     They roll camera...  "60 Minutes"...  "Hezbollah"...

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (charming)
               Sheikh Fadlallah, thank you so much for
               seeing us.
                   (changes)
               Are you a terrorist?

     The Sheikh didn't expect the Mike Wallace opening shot
     between the eyes.  He recovers...

                         THE SHEIKH
               Mr. Wallace, I...am a servant of God.

     That expression of incredulity...

                         MIKE WALLACE
               A servant of God?  Really...

     Mike, tipping his glasses down while the hostile Gunmen,
     cradling weapons, watch him through the doorway...

                         MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D)
               Americans believe that you, as an Islamic
               fundamentalist, that you are a leader who
               contributed to the bombing of the U.S.
               Embassy.

     The ballsiness of Wallace, asking these questions in this
     place, is impressive...

     EXT. BERKELEY - LATE MORNING

     It's still.  A MAIL TRUCK is stopped at an odd angle in the
     street outside an older brick house with a bold redwood Big
     Sur-like fence on a hillside.  Beyond the truck is a forever
     view of the Bay.  A handle turns.  Mail truck door opens.
     Mailman, carrying a box, going through the gate.  Doorstep.
     Box is deposited there.  It's quiet again.  The BOX sitting
     nakedly by the front door...

     INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BEDROOM, BERKELEY - LATE MORNING

     Lowell, in sweat pants and an old tee shirt now, is on the
     telephone, still in bed...  Newspapers, The New York Times,
     The Wall Street Journal, San Francisco Chronicle, are spread
     all over...home as refuge.  A tray with large cups of coffee
     is on a side table.

                         LOWELL
               ...everyone thinks Canadian Mounties
               ride horses and rescue ladies from
               rapids, Mike.  They backed locals in Oka
               in a fight with Mohawks over building a
               golf course on their burial site.  They
               beat up protesters at Kanasake...
                   (pause)
               Where'd you hear that?

     The other phone on a nightstand rings...  A Woman in her
     forties, SHARON TILLER, enters, in a bathrobe, brushing her
     teeth.  She answers it...

                         LOWELL (cont'd)
                   (droll)
               Oh, someone took a poll?  "Are all things
               Canadian boring...?"

                         SHARON
                   (to Lowell)
               It's Stuart...he's in Mexico City...

                         LOWELL
               Let me call you back...

     He takes up the line...listening...

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
               Yeah, Stuart...  What New York bank?

     A young Man in his early twenties wanders in...

                         JAKE
               Hey Dad...Sharon...

     Lowell waves at JAKE, his son.

                         SHARON
                   (to Jake)
               No classes this morning?

                         LOWELL
               Will he go on-camera and talk about the
               Mexico City branch?

                         JAKE
               I don't have to be there until ten-
               thirty.

     Lowell's son sits on the bed looking at part of a newspaper.
     And another young Man, in his early twenties, with long hair
     comes strolling in, Sharon's son, JOSIAH.

                         JOSIAH
               Hi Mom, Lowell...

     Lowell, still on the phone, waves to him.

                         SHARON
               Hi, sweetheart...

     Josiah sits on the bed too, reading the back of the sports
     section Jake is reading...  Another line rings, Sharon
     getting it.  The Boys, used to them, get up, and leave...

                         LOWELL
                   (into phone)
               Will independent sources corroborate
               that?

                         SHARON
               Hello?  Yeah...

     EXT. THE BERKELEY HOUSE - MORNING

     The Boys coming out of the house together...  And seeing the
     BOX by the door...

                         LOWELL'S SON
                   (shouts back inside)
               Dad, you got a box out here...

     And they go out the gate, talking, walking off along the
     Berkeley street.  The box left waiting by the door.

                         LOWELL
                   (looking at her itinerary)
               Let me see this...  No, 'cause I gotta
               know where you're going at all times.

     INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BEDROOM, BERKELEY - MORNING

                         SHARON
                   (into phone)
               I can't...  I've got to fly to Boston
               tomorrow.

     Lowell comes with the box back to bed.  He's already
     unwrapped it.  Inside are stacks of papers...  He looks at
     the box cover.  No return address.  An anonymous sender; not
     unusual for him.  He casually looks through the papers.

                         SHARON (CONT'D)
               Two p.m.  Great.  Bye-bye.
                   (hangs up)

                         LOWELL
                   (reading)
               ..."ignition propensity?"
                   (to Sharon)
               ...you understand any of this...?

     He gives her some papers.  We see formulas...scientific data
     in tables...

                         SHARON
               ...no...this looks like a table of
               temperatures...  Who's this from?

                         LOWELL
                   (shrugs)
               ...it's anonymous.  References to "P.M."
                   (motions)
               It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?

                         SHARON
               I have to take a shower.

     As he looks at the papers, Sharon goes into the bathroom...

     INT. THE FEDERAL DRUG ADMINISTRATION AGENCY, CAFETERIA,
     WASHINGTON - DAY

     We see a MAN in his forties, eating a late lunch, getting
     paged in a crowded cafeteria.  An old 1930's WPA mural on the
     wall...  His pager goes off...

     Doug Oliver walks across the cafeteria to a bank of pay
     phones and dials.

     INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, DEN - BERKELEY - MORNING

     The phone rings.  Lowell picks it up...

                         LOWELL
               Yeah.

                         DOUG OLIVER
                   (into phone)
               Hi, this is Doug Oliver...

                         LOWELL
               Oh, hi, Doug...it's Lowell.  I'm doing
               this story on fire safety...  People
               burning up from falling asleep smoking.
               I received a shitload of scientific
               papers from inside Philip Morris...
               Anonymous.  You or anybody in FDA know
               someone who can translate this stuff into
               English for me?

                         DOUG OLIVER
                   (beat)
               ...uh, yeah...

     EXT. A BERKELEY CAFE - CLOSE:  PAY PHONE

     There's the sound of a phone ringing.  PULL BACK to reveal
     Lowell outside a cafe with dry cleaning he collected over one
     shoulder.  A LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE OVER (Deborah's) answers.
     "Hello."

                         LOWELL
               Mr. Wigand, please.

     There's a whisper..."Someone's calling for Daddy, Mom."

     Behind Lowell is a humming Berkeley street.  He gestures
     familiarly to a Server, who brings out his two take-out
     cappuccinos.  Lowell nods his thanks, pays...

                         LOWELL (cont'd)
               Thank you, Bob.

                         LIANE'S VOICE (OVER)
               Who's calling?

                         LOWELL
               My name's Lowell Bergman...  I'm --

                         LIANE'S VOICE (OVER)
               Did you say Berman?

                         LOWELL
               No, Bergman...B.E.R.G.M.A.N....  I'm a
               producer with "60 Minutes"...

                         LIANE'S VOICE (OVER)
               "60 Minutes"?

                         LOWELL
               Yeah.

                         LIANE'S VOICE (OVER)
               "60 Minutes," the television show?

                         LOWELL
               Yes.

     Lowell waits for some moments, and...

     INT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - DAY

                        LIANE
                   (on phone)
               He doesn't want to talk to you.

     EXT./INT. BERKELEY CAFE - DAY

                         LOWELL
               How does he know he doesn't want to talk
               to me?  He doesn't know what I'm calling
               him about...

                         LIANE'S VOICE (OVER)
               He doesn't care to know.

     And she hangs up.  Lowell's motionless...  And his interest
     piqued, he sets down his cleaning.  He calls back...  The
     phone rings and rings...  A MACHINE picks it up...  Jeffrey
     Wigand's Voice:  "This is the Wigands'...  If you'd like to
     leave a message or send a fax, start now..."

     INT. THE WIGAND HOUSE, JEFFREY'S OFFICE, LOUISVILLE - DAY

     And we see Jeffrey Wigand, sitting at his desk in his office,
     working on his computer, hearing Lowell...

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (on the machine)
               This is Lowell Bergman with "60
               Minutes"...  I'm doing a story on fire
               safety and cigarettes...  I have
               scientific documents from a tobacco
               company, and I could use your help as a
               consultant explaining these documents to
               me...  My number is area code 510-555-
               0199...  I'll be there, at this number,
               in 10 minutes.

     He hangs up.  Jeffrey doesn't react, quietly working on his
     computer.

     INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, BERKELEY - DAY

     Lowell's restless, waiting...  And not getting a call back,
     he tries another tact.  He writes a FAX, "Please call me
     at..."  He writes his number down.  He sends the Fax.  He's
     still.  It's quiet.  And not getting an answer he gets up,
     starting to leave the room.  And suddenly the fax machine
     RINGS...  He turns.  He reads a message emerging from the
     machine..."I can't talk to you..."  He's quiet.  He writes on
     a piece of paper..."Can't talk to me?"  "Won't talk to me?"
     "Don't want to talk to me...?"  As he faxes it back...

     INT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, OFFICE, LOUISVILLE - DAY

     Wigand reading the return fax from Lowell...

     INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, BERKELEY - DAY

     Lowell, waiting...  The fax machine rings again...  He reads
     Jeffrey's answer.  "Can't."  "Won't."  "Don't want to..."
     He's quiet, more than just interested, now.  There's
     something beyond intriguing here.  He turns.  He looks
     through a stack of phone books for something...a nationwide
     800 directory.  He looks through it and dials Wigand's phone
     number again...

                         LOWELL
               If you're curious to meet me...

     INT. WIGANDS' HOUSE, OFFICE, LOUISVILLE - DAY

     Wigand working on his computer...  Lowell's VOICE on his
     answering machine...

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (on machine)
               ...I'm gonna be in the lobby of the
               Seelbach Hotel in Louisville, reading The
               New York Times, tomorrow, at five
               o'clock...

     Lowell clicks off.  And as Wigand sits at his computer,
     giving no indication what he might do...

     INT. THE SEELBACH HOTEL LOBBY, LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY - EARLY
     EVENING

     An old hotel with faded carpets.  Lowell in the lobby reading
     a New York Times, waiting...  And instead of looking up every
     time somebody passes, he looks down at people's shoes.  A
     pair of black wing tips walking by...  A woman's high
     heels...  A pair of men's tasseled loafers.  A lace-up brown.
     A pair of tennis shoes.  A cordovan wing tip.  The pair of
     tasseled loafers walking by again...  And Lowell looks up...

     And the Man in the tasseled loafers, turns away...  It's
     Jeffrey Wigand in a suit and a tie with a Fortune 500,
     corporate-executive bearing...  Lowell crosses to the
     elevators.  Wigand looks around the lobby and follows Lowell
     in, and as the doors close...

     INT. A HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - EARLY EVENING

                         LOWELL (OVER)
               Have you always lived in Louisville?

     Brilliant late afternoon sunlight.  We PULL BACK to see
     Jeffrey, standing by a window, silently looking outside to
     the left...  Lowell, cool, waiting, hands in his pockets, in
     the middle of the large room...

                         WIGAND
               Mr. Bergman?  What did you want me to
               consult about?

     A sudden KNOCK on the door...

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
                   (turns, suspicious)
               Who's that?

                         LOWELL
                   (wry)
               That's room service.  They usually knock
               first.
                   (calls)
               Come on in...  Over here, please.

     Room Service brings in a tray with coffee.  As Lowell signs
     the bill, the Room Service Waiter waiting, looks at Wigand...
     Their eyes meet...  The Waiter looks away.

                         LOWELL (cont'd)
               Thank you.

     And the Waiter leaves...

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
                    (pouring)
               How do you like your coffee?  Black?

                         WIGAND
               Black, black...

     Lowell gives him his cup of coffee.

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
               Look, I really don't have that much
               time...

                         LOWELL
                   (nods)
               Is there anything you want to know about
               me, Mr. Wigand...?

                         WIGAND
               Like what?  Your sign?

     Lowell smiles.

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
               I know what I have to know.

                         LOWELL
               Just so I know you know, when I talk to
               people in confidence, it stays that way.

                         WIGAND
                   (abruptly)
               How did a radical journalist from
               Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS?

     Lowell looks at him, he does his homework...

                         LOWELL
               I still do the tough stories.  "60
               Minutes" reaches a lot of people.

     Wigand's quiet, measuring him.

                         WIGAND
                   (after a beat)
               Let me see the documents...

     Lowell gives him the box of papers...  Wigand sits down, the
     box on his lap, quietly looking through them...flips to a
     different heading, consults a chart...

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
               ...this is a Fire-Safety Product Study
               for Philip Morris.  Burn rates...ignition
               propensity...things of this nature.
                   (after a beat)
               I could very easily explain this to you
               in layman's terms, because it's from
               another company...

     He puts the papers down...

                         WIGAND (cont'd)
               ...but that's as far as I go...

                         LOWELL
               Far as you go where?

                         WIGAND
                   (a beat)
               This issue is a drop in the bucket.  I
               can talk to you about what's in here.
               But I can't talk to you about anything
               else.

     And Lowell knows something else is going on here...

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
                   (meaning Philip Morris
                    documents)
               I signed a confidentiality agreement.  I
               honor agreements...

     A lot more is going on here...  Lowell nods, a good
     reporter...

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
               Doesn't CBS have confidentiality
               agreements, Mr. Bergman?

                         LOWELL
               Between journalists and management, yes,
               I believe they do...but I don't take that
               seriously.
                   (after a beat)
               Where do you work?

                         WIGAND
               Did work.

                         LOWELL
                   (fast)
               Did work.

                         WIGAND
                   (the bottom line)
               How much would I get paid?

                         LOWELL
               That, you have to discuss with CBS
               Business Affairs.  But, for something
               like this, I would say anywhere between
               10, 12 thousand.

     Wigand nods "Okay."

                         WIGAND
               Should I just take the documents now?

                         LOWELL
               If you want to do it.

     He turns to leave...  Lowell gets the door for him...  Wigand
     momentarily slows...

                         WIGAND
               I worked as the head of Research and
               Development for Brown & Williamson
               Tobacco Company.  I was a Corporate Vice
               President.  Mr. Bergman...

     And he goes out the door...  Lowell's still.  Wigand's job
     title resonates.  Lowell turns to the window, casually
     looking into the early evening...and he comes face to face
     with what Wigand was staring at, The Brown & Williamson
     Tobacco Company Headquarters Building, lit up right across
     the street...

     INT. CBS, A SCREENING ROOM - DAY

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (on screen)
               "President Assad of Syria said that
               difficult obstacles remain but that his
               country, quote, 'looks forward to a
               great, long peace with Israel.'"

     TAIL LEADER.  THEN BLACK.  Suddenly lights come on.
     Executive Producer DON HEWITT is suddenly on his feet.  A
     veritable dervish, in constant motion...

                         DON HEWITT
                   (kissing Mike)
               It's a Peabody, Mike.  When you're dead
               and buried, Hezbollah is the one they're
               gonna remember you for...

     Mike, used to him, ignores him, getting up, turning to leave,
     Hewitt on his tail...while...

                         LOWELL
                   (to his Editor)
               ...come in earlier on Mike's Marine
               barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh
               Mussawi...

                         MIKE WALLACE
               You eating with us?

                         LOWELL
               Yeah.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Bring a tie so they'll let us in the
               front door...

     And Lowell gestures for an olive-skinned Woman in her late
     thirties, Lowell's assistant, DEBBIE DELUCA, to join them.
     The eye contact on the way out says there's something
     important he needs to tell her...

     EXT. CBS - DAY

     There's a blast of NOISE.  The City.  Lowell, Wallace,
     Hewitt, Debbie, enter from the CBS lobby, moving through the
     reflections.  Lowell is about to say something to Debbie, but
     BILL FELLING, Evening News' Assignment Editor, coming the
     other way...

                         LOWELL
               Debbie...

                         FELLING
               Hey, Lowell.

     Midstream, fast:

                         LOWELL
               Oh, Bill...  Main Justice is
               investigating a major New York bank.
               Laundering narco dollars out of their
               Mexico City branch.  You want it for the
               Evening News?

                         FELLING
               What about you, you got a crew already?

                         LOWELL
               I'm gonna do a follow-up.

                         FELLING
               Okay.
                   (leaves)

                         LOWELL
               Catch ya' later.

     EXT. 53RD STREET, NEW YORK - DAY

     Lowell, crossing...

                         LOWELL
               Debbie...

     And, now, as they cross Madison...

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
                   (to Debbie; finally)
               I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE
               CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS.  Boundaries
               of their constraint.  Kentucky state law
               about.  I want you to drop everything.

                         DEBBIE DELUCA
                   (cuts in)
               Okay.

     Hewitt stops to buy a newspaper.  He doesn't have change,
     Debbie does.

     EXT. 55TH STREET (WESTBOUND), NEW YORK - DAY

     And Mike, Lowell and Don bang into Michael's restaurant.  We
     SEE them through the glass, being greeted, people shaking
     their hands, escorted by the maitre d' to their table as...

     INT. THE BROWN & WILLIAMSON BUILDING, MAIN LOBBY,
     LOUISVILLE - DAY

     Meanwhile, it's static.  Still, frozen.  Jeffrey sits in the
     RECEPTION AREA of The Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company
     headquarters.  Complimentary cigarettes are arranged on
     tables.  A dark quiet.  The hush of big business.  Standing
     in the background by a wall next to the banks of elevators,
     is an ever-present Man, another one, with an earphone and
     lapel microphone...

                         UNIFORMED SECURITY
                   (to Wigand)
               Mr. Wigand, you can go up now...

     He gets up, crossing to an elevator.

     INT. THOMAS SANDEFUR'S OFFICE, BROWN & WILLIAMSON - DAY

                         THOMAS SANDEFUR
                   (re:  his distraction)
               Sorry.  I'm accepting an award from the
               Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation.  It's
               going to kill the rest of my day.

     THOMAS SANDEFUR is absorbed in spreadsheets of regional sales
     figures.  Dark pouches are under his eyes.  He doesn't look
     up.  He doesn't look healthy.  We're in a luxurious office
     with a view of Louisville.  Jeffrey is waiting in a chair.
     Sandefur is Brown & Williamson's CEO.  Two LAWYERS, their
     briefcases, like weapons, close at hand, sit on a couch.
     Their jackets are off.  They wear expensive shirts.

                         THOMAS SANDEFUR (cont'd)
                   (finishing; looking up at
                    Jeffrey)
               So.  You had a chance to play golf?

     Surprisingly affable, Sandefur prides himself on his
     salesman's sunny manners.  He has a mellifluous Georgia
     accent...

                         THOMAS SANDEFUR (CONT'D)
                   (to the Lawyers)
               Jeff's a premiere golfer...  What are
               you, a two handicap?

                         WIGAND
                   (precise)
               Seven...

                         THOMAS SANDEFUR
                   (to lawyer)
               And, he gets out there and he has five
               strokes on us.  He has more concentration
               than anybody I've ever met.  It's spooky
               how he can concentrate.

                         WIGAND
               I'd rather play than talk about it.
                   (beat)
               What did you want to see me about?  I
               don't like being back here.

     Sandefur smiles, used to him.

                         THOMAS SANDEFUR
               Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind.
               Most people consider what they're
               saying...social skills...  Jeffrey just
               charges right ahead.
                   (smiles, after a beat)
               Now, I know you understood the nature of
               the confidentiality portion of your
               severance agreement with Brown &
               Williamson, Jeff...

                         WIGAND
               Chapter and verse.

                         THOMAS SANDEFUR
                   (nods)
               Yeah, I know you do...
                   (beat)
               You know, I came up through sales.  One
               of the reasons I was a great salesman,
               was I never made a promise I couldn't
               keep.
                   (beat)
               I knew that if I ever broke my promise
               I'd suffer the consequence...

     And there's a warning behind it...

                         WIGAND
                   (contained)
               Is that a threat?

                         THOMAS SANDEFUR
               ...we worked together for, what was it,
               three years...?
               Now, the work we did here is
               confidential, not for public
               scrutiny...any more than are one's family
               matters...

                         WIGAND
                   (quietly)
               You threatening my family, now, too?

                         THOMAS SANDEFUR
               Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.
                   (a beat)
               About the direction of research here, we
               may have had our differences of
               opinion...

                         WIGAND
               "Research..."
                   (smile + scorn)
               You declare, as a badge of honor, you
               don't even know what makes water boil...

                         THOMAS SANDEFUR
               That's why we hire scientists...

                         WIGAND
                   (interrupts, direct)
               Okay.
                   (a beat, honest)
               I don't believe you can maintain
               corporate integrity without
               confidentiality agreements.  I was paid
               well for my work.  The health and welfare
               benefits are good.  The severance package
               is fair.  I have no intention of
               violating my confidentiality agreement
               and disclosing that which I said I
               wouldn't.

                         THOMAS SANDEFUR
               I appreciate all that, Jeff.  But, upon
               reflection...we've decided to expand our
               zone of comfort with you.

     And there's a seriousness that weighs heavily on the room...

                         THOMAS SANDEFUR (CONT'D)
               So we've drafted a supplement to your
               agreement...it broadly defines and
               expands in more detail what is
               "confidential."  Nobody will be able to
               say, "Well, hell's bells, Margaret, I
               didn't know that was a secret..."
                   (beat)
               We're very serious about protecting our
               interests.
                   (a beat)
               We'd like you to sign it.

     And he's acutely aware of the threat behind it...

                         WIGAND
                   (a beat)
               And if I don't?

                         A LAWYER
                   (speaking for Sandefur)
               If we "arrive" at the conclusion you're
               acting in bad faith?  We would terminate,
               right now, payouts under your severance
               package.  You and your family's medical
               benefits.  And initiate litigation
               against you, Mr. Wigand.

                         WIGAND
               Dr. Wigand.

                         A LAWYER
                   (a beat)
               Dr. Wigand...after you've examined the
               document, you will see it is in your own
               best interest and you'll sign it.

     Jeffrey slowly turns to face the attorney.  And we see on his
     face the true nature of this man.

                         WIGAND
               So, what you are saying is:  it isn't
               enough that you fired me.  For no good
               reason!  Now you question my integrity?
               On top of the humiliation of being fired?
               You threaten me?!  You threaten my
               family?!
                   (beat)
               It never crossed my mind not to honor my
               agreement...
                   (turning, to Sandefur)
               But I will tell you, Mr. Sandefur, and
               Brown & Williamson, too...  Fuck me?
                   (a beat)
               Well, fuck you!!

     And with that he gets up, and leaves...  And it's quiet...

                         A LAWYER
               I'm not sure he got the message...

                         THOMAS SANDEFUR
                   (with total confidence)
               Oh, I think he did.

     EXT. A PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE - DAY

     Wigand picks up the phone and dials.

     INT. THE NEW YORK RESTAURANT - DAY

     They've finished lunch.  Wallace and Hewitt are turned to
     talk to Sam Cohn and an older writer as suddenly Lowell's
     cell phone rings.

                         LOWELL
                   (answering)
               Yeah...

                         WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER)
               ...you fucked me!

                         LOWELL
               Who is this?

     EXT. A PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE - DAY

                         WIGAND
                   (crazed)
               ...protect your sources...!  You screwed
               me!  You sold me out!

     INT. THE NEW YORK RESTAURANT - DAY

                         LOWELL
               What are you talking about?  Where are
               you?

     EXT. THE PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE - DAY

                         WIGAND
               Fuck you, too!

     And he slams down the phone.

     INT. THE RESTAURANT, NEW YORK - DAY

     Lowell, holding the dead phone in his hand...

     EXT. A GOLF DRIVING RANGE, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

     We see a brightly lit, golf driving range, empty, the wet
     grass under the lights vibrant, emerald green...  A caged
     cart, with one big yellow headlight, like some kind of
     strange insect, drives across the range, picking up golf
     balls.  And we see Jeffrey hitting golf balls, driving one
     after another, after another...  His swing is powerful,
     angry, a lone golfer, trying to chill out.  He pauses, spent.
     Settling down, he exhales.  Then, he looks down the way...
     And he slows...  He sees in the far distance, spot-lit, one
     other lone golfer, a Stocky Man, incongruously in a suit and
     tie, watching him...  And the Man in the suit right then,
     with great power and a tremendous follow through drives a
     golf ball...  The ball slamming into the steel net.  And the
     lights SUDDENLY go out.  The range closing for the night.
     The "insect" comes to a stop.  And it's quiet, dark.  Jeffrey
     gathers up his clubs.  He crosses, his golf shoes, the metal
     cleats, clicking on the pavement, toward the PARKING LOT.
     And there's the sound of the clicking of golf shoes behind
     him.  He turns.  And the stocky Man in the suit, carrying a
     golf bag walking some distance behind him, staring at him.
     Jeffrey comes to the parking lot.  It's empty.  Just
     Jeffrey's car, and despite all the empty spaces, another car,
     purposely or otherwise, parked right next to his.  He crosses
     to his car, getting in...

     INT. WIGAND'S CAR - NIGHT

     He drops the three clubs in the rear seat and settles behind
     the wheel.  He turns.  And he sees the Man in the suit has
     gotten in the car next to his.  They look at each other.  The
     Man, in no hurry, lights a cigarette, relaxes.  It's
     malevolent as hell.  And Jeffrey, suddenly, grabbing a golf
     club, jumps out of his car...

     EXT. THE PARKING LOT, DRIVING RANGE, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

     Golf club in hand at the driver side window...

                         WIGAND
                   (motioning with the club,
                    threatening)
               Stay away from me!  You stay away from
               me!

     The Man starts his car, and drives off nonplussed.  It's
     still.  And as Jeffrey with the golf club stands in the empty
     parking lot, not knowing what's threatening him, something
     real, something imaginary...

     EXT. THE WIGAND HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - WIDE SHOT: WIGANDS'
     HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

     A violent rain's falling.  And we see Jeffrey coming out of
     the house holding an umbrella over his little Girls.  They
     start towards the car.  There's the sound of a car door
     shutting.  Liane, carrying lunch boxes, comes after them...

                         LIANE
               Jeffrey, you forgot their lunches --

     She slows, seeing someone.  Jeffrey turns:  it's Lowell.
     He's surprised.

                         LOWELL
               Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?

                         WIGAND
                   (to the girls, protectively)
               Jump in, quick, c'mon...

                         LOWELL
               I'm Lowell Bergman.  We spoke on the
               phone, remember?

     The Girls climb in the car.  Lowell crosses behind the Audi
     around the far side.

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
               C'mere.  I want to talk to you.

                         WIGAND
               Good.  I want to talk to you.

     Jeff closes the door on his daughters and joins Lowell around
     the far side of the car.

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
                   (confronting him)
               What do...

                         LOWELL
                   (running over)
               I did not burn you.  I did not give you
               up to anyone!

                         WIGAND
                   (continuing)
               This is my house...  In front of my wife,
               my kids?!  What business do we have?

                         LOWELL
               To straighten something out with you.
               Right here.  Right now.

                         WIGAND
               So, you didn't mention my name?  You
               haven't talked to anybody about me?

                         LOWELL
               Why am I gonna mention your name?

                         WIGAND
               How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke
               to you...?

                         LOWELL
               How the hell do I know about Brown &
               Williamson?

                         WIGAND
               It happened after I talked to you.  I do
               not like coincidences!

                         LOWELL
               And I don't like paranoid accusations!
               I'm a journalist.  Think.  Use your head.
               How do I operate as a journalist by
               screwing the people who could provide me
               with information before they provided me
               with it?

                         WIGAND
                   (skeptical)
               You came all the way down here to tell me
               that?

                         LOWELL
               No.  I did not.  Big Tobacco is a big
               story.  And you got something important
               to say.  I can tell.
                   (a beat, personal)
               But, yes.  I did.
               I came all the way down here to tell you:
               story, no story, fuck your story, I don't
               burn people.

     It starts to rain harder.  They look at each other.  Jeffrey,
     without saying a word, gets in the Car.  He backs out.
     Lowell, left standing in the driveway with Liane in the rain.
     Liane goes back into the house.  And Lowell starts back
     across the street to his car.  There's a sound.  He turns.
     Jeffrey's car, having gone around the corner, has come back
     and stopped in the street.

                         WIGAND
                   (after a beat)
               Ride with me while I take the girls to
               school...

     Lowell hesitates, then gets into the car in the back seat.

     INT. WIGAND'S CAR - MORNING

     They drive away.  Lowell, incongruously sitting in the back
     seat with Barbara.  Jeffrey and Deborah in the front seat.
     And it's quiet, just the sound of the wipers on the window.
     And as Lowell rides with them...

     EXT. A RIVERSIDE PARKING LOT IN LOUISVILLE - WIDE REAR SHOT
     - MORNING

     We see the Car's parked in a weed-strewn empty lot.  Rain,
     pounding on it and the surface of the river beyond...

                         WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER)
               ...and my little girl has acute asthma...
               Deborah.  My eldest daughter.

     INT. WIGAND'S CAR, LOUISVILLE - REAR TWO SHOT - MORNING

     The Girls are gone.  We enter mid-scene.  Lowell's still in
     the back seat...

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
               And, I'm unemployed.  So I have to
               protect my medical coverage.
                   (the bottom line; turning to
                    look at Lowell in the rear
                    seat)
               ...so I left them a message this morning.
               Their expanded confidentiality agreement?
               I will sign it.

                         LOWELL
               They're afraid of you, aren't they?

                         WIGAND
               They should be.

     The sound of the rain...

                         LOWELL
                   (after a beat, trying to make
                    it easier for him)
               Talk to me outside the zone of your
               agreement?

                         WIGAND
                   (guarded)
               Like what?

                         LOWELL
               Like where'd you work before Brown &
               Williamson?

                         WIGAND
                   (a beat)
               Johnson & Johnson.  Union Carbide in
               Japan.  I was general manager and
               director of new products.  I speak
               Japanese.  I was a director of corporate
               development at Pfizer.  All health-
               related.
                   (wry)
               What else?  Outside the "zone"...?

                         LOWELL
               I don't know...you think the Knicks are
               gonna make it through the semi-finals?

     Wigand smiles...as their eyes meet in the rear view mirror.
     A subtle connection...  It passes...

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. WIGAND'S CAR - WIDE FRONTAL - DAY

     Jeff's car in the field, the giant Colgate-Palmolive clock
     behind.  The rain stopped.  Steam rises from the weed strewn
     empty lot.  Lowell's in the front seat.  And we get the
     feeling they've been talking for hours...

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
               Just give me an example...

                         WIGAND
               For example.  James Burke, the CEO of
               Johnson & Johnson...when he found out
               that some lunatic had put poison in
               Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the
               FDA...  He didn't even wait for the FDA
               to tell him.  He just pulled Tylenol off
               every shelf of every store right across
               America.  Instantly.  And then he
               developed the safety cap...  Because,
               look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a
               great businessman, right?  But he's also
               a man of science.  He's not going to
               allow his company...to put on the
               shelf...a product that might hurt people.
                   (sarcastic)
               Not like the Seven Dwarfs...

                         LOWELL
               Seven dwarfs?

                         WIGAND
               The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco...they got
               up in front of Congress that time...it
               was on television...

                         LOWELL
               ...and swore under oath that they know
               nothing about addiction, disease...

                         WIGAND
               It was on C-SPAN.  Yeah.

                         LOWELL
               Okay, so, here you are...you go to work
               for tobacco.
                   (after beat)
               You come from corporate cultures where
               research, really, creative thinking,
               these are core values.  You go to
               tobacco...  Tobacco is a sales culture.
               Market and sell enormous volume.  Go to a
               lot of golf tournaments.  The hell with
               everything else.
                   (beat)
               What are you doing?  Why are you working
               for "tobacco" in the first place?

                         WIGAND
                   (deadly honest)
               I can't talk about it.  The work I was
               supposed to do...might have had some
               positive effect.  I don't know...it could
               have been beneficial.
                   (bitterness there)
               Mostly, I got paid a lot.  I took the
               money.  My wife was happy.  My kids had
               good medical.  Good schools.  Got a
               great house.
                   (simply)
               I mean, what the hell is wrong with
               that...?

     He looks at Lowell, as if needing validation...

                         LOWELL
               Nothing's wrong with that.  That's it;
               you're making money...you're providing
               for your family?  What could be wrong
               with that?

     It's quiet.  After some moments...

                         WIGAND
               I've always thought of myself...as a man
               of science.  That's what's wrong with it.

                         LOWELL
               Then...you're in a state of conflict,
               Jeff.

     Jeffrey doesn't say anything.

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
               Because, look, here's how it lays out: if
               you got vital, insider stuff the American
               people for their welfare really do need
               to know...and you feel impelled to
               disclose it and violate your agreement in
               doing so, that's one thing.  On the other
               hand, if you want to honor this
               agreement, then that's simple.  You do
               so.  You say nothing.  You do nothing.
               There's only one guy who can figure that
               out for you.  And that's you.  All by
               yourself.

     Lowell's evenhanded...is it too evenhanded?  As Wigand
     contemplates the edge he's standing on, they're quiet.  Then
     Wigand sees the time...

                         WIGAND
               I've got to go pick up the girls.  They
               only had half a day...

     Lowell nods.  Jeffrey starts the car.  The windshield wipers
     screech on a dry window.  Their eyes meet.  As they drive
     off...we HOLD on the Colgate-Palmolive Clock.

     INT. A KITCHEN AREA, CBS OFFICES, NEW YORK - DAY

     We've entered mid-scene...  A monitor on a cart plays a 1/2-
     inch VCR of a C-SPAN broadcast.  Seven CEOs of Big Tobacco...
     in front of a bas relief of the American eagle.  Each in turn
     swears nicotine is not addictive or he doesn't know anything
     about health risks, they're not sure, maybe, maybe not,
     etc....

                         LOWELL (OVER)
               He referred to this...the Seven Dwarfs...

                         MIKE WALLACE (OVER)
               What "Seven Dwarfs?"

                         LOWELL (OVER)
               The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... Referred
               to this...  Said they should be afraid of
               him...  I assume, afraid of what he could
               reveal.
                   (to Staff Lawyers)
               Now, you tell me.  What does this guy
               have to say that threatens these people?

     And, now, we see Lowell, Mike Wallace and Debbie DeLuca with
     two staff Lawyers, MARK STERN and JOHN HARRIS, sitting around
     a workstation used as an improvised eating area.

     Beyond them are the "60 MINUTES" offices, workstations, piles
     of material, television monitors hanging from the ceiling,
     all tuned to CBS programming...

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for
               you"...

                         LOWELL
               Hardly new news.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               No shit.

                         LOWELL
               What's this?

                         MARK STERN
                   (re:  video)
               What that is is tobacco's standard
               defense.  It's the "we don't know"
               litany:  "Addiction?  We believe not.
               Disease?  We don't know.  We take a bunch
               of leaves, roll 'em together.  You smoke
               'em.  After that?  You're on your own.
               We don't know."
                   (beat)
               So...tells me nothing.
                   (beat)
               Besides, you'll never get what he's got.

                         LOWELL
               Why not?

                         JOHN HARRIS
               Because of this guy's confidentiality
               agreement, he is never gonna be able to
               talk to you.

                         LOWELL
               That's not good enough.  This guy is the
               top scientist in the number three tobacco
               company in America.  He's a corporate
               officer.  You never get whistle-blowers
               from Fortune 500 companies.  This guy is
               the ultimate insider.  He's got something
               to say; he wants to say it; I want it on
               "60 Minutes."

                         JOHN HARRIS
               Doesn't matter what he wants.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Am I missing something here?

                         JOHN HARRIS
               What do you mean, Mike?

                         MIKE WALLACE
               He's got a corporate secrecy agreement?
               Give me a break.  This is a public-health
               issue, like an unsafe airframe on a
               passenger jet or...some company dumping
               cyanide into the East River.  Issues like
               that?  He can talk, we can air it.
               They've got no right to hide behind a
               corporate agreement.
                   (re:  his coffee)
               Pass the milk...

               They don't need the right.  They've got

               These clowns have never...I mean ever...

                         JOHN HARRIS
               Not even once...

                         MARK STERN
               ...not even with hundreds of thousands
               dying each year from an illness related
               to their product...have ever lost a

               they'll issue gag orders, sue for breach,
               anticipatory breach, enjoin him, you, us,

               Tie him up in litigation for ten of
               fifteen years.  I'm telling you, they bat
               a thousand.  Every time.  He knows that.
               That's why he's not gonna talk to you...

     Lowell's been quiet, thinking about something else...  Now...

                         LOWELL
               Okay, let's look through the looking
               glass the other way...

                         MIKE WALLACE
               What do you mean?

                         LOWELL
               We got a guy...who wants to talk but he's
               constrained.
                   (beat)
               What if he were "compelled"?

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (eating)
               Oh, torture?  Great ratings.

                         MARK STERN
               What do you mean compelled?

                         LOWELL
                   (seriously)
               I mean compelled by a Justice Department,
               state courts, be a witness.  That would
               cut through any confidentiality
               agreement, wouldn't it?

                         MARK STERN
               Yeah...

                         DEBBIE DELUCA
               What does that do?

                         LOWELL
               What do you mean, what's it do?

                         DEBBIE DELUCA
               What I mean is, like, how does it cut
               through the confidentiality agreement?

                         LOWELL
               Because he has to reveal it in a court of
               law.  It's on record, it's out.  It's no
               secret anymore.  So how can they restrain
               his speech or retaliate?  It's out in the
               world...

                         MARK STERN
                   (nods)
               If you could engineer it into the court
               record, you might have something.  They
               would have a helluva time trying to
               restrain his speech then, wouldn't they?

     Pause.

                         JOHN HARRIS
                   (still skeptical)
               Yeah, but what venue?  And where does he
               get - does he have killer attorneys?

                         LOWELL
               I don't think he's got any attorneys.

                         MARK STERN
               He's gonna need attorneys who aren't
               afraid of risking years of litigation.
               And millions of dollars of their own
               dough in legal costs...

                         LOWELL
               What do you say, Mike?  What do you
               think?

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (pause)
               Even if he gets the defense team, will he
               go for it?

     INT. A HIGH SCHOOL CAFETERIA, LOUISVILLE - DAY

                         MRS. WATSON
               ...you're awfully overqualified, Dr.
               Wigand.

     The aftermath of a high school lunch.  Tables, covered with
     litter, as far as the eye can see.  And we see Jeffrey
     sitting with a formidable Black Woman in her mid-fifties, the
     High School Principal, CYNTHIA WATSON, drinking cups of
     coffee...

                         WIGAND
                   (after a beat, awkward)
               I'm trying to...start a new career...  I
               believe I could be a good teacher...

     She's quiet.  She senses this applicant has a lot on his
     mind.

                         MRS. WATSON
               Let me give it some thought...

                         WIGAND
                   (selling)
               ...and not a lot of companies in the
               health-care field hire ex-tobacco
               scientists.

     She nods, studying him.  They get up.

     INT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - DAY

     The house is nearly empty.  Liane, arms folded across her
     chest, is quietly standing in the empty living room.  Jeffrey
     comes down the stairs...

                         WIGAND
               That's it...

     And it's quiet.  And Liane holds herself, overcome...

                         LIANE
                   (beat)
               That's where our babies were born...
               Debbie took her first steps, right
               there...in the grass.

     And they're quiet.

                         LIANE (CONT'D)
               I didn't plan on this...

     Liane looks at him, afraid.  And as he moves to hold her.

                         WIGAND
               Hey, hey, hey, c'mon.  C'mon.  We can
               make this work for us.  Okay?  It's
               just...it's a smaller scale.
               Simpler...easier...more time.  More time
               together.  More time with the kids.  More
               time for us, okay?  It's just...  Can you
               imagine me coming home from some job
               feeling good at the end of the day?  This
               is gonna be better.  This is gonna be
               better.

     And instead of this downturn turning them against each other,
     it brings them closer together.  And as they stand in the
     empty house...

     INT. THE WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE - DAY

     We see unpacked boxes in the small 1970's kitchen.  Country-
     western music is playing on a radio.  And we see Liane busily
     putting things away in a cabinet.  And, then, stops and looks
     out the window.  She tightens a knob on a cabinet.  There's a
     moment of domestic peace for her as she sees...

     EXT. THE WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, THE BACKYARD - DAY

     Jeffrey with the Girls in a part of the backyard, kneeling in
     the dirt, planting a vegetable garden, putting in some small
     tomato trellises.  We see the house, now.  It's a small, one
     story.  Deborah sees her mom and waves.  It's an image from
     the 1950's post-war boom.  Liane waves back from behind the
     pane of glass...

     INT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

     Jeffrey's asleep on his side next to Liane, her back to him.
     His arm is draped over her, protectively.  There's a sound.
     He turns.  And he sees Barbara in her nightgown, standing in
     the doorway...

                         WIGAND
               Hey, baby.  What's wrong?

                         BARBARA
                   (terrified, whispers)
               What's that outside, Daddy?

                         WIGAND
               Did you see somebody or did you hear
               them?

                         BARBARA
               I heard them.

                         WIGAND
               Where?

                         BARBARA
               In the backyard.

     Fast, soundlessly, he's out of bed into old moccasins and
     trousers...

     INT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, BASEMENT - LATE NIGHT

     Jeffrey goes into a corner of the basement, around the corner
     from the furnace, where his "office" is now.  Unpacked boxes
     are on the floor.  He fumbles with the combination lock on a
     small gun safe, lifts the lid, taking out a hand gun.
     Barbara followed him.

                         WIGAND
               Sit at Daddy's desk, okay?  Why don't you
               just sit up at the desk.  Get out some
               paper and draw me a picture, okay?  What
               are you gonna draw me, baby?  An animal,
               something like that?  You stay down here
               until Daddy gets back...alright, Barbara?
               You stay down here.

     He keeps it hidden from Barbara.  He goes up the stairs.

     EXT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BACKYARD - LATE NIGHT

     It's still.  He steps further out onto the lawn with its dark
     shrubs and small tree in the corner.

     INT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BASEMENT - LATE NIGHT

     Meanwhile, Barbara in the basement, starts as the water
     heater comes on, scaring her.  She goes up the stairs to
     follow after her father...

     EXT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BACKYARD - LATE NIGHT

     Meanwhile, Jeffrey has crossed towards the darker back
     corners.  Sudden rustling.  He spins, gun ready.  And the
     yellow eyes of a RACCOON stare at him.

                         WIGAND
                   (to himself)
               You almost got your damn head blown
               off...

     The raccoon defiantly bares its teeth.

     Jeffrey starts to go...but he sees something and stops...

     Meanwhile, Barbara has come to the sliding glass door...

     Jeffrey sees one of the tomato trellises is crushed, stepped
     on...and in the vegetable garden's earth, are distinct,
     fresh, deep FOOTPRINTS...

                         BARBARA'S VOICE (OVER)
               Daddy...

     Wigand steps between her and the garden, hiding it...
     EXTREMELY CLOSE ON JEFFREY, as he covers, trying to keep from
     his daughter the invasion, trying to control his emotions...

                         WIGAND
                   (reassuring her)
               It's just a raccoon, baby...nothing.

     He crosses to her, putting his arm, around her, walking her
     back inside...

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
               They're nocturnal.  You know what that
               means?  That means that they only come
               out at nighttime.

     He locks the sliding glass door, takes a last look outside.

     INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE IN BERKELEY - LATE AT NIGHT

     The Phone suddenly RINGS.  Lowell asleep, alone...  He gets
     it...

                         LOWELL
                   (sleepy)
               Yeah...

     INT. WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, HALLWAY - LATE AT NIGHT

     It's dark, save a light from the living room.  Liane, in bed,
     seemingly sleeping.  And we see Jeffrey, just outside their
     door in the foyer, sitting on the floor against a curved
     wall, a drink at his side on the telephone...  A man with no
     one to talk to...

                         WIGAND
                   (after a beat)
               Lowell...  Jeffrey Wigand...

     INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BERKELEY - LATE AT NIGHT

     Lowell sits up...

                         WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER)
               Is it too late?

                         LOWELL
               No.  No, it's okay...  How's - how's the
               new place?

     INT. THE WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT

                         WIGAND
               The new place?  New.

     INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BERKELEY - LATE AT NIGHT

                         LOWELL
                   (intuiting)
               You okay?

                         WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER)
               Sure.

     Lowell knows he isn't...

                         LOWELL
               You know, I was thinking of calling you
               tomorrow, anyway.
                   (beat)
               How are your kids handling the new house?

     INT. WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - LATE AT NIGHT

                         WIGAND
               Good.
                   (beat)
               You have kids?

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
               We have a couple.  One's hers, one's
               mine.  Everybody uses a different name.
                   (wry)
               Modern marriage.
                   (beat)
               How's Liane?

                         WIGAND
               She's okay.

     He looks at Liane for beat.  We SEE his POV in medium shot.
     Then he moves and sits on the floor in the living room.

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
               Hold on a minute, Lowell...
                   (after a beat)
               ...somebody...may be following me.  I
               don't know.  They came on the property...

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
               What do you mean followed you?  Did you
               call the police?

                         WIGAND
               I don't want to be paranoid...  I mean,
               maybe it's a game.  Some kind of mind
               game.

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
               Well, what do you really think, though?

                         WIGAND
               I don't know what the fuck I really
               think!  Are they doing it?  Is some crank
               doing it?  Are they doing it to make me
               feel paranoid?  Are they doing it for
               real and don't give a shit what I think?
               I don't know!  I don't fucking know.

     And it's quiet again.

     INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BERKELEY - LATE AT NIGHT

     Lowell sitting in bed on the phone, alarmed, sharing Wigand's
     fears.

                         LOWELL
               Jeffrey, describe for me in detail what
               happened.

     INT. WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - LATE NIGHT

     And Jeffrey's emotions are back in check as...

                         WIGAND
               Well, no, look...I mean, there was a
               footprint.  Forget it.  It's probably not
               important at all.
                   (beat)
               You know, I got a job now.  I'm teaching
               high school. Japanese and Chemistry.
                   (beat)
               So, what were you calling about?

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
               You called me.

     He takes another drink...

                         WIGAND
               No, you said you were going to call me
               tomorrow.  So, what about?

                         LOWELL
                   (after a beat)
               Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did...I wanted to
               talk to you.  I wanted to hook up and
               talk to you.  About what we were talking
               about in your car.

                         WIGAND
               ...okay.

                         LOWELL
                   (after a beat)
               Makes you feel good?  Putting what you
               know to use?

     Jeffrey's impressed by Lowell's perceptivity...

                         WIGAND
               How'd you know that, Lowell?

                         LOWELL
               It's obvious, isn't it?

     He looks at Liane in the next room, asleep.

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
               Hello.  You there

                         WIGAND
               Yeah...  Look, thanks for talking.  I'm
               sorry I woke you up.

                         LOWELL
               It's okay.

     Jeffrey hesitates, holding the phone, then he hangs up...but
     the phone RINGS right away.

                         WIGAND
               Lowell...?

     But there's thick silence.

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
               Who is this?  Do not call here!  Do
               not...

     They hang up.  And he realizes he's talking to a DIAL TONE.
     He hangs up.  And as he sits in the patch of light from a
     street lamp, the gun in his hand on his lap, to be up all
     night guarding his family...

     INT.  THEIR BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

     And past Liane's sleeping form down the hall into the living
     room is her husband, his back to her, sitting in the
     trapezoid of light.  And as we DOLLY along her side, we come
     upon her face and discover she's been up all along and her
     eyes are pressed shut, her hands over her ears...her reaction
     to his raging on the phone.  She's far from "OKAY."

     INT. A JAPANESE RESTAURANT, WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

     And we see Lowell and Wigand sitting in their stocking feet
     at a traditional Japanese table in a private screened room...
     A traditionally-dressed Japanese Waitress waiting to take
     their order...  Wigand conversing with her in Japanese...

     The Waitress formally nods, and leaves...

                         LOWELL
               What did you get us?

                         WIGAND
               Tempura...

     And Wigand drinks some more saki.

                         WIGAND (cont'd)
               The internet said you did graduate work
               in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla
               with Professor...Marcus?

                         LOWELL
               Marcuse.  Yeah.  He was my mentor.  He
               had a major influence on the New Left in
               the late '60s...and on me, personally.

                         WIGAND
               Next to your father?

                         LOWELL
               My father?  What the hell's that got to
               do with my father?

                         WIGAND
               Is that why you became a journalist?
               Then you get to ask all the questions?

                         LOWELL
               You charge by the hour?

                         WIGAND
               My father was a mechanical
               engineer...most ingenious man I ever
               knew.

                         LOWELL
               Well, my father left us when I was five-
               years old.  He was not the most ingenious
               man I ever knew...  Let's get back to
               Brown & Williamson.  If you decide to go
               on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything
               about why you got fired.

                         WIGAND
               Why?

                         LOWELL
               They're gonna dig up stuff from your
               past, they're gonna throw it at you.  I
               got to know what they're gonna throw.
               You understand?

                         WIGAND
                   (concedes)
               I drink.  A couple of occasions more than
               I should have.
                   (thinks)
               I was cited for shoplifting once.  But it
               was a mistake...
                   (hesitant, after a beat)
               I pushed Liane one time.  We were both
               stressed out because of the pressure.
               She went to her mother's.
                   (out of the blue)
               I got fired because when I get angry I
               have difficulty censoring myself.  And I
               don't like to be pushed around!

                         LOWELL
               I'm not pushing you around!
                   (after a beat)
               I'm asking you questions.

                         WIGAND
               I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I?  I
               could be anything.  Right?  Anything
               worth putting on between commercials...

                         LOWELL
                   (honest)
               ...to a network, probably, we're all
               commodities.
                   (beat)
               To me?  You are not a commodity.  What
               you are is important.

     And he's begun to consciously or unconsciously "sell"...

                         LOWELL (cont'd)
               You go public and thirty-million people
               hear what you got to say, nothing, I mean
               nothing, will ever be the same again.

     Wigand doesn't react.

                         LOWELL (cont'd)
               You believe that?

                         WIGAND
                   (skeptical)
               No.

                         LOWELL
               You should.  Because when you're done, a
               judgment is going to go down in the court
               of public opinion, my friend.  And that's
               the power you have.

                         WIGAND
               You believe that?

                         LOWELL
               I believe that?  Yes, I believe that.

                         WIGAND
               You believe that because you get
               information out to people...something
               happens?

                         LOWELL
               Yes.

                         WIGAND
               Maybe that's just what you've been
               telling yourself all these years to
               justify having a good job?  Having
               status?  And maybe for the audience, it's
               just voyeurism?  Something to do on a
               Sunday night.  And maybe it won't change
               a fucking thing.  And people like myself
               and my family are left hung out to dry.
               Used up!  Broke, alone!

                         LOWELL
               Are you talking to me or did somebody
               else just walk in here?!  I never
               abandoned a source!

                         WIGAND
               I don't think you really understand --

                         LOWELL
                   (running over)
               No, don't evade a choice you gotta make
               be questioning my reputation or "60
               Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!

                         WIGAND
               I have to put my family's welfare on the
               line here, my friend!  And what are you
               puttin' up?  You're puttin' up words!

                         LOWELL
               Words!  While you've been dickin' around
               at fucking company golf tournaments, I
               been out in the world, giving my word and
               backing it up with action.

     Lowell is getting very close, in spite of the value of
     Wigand, to telling Jeff to take his story and stick it up his
     ass.

                         LOWELL (cont'd)
               Now, are you going to go do this
               thing, or not?

     Wigand abruptly rises...

                         WIGAND
                   (surprisingly mild)
               I said I'd call the kids before they went
               to bed.  Onisa...

     And turning, he crosses the restaurant.  And that's where it
     hangs.

     INT. A CBS EDITING SUITE, NEW YORK - DAY

     And we see we're watching footage in an on-line editing bay
     from what we will learn is Lowell's "N.O.P.D. Blue" on police
     corruption in New Orleans.

     Lowell, TONY BALDO (his editor), Debbie and an intense YOUNG
     MAN wearing glasses, an Intern, looking at the cut.  All the
     police are on horseback, lots of cops on horses.
     Lowell is waiting for a call to go through...

                         LOWELL
               The stringer was supposed to be shooting
               B-roll on street cops in New Orleans.
               What's with all the horses?

                         TONY BALDO
               Camera guy's got a thing about mounted
               police.

                         LOWELL
                   (re:  horses)
               Don't any of these guys ride in cars or
               walk?

                         TONY BALDO
               How long did he stay on this?

                         LOWELL
               What was he seeing?

                         DEBBIE DELUCA
                   (into phone)
               Yes, hello...  I'm trying to reach Mr.
               Richard Scruggs...

     INT. A LEAR JET - DAY

     And we see the PILOT, a fit-looking, unassuming man, wearing
     aviator glasses, in his late forties.  A heavyset Man in his
     forties, riding up in the co-pilot's seat we'll come to know
     as RON MOTLEY.  The Pilot's on a headset...  He has a
     distinctive Southern accent...

                         THE PILOT
               This is Richard Scruggs...

                         DEBBIE DELUCA
               Could you hold on one second, please?
                   (to Lowell)
               Lowell, I got him on the phone.

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
               Hello, I'm Lowell Bergman.

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
               Hold on...  Mobile approach...this is

               Mr. Bergman?

                         LOWELL
               Yes, I'm right here.  Could you call me
               back on a hard line?

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
               Alright.

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
               I'll call you then.

     INT. A LOUNGE, PRIVATE AVIATION TERMINAL - DAY

     Through the window, we see Scruggs' plane being refueled
     while Scruggs and Motley in a run-down lounge are talking on
     a SPEAKER PHONE with Lowell.  They've taken over the
     Secretary's office for privacy.

                         LOWELL
                   (re:  footage)
               What do we do with that?

     The phone rings.

                         DEBBIE DELUCA
               I don't know.

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS' VOICE (OVER)
               Richard Scruggs...

                         LOWELL
               ...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on
               behalf of the State of Mississippi, did
               you not?

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
                   (nods)
               That's right...

                         LOWELL
                   (after a beat)
               Well, I'm working with someone, now, who
               was the former head of research at Brown
               & Williamson, a former corporate officer
               there.

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
               What's your interest in this, Mr.
               Bergman?

                         LOWELL
               Well, he may tape an interview with us.
               And, we believe if his testimony showed
               up in a court record first, it would free
               him up from his confidentiality agreement
               and give him some protection.

                         MOTLEY
               It could work.  If it's public record,
               it's public record.

                         LOWELL
               Yeah, and he's going to need legal
               representation.

                         MOTLEY
               He sure as hell will.

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
                   (a beat)
               Has he decided to go public?  Because
               let me tell you, we've been doing this
               for three years now, and we've worked
               with a lot of corporate cases involving
               whistle-blowers, so we know...  Big
               Tobacco will do everything in their power
               to stop him.  So, is your man truly
               committed?

                         LOWELL
               Well, actually, no.  Well, he's on the
               fence.  That's the point.

     Scruggs and Motley exchange a look...  Motley shrugs...

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
               Well, we'd certainly be interested in
               making his acquaintance, but without
               knowing what he's going to do...

                         LOWELL
               Well, would you want him to call you?
               Or, you want to call him?  How do you
               want to do it?

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
                   (no nonsense)
               It would be better if he called us.

                         LOWELL
               Yeah.

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
               Alright?

                         LOWELL
               Okay.  Thank you.

     At this moment, these two attorneys are unsold on the
     prospect of Jeffrey Wigand.  Scruggs disconnects.

     INT. THE WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, KITCHEN - TWILIGHT

     Liane cooking dinner, making pasta.  Ingredients, diced
     tomato, basil, are neatly ordered.  She's waiting for water
     to boil.  The kids are doing homework on the round table in
     the kitchenette.  It's an idle moment.  She's dazed-out
     watching them.

                         DEBORAH

     And now she hears from the basement the BELL RING on
     Jeffrey's computer.  It's a tiny bell, incessant...  She
     crosses to the basement stairs.

                         LIANE
               I'm going to have to go downstairs.

     INT. WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, BASEMENT OFFICE - NIGHT

     Liane down the stairs, approaching Jeffrey's computer.  And
     she SEES an incoming E-mail icon - a large letter with wings -
     flying repetitively across the screen.

     The bell RINGING is louder.  She calls-up the E-mail...  On
     the screen in large RED letters:

               WE WILL KILL YOU.  WE WILL KILL ALL OF
               YOU.  SHUT THE FUCK UP.

     And now Liane is shouting and running up the stairs and...

                         LIANE
               Debbie, Barbara...  Debbie!

     EXT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - EVENING

     Jeffrey, having arrived home from work, pulls the mail out of
     the mailbox, now stands, frozen, staring at something...  And
     he sees, standing upright in the back of the mail box, like a
     monument of threat, a single hollow point .38 CALIBER BULLET.
     He freezes...  And simultaneously...

     Liane and the Girls are running toward him...like in a bad
     fucking dream.  He's looking at them.  Liane is saying
     something about E-mail, but his slow-motion attention is
     still arrested by the statuesque bullet.  As they close on
     him...

     EXT. NEW ORLEANS, THE FRENCH QUARTER - NIGHT

     And we see Lowell lit by FLASHING POLICE LIGHTS.  We're at a
     crime scene.  Uniformed cops on horseback.  Just arrived, the
     Cameraman's unloading his gear, preparing to shoot B-roll.

                         LOWELL
               What happened?

                         COP
               Dispatch received a call of shots fired
               in the area.  Uniforms arrived on the
               scene and found this white male subject
               shot to death.

                         LOWELL
               Was it gang related?

                         COP
               There's no indication as far as a tag or
               an advertisement...

     Police moving around as Lowell's cell phone RINGS...

                         LOWELL
                   (answering)
               Excuse me.  Yeah...

     INT. WIGANDS' HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT

                         WIGAND
               They're terrorizing us.  Death threats?!
               To my family?  My kids?!

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
               What are you talking about?

                         WIGAND
               Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.

                         LOWELL
               Jeff, call the FBI right away...

                         WIGAND
               They do this with impunity!

                         LOWELL
               Jeff...

                         WIGAND
               They get to go home at night.  What does
               it cost these people to do this to us?
               Nothing?!  My girls are crying, so fuck
               them!  I want to tape!  I'm done thinking
               about it.

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (frustrated)
               I heard you.  But I got to arrange a
               legal defense first.  I got to get you to
               testify in court, get it on public
               record.

                         WIGAND
                   (cuts in)
               Then hold it off the air until you got
               that.  But I want to go to New York.
               And I want to go on the record.  Right
               now!

                         LOWELL
               Good.  But Jeff...

                         WIGAND
               I'll call them, Lowell.

     INT. WIGAND'S HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

     And two older, local FBI AGENTS #1 and #2 are sitting with
     Jeffrey in his living room...

                         FBI AGENT #2
               Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?

                         WIGAND
               Yes, I'm afraid I did.

                         FBI AGENT #1
               We won't be able to lift usable prints.

                         FBI AGENT #2
               Do you own a gun, Mr. Wigand?

                         WIGAND
               A gun?  Yes.

                         FBI AGENT #2
               What caliber is your gun?

                         WIGAND
               What caliber is my gun?

                         FBI AGENT #2
               Yes, sir.  What caliber is your gun?

                         WIGAND
                   (a dawning realization)
               What does that have to do with the price
               of tea in China?

     Now one of the kids is crying, Liane trying to calm her,
     takes her out of the room.

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
                   (a beat, realizing)
               You think I put that bullet in the
               mailbox myself...?

                         FBI AGENT #2
               If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...

     And he gets up...  They follow him into the bedroom.  He
     unlocks the side drawer on his night stand, taking out a gun,
     giving it to one of the Agents.

                         FBI AGENT #1
               Why do you keep this gun?

                         WIGAND
               I don't think it's unconstitutional yet
               to own a gun.  I'm a target shooter.

                         FBI AGENT #2
               That bullet was for a .38 caliber.  Do
               you own a .38?

                         WIGAND
               Yes, I do.  A .38 Target Master.  In my
               gun safe downstairs.  A .45 Gold Cup.  A
               .22 target pistol.  So what?

                         FBI AGENT #2
                   (after a beat)
               Do you have a history of emotional
               problems, Mr. Wigand?

                         WIGAND
               Yes.  Yes, I do.
                   (beat)
               Yes, I get extremely emotional when
               assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!

     And we hear Liane's voice from downstairs...

                         LIANE'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (upset)
               I didn't tell you that so you could just
               pick it up and take it away.  Jeffrey!

     And we see Liane following FBI Agent #3, coming up the stairs
     from the basement, and the Agent is carrying Jeffrey's
     computer...

                         WIGAND
               What's going on?

                         LIANE
               I told him that you had an E-mail death
               threat that said if you didn't shut the
               "F" up, they were going to kill you...

     Agent #3 starts out of the house with the computer followed
     by #2.  Jeffrey runs out after them.

     EXT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE - NIGHT

                         WIGAND
                   (outraged)
               You can't take that...  It's personal
               property...!

                         FBI AGENT #2 (OR #3)
               We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand.
               There's been a death threat.

                         WIGAND
                   (after him)
               ...my files!  Personal correspondence...

     Agent #3 ignores him, putting the computer in the trunk of
     their car.  And FBI Agent #1, the .38 bullet in a baggie,
     comes out of the house.

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
               ...letters to my brother...my will.

     His shoes slip on the grass and he falls.  And the FBI are
     getting into their car.  And NEIGHBORS have come out,
     watching them.  Liane and the girls, standing halfway down
     the front lawn, the neighbors looking at them.  She and
     Jeffrey look at each other.  Will she go to him or not?  She
     goes to him as he rises...

                         WIGAND (cont'd)
               That computer has everything...

                         FBI AGENT #2
               You alright, Mr. Wigand?

                         FBI AGENT #1
               We need to take a look at your gun safe,
               Mr. Wigand.

     EXT. NEW ORLEANS, THE FRENCH QUARTER - NIGHT

                         LOWELL
                   (interrupts)
               I'm telling you, your agents in that
               office are acting improperly!  Now, who
               are they trying to protect?

     And we see a Man in his early forties, a neatly-dressed man
     who prides himself on his appearance, at his desk in the
     Bureau (FBI).  BILL ROBERTSON.  He's completely distracted,
     focused on agent travel orders...

                         BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE (OVER)
               Let me tell you something, Lowell.  Look,
               look, look.  You're talking about two
               agents in a regional office in
               Louisville.  I got the goddamn Unabomber
               threatening to blow up LAX!  I gotta move
               45 agents from all over the country into
               L.A.  Alright?  When I get a chance, I'll
               give it a look...

                         LOWELL
                   (heated)
               You better take a good look!  Because I'm
               getting two things:  pissed off and
               curious!  Now, any of these guys been
               offered jobs in corporate security after
               they retire?  Either one of those guys
               have ex-agent pals already in those jobs?
               Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor,
               who's already at Brown & Williamson as we
               fucking speak?

     INT. BILL ROBERTSON'S OFFICE, WASHINGTON - NIGHT

                         BILL ROBERTSON
                   (beat)
               I'll give it a look.

                         LOWELL
               You're getting my drift?

                         BILL ROBERTSON
               I'll give it a look.

     He hangs up.

     INT. DINING ROOM, THE FOUR SEASONS HOTEL, NEW YORK - NIGHT

     And we slide by some elegant diners to fall onto Lowell and
     Mike Wallace with Jeffrey and Liane in the Hotel's dining
     room, having ordered dinner.

                         LOWELL
               So, is everything okay?

                         MIKE WALLACE
               How are the rooms?  Comfortable?

                         LIANE
                   (to Mike)
               Yes, very.  You know, I enjoy your work
               so much...when you're talking to
               somebody, I always feel like I'm right
               there.

     And she laughs...

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Thank you got saying that...

                         LOWELL
               Do you think we could talk about the
               taping?  Tomorrow's taping, just so we
               can get it out of the way and order...

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Yeah, well, questions will go toward what
               work you did there, why you were fired.
               And others will deal...

                         LIANE
                   (not sure she quite heard)
               ...taping?
                   (beat)
               What are you taping?

                         WIGAND
               I'm doing an interview.

                         LIANE
                   (whispers)
               An interview!  Do you know what they will
               do to us...!  I thought...  Sorry.

     But she suddenly gets up and leaves, hurrying out of the
     dining room.  And Jeffrey oddly doesn't move.

                         LOWELL
                   (trying to intervene)
               Liane, this is a preliminary...
                   (after a beat)
               You didn't tell her we were taping?
               What did she think she was coming to New
               York for?

                         WIGAND
               ...to talk about it.  To think about it.
               I had a plan to ease her into it.  But, I
               really - I didn't know how to do that...

     Jeffrey abruptly crosses to the nearby Bar.

                         LOWELL
               Oh, man.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Who are these people?

                         LOWELL
                   (frustrated)
               Ordinary people!  Under extraordinary
               pressure, Mike.  What the hell do you
               expect?  Grace and consistency?

     And Lowell leaves the table.  And as Mike Wallace sits at the
     table, looking around, wondering what the fuck he's doing
     there.

     INT. THE BATHROOM, NEW YORK HOTEL - NIGHT

     Liane folds her arms protectively across her chest...

     INT. A STUDIO, CBS - MORNING

     And we see a small TAPING STUDIO separated by flats and black
     curtains from other CBS News sets.  Cameras are set up.

     INT. THE STUDIO, CBS - DAY

     And we enter mid-scene on Jeffrey in a more formal demeanor,
     sitting in a chair, Mike Wallace sitting across from him,
     under the lights, taping an interview.  Lowell, off camera.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               You heard Mr. Sandefur say before
               Congress that he believed nicotine was
               not addictive...?

                         WIGAND
                   (nods)
               ...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured
               himself because I watched those
               testimonies very carefully.

     Lowell's reaction.  Jeffrey's statements are stunning and
     powerful revelations...and dangerous ones to make.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               All of us did.  There was this whole line
               of people...whole line of CEOs up there
               all swearing.

                         WIGAND
               Part of the reason I'm here is I felt
               that their representation clearly
               misstated, at least within Brown &
               Williamson's representation, clearly
               misstated...what is common language
               within the company...we are in the
               nicotine delivery business.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               And that's what cigarettes are for...?

                         WIGAND
               A delivery device for nicotine.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               A delivery device for nicotine.  Put it
               in your mouth, light it up, and you're
               gonna get your fix...

                         WIGAND
               You're gonna get your fix...

                         MIKE WALLACE
               You're saying that Brown & Williamson
               manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix,
               not by artificially adding nicotine, but
               by enhancing the effect of nicotine
               through the use of chemical elements such
               as ammonia...

                         WIGAND
                   (nods)
               The process is known as "impact
               boosting..."  While not spiking nicotine,
               they clearly manipulate it.  There's
               extensive use of this technology, know
               as "ammonia chemistry."  It allows for
               the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed
               in the lung and therefore affect the
               brain and central nervous system.

     INT. THE STUDIO, CBS - LATER

                         WIGAND
               The straw that broke the camel's back for
               me and really put me in trouble with
               Sandefur was a compound called
               "coumarin."  When I came on board at B&W,
               they had tried to transition from
               coumarin to a similar flavor that would
               give the same taste, and had been
               unsuccessful.  I wanted it out
               immediately.
               I was told that it would affect sales, so
               I should mind my own business.  I
               constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur
               indicating I could not in conscience
               continue with coumarin in a product that
               we now knew, we had documentation, was
               similar to coumadin, a lung-specific
               carcinogen...

                         MIKE WALLACE
               And you sent the document forward to
               Sandefur?

                         WIGAND
               I sent the document forward to Sandefur.
               I was told that we would continue to work
               on a substitute, we weren't going to
               remove it as it would impact sales, and
               that that was his decision.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               In other words, you were charging
               Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with
               ignoring health considerations
               consciously...

                         WIGAND
               Most certainly.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of
               Brown & Williamson had you fired.  And
               the reason he gave you?

                         WIGAND
               Poor communication skills.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               And, do you wish you hadn't come forward?
               You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?

                         WIGAND
               Yeah, there are times I wish I hadn't
               done it.  There are times I feel
               compelled to do it.  If you asked me
               would I do it again?  Do I think it's
               worth it?  Yeah, I think it's worth it.

     INT. A HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE CLASS, LOUISVILLE - AFTERNOON

     Not too many kids paying attention.  Meanwhile, Jeffrey has
     written his name on the blackboard.

                         WIGAND
               Hi.

                         KIDS
                   (in unison)
               Hi.

                         WIGAND
               My name is Jeff Wigand.  You can call me
               Mr. Wigand; you can call me Dr. Wigand--I
               have a Ph.D. in biochemistry and
               endocrinology; you can call me Jeff...
                   (beat)
               Anything else you want to call
               me...you'll have to do so in private...
                   (a few kids smile)
               Okay...  I find chemistry to be magical.
               I find it an adventure.  An exploration
               into the building blocks of our physical
               universe...
                   (beat)
               So, how many of you have taken chemistry
               before?

     Nobody raises their hands.

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
                   (easy smile)
               Okay...I've never taught it before, so
               we're gonna be fine.

     A couple of laughs...  And we feel Jeffrey, for the first
     time is in a milieu that suits him.

                         WIGAND (cont'd)
               Our first experiment is...
                   (holds up cigarette lighter)
               ...going to be measuring the molecular
               weight of butane...

     INT. SCRUGGS' OFFICE

     Scruggs' office is decorated with watercolors of Phantom jets

               He's on line three.

     INT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR

     Jeffrey Wigand is on a pay phone in the corridor crowded with
     students...

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
               Hello.

                         WIGAND
               Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand.  Lowell Bergman
               said I should give you a call...

     INT. SCRUGGS' OFFICE

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
               My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have
               filed a lawsuit against the tobacco
               industry on behalf of the State of
               Mississippi to get the state reimbursed
               Medicaid costs for treating people with
               smoking-related illness.
                   (beat)
               If you'd be interested in talking to us,
               we'd certainly like to talk to you...

                         WIGAND
               When should we do this?

     EXT. WIGAND'S HOUSE #2, LOUISVILLE - TWILIGHT

     Jeffrey drives up the block and onto his driveway.  Seeing a
     MAN in a suit, an ear piece in his ear, disappearing around
     the corner of his house, Jeffrey leaps out of the car.  But
     the front door's open.  So instead of chasing after, he runs
     inside...

     INT. THE WIGAND'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY/TWILIGHT

     And he sees another Man is in the living room...

                         WIGAND
               Who the hell are you?!  What are you
               doing in my house?!

     And he sees Lowell enter from the dining room...

                         LOWELL
               It's okay, Jeff.

                         SECURITY GUARD
               Mr. Wigand, you need to speak to...

                         LOWELL
                   (wry)
               It's okay.  You got your own security
               now...

     Wigand catches his breath.

                         WIGAND
               Lowell, I can't afford --

                         LOWELL
               ...they "volunteered."  A friend owns a
               large security company.

                         TALIFARO
               How are you doing, Mr. Wigand?  I'm Jon
               Talifaro.  There'll be three of us on
               detail.

                         LIANE
                   (crossing through)
               I'm going to the store.  Please explain
               our new "houseguests" to your children.

     And Wigand looks at Lowell...  Barbara comes into the living
     room and holds onto her father's leg.

                         WIGAND
               I called Richard Scruggs in
               Mississippi...

                         LOWELL
               I heard.

                         WIGAND
               I'm going to be a witness for them in
               their litigation.  So I'm going to fly to
               Pascagoula to give a deposition...

                         LOWELL
               I know.  I'm going to go there tonight...

                         WIGAND
               Did you have a good day?

                         DEBORAH
               Yes, I did.  I had a great day.

                         WIGAND
               Coffee, Lowell?

                         LOWELL
               Yeah.
                   (to kids)
               Want to play that game we were playing
               before?  You know, I think you got it up
               to five.  I was ahead of you.

     She goes over and holds his hand.  And as he holds her hand,
     seeing what his life has become, he looks up and his glance
     connects with Lowell...

     INT. THE KITCHEN, THE WIGANDS' HOUSE - NIGHT

     We see out the window a Security Guard, incongruous, walking
     by.  And we see Liane, finished with the dinner dishes,
     silently wiping off the sink.  There's a pall you could cut
     with a knife.  A moment, and Jeffrey comes in the kitchen
     door from the garden...  He stops to wash his hands in the
     sink.

                         LIANE
               Please don't wash your hands in the sink.

                         WIGAND
               Where should I wash them?

                         LIANE
               Use the bathroom.

                         WIGAND
               What's the difference...

                         LIANE
               That's for food.

     But he ignores her, washing his hands...  And she turns the
     water off.  He turns it back on.  He thinks, then turns it
     off.  Then she turns it on.

                         LIANE (cont'd)
               Leave it on!  Just leave it on, okay?!

     And she turns and leaves the room, coldly, all her anger
     repressed.  For Jeffrey, everything else and now this?  The
     running faucet.

     EXT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - LATE NIGHT

     The house on the quiet suburban street.  A Security Guard,
     incongruous, a noticeable bulge where his shoulder holster
     is, sitting watch under the porch light on the small front
     porch in a metal porch chair.

     INT. THE BASEMENT, THE WIGANDS' HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

     And we see Jeffrey, unable to sleep, sitting at his desk,
     alone in the basement, listening to classical music.  He
     instinctively turns.  And he sees Liane, in her bathrobe, has
     come down to sit on the basement stairs.  He looks over at
     her.  And he thinks she's come down to make up.  And all she
     really wants him to do is say, "I need you..."  But he
     can't...  And like ships that pass in the night, nothing's
     said.  It's quiet.  She puts her hands protectively in her
     robe pockets.  And she starts to cry...

                         LIANE
               I don't think I can do this...  I want to
               stand by my husband...  I really do,
               Jeffrey.  But I don't think I can do this
               anymore.  I am so sorry...

                         WIGAND
               Can we talk about this when I get back?

                         LIANE
               Yes...Jeffrey.

     She goes back up the stairs.  And as Jeffrey sits in the
     basement, and the music plays.

     INT. THE LOUISVILLE AIRPORT - DAY

     We see Jeffrey and his Security Man.  He passes a small
     Filipino Woman in a nurse's uniform and a Man in clerical
     garb, who hands him a small American Flag, asking for
     donations.  And, now, he passes through the metal detector.
     He nods thanks and walks towards us, relaxing, looking behind
     every so often to see if anybody is following him.  As he
     passes Gate 3, he HEARS over his shoulder...

                         THE MAN
                   (friendly)
               Jeff...?

     Jeffrey turns and the Man throws a sheaf of SUBPOENAS at his
     chest...

                         THE MAN (CONT'D)
                   (nasty)
               You've been served.

     And he turns and walks off.  And as Jeffrey looks down at the
     subpoenas...

     INT. RICHARD SCRUGGS' KITCHEN - 7:00 A.M.

     Jeffrey is sitting with Scruggs and Motley in Scruggs'
     kitchen around a semi-circular counter.  Coffee and sweet
     rolls.  It's casual.  No one's dressed for court.  Scruggs
     has been looking through the sheaf of subpoenas.  About
     Motley, we sense power held in reserve.

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
               Now, what this one is, is a temporary
               restraining order, a gag order, issued by
               a Kentucky court.

     Meanwhile, a movie-star handsome man in shirtsleeves and a
     tie, a coffee cup in his hand, enters and sits casually on
     the arm of a chair.

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS (CONT'D)
                   (introducing)
               Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.

                         MICHAEL MOORE
               Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
               Mike's our Attorney General down here.
                   (to Moore)
               I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a
               Kentucky court to issue a gag order to
               stop his deposition today.

                         MICHAEL MOORE
               Right.

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
               Now, they tried to get the Mississippi
               Court to honor it, but the judge threw it
               out...
                   (to Jeffrey)
               However, for you, there is a more
               perilous effect to the Kentucky gag
               order...

                         MICHAEL MOORE
                   (after a beat)
               Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could
               happen, don't you?

                         WIGAND
               I'm not free to testify...here...?

                         MOTLEY
               That's right.  If you violate the
               Kentucky order, when you step foot back
               in Kentucky, they can find you in
               contempt and they can incarcerate you.
               And you ought to know that.

     And Jeffrey fairly turns white, it's never occurred to him he
     might go to jail...

                         WIGAND
               Jail?

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
               Possibly, yes.  That is one of the
               possible consequences of your testifying
               here today.  That's right...

                         WIGAND
               How does one..."go...to...jail?"  What
               does my family do?  Go on welfare?  If my
               wife has to work?  Who's going to look
               after the kids?  Put food on the table?
               My children need me.  If I'm not
               teaching...there's no medical...no
               medical...even on co-pay, that's like...
               Tuition...

                         MICHAEL MOORE
               Dr. Wigand, listen, you may not be able
               to do this thing.  As I understand from
               Dick, you're our key witness.  And, I
               hope you don't withdraw.  I guess we'd
               all understand if you did...
                   (at watch)
               Guys, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late
               for court.  I'll see y'all a little
               later.  Dr. Wigand, good luck.

     He leaves.  And Jeffrey's quiet, frightened.  Having shaken
     the departing Moore's hand, he now turns away from Scruggs
     and Motley, thinking about consequences.

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
               I know what you're facing, Jeff.  And, I
               think I know how you're feeling...

     Jeffrey's skeptical anybody could know "how it is"...

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS (CONT'D)
                   (low, personal)
               In the Navy I flew A-6's off carriers...
               In combat, events have a duration of
               seconds, sometimes minutes...  But what
               you're going through goes on day in and
               day out.  Whether you're ready for it or
               not, week in, week out...  Month after
               month after month.  Whether you're up or
               whether you're down.  You're assaulted
               psychologically.  You're assaulted
               financially, which is its own special
               kind of violence.  Because it's directed
               at your kids...what school can you
               afford...  How will that affect their
               lives.  You're asking yourself:  Will that
               limit what they may become?  You feel
               your whole family's future's
               compromised...held hostage...
                   (after a beat)
               I do know how it is.

     EXT. RICHARD SCRUGGS' HOUSE, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

     A white, traditional, Southern house, with a veranda and
     gables...a large front lawn with weeping willows.  And we see
     Lowell, hands in his pockets, not an insider or an outsider,
     waiting alone on the expansive lawn.  The front door opens.
     A Mississippi State Trooper, putting on his round brimmed hat
     comes out and crosses the driveway.  Then Jeffrey coming out
     with Motley.  Motley talks to him on the veranda for a moment
     and then heads towards his car.  Meanwhile, Jeffrey comes
     down over to Lowell on the lawn.

     And Jeffrey looks off, across the street from the house, at
     the Gulf.  And we see the street is blockaded by Mississippi
     State Police cars.  An armed camp.  Other men in suits,
     Lawyers and state officials, wait.  Ron Motley gets in his
     car and drives away.

                         LOWELL
               You attract a crowd.

                         WIGAND
                   (smiles, wry)
               Yeah, great.

                         LOWELL
               I heard about the Kentucky gag order...

                         WIGAND
               I don't know what to do.

     And they're quiet, a breeze of the Gulf ruffling their
     coats...  He looks out at the water, a cargo container ship
     passing by.  He watches its slow progress...

     And Jeffrey quietly starts to walk off across the lawn, hands
     in his pockets, shoulders bent, head down, thinking...  And
     Richard Scruggs comes out, tying his tie, to wait beside
     Lowell...

     EXT. COURTHOUSE, CANTY STREET, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI -
     DAY

     Motley's car parks, and he and an Assistant are approached by
     a flurry of media from the parking lot behind us, crossing
     Canty Street to intercept him.  And we SEE the lot is jammed
     with Mercedes-Benzes, Town Cars and limousines belonging to
     the 150-200 Big Tobacco, Wall Street lawyers.  Some hang out
     by their cars, killing time.  It's a tailgate party.  Beyond
     them are trucks and vans with satellite dishes supporting the
     media circus.  They're all here for Jeff's deposition.  The
     scale of it dwarfs the plebeian storefront with its sign
     "Temporary Jackson County Courthouse"...into which Motley
     enters...

     EXT. RICHARD SCRUGGS' HOUSE, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

     Jeffrey contemplating.

     INT. COURTROOM, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

     One TOBACCO LAWYER, an Edward Bennett-type while waiting is
     on his cell phone...

                         TOBACCO LAWYER
                   (into phone)
               Hold on a second...
                   (seeing Motley enter; to Jr.
                    Lawyer)
               Would you please ask Mr. Motley if he
               expects his witness to appear or not...?

     JR. LAWYER crosses to Motley.

     EXT. SCRUGGS' HOUSE, DOCK - DAY

     Jeffrey alone on the jetty, looking out to sea.  Trying to
     decide, trying to untangle identity and consequence.  A
     moment.  He turns, crossing to Lowell and Scruggs.  Then.
     it's the three men, standing on the lawn.  Time seems to
     slow...all of them aware it's a critical decision, personally
     and historically...

                         WIGAND
                   (severely conflicted)
               I can't seem to find...the criteria to
               decide.  It's too big a decision to make
               without being resolved...in my own mind.

     They're quiet.  Jeffrey, getting nowhere.  Lowell offers...

                         LOWELL
               Maybe things have changed...

     Long pause on Jeffrey as he contemplates his future.  And
     something just got resolved.  He asks Lowell, rhetorically...

                         WIGAND
               What's changed?

                         LOWELL
                   (unsure)
               You mean...since this morning?

                         WIGAND
               No.  I mean since whenever...

     Nothing's changed.  Wigand looks at them.  He found his own
     answer.

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
               Fuck it.  Let's go to court.

     And Dick Scruggs and Lowell look at this normal, somewhat
     flawed, very courageous man...

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
                   (to unseen staff)
               Dr. Wigand would like to leave now.

     And there's a sudden flurry of activity.  Jeffrey and Scruggs
     walk to a Mississippi State Police car.  Lowell gets into his
     car and drives away, separately.  Police, State Officials,
     run to their cars.  Cars starting, lights flashing, Wigand's
     car pulls into position.

     INT. SCRUGGS' CAR - JEFFREY - DAY

     in the back seat with Scruggs.  The driver's a State
     Policeman.  Jeffrey watches the small town of empty lots, old
     buildings, a 1930's Deco school pass by.  It's all
     heightened, especially vivid to his eyes somehow.  And he
     exhales heavily to calm himself, to focus...

     EXT. THE COURTHOUSE, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

     Some of the Tobacco Lawyers, their jackets off, still hanging
     across Canty Street by their cars.  And now they see the
     police lights turning, coming around a corner, moving towards
     the courthouse.  The caravan stops.  First, Scruggs gets out.
     A moment, then Jeffrey appears.  And the Reporters pounce on
     Jeffrey, cameras flashing...Mississippi Police leading him
     through the crowd...  Moore appears at courtroom door
     (already there).  And as he's whisked away into the
     courtroom.

     INT. THE COURTROOM, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

     The tobacco lawyers become dead quiet.  Cell phones are hung
     up.  Newspapers are put away.  Jackets are donned.  This is
     now very serious business.  Motley meets Jeffrey, all eyes on
     him.

                         MOTLEY
               Okay, Jeff, I'm going to sit you down at
               that table over there.  I'm going to
               start as fast as possible.  I don't want
               to give them a chance to get another
               restraining order, okay?  Let's go.

                         MICHAEL MOORE
               Good luck, Doc.

     Motley calmly motions Wigand to take a chair.  He settles in.

                         STENOGRAPHER
               Please stand.  Raise your right hand...
               Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole
               truth and nothing but the truth, so help
               you God?

                         WIGAND
               I do.

                         STENOGRAPHER
               You may be seated.

                         MOTLEY
               You understand, Dr. Wigand, you are under
               oath.  This is a sworn deposition.
               There's no judge.  It's not a trial.
                   (understatement of the century)
               Will you state your name for the record.

                         WIGAND
                   (after a beat)
               Jeffrey S. Wigand.

     He spells it for them...

     EXT. THE COURTHOUSE, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

     Lowell, waiting with the other journalists...

                         PHOTOGRAPHER
               Got any idea what's going on in there?

                         LOWELL
               No, I don't have a clue.

     INT. THE COURTROOM, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

     Motley still conducting the inquiry...  And the tobacco
     lawyers, like a pack of dogs, waiting to pounce...

                         WIGAND
               That is correct.

                         MOTLEY
               In other words, it acts as a drug?

                         TOBACCO LAWYER
               Object to the form of the question!

                         MOTLEY
               It acts as a drug on the body?

                         TOBACCO LAWYER
               Object to the form!

                         MOTLEY
               It acts as a...

                         TOBACCO LAWYER
               Object!

                         MOTLEY
               There an echo in here?  Your objection's
               been recorded.  She typed it into her
               little machine over there.  It's on the
               record.  So now I'll proceed with my
               deposition of my witness.  Does it act as
               a drug?

                         TOBACCO LAWYER
                   (shouts)
               Dr. Wigand.  I am instructing you...
                   (to Wigand)
               ...not to answer that question in
               accordance to the terms of the
               contractual obligations undertaken by you
               not to disclose any information about
               your work at the Brown & Williamson
               Tobacco Company.  And in accordance with
               the force and effect of the temporary
               restraining order that has been entered
               against you to by the court in the State of
               Kentucky!  That means you don't talk!
                   (beat)
               Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...

                         MOTLEY
                   (explodes)
               Oh, you got rights and lefts!  Ups and
               downs and middles!  So what?!  You don't
               get to instruct anything around here!
               This is not North Carolina, not South
               Carolina nor Kentucky.  This is the
               sovereign State of Mississippi's
               proceeding.  Wipe that smirk off your
               face!  Dr. Wigand's deposition will be
               part of this record.  And I'm going to
               take my witness' testimony!  Whether the
               hell you like it or not!
                   (to Wigand)
               Answer the question, Dr...

                         WIGAND
                   (slams it home)
               Yes.  It produces a physiological
               response, which meets the definition of a
               drug!  Nicotine is associated with
               impact, with satisfaction.  It has a
               pharmacological effect that crosses the
               blood-brain barrier intact...

                         MOTLEY
               Thank you, Doctor.  Thank you.

     EXT. THE SCRUGGS' HOUSE, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - NIGHT

     Lowell stands on the porch looking out at the rain.  There's
     a slight sound.  He turns.  And Jeffrey's come outside.  He
     stands leaning on the porch railing, looking out at the rain
     and windswept trees.  They're quiet.  They share a look.
     They nod to each other.  The smallest nod of accomplishment.
     And they're there on the porch, alone, outside the house in
     Pascagoula, Mississippi.

     INT. CBS EDITING ROOM, NEW YORK - AFTERNOON

     We see Lowell, unusually buoyant in the same clothes as
     yesterday.  He's working with Tony Baldo on a cut of the
     show, the net result of his architecture of events, his
     combination of persuasion and integrity...

     We see on the Avid monitor a single of Jeffrey...

                         WIGAND
                   (on monitor)
               "Part of the reason I'm here is I felt
               that their representation clearly, at
               least within..."

                         LOWELL
               Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's
               not addictive."  Run that on-camera.
               Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe
               they perjured..."  Then go wide to the
               CEOs all taking the oath.  Back on Jeff
               and play the pause after the word "felt"
               on the B-side...

     Widen to include Debbie DeLuca, the Intern, two other
     Editors, Felling.  They have gathered behind Lowell in the
     doorway.  This is a hot show and it's generated excitement
     among Lowell's co-workers.  And while Baldo cuts, we see...

     INT. CBS, CORRIDOR OUTSIDE EDITING ROOM - DAY

     ...the group has spilled out the doorway, watching Lowell's
     story come together.  Beyond them, approaching, is Mike
     Wallace, coming to work...

                         BILL FELLING
                   (leaving)
               ...helluva show, Mike.  Explosive
               material.

     People separate as Mike pushes in.  Lowell sees Mike.  While
     Tony Baldo is making the edits on the Avid...

                         LOWELL
                   (to Mike)
               It went great in Mississippi, Mike.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Good.

     Don Hewitt enters from the corridor without jacket.

                         DON HEWITT
               I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.

                         LOWELL
               Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal
               the secret formula of "Kools" to the
               world.
                   (seriously)
               "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs'
               litigation, and since we're the only ones
               with the story, I believe we're sitting
               on an exclusive.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               I like that...

                         DON HEWITT
               Corporate has some questions.  We've got
               a meeting at Black Rock first thing in
               the morning.

                         LOWELL
               When's the air date?

                         DEBBIE DELUCA
                   (to Lowell)
               Excuse me, Lowell.  Sharon's on line 3.

                         LOWELL
               Tell her I'll call her back in ten.

                         BALDO
               Here we go.

     Baldo now runs Lowell's edit of the above sequence.  And we
     SEE THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT.

     Sandefur in CLOSE-UP states "I believe that nicotine is not
     addictive."  Wigand in matching CLOSE-UP states "I believe he
     perjured himself."  Then all seven CEOs of Big Tobacco stand
     up and raise their hands and take an oath in front of
     Congress to tell the truth while Wallace says "...the whole
     line of people, the whole line of CEO's up there, all
     swearing that."  And Wigand says off-screen with great
     emphasis "Part of the reason I'm here is I FELT"...and it
     cuts to Wigand for a pause that makes the word "FELT" resound
     and, then, he goes on to say on-camera "that their
     representation clearly misstated what they commonly knew.
     We're a nicotine delivery business."  We see the combination
     of art and truth woven into impact that has an audacity
     that's stirring and beautiful...

     EXT. LOUISVILLE - DUSK

     We see an anonymous rental car moving through downtown
     Louisville.

     INT. THE RENTAL CAR - NIGHT

     It's Jeffrey in the front seat, driven by one of his security
     men.  He's coming home under the cover of darkness.  They
     pass a FLAMING CAR on the freeway shoulder.  Jeffrey turns to
     stare at it.  They turn off onto city streets and stop at a
     light.  Jeffrey's nervous.  Jeffrey instinctively turns.  A
     Police Car stops alongside.  The Policeman looks at him.
     Eyes meet.  Jeffrey looks away.  The signal takes forever.
     It changes.  And as the Police Car moves off...

     EXT. WIGANDS' HOUSE - NIGHT

     The car's stopped at the curb.  Jeffrey gets out.  He starts
     up the walk, and the Second Security Guard quickly crosses
     the lawn to intercept him...

     And Jeff opens the door going inside, anxious to be home...

     INT. WIGANDS' HOUSE - NIGHT

     The house is quiet, dark.  Too quiet.  Too dark.  Something
     isn't right.  He crosses to one of the children's rooms...the
     master bedroom.  The lights are on.  Both rooms are empty.
     He goes into the kitchen and sees a note that's been left for
     him...  He opens it.  He sits heavily in a chair, reading the
     note.  The Security Guard peers...  And as Jeffrey sits in
     the silent house, the hero come home...

     INT. THE CONFERENCE ROOM, CBS - DAY

     We're at a table.  Mike and Lowell laugh at some joke while
     HELEN CAPERELLI, CBS GENERAL COUNSEL, enters with the
     President of CBS News, ERIC KLUSTER.

                         HELEN CAPERELLI
               Shall I send for coffee?  Sorry I'm late.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               No, no, we're fine...

                         HELEN CAPERELLI
               Are you sure?

     Also there is Don Hewitt.  Caperelli is too well put
     together, too practiced, too polished.

     They nod.  They don't need coffee.

                         HELEN CAPERELLI (CONT'D)
               Alright, I thought we'd get together
               because there's a legal concept that has
               been getting some new attention recently,
               "tortious interference."
                   (beat)
               If two people have an agreement, like a
               confidentiality agreement, and one of
               them breaks it because they are induced
               to do so by a 3rd party, the 3rd party
               can be sued for damages for
               interfering...hence, "tortious
               interference."

                         DON HEWITT
               Interfering?  That's what we do.

                         LOWELL
               I think what we're trying to tell you is
               that it happens all the time.  This is a
               news organization.  People are always
               telling us things they shouldn't.  We
               have to verify if it's true and in the
               public interest...  And if it is, we air
               it.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               After we corroborate it.  That's why
               we've never lost a lawsuit and run a
               classy show.
                   (impatient, now)
               Anything else?

                         HELEN CAPERELLI
               And "60 Minutes'" verification is exact.
               And precise.  And I don't think it would
               hurt to make sure you're right...on this
               one.

                         DON HEWITT
               Why?  You think we have liability?
               What's the CBS News' position, Eric?

                         ERIC KLUSTER
               There's a possibility, it's rather
               remote...

                         HELEN CAPERELLI
               But one we have to check on, Mike.  I've
               retained outside counsel to do exactly
               that.  On a segment, I might add, that's
               already rife with problems...

                         LOWELL
               What does that mean?  "Rife with -- ?"

                         HELEN CAPERELLI
               I'm told unusual promises were made to
               Wigand.

                         LOWELL
               No, only that we would hold the story
               until it was safe for him...

                         HELEN CAPERELLI
                   (cuts in)
               And, I'm told there are questions as to
               our "star witness'" veracity.

                         LOWELL
                   (trying to control his anger)
               His "veracity" was good enough for the
               State of Mississippi.

                         HELEN CAPERELLI
                   (historic)
               Our standards have to be higher than
               anyone else's, because we are the
               standard...for everyone else...

     Whatever that means...

                         LOWELL
                   (wry)
               Well, as a "standard"...I'll hang with
               "is the guy telling the truth?"

                         HELEN CAPERELLI
               Well, with tortious interference, I'm
               afraid...the greater the truth, the
               greater the damage.

                         LOWELL
               Come again?

                         HELEN CAPERELLI
               They own the information he's disclosing.
               The truer it is, the greater the damage
               to them.  If he lied, he didn't disclose
               their information.  And the damages are
               smaller.

                         LOWELL
               Is this "Alice in Wonderland"?

                         MIKE WALLACE
               You said "on this one."  What about "this
               one"?

     And Lowell hears a changed note in Wallace's voice.  After a
     beat.

                         HELEN CAPERELLI
                   (familiar, seductive)
               If this holds up, and it very well may
               not, Mike...but, if it did.  And we aired
               this segment?  And CBS was sued by Brown
               & Williamson?  I think we could be at
               grave risk.

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (a beat)
               How grace?

                         HELEN CAPERELLI
                   (and she's been waiting for
                    this)
               Well, at the end of the day...because of
               your segment...the Brown & Williamson
               Tobacco Company...could own CBS.

     As if on cue, the alarm on Helen Caperelli's watch beeps.
     She glances at it.

                         HELEN CAPERELLI (CONT'D)
               You know, I am sorry.  But I'm due
               upstairs.

     She gets up, gathering her things.

                         LOWELL
               Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not
               go to air with this story?

                         HELEN CAPERELLI
               You're getting ahead of yourself.  We're
               all in this together.  We're all CBS.
               We'll find out soon.  Thank you,
               gentlemen.

     And taking up her briefcase, she leaves.  Don and Mike rise.

                         LOWELL
               "Tortious interference"?  Sounds like a
               disease caught by a radio.

                         DON HEWITT
                   (to Mike)
               Lunch?

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Sure.
                   (to Lowell)
               Don't worry, we call the shots around
               here.

     Lowell finds himself angry and alone.  He crosses to the
     window and pulls out his cell phone and goes to work.

                         DEBBIE DELUCA'S VOICE (OVER)
               Hello?

                         LOWELL
                   (into phone)
               Debbie, it's me.  I want you to check
               some filings and give me John Wilson's
               number at Bear-Stern.

     INT. CBS, HEWITT'S OFFICE - DAY

                         LOWELL
               What now?

                         DON HEWITT
               Kluster's coming over.

     Hewitt's on an unrelated call.  Lowell crosses to look out
     the window, a manila folder (the filing) under his arm with
     whatever he found out, like a bomb, feels distant from these
     people.  The door opens, and Eric Kluster, the President of
     CBS News enters...

                         ERIC KLUSTER
               Hello, Lowell, Mike, Don.

     Hewitt hangs up the phone.

                         ERIC KLUSTER (CONT'D)
               There has been so much soul searching
               about this Wigand, I've decided we should
               cut an alternate version of the show
               without his interview.

                         LOWELL
               So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's
               checking with outside counsel first, all
               that crap?

                         ERIC KLUSTER
               That's happening.  And, hopefully we
               won't have to use the alternate, but we
               should have it in the can.

                         LOWELL
               I'm not touching my film...

                         ERIC KLUSTER
               I'm afraid you are.

                         LOWELL
               No, I'm not...

                         ERIC KLUSTER
               We're doing this with or without you,
               Lowell.  If you like, I can assign
               another producer to edit your show...

     Lowell's stunned.  He looks like he's been hit with a
     hammer...

                         LOWELL
               Since when has the paragon of
               investigative journalism allowed lawyers
               to determine the news content on "60
               Minutes"?

                         DON HEWITT
               It's an alternate version.  So what if we
               have an alternate version?  And I don't
               think her being cautious is so damned
               unreasonable.

                         ERIC KLUSTER
                   (wry)
               So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen,
               Mr. Rather's been complaining about his
               chair again.
                   (laughter)

     As they start to leave...

                         LOWELL
                   (mild)
               Before you go...

     And Lowell takes out...

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
               I discovered this.  SEC filing...
                   (he gets their attention)
               For the sale of the CBS Corporation to
               Westinghouse Corporation.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               What?

                         DON HEWITT
               Yeah, I heard rumors.

                         LOWELL
               It's not a rumor.  It's a sale.
                   (rhetorical answer)
               If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share
               to Westinghouse and then is suddenly
               threatened with a multibillion-dollar
               lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that
               could screw up the sale, could it not?

                         ERIC KLUSTER
                   (serene)
               And what are you implying?

                         LOWELL
                   (to Kluster)
               I'm not implying.  I'm quoting.  More
               vested interests...
                   (reading from SEC filing)
               "Persons Who Will Profit From This
               Merger...
                   (beat)
               Ms. Helen Caperelli, General Counsel of
               CBS News, 3.9 million.  Mr. Eric Kluster,
               President of CBS News, 1.4 million..."

                         DON HEWITT
               Are you suggesting that she and Eric are
               influenced by money?

                         LOWELL
               Oh, no, of course they're not influenced
               by money.  They work for free.  And you
               are a Volunteer Executive Producer.

                         DON HEWITT
               CBS does not do that.  And, you're
               questioning our journalistic integrity?!

                         LOWELL
               No, I'm questioning your hearing!  You
               hear "reasonable" and "tortious
               interference."  I hear...  "Potential
               Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing
               the sale of CBS to Westinghouse."  I
               hear...  "Shut the segment down.  Cut
               Wigand loose.  Obey orders.  And fuck
               off...!"  That's what I hear.

                         DON HEWITT
               You're exaggerating!

                         LOWELL
               I am?  You pay me to go get guys like
               Wigand, to draw him out.  To get him to
               trust us, to get him to go on television.
               I do.  I deliver him.  He sits.  He
               talks.  He violates his own fucking
               confidentiality agreement.  And he's only
               the key witness in the biggest public
               health reform issue, maybe the biggest,
               most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case
               in U.S. history.  And Jeffrey Wigand,
               who's out on a limb, does he go on
               television and tell the truth?  Yes.
               Is it newsworthy?  Yes.  Are we gonna air
               it?  Of course not.  Why?  Because he's
               not telling the truth?  No.  Because he
               is telling the truth.  That's why we're
               not going to air it.  And the more truth
               he tells, the worse it gets!

                         DON HEWITT
               You are a fanatic.  An anarchist.  You
               know that?  If we can't have a whole
               show, then I want half a show rather than
               no show.  But oh, no, not you.  You won't
               be satisfied unless you're putting the
               company at risk!

                         LOWELL
               C'mon, what are you?  And are you a
               businessman?  Or are you a newsman?!
               Because that happens to be what Mike and
               I do for a living...

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Lowell.

                         LOWELL
                   (runs on)
               "Put the corporation at risk"...?  Give
               me a fucking break!

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Lowell.

                         LOWELL
               These people are putting our whole reason
               for doing what we do...on the line!

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Lowell!

                         LOWELL
               What?

                         MIKE WALLACE
               I'm with Don on this.

     And there it is.

     EXT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BERKELEY - AFTERNOON

     We see Sharon in a vegetable garden in their side yard...
     She turns, seeing him standing behind her...

     After a moment.  She knows.

                         SHARON
               What's wrong?

                         LOWELL
               They're killing the Wigand interview...

                         SHARON
               What?!

                         LOWELL
               They're pretending it's process.
               Bullshit, it's foregone.

                         SHARON
                   (beat)
               What are you and Mike going to do?

                         LOWELL
               I'm alone on this...

                         SHARON
                   (beat)
               Oh, baby...

     And the phone RINGS...  Sharon goes in the house to get it...
     She comes back out...

                         SHARON (CONT'D)
                   (after a beat)
               Jeffrey Wigand...

     INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, BERKELEY - LATE AFTERNOON

                         LOWELL
               Jeffrey...

     INT. A HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

     And we see Wigand looking rough, unshaven, sitting on a couch
     in a hotel room.  And we see his belongings, clothing, some
     boxes, a bottle of vodka, his computer, what's left of his
     world, are around the room.

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
               Jeffrey, how are you?  How's the family,
               okay?

                         WIGAND
               There is - there is no family.

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
               What do you mean there is no family?

                         WIGAND
               Liane has filed for divorce...

     INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, BERKELEY - LATE AFTERNOON

     And Lowell's dead quiet.

     INT. THE HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

                         WIGAND
               And, so, I moved out...  I see the girls
               a couple of days a week...

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (concerned)
               Where you staying now?

                         WIGAND
                   (sarcastic)
               Our favorite hotel, honey...  I checked
               into Room 930.  Odd choice?  Huh?

     And we don't know what he means by that...

     INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, BERKELEY - LATE AFTERNOON

     The last of the daylight shadows his office.

                         LOWELL
                   (after a beat)
               I don't know how to say this, Jeff,
               except to just say it right out, so I'll
               say it.  They do not want to air it.

                         WIGAND
                   (stops)
               What?!

                         LOWELL
               B & W may have threatened litigation...
               CBS is on the block...
                   (a beat)
               But you, I mean, I know how...

                         WIGAND
               No.

                         LOWELL
               No?  No, what?

                         WIGAND
               I do not think that you "know" for
               me...what it is to walk in my shoes...
                   (beat)
               ...for my kids to have seen it...for them
               to know why I've put them through what I
               did...the public airing of that...the
               testament to why I did what I
               did...you're telling me is not going to
               see the light of day.

     Lowell's quiet.  And Jeffrey starts to hang up...

                         LOWELL
               Jeff...

     And Jeffrey hangs up.

     INT. JEFFREY'S HOTEL ROOM, LOUISIANA - (PROCESS) - NIGHT

     Jeffrey silently sitting in the chair.  We COME AROUND and
     see why he's been purposely sitting there.  Why he's chosen
     this room.  Directly across the street is the Brown &
     Williamson Building.  The lights are on.  The building lit
     up.  And in an upstairs office Brown & Williamson lawyers,
     moving around a conference room, talking.  And as Jeffrey
     looks out the window...

     EXT. A SMALL TOWN, UPSTATE NEW YORK - DAY

     A peaceful, suburban street.  Small houses.  A PRIVATE
     INVESTIGATOR (P.I.) from IGI, in a raincoat, getting out of a
     car, going up the walk.  He knocks on the door.  Some
     moments.  A Woman in her late forties, handicapped, in an
     electric cart answers the door...

                         P.I.
               Mrs. Wigand?

                         THE WOMAN
               It hasn't been Mrs. Wigand for some time.

                         P.I.
               Well, I'm an investigator and I was - I
               was wondering if I could ask you a couple
               of questions about that?

                         THE WOMAN
               Alright...

     INT. JOHN SCANLON'S PUBLIC RELATIONS FIRM, A MEDIA ROOM,
     NEW YORK - DAY

     And on a TELEVISION SCREEN, SUSAN WIGAND, the woman in the
     electric cart, giving a taped interview to the P.I....

                         SUSAN WIGAND
               ...seven months after we were married we
               found out that I had multiple
               sclerosis...

     We PULL BACK to see John Scanlon and his Staff watching the
     tape...  His firm's logo, public relations campaigns for some
     of his high-profile clients are on the walls.  Scanlon's on
     the phone talking with somebody as the tape runs...

                         P.I.'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (on television)
               And, you had a daughter, Diane, with him,
               is that correct?

                         SUSAN WIGAND
                   (on television)
               Yes, in 1973.

                         JOHN SCANLON
                   (on the phone, whispering)
               ...come on, Tommy Sandefur told me
               himself, he's not gonna allow Brown &
               Williamson to be demonized to the
               American public, so I told Peter Jennings
               and I...hold on...

     He stops, listening to the videotape...

                         P.I.'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (on television)
               Would it be fair to say when he divorced
               you he left you in a precarious
               situation?  You had multiple sclerosis;
               you had a small child to raise.

                         JOHN SCANLON
                   (ignoring that part; to staff)
               Mention that part in the executive
               summary and in the chapters "First Wife"
               and "Estrangement of Daughter."
                   (beat; into phone)
               So, I was telling Pete, I said, "You've
               been taken in by this guy...

                         SUSAN WIGAND
                   (on television)
               Yes...
                   (beat)
               But you have to understand, the divorce
               was something that we both wanted...

                         JOHN SCANLON
               He's a total bullshit artist.  He's a
               shoplifter.  He's a convicted shoplifter.

     And as we end in a sea of documents, affidavits, court
     records, all from Louisville, all about Jeffrey.  We
     understand the war has only been begun...

     INT. CBS, "60 MINUTES," CORRIDOR, LOWELL'S OFFICE - MORNING

     Lowell, in his office, his door open for anyone to see him,
     an immovable force, sitting behind his desk.  Hewitt appears
     in his doorway...

                         DON HEWITT
                   (after a beat, cold)
               So, what are you going to do?

                         LOWELL
               Well, what do you think I'm going to do?
               Quit in protest?  I'm not going to do
               that.

                         DON HEWITT
                   (surprised)
               You're taking "no" for an answer?

                         LOWELL
               No.  I'm not going to take "no" for an
               answer.  No.

                         DON HEWITT
               Then what are you going to do?

     Hewitt looks at him...

                         LOWELL
               I'm staying right here.  Doing my job.
               Fighting to get my show on the air.  You
               don't like it?  Hey, I'll tell you
               what...fire my ass...

                         DON HEWITT
               End up in a high-profile lawsuit with
               Lowell, the First Amendment martyr?  I
               don't think so.
                   (laughs)
               Take a look at this...  This is a summary
               of a dossier that's being prepared.

     And he gives him a copy of it.

                         DON HEWITT (CONT'D)
               He would lie about his whole life...?
               Who's going to believe him about anything
               he says...?
                   (a beat, and the coup de grace)
               The Wall Street Journal's doing a major
               story and I think the Post.  You backed
               the wrong horse...

     He turns and starts off along the hall.  As he goes...

                         DON HEWITT (cont'd)
                   (his parting shot)
               The version without his interview is
               going to air the week after next.

     Lowell watches him walk away.  Debbie enters.

                         DEBBIE DELUCA
               What was that about?

                         LOWELL
               Get me Wigand.

                         DEBBIE DELUCA
               Sure.

                         LOWELL
               ...fuck is this?  Fuck!

     INT. THE PHONE BOOTH, HIGH SCHOOL, LOUISVILLE - DAY

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (on the phone, upset)
               You never told me you were married
               before...that you had a daughter...

     And Wigand is in the phone booth at the High
     School...students walking by...

                         WIGAND
                   (outraged)
               Well, how is that any of your business?!
               That is not something that you people
               need to know!

     His voice carries, a student looks over...

     INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE - DAY

                         LOWELL
                   (frustrated)
               Oh, you know what we do or do not need to
               know?  Since when have you become a media
               expert?

     INT. THE PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

                         WIGAND
                   (upset)
               What do you want to do, Lowell, look up
               my ass, too...!

     And he realizes he's said it too loud, a couple of passing
     students stop, looking at him...

     INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, CBS - DAY

                         LOWELL
               Oh, my God.

                         WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (after a beat, lowering his
                    voice, but contentious)
               You're not even on this anymore...  What
               do you care?

                         LOWELL
               Jeff!  Wake the fuck up!  Everybody is on
               the line here.  If they can catch you in
               a lie, they can paint everything with
               that brush.  Do you understand?
               Everything you say!

                         WIGAND
               I told the truth!

                         LOWELL
               Everything...you...say!  And I can't
               defend you, man, with one hand tied
               behind my back!  Because you keep from
               me...what they can discover.  And they
               will discover everything!  Believe me.

     INT. THE PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

     Wigand's quiet.  He looks out the phone booth.  After some
     moments...

                         WIGAND
                   (meaning his first wife and
                    their child, upset)
               ...I was young.  I was
               young...confused...  We didn't handle it
               the right way...

     INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, NEW YORK - DAY

                         LOWELL
                   (after a beat)
               She sued you for back payments of child
               support?

     INT. THE PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

                         WIGAND
               She did not sue me.  We had a dispute
               over money...  I settled it, she dropped
               the complaint...
                   (angry)
               Any other questions?

     And we'll go back and forth...

                         LOWELL
               Yes.  Did you lie about being on the
               American Judo Team in the Olympics?

                         WIGAND
               What?

                         LOWELL
               Some public relations guy got a hold of a
               tape of an interview...where you're
               saying you were on the American Judo Team
               in the Olympics...?

                         WIGAND
                   (explosive)
               What kind of shit is this?  I was not on
               the team, I sparred with the Olympic
               Team...okay?

     And we see, unbeknownst to Wigand, the P.I. in the raincoat,
     who interviewed his ex-wife, coming out of an administration
     office, walking towards us along the hallways...

                         LOWELL
               Alright...the ABC Telemarketing Company?

                         WIGAND
               ABC...?

                         LOWELL
               ABC Telemarketing Company.

                         WIGAND
                   (the absurdity)
               A can opener!  A $39.95 can opener.  I
               cancelled payment...  It was junk.
                   (sarcastic)
               You ever bounce a check, Lowell?  You
               ever look at another woman's tits?  You
               ever cheat a little on your taxes?
                   (a beat, angry)
               Whose life, if you look at it under a
               microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?

     The P.I. in the raincoat passes Jeffrey, now, and doesn't
     even glance at him...

                         LOWELL
               That's the whole point, Jeffrey.  That's
               the whole point.  Anyone's.  Everyone's.
               They are gonna look under every rock, dig
               up every flaw, every mistake you've ever
               made.  They are going to distort and
               exaggerate everything you've ever done,
               man.  Don't you understand?

                         WIGAND
                   (shouts)
               What does this have to do with my
               testimony?

                         LOWELL
               That's not the point.

                         WIGAND
               What does this have to do with my
               testimony?!  I told the truth!  It's
               valid and true and provable!

                         LOWELL
               That's not the fucking point, whether you
               told the truth or not!  Hello...?

                         WIGAND
               I told the truth...  I told the truth.

     And Wigand's quiet, a deep, dark depression.  The school bell
     RING snaps him out of it...

                         WIGAND
                   (after a beat)
               I've got to teach class.  I've got to go.
               I've got to teach class.

                         LOWELL
                   (undaunted)
               And I've got to refute every fucking
               accusation made in this report before The
               Wall Street Journal runs.
                   (a beat)
               I am trying to protect you, man!

     Wigand's quiet.

                         WIGAND
                   (after a beat, the killer)
               Well, I hope you improve your batting
               average.

     And he SLAMS the phone down.  And as he stands in the phone
     booth, like a man in a glass booth, all alone...

     EXT. CBS BUILDING, ROOFTOP - DAY

     ON the door to the roof.  It SLAMS open.  An enraged Lowell
     enters and walks out into the cold rain.  Like a prize-
     fighter, shoulders hunched against the cold, he buries his
     hands in his jacket pockets.  He crosses to the edge of the
     roof high above the city.  He's pissed off.  He takes out his
     cell phone.  He dials...  Lowell hears background NOISE...

     INT. WALL STREET JOURNAL - NEWS MEETING - DAY

     Twenty sub-editors and section heads sit and stand in a clear
     area...  One of them, a large man, is CHARLIE PHILLIPS on a
     cell phone.

                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS
               Hello?

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (cautious)
               It's Lowell.  Are you guys planning to do
               a piece on a former top executive in Big
               Tobacco?

                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS
               You caught me in a news meeting.

                         LOWELL
               Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?

                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS
               You bet we are.  And I can't talk to you
               now.

                         LOWELL
               We gotta hook up.

                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS
               Sure.  Where?

                         LOWELL
               P.J.'s.

                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS
               I'll be there.

     INT. A PHONE BOOTH, NEW YORK - NIGHT

     A busy New York street.  Light mist.  And we see Lowell is on
     the phone in a phone booth...

                         LOWELL
               Yeah, I got it.  500 pages of it.  They
               looked in every corner of this guy's
               life...from a spousal abuse charge, to
               shoplifting, to a traffic ticket he got
               once for running a red light.  It's Terry
               Lenzner's outfit, IGI.  Jack, listen to
               me.  Their strategy:  discredit this guy,
               ruin his reputation in The Wall Street
               Journal, and then nobody will ever listen
               to what he's got to say about tobacco.
               He's dead.  Unless I can get this thing
               knocked down.

     INT. A HOUSE IN SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

     A townhouse with a commanding view of the Bay.  And we see a
     broad-shouldered man in his late forties sitting at a desk on
     the phone.  JACK PALLADINO.  His wife, SANDRA SUTHERLAND,
     sitting across from him on another phone.  They're Private
     Investigators...

                         LOWELL
               To make it even a little more attractive,
               I don't know if you're ever gonna get
               paid.

                         SANDRA SUTHERLAND
               Is there any truth to any of it?

                         LOWELL
               That's a good question.  "Is there any
               truth to any of it?"  I doubt it.

                         PALLADINO
               What's their deadline?

                         LOWELL
               Soon.

     Palladinos exchange looks; she nods.

                         PALLADINO
               Fax me the summary.

                         LOWELL
               That's great, Jack.

     Lowell hangs up and walks towards us to enter...

     INT. BAR - NIGHT

     CLOSE on Lowell entering, moving through the crowd of sports
     writers, feature writers, sub-editors, etc.  He comes upon a
     rugged-featured man, JIM COOPER from The New York Times,
     sitting next to Charlie.

                         JIM COOPER
               Hey, Lowell.

                         LOWELL
               How are you, Jim?

                         JIM COOPER
               Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting
               on something sensational over there.

     Lowell looks at Cooper quizzically.

                         LOWELL
               Really?  Hi, Joan.

     Just then Jim's wife enters.  They exchange greetings.

                         JIM COOPER
               Hi, baby.

                         LOWELL
               Catch you later.

     Cooper and his wife leave.  Charlie and Lowell are alone in
     the crowded bar.

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
               When's your deadline?

                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS
               Monday.

                         LOWELL
               Push it.

                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS
               What?  Forget it.

                         LOWELL
               It's a smear campaign, Charlie.

                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS
               It's drawn from a selectively
               circulated...

                         LOWELL
                   (cuts in)
               Oh, it's real selective...about as hard
               to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone
               book.

                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS
               Well, it's authoritative and is
               overwhelmingly documented.

                         LOWELL
               And it's bullshit.  And if I'm right, are
               you going to put the Journal's reputation
               behind a story that's going to blow up in
               your face?

                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS
               I'll take a look at what you got.  But I'm
               not moving any deadlines 'cause you say
               so.

     That's the way it lays.  In a different, personal tone...

                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS (cont'd)
               Are you all right?

                         LOWELL
               Yeah.  Catch you later.

     INT. A COFFEE SHOP, LOUISVILLE - DAY

     And we see a Policeman sitting at the counter having a cup of
     coffee...

                         SANDRA SUTHERLAND
               Officer Murabchick?

     He turns as Sandra Sutherland sits at the counter to the left
     of him.

                         SANDRA SUTHERLAND (cont'd)
               Officer Muravchick.  How are you?  I'm
               Sandra Sutherland.

                         POLICEMAN
               How do you do?

                         SANDRA SUTHERLAND
               Fine, thank you.  I'm doing a background
               check.  Mind if I sit down?

     INT. COURTROOM, LOUISVILLE - LATE AFTERNOON

     An older Man is on the bench.  He's just recessed his court.
     As everybody streams out, going against the tide is Jack
     Palladino.  He approaches the judge, crossing to a side
     door...

                         PALLADINO
               Your honor, could I have a word with you?
               You presided in a dispute over support
               payments...

     INT. A COFFEE SHOP, LOUISVILLE - DAY

                         POLICEMAN
               Jeffrey Wigand?  Yeah, I cited him.

     INT. EDITING ROOM, CBS - DAY

                         DAN RATHER
                   (on monitor)
               CBS is under criticism, because the CBS
               News program "60 Minutes" will not be
               presenting an interview...

     Lowell's destroying his own work product, taking apart his
     creation that we saw earlier to be so impactful.  Tony gets a
     call as Hewitt enters.

                         DON HEWITT
               What the hell are you doing?

                         LOWELL
               What does it look like I'm doing?  I'm
               editing.

                         DON HEWITT
               No, not that.  I'm talking about the
               Associated Press.  They got this story
               that we pulled this interview and they
               talked to Mike and I.  Did you tell them
               that we were lying?

                         LOWELL
               No.  I should have.  I told them I
               disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that
               this segment is as good as the original.
               I'm not lying for you.  I'm not gonna
               shut up for you.  Not on any of it.

                         DON HEWITT
               Hey!  I'm not going to fire you, okay?
               Take a vacation.  Now!

     INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE - EVENING

     A suitcase is on the floor.  Lowell, finishing packing up his
     things from his office.

                         MIKE WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER)
               Lowell.  I decided to preface Sunday's
               show.  I did three minutes on the
               "Evening News."  You'll want to see it.
                   (beat)
               Where you going?

     And he sees Wallace has stopped at his door...

                         LOWELL
               I've been banished.  In lieu of being
               fired.

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (disinterested)
               I took off on Tisch.  I took off on
               corporate.  They'll know they're not
               going to see everything on Sunday
               night...

                         LOWELL
               I don't know.  How does that get Wigand
               on the air?

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (goes up)
               Do me a favor, will you?  Spare me, for
               God's sake.  Get in the real world.  What
               do you think?  I'm going to resign in
               protest?  To force it on the air?  The
               answer is "no."  I don't plan to spend
               the end of my days wandering in the
               wilderness of National Public Radio.
                   (beat)
               That decision I've already made.

                         VOICE
                   (from corridor; to Mike)
               It just started, Mike...

     Wallace waves Lowell's remark aside and exits.  We dwell on
     Lowell until he exits...

     INT. CBS CORRIDOR - EVENING

     ...into the hall.  Dan Rather introduced Mike.  As Lowell
     exits, we SEE Hewitt, Kluster and Caperelli outside of
     Hewitt's office watching...  Lowell, disgusted, takes a
     cursory look and moves towards the elevator.  But he hears...

                         MIKE WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER)
               Where's the rest?  Where the hell's the
               rest?!!

     Lowell turns to see Wallace shouting up at the monitors in
     disbelief...

                         MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D)
               You cut it!  You cut the guts out of what
               I said...!

     Wallace moves in on Kluster...

                         ERIC KLUSTER
               It was a time consideration, Mike...

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Time?  Bullshit!  You corporate lackey!
               Who told you your incompetent little
               fingers had the requisite skills to edit
               me!  I'm trying to Band-Aid a situation,
               here, and you're too dim to...

                         HELEN CAPERELLI
                   (interrupts, familiar)
               Mike...  Mike...  Mike...

                         MIKE WALLACE
               "Mike?"

     It was a big mistake.  Now, he turns on her.  Zeroing in,
     getting closer...

                         MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D)
               "Mike?"  Try "Mr. Wallace."  We work in
               the same corporation doesn't mean we work
               in the same profession.  What are you
               gonna do now?  You gonna finesse me?
               Lawyer me some more?  I've been in this
               profession fifty fucking years.  You and
               the people you work for are destroying
               the most-respected, the highest-rated,
               the most-profitable show on this network!

     EXT. THE EAST RIVER - NIGHT

     A Range Rover pulls up.  Charlie Phillips gets out.  He
     crosses to Lowell who's been waiting by his own taxi.

                         LOWELL
               Here.

     He hands Charlie a folder with the brown notebook inside that
     is the partially complete Palladino/Sutherland/Lowell work
     product.

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
               These are their leads, their sources.  I
               want you to have your reporters...

                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS
               Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.

                         LOWELL
               Have them make their own calls.  They'll
               find that these sources have a different
               story than the one that's in the
               dossier...
                   (demands)
               Push the deadline, Charlie...

     Charlie starts looking through the Palladino/
     Sutherland/Lowell work product.  Meanwhile...

                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS
               I'll push it for a week.  Let Milo and
               Suein go through it.

                         BARBARA
               He's into kind of little cars, that...

                         LIANE
               That remote control thing?

                         BARBARA
               Yeah.

                         LIANE
               Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.

                         BARBARA
               Mom.

                         LIANE
               Yes, baby?

                         BARBARA
               There's Dad, on TV.

     INT. A BAR, LOUISVILLE - DAY

     And we see Jeffrey in a quiet Bar.  The television's on, the
     sound low, the midday news.  As Jeffrey looks up and sees his
     photograph on TELEVISION.  In his LOCAL WORLD the impact is:

                         LOCAL NEWSCASTER
               And in local news, WLKO Louisville has
               gained access to a five-hundred-page
               dossier on former Brown & Williamson
               research head Jeffrey Wigand detailing
               charges of spousal abuse, shoplifting...

     And Jeffrey looks as if something just detonated inside of
     him.

     WE'RE LOOKING AT MIKE WALLACE SITTING IN FRONT OF A BACKDROP
     ON "60 MINUTES," ON A TELEVISION...

     INT. HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

     And Jeffrey sitting alone in the hotel, watching the show...

                   (on "60 Minutes")
               "...thousands of documents from inside

     INT. MIKE WALLACE'S APARTMENT, NEW YORK - NIGHT

     Mike Wallace is in his study, watching the show alone.  As we

               "...if were to broadcast an interview
               with him, CBS could be faced with a
               multibillion-dollar lawsuit..."

     INT. HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

     Jeffrey, watching the show...

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (on "60 Minutes," from the
                    interview with Wigand...)
               "The fact is, we are not allowed even to
               mention his name or the name of the
               company he worked for and, of course, we
               cannot show you his face...  '...and your
               confidentiality agreement with...(blip)
               is still in force?'"

     And all we can hear is an ELECTRONICALLY-ALTERED VOICE and
     the BLANKED-OUT image of a man...

                         WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER)
               "Yes, it is."

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (on "60 Minutes")
               "So, what are they gonna do?  Sue you for
               making this appearance?"

                         WIGAND
               "I would bet on it."

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (on "60 Minutes")
               "The former executive has reason to bet
               on being sued, for major cigarette
               manufacturers..."

     Jeffrey, motionless...  A man, no longer with a face or a
     voice...  And as he gets up, and quietly turns off the
     television...

     INT. MIKE WALLACE'S APARTMENT, NEW YORK - NIGHT, LATER

     Wallace, hasn't moved, still in his chair.  He stares,
     ignoring the CBS programming, on the phone, making a call...

     EXT. THE CARIBBEAN BEACH - NIGHT

     Lowell, walking up the sand, his cell phone rings.

                         LOWELL
               Yeah.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               You disappeared on me.  How long you
               staying?

                         LOWELL
                   (absurd)
               I disappeared on you?

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (meaning the show)
               Alright.  What did you think?

                         LOWELL
                   (after a beat)
               I think it was a disgrace.

     The look on Wallace's face says he thinks so, too.  It's
     obvious.  He hangs up the phone.

     EXT. LOWELL'S BUNGALOW, THE CARIBBEAN - NIGHT

     Lowell is on the phone, now.  The moon lights the water, the
     empty beach.  He listens as a phone, through STATIC, RINGS
     and RINGS and RINGS.

     INT. WIGAND'S HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

     And we hear the phone RINGING.  We slowly PAN across the
     hotel room.  We see on the floor a pair of men's tasseled
     loafers...  A discarded sport jacket...  And we see Jeffrey,
     barefoot, sitting in a chair in the center of the room.  He's
     looking out the window at B&W.  The curtains are blowing...
     And he's still...  The sound of the phone RINGING and
     RINGING...

     EXT. THE BEACH, THE CARIBBEAN - NIGHT

                         AN OPERATOR'S VOICE (OVER)
               Sir, there's still no answer in that
               room.

                         LOWELL
               Alright.  Get me the manager's office...

     INT. THE HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

                         HOTEL DESK CLERK
               David?  David, you've got a call on line
               4.  I think you better take it.

     A thin Man answers the phone.

                         THE HOTEL MANAGER
               This is David MacDougal.  How can I help
               you?

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
               Mr. MacDougal, my name is Lowell Bergman.
               I'm a producer for "60 Minutes"...
               I'm concerned with a friend of mine who's
               staying at your hotel right now.

     INT.  THE HOTEL CORRIDOR, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

     And we see the Hotel Manager, walking along with a Security
     Guard, and now KNOCKING on Jeffrey's door...

     And when there is no response, the Manager nods to the
     Security Guard, the Guard using a pass key, unlocking the
     door.  But the door stops, the chain-lock drawn.  The Manager
     looks in through the chain...and he can see Jeffrey sitting
     in the chair...

                         THE HOTEL MANAGER
               Mr. Wigand?  Mr. Wigand?

     Jeffrey's still.  The Manager quickly takes a cell phone from
     the Security Guard.

     EXT. THE CARIBBEAN - NIGHT

     Lowell, standing on the beach anxiously waiting.

                         THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (upset)
               I think I need to call the police.  He
               won't respond...

                         LOWELL
               No, no.  Don't call the police!
                   (urgent)
               Just tell him I'm on the phone with
               you...  My name is Lowell Bergman...
               Just tell him that.

     INT. THE HOTEL CORRIDOR, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

                         THE HOTEL MANAGER
                   (through the door, frightened)
               Mr. Wigand...Mr. Bergman is on the
               telephone.

     Jeffrey's quiet.

     EXT. THE CARIBBEAN - NIGHT

                         LOWELL
               Did he hear you?

                         THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE (OVER)
               You're breaking up.  I can't hear you.

     Lowell goes deeper into the water.

                         LOWELL
               What about now?

                         THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE (OVER)
               What?

                         LOWELL
               Hello, can you hear me now?

     INT. WIGAND'S HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

     And now the walls behind MORPH into a green daytime garden,
     the garden behind his house.  And as we DOLLY AROUND Wigand,
     more walls MORPH into the side yard, and, turning slowly, he
     sees Barbara and Deborah in the emerald-green grass.  They
     stop and smile, then they stare at us, at their father.  And
     he looks at his children, at an idyll lost...  The chair, the
     man are the only real objects left in the view from inside
     his head...

     EXT. THE CARIBBEAN - NIGHT

     Lowell anxiously moves along the beach, trying to be heard,
     the phone chattering with static...

                         LOWELL
                   (alarmed)
               What's happening?!

                         THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (afraid)
               He doesn't seem to be listening...

                         LOWELL
                   (on the cell phone, shouts,
                    urgent)
               Alright, now listen to me.  I want you -
               I want you to tell him, in these words:
               get on the fucking phone...!

                         THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE (OVER)
               I can't say that!

                         LOWELL
               No, you can.  Tell him to get on the
               fucking phone!

     INT. THE HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

                         THE HOTEL MANAGER
                   (at the door, to Jeffrey, loud)
               He told me to tell you, to get on...the
               fucking phone...!

     And even he's surprised by his language.  And suddenly
     Jeffrey gets up, unlatches the door, grabs the phone from the
     Hotel Manager.  Wigand in the hotel corridor, Lowell standing
     knee-deep in the water...

                         WIGAND
                   (on the phone, angry)
               You manipulated me into this...!

                         LOWELL
               That's bullshit, Jeff!

                         WIGAND
               You greased the rails!

                         LOWELL
               I greased the rails for a guy who wanted
               to say yes.  I helped him to say yes.
               Alright.  You're not a robot, Jeff!
               That's all.  You got a mind of your own,
               don't you?

                         WIGAND
                   (running on)
               "Up to you, Jeffrey.  That's the power
               you have, Jeffrey.  Vital insider
               information the American public need to
               know."  Lowell Bergman, the hot show who
               never met a source he couldn't turn
               around.

                         LOWELL
                   (running on)
               I fought for you...and I still fight for
               you.

                         WIGAND
               You fought for me...?!
                   (running on)
               ...you manipulated me...into where I am
               now...staring at the Brown & Williamson
               Building.  It's all dark.  Except the
               10th floor!  That's the legal department.
               That's where they fuck with my life!

                         LOWELL
                   (beat)
               Jeffrey, where you going with this?  So
               where you goin'?
                   (quiet)
               You are important to a lot of people,
               Jeffrey.  You think about that.  You
               think about them.

     CLOSE ON JEFFREY:  standing in the room with the blowing
     curtains...

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
               I'm running out of heroes, man...
                   (after a beat)
               Guys like you are in short supply.

     And for the first time, Wigand smiles.

                         WIGAND
                   (a beat, wry)
               Yeah, guys like you, too.

     And the grave situation passes.

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
                   (after a beat)
               Where are you, anyway?

                         LOWELL
               I'm on a leave of absence.  Forced
               vacation.

                         WIGAND
                   (a rare laugh, his sarcasm)
               You try and have a good time.

                         LOWELL
                   (droll)
               Yeah.  Yeah, I will.

     INT. THE CARIBBEAN BUNGALOW - DAY/NIGHT

     Sharon's cooking across the room...  And there's just the
     sound of the ceiling fan turning.

                         LOWELL
               "I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60
               Minutes.'"  You know, you take the "60
               Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody
               returns your phone call.  Maybe Wigand's
               right.  Maybe I'm hooked.  What am I
               hooked on?  The rush?  "60 Minutes"?
               What the hell for?  Infotainment.  It's
               so fucking useless, all of it.

                         SHARON
                   (a beat)
               So, it's a big country with a free press.
               You can go work somewhere else.

                         LOWELL
               Free press?  Press is free...for anyone
               who owns one.  Larry Tisch has a free
               press.

                         SHARON
               Get some perspective, Lowell.

                         LOWELL
               I got perspective.

                         SHARON
               No, you do not.

                         LOWELL
               From my perspective, what's been going on
               and what I've been doing is ridiculous.
               It's half-measures.

                         SHARON
               You're not listening.
                   (beat)
               Really know what you're going to do
               before you do it.

     And as the fan squeaks, turning...  Lowell stares at Sharon.

     WE SEE SNOW IS ON THE GROUND.

     EXT. LINCOLN, MONTANA - DAY

     Between two curved colonnades of SNOW-covered trees drives a
     rental car.  CLOSER, it's Lowell.  His POV spots a dirty SUV
     and he pulls into park across from a coffee shop in this out-
     of-context mountain town.  His pager beeps.  He looks at it.
     He detours from the coffee shop to a pay phone on the corner
     of the Moose Lodge.

                         DEBBIE DELUCA'S VOICE (OVER)
               I've got Richard Scruggs on the phone...

                         LOWELL
               Patch him through.

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS' VOICE (OVER)
               Well, Lowell, you are not going to
               believe this...

     INT. A COURTROOM + ROTUNDA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

     And we see the back of a crowded courtroom.  Richard Scruggs
     is standing in the rear amongst bailiffs an witnesses,
     talking on his own cell phone.

                         RICAHRD SCRUGGS
               The Governor of Mississippi is suing his
               own Attorney General...to abandon
               litigation against Big Tobacco...

                         LOWELL
               Oh, good...

     Waiting media are relaxing as Scruggs continues to Lowell...

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
                   (after a beat)
               But, now that the version without Jeff
               ran...what's the chance of getting his
               interview on the air...?
                   (beat)
               Hello?

     Sudden STATIC.  Scruggs now exits the building, past the
     metal detector, seeking better reception.

                         LOWELL
               Yeah, I'm here.

     EXT. COURTHOUSE STAIRS, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
               What chance is there of getting Jeff's
               interview on the air...?

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (droll)
               Less than great.

     And the courthouse doors suddenly burst open, Michael Moore
     and his attorneys coming out.  Scruggs comes further down the
     steps so he can hear, away from Michael Moore who begins
     answering questions from the Press.

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
                   (after a beat)
               ...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell
               you how important it was in the court of
               public opinion...

               ...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't
               tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
               All right.  See you...

     INT. CAFE, LINCOLN, MONTANA - DAY

     Lowell walks right in and up to a booth and a COUPLE in
     hiking pants and hiking boots.  They look up at him...

                         LOWELL
               Hi.  So, what are you folks doing here in
               Lincoln?

     And we sense something is all wrong here.

                         MAN GEOLOGIST
                   (affable)
               Geology survey.

                         LOWELL
                   (nods)
               Geology.  Yeah?  Really?

                         WOMAN GEOLOGIST
               How about you?

                         LOWELL
                   (direct)
               I work for CBS News.

                         MAN GEOLOGIST
                   (after a beat)
               Oh, yeah?

     Lowell nods.  They look at each other and they both know
     there's a lot more than meets the eye.  And as Lowell gets up
     and leaves...

     EXT. A PAY PHONE, LINCOLN, MONTANA - DAY

     And we see Lowell on the PAY PHONE again.

                         LOWELL
               Just ran into two of your "geologists."
               Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed
               up...?

                         BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE (OVER)
               Lowell?

     INT. THE FBI, BILL ROBERTSON'S OFFICE, WASHINGTON - DAY

     And we see Bill Robertson's on the phone...

                         BILL ROBERTSON
               Do not...screw this up.  We are a week
               away from an arrest...

     EXT. THE PAY PHONE, LINCOLN, MONTANA - DAY

                         LOWELL
               So, I'll hold it...  And...

                         BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (on the phone)
               We'll give you a heads up before we
               launch.

                         LOWELL
               How long?

                         BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE (OVER)
               Three hours.

                         LOWELL
               You got a deal.
                   (hangs up)

     INT. LOWELL'S ROOM, MOTEL, MONTANA - NIGHT

     Lowell is in a T-shirt and sweat pants, sitting in an old, re-
     upholstered-one-too-many-times chair in a room barely big
     enough for a chair, a bed and the TV/VCR combo on the cheap
     dresser.  It's playing Lowell's cut of the full Wigand
     interview.  He watches the show that will never see the light
     of day.

                         MIKE WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER)
               "...like the testimony before Congress of
               Dr. Wigand's former boss, Brown &
               Williamson's Chief Executive Officer,
               Thomas Sandefur."

                         THOMAS SANDEFUR
                   (in CLOSE-UP)
               "I believe that nicotine is not
               addictive."

                         WIGAND
                   (in matching CLOSE-UP)
               "I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured
               himself...  Because I watched those
               testimonies very carefully."

     Then it cuts to all seven CEOs of Big Tobacco raising their
     hands and taking the oath in front of Congress to tell the
     truth while...

                         WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER)
               "All of us did...there was this whole
               like of people, the whole line of CEOs up
               there, all swearing that."

                         WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER)
               "Part of the reason I'm here is I
               FELT..."

     And the PAUSE after the word makes "FELT" resound, and as it
     CUTS TO Jeffrey ON CAMERA saying...

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
               "...that their representation..."

     And Lowell FREEZES after the image...  He gets up, looking
     out the window through the curtain with the spill from the
     neon motel sign.  Outside are horse trailers.  He goes back
     to watching the show...standing there...in touch with his
     own creative work product and the ideas inherent in it in
     this decision-making process that we feel is critical to him.
     Turning, he dials the phone and we intercut with...

                         JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER)
               Hello?

     INT. NEW YORK TIMES - NIGHT

               Hey!  Where are you?

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (doesn't answer)
               Remember that night at P.J.'s?  You asked
               me if we were sitting on something
               "explosive"?
                   (beat)
               Well, we're not "sitting on" it.
                   (beat)
               CBS corporate leaned on CBS News which
               yanked an interview we did with a top-
               ranking tobacco scientist.  A corporate
               officer.  They are trying to close down
               the story.

                         JIM COOPER
                   (sarcastic)
               You mean, "60 Minutes" is letting CBS
               corporate decide what is or is not news?
                   (beat)
               What's Wallace think about this, or
               Hewitt, or...?

                         LOWELL
               How prominent?  What kind of placement?

                         JIM COOPER
               Oh, c'mon, Lowell.  This is The New York
               Times.  I don't know...

                         LOWELL
               Well, until you do, all I can tell you is
               what you already know...they will not air
               an interview.

                         JIM COOPER
               Call me back in ten.

     Lowell hangs up.  Re-dials.

     INT. DEBBIE DELUCA'S APARTMENT - NEW YORK - LATE NIGHT

     Debbie answers, intercutting with above...

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
               Debbie.  It's me...

                         DEBBIE DELUCA
               Hi.  What time is it?

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
               Oh, it's late.

                         DEBBIE DELUCA
               That I know.  When are you coming back?

                         LOWELL
               I can't get out of here til mid-morning.
               I'll be in tomorrow night...
                   (beat)
               Listen, could you call a number for me,
               it's in Mississippi...

                         DEBBIE DELUCA
               Okay.  Hold on a second...  What is it?

     INT. NEW YORK TIMES - NIGHT

     Jim Cooper's workstation.  His phone rings.  He grabs it.

                         JIM COOPER
               Hello?
                   (beat)

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
               Lowell.

                         JIM COOPER
               Alright, Lowell.  Page one.  Editorial's
               interested.  Let's talk.

     INT. MOTEL, LINCOLN, MONTANA - NIGHT

                         LOWELL
               Here's how it works.  You ask me
               questions.  I tell you if you're wrong.

                         JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER)
               Okay.
                   (pause)
               Lowell?

                         LOWELL
               Yeah?

                         JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER)
               You're sure you want to do this?

                         LOWELL
               Why?

                         JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER)
               Hey, it doesn't work?  You've burned your
               bridges, man.

                         LOWELL
               You ready...?

                         JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER)
               Okay...  About this whistle-blower...
               Did Mike and Don go along with the
               corporate decision?

     No answer.

                         JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER)(cont'd)
               Lowell?

                         LOWELL
               Did I tell you you were wrong?

                         JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER)
               No.
                   (beat)
               I'm assuming the cave-in begins with the
               threat of litigation from Big Tobacco.
               Are we talking...are we talking Brown &
               Williamson, here?

     MOVING CLOSER into the face of Lowell.  His gaze falters.
     His eyes go back to the motel TV mutely frozen on the show.
     Whatever he's seeing there, his gaze is steadfast.

     EXT. STREET, NEW YORK - 5:30 A.M.

     Newspaper box is loaded with The New York Times.

     EXT. HOTEL, NEW YORK - 5:30 A.M.

     Cab pulls to curb and a raincoated Man emerges.  We SEE he
     carries a copy of this morning's New York Times.

     INT. A HOTEL ROOM, NEW YORK - DAWN

     A suitcase is half-unpacked on the floor...a sleeping
     figure...  There's a knock.  Irritated, a sleeping Lowell
     gets up to answer it.  He looks through the security peep
     hole.  He opens it.  And Mike Wallace, a newspaper under his
     arm, is standing in the doorway.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Did I get you up?

                         LOWELL
               No, I usually sit around in my hotel
               room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the
               morning, sleepy look on my face.

     There's an awkward quiet.  Mike enters.  He slows, looks
     around.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               How many shows have we done?  Huh?
               C'mon, how many?

                         LOWELL
               Oh, lots.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Yeah, that's right.

                         LOWELL
               But in all that time, Mike, did you ever
               get off a plane, walk into a room, and
               find that a source for a story changed
               his mind?  Lost his heart?  Walked out on
               us?  Not one fucking time!  You want to
               know why?

                         MIKE WALLACE
               I see a rhetorical question on the
               horizon.

                         LOWELL
               I'm going to tell you why.  Because when
               I tell someone I'm going to do something,
               I deliver.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell
               Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down
               the shining path.  To show me the way.

                         LOWELL
               Oh, please, Mike...

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (beat)
               Give me a break!

                         LOWELL
               No, you give me a break!  I never left a
               source hung out to dry, ever.  Abandoned.
               Not 'til right fucking now!  When I came
               on this job, I came with my word intact.
               I'm gonna leave with my word intact.
               Fuck the rules of the game!  Hell, you're
               supposed to know me, Mike.  What the hell
               did you expect?  You expect me to lie
               down?  Back off?  What, get over it?

                         MIKE WALLACE
               In the real world, when you get to where
               I am, there are other considerations...

                         LOWELL
               Like what?  Corporate responsibility?
               What, are we talking celebrity here?

                         MIKE WALLACE
               I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS.
               I'm talking about when you're nearer the
               end of your life than the beginning.
               Now, what do you think you think about
               then?  The future?  "In the future I'm
               going to do this?  Become that?"  What
               "future"?  No.  What you think is:  how
               will I be regarded in the end?  After I'm
               gone.

     He trails off.  They look at each other.

                         MIKE WALLACE (cont'd)
               Now, along the way I suppose I made some
               minor impact.
                   (beat)
               I did Iran-Gate and the Ayatollah,
               Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Saddam,
               Sadat, etcetera, etcetera.  I showed
               them thieves in suits.
                   (beat)
               I've spent a lifetime building all that.
               But history only remembers most what you
               did last.  And should that be fronting a
               segment that allowed a tobacco giant to
               crash this network?
                   (beat)
               Does it give someone at my time of life
               pause?
                   (simply)
               Yeah.

     And the look on Wallace's face is "It did.  Whether it should
     or should not...what difference does that make?  It did."
     And we realize only now that he has not come to argue.

                         LOWELL
               Mike...in my...

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (low)
               You and I have been doing this together
               for fourteen years.

     And he gives Lowell a copy of The New York Times.

                         MIKE WALLACE (cont'd)
               This is today's New York Times.
                   (beat)
               In it is the whole sordid story of what
               went on inside our shop.

     Lowell looks down at the page.  The headline is "'60 MINUTES'
     ORDERED TO PULL INTERVIEW IN TOBACCO REPORT."

                         MIKE WALLACE (cont'd)
               And in the editorial...  It accuses
               us...of betraying the legacy of Edward R.
               Murrow.

     Turning, he walks out and down the hallway.  Lowell looks at
     the newspaper.

     INT. THE COMMUTER HELICOPTER - MORNING

     The helicopter approaching Manhattan.  John Scanlon sitting
     with Hewitt, both of them reading The Wall Street Journal
     Wigand article.

                         DON HEWITT
                   (troubled)
               They conclude most of it seems pretty
               unsubstantiated...
                   (looking at him, sickened)
               You're full of shit, John.

     INT. COFFEE SHOP, NEW YORK - MORNING

     Lowell at a table littered with New York Times, New York
     Daily News, etc.  His phone rings...

                         LOWELL
               Yeah.

     INT. A CITY BUS, NEW YORK - MORNING

     Broadway backgrounds streak past Debbie DeLuca's head as she
     rides, talking on a cell phone, The Wall Street Journal in
     her hand.

                         DEBBIE DELUCA
               ...front page.  There's a picture of
               Wigand.  Article's entitled, "Getting
               Personal," by-lined to Suein Hwang and
               Milo Geyelin.  Wait, hold on a second,
               Lowell.

     Debbie hits "call waiting."

                         DEBBIE DELUCA (cont'd)
               Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  I'll see if I can
               find him.  Hold on...
                   (beat; to Lowell)
               Yeah, Don's looking for you...

                         LOWELL
               Good.

                         DEBBIE DELUCA
               The sub-heading is, "Brown & Williamson
               Has a 500-Page Dossier Attacking Chief
               Critic."
               It quotes Richard Scruggs calling it "the
               worst kind of an organized smear campaign
               against a whistle-blower."

     INT. COFFEE SHOP, NEW YORK - MORNING

     EXTREMELY CLOSE Lowell.

                         DEBBIE DELUCA'S VOICE (OVER)
               "...a close look at the file, and
               independent research by this newspaper
               into its key claims, indicates that many
               of the serious allegations against Mr.

               contradictory evidence..."

     EXT. STREET, NEW YORK - MORNING

     As Lowell hails a cab in a WIDE ANGLE and runs towards us,
     jumping into the cab...

     INT. DON HEWITT'S OFFICE - DAY

                         DON HEWITT
               The news division has been vilified in
               The New York Times, in print, on
               television, for caving to corporate
               interests!

     We PULL BACK and we see that Lowell's with Hewitt in Hewitt's
     office...

                         DON HEWITT (CONT'D)
               The New York Times ran a blow by blow of
               what we talked about behind closed doors!
               You fucked us!

                         LOWELL
                   (shouting)
               No, you fucked you!  Don't invert stuff!
               Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you
               bought it.  The Wall Street Journal,
               here, not exactly a bastion of anti-
               capitalist sentiment, refutes Big
               Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest
               form of character assassination!  And
               now, even now, when every word of what
               Wigand has said on our show is printed,
               the entire deposition of his testimony in
               a court of law in the State of
               Mississippi, the cat totally out of the
               bag, you're still standing here debating!
               Don, what the hell else...do you need?

     And Hewitt, looking around.

                         DON HEWITT
               Mike, you tell him...

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (simply)
               You fucked up, Don.

     And Don's taken off stride...

                         DON HEWITT
                   (recovers fast)
               Hey, it's old news!  Stick with me.  Like
               always, we'll be okay.  These things have
               a half-life of fifteen minutes...

                         MIKE WALLACE
               No, that's fame.  Fame has a fifteen-
               minute half-life...
                   (droll)
               Infamy...lasts a little longer.

     Lowell looks at Wallace.

                         MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D)
               We caved.  It's foolish.  It's simply
               dead wrong.
                   (in his face, so there's no
                    doubt)
               Now, this is what we're going to do.
               We're going over to Black Rock...

     INT. A HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE CLASS, LOUISVILLE - AFTERNOON

     Jeff is in front of his class, teaching...

                         WIGAND
               Okay, so let's get back to it.  Alright,
               now, what we saw there was...

     INT. LAX - ECU:  LOWELL - NIGHT

     Tired, his suitcase at his feet.  We don't know if he's
     coming or going.  He's at a pay phone in the more-deserted-
     than-not airport.

                         LOWELL
                   (into phone)
               They cancelled the six o'clock.
                   (beat)
               I don't know why.  I'm on the 8:10.  I
               should be home...9:30.  I'll see you
               then.  Love ya'.  Bye...

     He hangs up and ambles over to a lounge with a few travellers
     sitting in it.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               "CBS Management wouldn't let us broadcast
               our original story and our interview with
               Wigand because they were worried about
               the possibility of a multi-billion dollar
               lawsuit against us for tortious
               interference...  But now things have
               changed."

     INT. JEFFREY WIGAND'S APARTMENT, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

     A small apartment.  Jeffrey dishes out second helpings of
     pasta primavera into two pasta plates and brings them into
     the kitchenette to his girls, Deborah and Barbara.  And now
     we SEE AND HEAR the small television on the table playing "60
     Minutes" and...

                         MICHAEL MOORE
                   (on television)
               "...in my opinion, is an industry that
               has perpetrated the biggest fraud on the
               American public in history."

     Deborah looks proudly at her father.

     Wigand's gotten up and gone out of the kitchenette.  He has
     stopped for a moment around the corner in the hallway.  His
     kids can't see him.  We can.  And he watches them and his
     eyes get shiny and start to tear.  And as he stands there,
     watching his girls at the kitchen table witnessing their
     father's hard-earned "truth" on television, we realize that
     of all the audiences, his girls are the one he cares about
     most...

     INT. AIRPORT LOUNGE

     And Lowell in his moment of victory is watching his "60
     Minutes" double segment on a departure lounge television with
     his feet resting on his suitcase, next to a Chicano woman
     with two kids and her mother and an older man with a beard
     and cane.  An airport cleaner stops to watch, too.  Lowell
     glances at him...

     Unbeknownst to these viewers, arrested by the content on the
     television screen, is that the man who made it sits casually
     among them, watching his work.

     INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, KITCHEN, BERKELEY - NIGHT

     Sharon sits at the kitchen table.  She watches in a far
     corner a small countertop television.  It's "60 Minutes," the
     full show entitled "Jeffrey Wigand, Ph.D." and on the top
     right, "PRODUCED BY LOWELL BERGMAN."  As Sharon continues
     watching the television playing on the counter, the emotional
     currents within her remaining unrevealed...

     INT. MIKE WALLACE'S STUDY - ON MIKE WALLACE - NIGHT

     watching the show.  He sees himself...

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (to Wigand)
               "You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"

                         WIGAND
                   (on television, hesitating)
               "There are times...I wish I hadn't done
               it.  But there are times that I feel
               compelled to do it..."
               "I've - if you asked me if I would do it
               again or if it's - do I think it's worth
               it.  Yeah.  I think it's worth it."

     Wallace, satisfied, rises to refill his glass, as...

     INT. AIRPORT LOUNGE

     Lowell watching show in airport.

     INT. A SURVEILLANCE VAN, LINCOLN, MONTANA - NIGHT

     And we see the FBI Agent, BILL ROBERTSON on the phone.

                         BILL ROBERTSON
               I promised you a three-hour heads-
               up...well, here it is.  Have a camera
               crew standing by in Helena, Montana on
               Tuesday and I'll give you a three-hour
               head start.  Alright?  By the way, that
               was a hell of a good show tonight...

     INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BERKELEY - NIGHT

                         LOWELL
                   (nods, trustworthy)
               Thank you, Bill.

     And he quietly hangs up.  And it's still.  Sharon's laid
     down, closing her eyes.  They lie close together.  After some
     moments, she opens her eyes and lets us know what she's been
     thinking...

                         SHARON
                   (understated)
               You won.

     This time he isn't droll.

                         LOWELL
               Yeah?
                   (a beat)
               What did I win?

     There's an odd look on his face, not the look of a victor.
     He shuts off the light.  And as they lie close together in
     the dark in each other's arms...

     WE'RE LOOKING AT THE FAMILIAR CBS EYE ON A TELEVISION SCREEN.
     AND THEN THE WORDS:  "SPECIAL REPORT."

     INT. MASTER CONTROL ROOM, CBS - DAY

     Lowell, entering through machine rooms, into a state-of-the-
     art Master Control Room.  On a wall are fifty or more
     monitors, in the humidity-and-temperature-controlled nexus of
     CBS operations.  And it's jammed with people, witnessing a
     fast-breaking, major news event.  Mike Wallace stands near
     Felling.  Lowell crosses past Felling and stands next to Mike
     Wallace.

     And we see footage of a handcuffed, bearded, barefoot
     Man...THEODORE KACZYNSKI, the UNABOMBER, being taken in by
     the FBI.  A director counts down.  Dan Rather launches...

                         DAN RATHER
               "Reporting from CBS World News
               headquarters in New York, good afternoon.
               There has been a major break in the case
               of the so-called 'Unabomber.'  CBS News
               has learned that a remote homesite
               outside Lincoln, Montana has been under
               FBI surveillance..."

                         BILL FELLING
               Thanks for this.  You know, we beat
               everybody.  ABC, NBC, CNN.

     Mike motions Lowell out into the corridor so they can be
     alone.

     INT. CORRIDOR, CBS - DAY

     The control room and crowd are seen through the glass wall.
     After some moments:

                         MIKE WALLACE
               That Canada story?  Still interest you?

                         LOWELL
                   (nods)
               Everything interests me.

     Mike nods...  Lowell puts his hands in his jacket pockets...
     After some moments...

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
               I quit, Mike.

     Mike's startled.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Bullshit.

     Lowell shakes his head "no."

                         MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D)
               C'mon, it all worked out.  You came out
               okay in the end...

                         LOWELL
               I did?  What do I tell a source on the
               next tough story?  Hang in with us.
               You'll be fine...maybe?

     They look at each other.  Lowell says to Mike, intimately,
     what he knows Mike knows...

                         LOWELL (cont'd)
               What got broken here...doesn't go back
               together again.

     Lowell's heartfelt regret.  He starts to leave.  They look at
     each other.

                         LOWELL (cont'd)
               So, uh...

     And Lowell moves off along the hallway, the monitors all
     showing CBS programming.  He doesn't even look back...

     INT. A JEEP, LEBANON - DAY

     And we're in a speeding SOVIET JEEP...  Two men in front,
     shouldering assault rifles.  HEZBOLLAH SOLDIERS...  And there
     are three MEN in the back.  A middle-aged Man wearing a tired
     suit and tinted sunglasses trying to hold on.  And on either
     side of him, two Men, blindfolded.  The man on one side is in
     his forties, hands pressed in the pockets of a well-travelled
     black-leather jacket...  A stocky man, with the edge of a
     J.D. Salinger character, he's seen everything at least once.
     But even he has lost some of his self-confidence, here,
     turning his head, sensing the wind, a blast of Arabic music
     that disappears behind him...  He's LOWELL BERGMAN.  On the
     other side of the man in the tired suit is a lanky Man with a
     voltmeter around his neck, NORMAN.

     EXT. THE BEQA'A VALLEY, BAALBEK, LEBANON - DAY

     The Jeep races up narrow winding streets of a Lebanese
     village.  It's shadowed by a Jeep in front, and in back, each
     carrying personnel armed with AK's and a few RPG's...  And in
     the third Jeep are two blindfolded, not very threatening
     Lebanese soldiers.  And as the speeding convoy passes a
     captured Israeli Armored Personnel Carrier covered with
     Arabic graffiti, looking down on them from huge murals are
     the stern visages of the Ayatollah Khomeini, and a Hezbollah
     religious leader, the Sheikh Fadlallah...  And, suddenly the
     convoy skids to a stop...  And blindfolded Lowell and Norman
     are roughly taken out, and pushed, stumbling, through the
     cloud of dust without sight...  The lanky cameraman is
     stopped, told to wait, while Lowell is pushed past armed men
     guarding a small stone house, and inside...

     INT. A HOUSE IN LEBANON - DAY

     A round-faced Man in his mid-forties, with large-framed
     glasses, black hair and a grey-black beard, wearing a
     dullbend, a turban, sits informally at a kitchen table...
     It's the Sheikh Fadlallah whose face stares out at us from
     walls.  A Gunman cradling an AK-47 sits in an incongruous
     purple armchair in a corner.  A torn poster of the Seychelles
     is on one wall.  Another Gunman stands by a window.  Lowell
     is sat down in a chair at the kitchen table...

                         THE SHEIKH
               Coffee?

                         LOWELL
               Yeah...  Thank you.

                         THE SHEIKH
               How have you liked your stay?

                         LOWELL
                   (droll)
               What I've seen...I've liked.

     The Sheikh smiles.  And the smile passes as quickly as it
     came.  A steaming cup of coffee in a small Arabic demitasse
     is put down.

                         THE SHEIKH
               Please to explain, why I should agree to
               interview...with pro-Zionist American
               media?

                         LOWELL
               Because I think Hezbollah is trying to
               broaden into a political party right now.
               So you care about what you're thought of
               in America.  And in America, at this
               moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a
               face.
                   (confident)
               That's why.

     And we've first realized this man is not a hostage; he's come
     here voluntarily.

                         THE SHEIKH
               Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity
               and I see the questions first.  Then I
               decide if I grant the interview.

                         LOWELL
                   (blunt)
               No.  We don't do that.
                   (beat)
               You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike
               Wallace.  So you know our reputation for
               integrity and objectivity.  You also know
               we are the highest-rated, most-respected,
               TV-magazine news show in America.

     The Sheikh quietly looks out his glasses at him, studying
     him.  And Lowell "closes":

                         LOWELL (cont'd)
               So.  Mr. Wallace.  Should he get on a
               plane or not?

     The Sheikh thinks it over and then...

                         THE SHEIKH
               Tell him I will see him day after
               tomorrow.

                         LOWELL
               That's good.  That works.
                   (after a beat)
               Uh, you know, I want to ask you
               something...I know it sounds odd...but...

     It's quiet...too quiet...

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
               Hello, Sheikh...?
                   (no answer)
               Hello, Sheikh...?

     Silence.  He hesitates, starts to lift his blindfold...  He
     lifts it.  And he sees the Sheikh, and his gunmen, are gone.
     The house empty.  Only his Cameraman, the lanky man, left
     there, standing by the door still in his blindfold...

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
               Norman.

                         NORMAN
               What?  What?

                         LOWELL
               Take your blindfold off.

     The lanky man does and we see the cameraman is Asian-
     American.

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
                   (sarcastic)
               Welcome to the world.

     Norman gives Lowell an ironic look and tests the local
     current at an electrical outlet.

                         NORMAN
               Fluctuating all over the place.  Anywhere
               we shoot, here, it's gonna be portable
               gennies and we'll run cable...

     Lowell nods and opens the curtains from this commanding
     height.  Baalbek and the Beqa'a Valley below gold-domed
     mosques.  A moment of triumph.  He dials his cell phone...

                         MIKE WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER)
               Hello?

                         LOWELL
                   (into phone)
               Mike, it's me.  We're on...

     AND WE HEAR PEOPLE LAUGHING AND ENCOURAGING "GO AHEAD...
     OPEN IT..."

     INT. A LABORATORY, BROWN & WILLIAMSON, LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY
     - DAY

     We're in a SCIENCE LABORATORY...  OUT OF FOCUS LAB
     TECHNICIANS, in white lab coats, celebrating a heavyset Black
     woman's birthday...  Half her presents are opened.  Balloons,
     incongruous, floating above the lab...  And there's a sense
     that somebody is watching...  And from the waist up, a
     disembodied figure comes into FOCUS behind a glass partition,
     as if quarantined, isolated, an expressionless MAN in his
     late forties, watching them...

     INT. JEFFREY WIGAND'S OFFICE - DAY

     The office soundproofed, he watches the people laughing,
     their lips moving.  His hair not yet settled on grey, his
     face is changing, always interesting.  Born in the Bronx,
     educated in Upstate New York, he retains little of the accent
     and much of the directness.  He's JEFFREY WIGAND.  He turns
     to resume gathering things from his desk...some technical
     books, a medical text on asthma...putting them in his
     briefcase.  And as he leaves the office, the silent party
     like a bizarre mime behind him...

     INT. LOBBY, BROWN & WILLIAMSON BUILDING - DAY

     Briefcase in hand, Jeffrey appears from the elevator from
     ABOVE, from WIDE and in FRONT, his eyes, frozen pools...  And
     like a bad dream, a broad-shouldered Man, leaning against the
     wall near the reception island in a suit he's not comfortable
     in, wearing an earphone, saying something into a lapel
     microphone after Jeffrey's passed.

     INT. WIGAND'S CAR, LOUSIVILLE - DAY

     Light mottled through trees reflects off the car window...
     Jeffrey's face goes in and out of the tunnel of light and
     shadow...down this tasteful, suburban Louisville street of
     neat houses and manicured lawns...  He pulls into driveway
     behind a 3 series BMW.  It's a grey French provincial
     replica...

     INT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, FOYER - DAY

     Jeffrey comes in and a young Girl, six, is watching
     television in the den...BARBARA.

                         WIGAND
               Hi, honey.

                         BARBARA
               Hi, Daddy.

                         WIGAND
               What's new?

                         BARBARA
               Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.

                         WIGAND
               Yeah?  What for?

                         BARBARA
               For reading.

     He pours himself a drink at a wet bar.

                         WIGAND
               That's great...  Little early for
               cartoons, isn't it?

                         BARBARA
               Okay.

     Dutiful, she shuts off the TV, going upstairs.

                         BARBARA (cont'd)
               Deborah?  Debbie?

     He looks outside.  A Woman is sitting on the back porch
     drinking wine, reading a paperback book, drinking wine.
     There's something like a Hockney painting about her against
     the manicured lawns.  Right now the Woman comes in.  She's
     pretty, tall, languid, reserved, somebody it would be nice to
     wear on your arm.  LIANE WIGAND.  She has an odd delay
     between a thought and her speech...

                         LIANE
               Oh, I didn't know you were home...  It's
               early...  Isn't it?

     He doesn't say anything...

                         LIANE (CONT'D)
               Gotta take Debbie to ballet...

     And it all feels suburban, familiar.  Suddenly there's a
     shout...

                         BARBARA'S VOICE (OVER)
               Mommy!

     Jeffrey goes quickly up the stairs into...

     INT. WIGAND'S HOUSE - DEBORAH'S BEDROOM - DAY

     And a little girl, eight, sitting on the floor in a ballet
     leotard, her head back, wheezing, her neck muscles
     contracting and bulging, her face pale, lips white, and her
     eyes filled with fear as rapid, shallow breathing induces a
     sense of suffocation.  DEBORAH WIGAND is having a severe
     asthmatic attack...

                         WIGAND
               Sweetheart, c'mon.  C'mon.

                         BARBARA
               She was playing with my Pooh doll
               again...

     Jeffrey sits her on the side of her bed next to which is a
     Nebulizer, an air compressor to deliver medication via a tube
     into a circular mouthpiece.

     The compressor whirs.  Deborah breathes in the medication.
     Jeffrey brushes the hair back from her face and wipes
     perspiration from her forehead as...

                         WIGAND
               Slow down.  Slow down.  Slow down.
               Breathe deep.  Breathe deep.  Slow down,
               honey.  Slow down.  Slow down.

     Liane rushes in with rolled-up towels, kneels in front of
     Deborah, smiling to mask anxiety, and goes into the bathroom
     with the towels and turns on full blast the bathtub's hot
     water.  We don't know why yet...

     Deborah's chest heaves.  She's scared.  Jeffrey gets in front
     of her and talks to her to arrest her attention.

                         WIGAND (cont'd)
               Here we go.  Deep breaths, deep breaths.

                         BARBARA
               She was playing with the Pooh doll.

                         WIGAND
               Pooh's dusty, sweetheart...he's dusty,
               and you breathed him in, okay?  So what's
               - what's happening to you now is... cells
               called mast cells told your lungs "don't
               breathe any more of that dust in."
                   (beat)
               ...and the airways in your lungs are like
               branches.  And when the branches close
               up, you get an asthmatic attack.  And, we
               give you medicine, and you get better.
               Huh?  Okay?  You're better already,
               aren't you?

     And the medication's taking effect and she's calmer.

     Liane, hands clutched in her lap, smiles at Deborah.  Now she
     takes Deborah's hand and exchanges a look with Jeffrey.
     Jeffrey's a good father, a natural caregiver.

                         WIGAND (cont'd)
               Okay, baby?

     INT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - EVENING

     Jeffrey, Liane and the two Girls silently eating dinner,
     Deborah in a bathrobe.

                         DEBORAH
               Can I go to dance tomorrow?  I'm
               better...

                         LIANE
               ...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to
               soccer and take you to dance after...

                         WIGAND
               I can take her.

                         LIANE
               Don't you have to be at the office?

                         WIGAND
                   (instead, getting up)
               Is there any more rice...?

                         LIANE
                   (nods)
               Yes, it's on the stove...

     He goes into the kitchen, to the stove, seeing...

                         LIANE (cont'd)
               Do you want more rice?

                         DEBORAH
               Maybe later.

                         LIANE
               How about you?

                         BARBARA
               I'll take some.

                         WIGAND
               Instant rice...?

                         BARBARA
               Can I go over to Janeane's house?

                         LIANE
               I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my
               coffee mug...?

                         WIGAND
               Try the car.

     And Liane going outside...

     EXT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE - EVENING

     She opens Jeffrey's car looking in the front seat at the cup
     holders.  She turns to leave and sees the backseat filled
     with two boxes and the books we saw him take...

                         LIANE
               Uh, what are those boxes?

                         WIGAND
               I'm going to the store.  You need
               anything?

                         LIANE
               What do you need at the store?

                         WIGAND
               Soy sauce...

                         LIANE
               Right now?

                         WIGAND
                   (meaning in the car)
               That's my stuff from the office...

                         LIANE
               Why did you take your stuff from the
               office?

                         WIGAND
                   (simply)
               I didn't want to leave it there...

                         LIANE
                    (confused)
               I don't understand.

                         WIGAND
                   (matter of fact)
               I got fired this morning...  Where else
               am I gonna take it?

                         LIANE
               Why?  Who said?

                         WIGAND
                   (specifically)
               Thomas Sandefur...

                         LIANE
                   (stunned, fearful)
               What are we supposed to do...?  What
               about our medical coverage; what about
               our health?  What about our car payments?
               The payments on this house?

     He looks at her.  There's an unspoken moment when it seems
     he's desperate for her to ask how he's feeling...  But she
     doesn't and now there's a wall up and the moment passes...

                         WIGAND
                   (a beat, specific)
               There's a severance agreement...  It
               includes cash payouts over time and
               continuing medical coverage...
                   (beat)
               Sure you don't need anything?

                         LIANE
               No, thank you.

     She's stunned.  He leaves.  And as Liane's completely still,
     her accessories seeming literally to weigh her down, she
     wants to ask how he is, how he must be feeling, and she turns
     into CAMERA towards him to do that.  But he's driven off down
     the street.

                         LIANE (cont'd)
               Jeffrey...!

     INT. ANOTHER HOUSE IN BAALBEK - DAY

     The Sheikh, wearing a fresh white robe and skull cap, comes
     into the room...

                         THE SHEIKH
               I am very pleased to receive you as my
               guest, Mr. Wallace.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Thank you for having us...

     REVERSE:  Norman's camera crew is setting up.  MIKE WALLACE
     is there.  A dangerous combination of intelligence,
     arrogance, and celebrity, there's a kinetic quality about
     him.

     Wallace sits across from the Sheikh on a dais of patterned
     linoleum in incongruous armchairs against a wallpaper mural
     of a French formal garden.  A Sound Technician wires the
     Sheikh and Mike with microphones.  Norman says something to
     Lowell and then goes out.

                         NORMAN
               I think I've got a problem with the
               gennie.  I have to go outside.

                         LOWELL
                   (going outside)
               Norman...?

     Mike turns his chair to face and slides it closer to the
     Sheikh's chair.  The Head Bodyguard barks something in
     Arabic.  The Interpreter says something back in Arabic.  The
     Sheikh, absorbed in his notes for the upcoming interview,
     ignores all of this.

                         INTERPRETER
               He says you must not sit so close.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               What?
                   (re:  Bodyguard)
               I can't conduct an interview from back
               there.

     The Bodyguard, bristling at Wallace's tone, barks more
     confrontational Arabic.

                         INTERPRETER
               You must move back your chair.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Will you tell him that when I conduct an
               interview, I sit anywhere I damn please!

                         INTERPRETER
               There is no interview.

     As Mike leaps forward, moving inches from the Bodyguard's
     face with such sudden ferocity, even the Bodyguard flinches.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               You!  I'm talking to you!

     More armed men start to enter.

                         MIKE WALLACE (cont'd)
               What the hell do you think I am?  A 78-
               year-old assassin?  You think I'm gonna
               karate him to death with this notepad?
                   (to Interpreter)
               Are you interpreting what I'm saying?

                         INTERPRETER
               Yes.

                         LOWELL
               We're there.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Good, well ask him if Arabic is his
               second language.

                         LOWELL
                   (to Interpreter)
               Don't interpret that!
                   (to both)
               Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it!  Slow,
               slow!!
                   (to the Sheikh)
               Sheikh, do you mind...if you would just
               turn your chair a little bit to face Mr.
               Wallace?

     The Sheikh looks up from his notes, nods, fixes his chair,
     goes back to his notes...

                         LOWELL (cont'd)
               Is that okay?

                         INTERPRETER
               Okay.

                         LOWELL
                   (Bodyguard assents; to Mike)
               Are you ready?  Or you want to keep
               fucking around and warm up some more...?

                         MIKE WALLACE
               No.
                   (wry)
               ...that's got my heart started.

     They know each other well.  Lowell smiles.  Wallace sits
     down.

                         LOWELL
               Alright, Todd, give me the three-button
               on Mike, please.  Okay.  We are rolling.
               Okay, Mike.

     They roll camera...  "60 Minutes"...  "Hezbollah"...

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (charming)
               Sheikh Fadlallah, thank you so much for
               seeing us.
                   (changes)
               Are you a terrorist?

     The Sheikh didn't expect the Mike Wallace opening shot
     between the eyes.  He recovers...

                         THE SHEIKH
               Mr. Wallace, I...am a servant of God.

     That expression of incredulity...

                         MIKE WALLACE
               A servant of God?  Really...

     Mike, tipping his glasses down while the hostile Gunmen,
     cradling weapons, watch him through the doorway...

                         MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D)
               Americans believe that you, as an Islamic
               fundamentalist, that you are a leader who
               contributed to the bombing of the U.S.
               Embassy.

     The ballsiness of Wallace, asking these questions in this
     place, is impressive...

     EXT. BERKELEY - LATE MORNING

     It's still.  A MAIL TRUCK is stopped at an odd angle in the
     street outside an older brick house with a bold redwood Big
     Sur-like fence on a hillside.  Beyond the truck is a forever
     view of the Bay.  A handle turns.  Mail truck door opens.
     Mailman, carrying a box, going through the gate.  Doorstep.
     Box is deposited there.  It's quiet again.  The BOX sitting
     nakedly by the front door...

     INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BEDROOM, BERKELEY - LATE MORNING

     Lowell, in sweat pants and an old tee shirt now, is on the
     telephone, still in bed...  Newspapers, The New York Times,
     The Wall Street Journal, San Francisco Chronicle, are spread
     all over...home as refuge.  A tray with large cups of coffee
     is on a side table.

                         LOWELL
               ...everyone thinks Canadian Mounties
               ride horses and rescue ladies from
               rapids, Mike.  They backed locals in Oka
               in a fight with Mohawks over building a
               golf course on their burial site.  They
               beat up protesters at Kanasake...
                   (pause)
               Where'd you hear that?

     The other phone on a nightstand rings...  A Woman in her
     forties, SHARON TILLER, enters, in a bathrobe, brushing her
     teeth.  She answers it...

                         LOWELL (cont'd)
                   (droll)
               Oh, someone took a poll?  "Are all things
               Canadian boring...?"

                         SHARON
                   (to Lowell)
               It's Stuart...he's in Mexico City...

                         LOWELL
               Let me call you back...

     He takes up the line...listening...

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
               Yeah, Stuart...  What New York bank?

     A young Man in his early twenties wanders in...

                         JAKE
               Hey Dad...Sharon...

     Lowell waves at JAKE, his son.

                         SHARON
                   (to Jake)
               No classes this morning?

                         LOWELL
               Will he go on-camera and talk about the
               Mexico City branch?

                         JAKE
               I don't have to be there until ten-
               thirty.

     Lowell's son sits on the bed looking at part of a newspaper.
     And another young Man, in his early twenties, with long hair
     comes strolling in, Sharon's son, JOSIAH.

                         JOSIAH
               Hi Mom, Lowell...

     Lowell, still on the phone, waves to him.

                         SHARON
               Hi, sweetheart...

     Josiah sits on the bed too, reading the back of the sports
     section Jake is reading...  Another line rings, Sharon
     getting it.  The Boys, used to them, get up, and leave...

                         LOWELL
                   (into phone)
               Will independent sources corroborate
               that?

                         SHARON
               Hello?  Yeah...

     EXT. THE BERKELEY HOUSE - MORNING

     The Boys coming out of the house together...  And seeing the
     BOX by the door...

                         LOWELL'S SON
                   (shouts back inside)
               Dad, you got a box out here...

     And they go out the gate, talking, walking off along the
     Berkeley street.  The box left waiting by the door.

                         LOWELL
                   (looking at her itinerary)
               Let me see this...  No, 'cause I gotta
               know where you're going at all times.

     INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BEDROOM, BERKELEY - MORNING

                         SHARON
                   (into phone)
               I can't...  I've got to fly to Boston
               tomorrow.

     Lowell comes with the box back to bed.  He's already
     unwrapped it.  Inside are stacks of papers...  He looks at
     the box cover.  No return address.  An anonymous sender; not
     unusual for him.  He casually looks through the papers.

                         SHARON (CONT'D)
               Two p.m.  Great.  Bye-bye.
                   (hangs up)

                         LOWELL
                   (reading)
               ..."ignition propensity?"
                   (to Sharon)
               ...you understand any of this...?

     He gives her some papers.  We see formulas...scientific data
     in tables...

                         SHARON
               ...no...this looks like a table of
               temperatures...  Who's this from?

                         LOWELL
                   (shrugs)
               ...it's anonymous.  References to "P.M."
                   (motions)
               It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?

                         SHARON
               I have to take a shower.

     As he looks at the papers, Sharon goes into the bathroom...

     INT. THE FEDERAL DRUG ADMINISTRATION AGENCY, CAFETERIA,
     WASHINGTON - DAY

     We see a MAN in his forties, eating a late lunch, getting
     paged in a crowded cafeteria.  An old 1930's WPA mural on the
     wall...  His pager goes off...

     Doug Oliver walks across the cafeteria to a bank of pay
     phones and dials.

     INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, DEN - BERKELEY - MORNING

     The phone rings.  Lowell picks it up...

                         LOWELL
               Yeah.

                         DOUG OLIVER
                   (into phone)
               Hi, this is Doug Oliver...

                         LOWELL
               Oh, hi, Doug...it's Lowell.  I'm doing
               this story on fire safety...  People
               burning up from falling asleep smoking.
               I received a shitload of scientific
               papers from inside Philip Morris...
               Anonymous.  You or anybody in FDA know
               someone who can translate this stuff into
               English for me?

                         DOUG OLIVER
                   (beat)
               ...uh, yeah...

     EXT. A BERKELEY CAFE - CLOSE:  PAY PHONE

     There's the sound of a phone ringing.  PULL BACK to reveal
     Lowell outside a cafe with dry cleaning he collected over one
     shoulder.  A LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE OVER (Deborah's) answers.
     "Hello."

                         LOWELL
               Mr. Wigand, please.

     There's a whisper..."Someone's calling for Daddy, Mom."

     Behind Lowell is a humming Berkeley street.  He gestures
     familiarly to a Server, who brings out his two take-out
     cappuccinos.  Lowell nods his thanks, pays...

                         LOWELL (cont'd)
               Thank you, Bob.

                         LIANE'S VOICE (OVER)
               Who's calling?

                         LOWELL
               My name's Lowell Bergman...  I'm --

                         LIANE'S VOICE (OVER)
               Did you say Berman?

                         LOWELL
               No, Bergman...B.E.R.G.M.A.N....  I'm a
               producer with "60 Minutes"...

                         LIANE'S VOICE (OVER)
               "60 Minutes"?

                         LOWELL
               Yeah.

                         LIANE'S VOICE (OVER)
               "60 Minutes," the television show?

                         LOWELL
               Yes.

     Lowell waits for some moments, and...

     INT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - DAY

                        LIANE
                   (on phone)
               He doesn't want to talk to you.

     EXT./INT. BERKELEY CAFE - DAY

                         LOWELL
               How does he know he doesn't want to talk
               to me?  He doesn't know what I'm calling
               him about...

                         LIANE'S VOICE (OVER)
               He doesn't care to know.

     And she hangs up.  Lowell's motionless...  And his interest
     piqued, he sets down his cleaning.  He calls back...  The
     phone rings and rings...  A MACHINE picks it up...  Jeffrey
     Wigand's Voice:  "This is the Wigands'...  If you'd like to
     leave a message or send a fax, start now..."

     INT. THE WIGAND HOUSE, JEFFREY'S OFFICE, LOUISVILLE - DAY

     And we see Jeffrey Wigand, sitting at his desk in his office,
     working on his computer, hearing Lowell...

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (on the machine)
               This is Lowell Bergman with "60
               Minutes"...  I'm doing a story on fire
               safety and cigarettes...  I have
               scientific documents from a tobacco
               company, and I could use your help as a
               consultant explaining these documents to
               me...  My number is area code 510-555-
               0199...  I'll be there, at this number,
               in 10 minutes.

     He hangs up.  Jeffrey doesn't react, quietly working on his
     computer.

     INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, BERKELEY - DAY

     Lowell's restless, waiting...  And not getting a call back,
     he tries another tact.  He writes a FAX, "Please call me
     at..."  He writes his number down.  He sends the Fax.  He's
     still.  It's quiet.  And not getting an answer he gets up,
     starting to leave the room.  And suddenly the fax machine
     RINGS...  He turns.  He reads a message emerging from the
     machine..."I can't talk to you..."  He's quiet.  He writes on
     a piece of paper..."Can't talk to me?"  "Won't talk to me?"
     "Don't want to talk to me...?"  As he faxes it back...

     INT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, OFFICE, LOUISVILLE - DAY

     Wigand reading the return fax from Lowell...

     INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, BERKELEY - DAY

     Lowell, waiting...  The fax machine rings again...  He reads
     Jeffrey's answer.  "Can't."  "Won't."  "Don't want to..."
     He's quiet, more than just interested, now.  There's
     something beyond intriguing here.  He turns.  He looks
     through a stack of phone books for something...a nationwide
     800 directory.  He looks through it and dials Wigand's phone
     number again...

                         LOWELL
               If you're curious to meet me...

     INT. WIGANDS' HOUSE, OFFICE, LOUISVILLE - DAY

     Wigand working on his computer...  Lowell's VOICE on his
     answering machine...

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (on machine)
               ...I'm gonna be in the lobby of the
               Seelbach Hotel in Louisville, reading The
               New York Times, tomorrow, at five
               o'clock...

     Lowell clicks off.  And as Wigand sits at his computer,
     giving no indication what he might do...

     INT. THE SEELBACH HOTEL LOBBY, LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY - EARLY
     EVENING

     An old hotel with faded carpets.  Lowell in the lobby reading
     a New York Times, waiting...  And instead of looking up every
     time somebody passes, he looks down at people's shoes.  A
     pair of black wing tips walking by...  A woman's high
     heels...  A pair of men's tasseled loafers.  A lace-up brown.
     A pair of tennis shoes.  A cordovan wing tip.  The pair of
     tasseled loafers walking by again...  And Lowell looks up...

     And the Man in the tasseled loafers, turns away...  It's
     Jeffrey Wigand in a suit and a tie with a Fortune 500,
     corporate-executive bearing...  Lowell crosses to the
     elevators.  Wigand looks around the lobby and follows Lowell
     in, and as the doors close...

     INT. A HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - EARLY EVENING

                         LOWELL (OVER)
               Have you always lived in Louisville?

     Brilliant late afternoon sunlight.  We PULL BACK to see
     Jeffrey, standing by a window, silently looking outside to
     the left...  Lowell, cool, waiting, hands in his pockets, in
     the middle of the large room...

                         WIGAND
               Mr. Bergman?  What did you want me to
               consult about?

     A sudden KNOCK on the door...

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
                   (turns, suspicious)
               Who's that?

                         LOWELL
                   (wry)
               That's room service.  They usually knock
               first.
                   (calls)
               Come on in...  Over here, please.

     Room Service brings in a tray with coffee.  As Lowell signs
     the bill, the Room Service Waiter waiting, looks at Wigand...
     Their eyes meet...  The Waiter looks away.

                         LOWELL (cont'd)
               Thank you.

     And the Waiter leaves...

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
                    (pouring)
               How do you like your coffee?  Black?

                         WIGAND
               Black, black...

     Lowell gives him his cup of coffee.

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
               Look, I really don't have that much
               time...

                         LOWELL
                   (nods)
               Is there anything you want to know about
               me, Mr. Wigand...?

                         WIGAND
               Like what?  Your sign?

     Lowell smiles.

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
               I know what I have to know.

                         LOWELL
               Just so I know you know, when I talk to
               people in confidence, it stays that way.

                         WIGAND
                   (abruptly)
               How did a radical journalist from
               Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS?

     Lowell looks at him, he does his homework...

                         LOWELL
               I still do the tough stories.  "60
               Minutes" reaches a lot of people.

     Wigand's quiet, measuring him.

                         WIGAND
                   (after a beat)
               Let me see the documents...

     Lowell gives him the box of papers...  Wigand sits down, the
     box on his lap, quietly looking through them...flips to a
     different heading, consults a chart...

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
               ...this is a Fire-Safety Product Study
               for Philip Morris.  Burn rates...ignition
               propensity...things of this nature.
                   (after a beat)
               I could very easily explain this to you
               in layman's terms, because it's from
               another company...

     He puts the papers down...

                         WIGAND (cont'd)
               ...but that's as far as I go...

                         LOWELL
               Far as you go where?

                         WIGAND
                   (a beat)
               This issue is a drop in the bucket.  I
               can talk to you about what's in here.
               But I can't talk to you about anything
               else.

     And Lowell knows something else is going on here...

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
                   (meaning Philip Morris
                    documents)
               I signed a confidentiality agreement.  I
               honor agreements...

     A lot more is going on here...  Lowell nods, a good
     reporter...

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
               Doesn't CBS have confidentiality
               agreements, Mr. Bergman?

                         LOWELL
               Between journalists and management, yes,
               I believe they do...but I don't take that
               seriously.
                   (after a beat)
               Where do you work?

                         WIGAND
               Did work.

                         LOWELL
                   (fast)
               Did work.

                         WIGAND
                   (the bottom line)
               How much would I get paid?

                         LOWELL
               That, you have to discuss with CBS
               Business Affairs.  But, for something
               like this, I would say anywhere between
               10, 12 thousand.

     Wigand nods "Okay."

                         WIGAND
               Should I just take the documents now?

                         LOWELL
               If you want to do it.

     He turns to leave...  Lowell gets the door for him...  Wigand
     momentarily slows...

                         WIGAND
               I worked as the head of Research and
               Development for Brown & Williamson
               Tobacco Company.  I was a Corporate Vice
               President.  Mr. Bergman...

     And he goes out the door...  Lowell's still.  Wigand's job
     title resonates.  Lowell turns to the window, casually
     looking into the early evening...and he comes face to face
     with what Wigand was staring at, The Brown & Williamson
     Tobacco Company Headquarters Building, lit up right across
     the street...

     INT. CBS, A SCREENING ROOM - DAY

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (on screen)
               "President Assad of Syria said that
               difficult obstacles remain but that his
               country, quote, 'looks forward to a
               great, long peace with Israel.'"

     TAIL LEADER.  THEN BLACK.  Suddenly lights come on.
     Executive Producer DON HEWITT is suddenly on his feet.  A
     veritable dervish, in constant motion...

                         DON HEWITT
                   (kissing Mike)
               It's a Peabody, Mike.  When you're dead
               and buried, Hezbollah is the one they're
               gonna remember you for...

     Mike, used to him, ignores him, getting up, turning to leave,
     Hewitt on his tail...while...

                         LOWELL
                   (to his Editor)
               ...come in earlier on Mike's Marine
               barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh
               Mussawi...

                         MIKE WALLACE
               You eating with us?

                         LOWELL
               Yeah.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Bring a tie so they'll let us in the
               front door...

     And Lowell gestures for an olive-skinned Woman in her late
     thirties, Lowell's assistant, DEBBIE DELUCA, to join them.
     The eye contact on the way out says there's something
     important he needs to tell her...

     EXT. CBS - DAY

     There's a blast of NOISE.  The City.  Lowell, Wallace,
     Hewitt, Debbie, enter from the CBS lobby, moving through the
     reflections.  Lowell is about to say something to Debbie, but
     BILL FELLING, Evening News' Assignment Editor, coming the
     other way...

                         LOWELL
               Debbie...

                         FELLING
               Hey, Lowell.

     Midstream, fast:

                         LOWELL
               Oh, Bill...  Main Justice is
               investigating a major New York bank.
               Laundering narco dollars out of their
               Mexico City branch.  You want it for the
               Evening News?

                         FELLING
               What about you, you got a crew already?

                         LOWELL
               I'm gonna do a follow-up.

                         FELLING
               Okay.
                   (leaves)

                         LOWELL
               Catch ya' later.

     EXT. 53RD STREET, NEW YORK - DAY

     Lowell, crossing...

                         LOWELL
               Debbie...

     And, now, as they cross Madison...

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
                   (to Debbie; finally)
               I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE
               CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS.  Boundaries
               of their constraint.  Kentucky state law
               about.  I want you to drop everything.

                         DEBBIE DELUCA
                   (cuts in)
               Okay.

     Hewitt stops to buy a newspaper.  He doesn't have change,
     Debbie does.

     EXT. 55TH STREET (WESTBOUND), NEW YORK - DAY

     And Mike, Lowell and Don bang into Michael's restaurant.  We
     SEE them through the glass, being greeted, people shaking
     their hands, escorted by the maitre d' to their table as...

     INT. THE BROWN & WILLIAMSON BUILDING, MAIN LOBBY,
     LOUISVILLE - DAY

     Meanwhile, it's static.  Still, frozen.  Jeffrey sits in the
     RECEPTION AREA of The Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company
     headquarters.  Complimentary cigarettes are arranged on
     tables.  A dark quiet.  The hush of big business.  Standing
     in the background by a wall next to the banks of elevators,
     is an ever-present Man, another one, with an earphone and
     lapel microphone...

                         UNIFORMED SECURITY
                   (to Wigand)
               Mr. Wigand, you can go up now...

     He gets up, crossing to an elevator.

     INT. THOMAS SANDEFUR'S OFFICE, BROWN & WILLIAMSON - DAY

                         THOMAS SANDEFUR
                   (re:  his distraction)
               Sorry.  I'm accepting an award from the
               Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation.  It's
               going to kill the rest of my day.

     THOMAS SANDEFUR is absorbed in spreadsheets of regional sales
     figures.  Dark pouches are under his eyes.  He doesn't look
     up.  He doesn't look healthy.  We're in a luxurious office
     with a view of Louisville.  Jeffrey is waiting in a chair.
     Sandefur is Brown & Williamson's CEO.  Two LAWYERS, their
     briefcases, like weapons, close at hand, sit on a couch.
     Their jackets are off.  They wear expensive shirts.

                         THOMAS SANDEFUR (cont'd)
                   (finishing; looking up at
                    Jeffrey)
               So.  You had a chance to play golf?

     Surprisingly affable, Sandefur prides himself on his
     salesman's sunny manners.  He has a mellifluous Georgia
     accent...

                         THOMAS SANDEFUR (CONT'D)
                   (to the Lawyers)
               Jeff's a premiere golfer...  What are
               you, a two handicap?

                         WIGAND
                   (precise)
               Seven...

                         THOMAS SANDEFUR
                   (to lawyer)
               And, he gets out there and he has five
               strokes on us.  He has more concentration
               than anybody I've ever met.  It's spooky
               how he can concentrate.

                         WIGAND
               I'd rather play than talk about it.
                   (beat)
               What did you want to see me about?  I
               don't like being back here.

     Sandefur smiles, used to him.

                         THOMAS SANDEFUR
               Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind.
               Most people consider what they're
               saying...social skills...  Jeffrey just
               charges right ahead.
                   (smiles, after a beat)
               Now, I know you understood the nature of
               the confidentiality portion of your
               severance agreement with Brown &
               Williamson, Jeff...

                         WIGAND
               Chapter and verse.

                         THOMAS SANDEFUR
                   (nods)
               Yeah, I know you do...
                   (beat)
               You know, I came up through sales.  One
               of the reasons I was a great salesman,
               was I never made a promise I couldn't
               keep.
                   (beat)
               I knew that if I ever broke my promise
               I'd suffer the consequence...

     And there's a warning behind it...

                         WIGAND
                   (contained)
               Is that a threat?

                         THOMAS SANDEFUR
               ...we worked together for, what was it,
               three years...?
               Now, the work we did here is
               confidential, not for public
               scrutiny...any more than are one's family
               matters...

                         WIGAND
                   (quietly)
               You threatening my family, now, too?

                         THOMAS SANDEFUR
               Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.
                   (a beat)
               About the direction of research here, we
               may have had our differences of
               opinion...

                         WIGAND
               "Research..."
                   (smile + scorn)
               You declare, as a badge of honor, you
               don't even know what makes water boil...

                         THOMAS SANDEFUR
               That's why we hire scientists...

                         WIGAND
                   (interrupts, direct)
               Okay.
                   (a beat, honest)
               I don't believe you can maintain
               corporate integrity without
               confidentiality agreements.  I was paid
               well for my work.  The health and welfare
               benefits are good.  The severance package
               is fair.  I have no intention of
               violating my confidentiality agreement
               and disclosing that which I said I
               wouldn't.

                         THOMAS SANDEFUR
               I appreciate all that, Jeff.  But, upon
               reflection...we've decided to expand our
               zone of comfort with you.

     And there's a seriousness that weighs heavily on the room...

                         THOMAS SANDEFUR (CONT'D)
               So we've drafted a supplement to your
               agreement...it broadly defines and
               expands in more detail what is
               "confidential."  Nobody will be able to
               say, "Well, hell's bells, Margaret, I
               didn't know that was a secret..."
                   (beat)
               We're very serious about protecting our
               interests.
                   (a beat)
               We'd like you to sign it.

     And he's acutely aware of the threat behind it...

                         WIGAND
                   (a beat)
               And if I don't?

                         A LAWYER
                   (speaking for Sandefur)
               If we "arrive" at the conclusion you're
               acting in bad faith?  We would terminate,
               right now, payouts under your severance
               package.  You and your family's medical
               benefits.  And initiate litigation
               against you, Mr. Wigand.

                         WIGAND
               Dr. Wigand.

                         A LAWYER
                   (a beat)
               Dr. Wigand...after you've examined the
               document, you will see it is in your own
               best interest and you'll sign it.

     Jeffrey slowly turns to face the attorney.  And we see on his
     face the true nature of this man.

                         WIGAND
               So, what you are saying is:  it isn't
               enough that you fired me.  For no good
               reason!  Now you question my integrity?
               On top of the humiliation of being fired?
               You threaten me?!  You threaten my
               family?!
                   (beat)
               It never crossed my mind not to honor my
               agreement...
                   (turning, to Sandefur)
               But I will tell you, Mr. Sandefur, and
               Brown & Williamson, too...  Fuck me?
                   (a beat)
               Well, fuck you!!

     And with that he gets up, and leaves...  And it's quiet...

                         A LAWYER
               I'm not sure he got the message...

                         THOMAS SANDEFUR
                   (with total confidence)
               Oh, I think he did.

     EXT. A PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE - DAY

     Wigand picks up the phone and dials.

     INT. THE NEW YORK RESTAURANT - DAY

     They've finished lunch.  Wallace and Hewitt are turned to
     talk to Sam Cohn and an older writer as suddenly Lowell's
     cell phone rings.

                         LOWELL
                   (answering)
               Yeah...

                         WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER)
               ...you fucked me!

                         LOWELL
               Who is this?

     EXT. A PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE - DAY

                         WIGAND
                   (crazed)
               ...protect your sources...!  You screwed
               me!  You sold me out!

     INT. THE NEW YORK RESTAURANT - DAY

                         LOWELL
               What are you talking about?  Where are
               you?

     EXT. THE PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE - DAY

                         WIGAND
               Fuck you, too!

     And he slams down the phone.

     INT. THE RESTAURANT, NEW YORK - DAY

     Lowell, holding the dead phone in his hand...

     EXT. A GOLF DRIVING RANGE, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

     We see a brightly lit, golf driving range, empty, the wet
     grass under the lights vibrant, emerald green...  A caged
     cart, with one big yellow headlight, like some kind of
     strange insect, drives across the range, picking up golf
     balls.  And we see Jeffrey hitting golf balls, driving one
     after another, after another...  His swing is powerful,
     angry, a lone golfer, trying to chill out.  He pauses, spent.
     Settling down, he exhales.  Then, he looks down the way...
     And he slows...  He sees in the far distance, spot-lit, one
     other lone golfer, a Stocky Man, incongruously in a suit and
     tie, watching him...  And the Man in the suit right then,
     with great power and a tremendous follow through drives a
     golf ball...  The ball slamming into the steel net.  And the
     lights SUDDENLY go out.  The range closing for the night.
     The "insect" comes to a stop.  And it's quiet, dark.  Jeffrey
     gathers up his clubs.  He crosses, his golf shoes, the metal
     cleats, clicking on the pavement, toward the PARKING LOT.
     And there's the sound of the clicking of golf shoes behind
     him.  He turns.  And the stocky Man in the suit, carrying a
     golf bag walking some distance behind him, staring at him.
     Jeffrey comes to the parking lot.  It's empty.  Just
     Jeffrey's car, and despite all the empty spaces, another car,
     purposely or otherwise, parked right next to his.  He crosses
     to his car, getting in...

     INT. WIGAND'S CAR - NIGHT

     He drops the three clubs in the rear seat and settles behind
     the wheel.  He turns.  And he sees the Man in the suit has
     gotten in the car next to his.  They look at each other.  The
     Man, in no hurry, lights a cigarette, relaxes.  It's
     malevolent as hell.  And Jeffrey, suddenly, grabbing a golf
     club, jumps out of his car...

     EXT. THE PARKING LOT, DRIVING RANGE, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

     Golf club in hand at the driver side window...

                         WIGAND
                   (motioning with the club,
                    threatening)
               Stay away from me!  You stay away from
               me!

     The Man starts his car, and drives off nonplussed.  It's
     still.  And as Jeffrey with the golf club stands in the empty
     parking lot, not knowing what's threatening him, something
     real, something imaginary...

     EXT. THE WIGAND HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - WIDE SHOT: WIGANDS'
     HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

     A violent rain's falling.  And we see Jeffrey coming out of
     the house holding an umbrella over his little Girls.  They
     start towards the car.  There's the sound of a car door
     shutting.  Liane, carrying lunch boxes, comes after them...

                         LIANE
               Jeffrey, you forgot their lunches --

     She slows, seeing someone.  Jeffrey turns:  it's Lowell.
     He's surprised.

                         LOWELL
               Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?

                         WIGAND
                   (to the girls, protectively)
               Jump in, quick, c'mon...

                         LOWELL
               I'm Lowell Bergman.  We spoke on the
               phone, remember?

     The Girls climb in the car.  Lowell crosses behind the Audi
     around the far side.

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
               C'mere.  I want to talk to you.

                         WIGAND
               Good.  I want to talk to you.

     Jeff closes the door on his daughters and joins Lowell around
     the far side of the car.

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
                   (confronting him)
               What do...

                         LOWELL
                   (running over)
               I did not burn you.  I did not give you
               up to anyone!

                         WIGAND
                   (continuing)
               This is my house...  In front of my wife,
               my kids?!  What business do we have?

                         LOWELL
               To straighten something out with you.
               Right here.  Right now.

                         WIGAND
               So, you didn't mention my name?  You
               haven't talked to anybody about me?

                         LOWELL
               Why am I gonna mention your name?

                         WIGAND
               How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke
               to you...?

                         LOWELL
               How the hell do I know about Brown &
               Williamson?

                         WIGAND
               It happened after I talked to you.  I do
               not like coincidences!

                         LOWELL
               And I don't like paranoid accusations!
               I'm a journalist.  Think.  Use your head.
               How do I operate as a journalist by
               screwing the people who could provide me
               with information before they provided me
               with it?

                         WIGAND
                   (skeptical)
               You came all the way down here to tell me
               that?

                         LOWELL
               No.  I did not.  Big Tobacco is a big
               story.  And you got something important
               to say.  I can tell.
                   (a beat, personal)
               But, yes.  I did.
               I came all the way down here to tell you:
               story, no story, fuck your story, I don't
               burn people.

     It starts to rain harder.  They look at each other.  Jeffrey,
     without saying a word, gets in the Car.  He backs out.
     Lowell, left standing in the driveway with Liane in the rain.
     Liane goes back into the house.  And Lowell starts back
     across the street to his car.  There's a sound.  He turns.
     Jeffrey's car, having gone around the corner, has come back
     and stopped in the street.

                         WIGAND
                   (after a beat)
               Ride with me while I take the girls to
               school...

     Lowell hesitates, then gets into the car in the back seat.

     INT. WIGAND'S CAR - MORNING

     They drive away.  Lowell, incongruously sitting in the back
     seat with Barbara.  Jeffrey and Deborah in the front seat.
     And it's quiet, just the sound of the wipers on the window.
     And as Lowell rides with them...

     EXT. A RIVERSIDE PARKING LOT IN LOUISVILLE - WIDE REAR SHOT
     - MORNING

     We see the Car's parked in a weed-strewn empty lot.  Rain,
     pounding on it and the surface of the river beyond...

                         WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER)
               ...and my little girl has acute asthma...
               Deborah.  My eldest daughter.

     INT. WIGAND'S CAR, LOUISVILLE - REAR TWO SHOT - MORNING

     The Girls are gone.  We enter mid-scene.  Lowell's still in
     the back seat...

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
               And, I'm unemployed.  So I have to
               protect my medical coverage.
                   (the bottom line; turning to
                    look at Lowell in the rear
                    seat)
               ...so I left them a message this morning.
               Their expanded confidentiality agreement?
               I will sign it.

                         LOWELL
               They're afraid of you, aren't they?

                         WIGAND
               They should be.

     The sound of the rain...

                         LOWELL
                   (after a beat, trying to make
                    it easier for him)
               Talk to me outside the zone of your
               agreement?

                         WIGAND
                   (guarded)
               Like what?

                         LOWELL
               Like where'd you work before Brown &
               Williamson?

                         WIGAND
                   (a beat)
               Johnson & Johnson.  Union Carbide in
               Japan.  I was general manager and
               director of new products.  I speak
               Japanese.  I was a director of corporate
               development at Pfizer.  All health-
               related.
                   (wry)
               What else?  Outside the "zone"...?

                         LOWELL
               I don't know...you think the Knicks are
               gonna make it through the semi-finals?

     Wigand smiles...as their eyes meet in the rear view mirror.
     A subtle connection...  It passes...

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. WIGAND'S CAR - WIDE FRONTAL - DAY

     Jeff's car in the field, the giant Colgate-Palmolive clock
     behind.  The rain stopped.  Steam rises from the weed strewn
     empty lot.  Lowell's in the front seat.  And we get the
     feeling they've been talking for hours...

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
               Just give me an example...

                         WIGAND
               For example.  James Burke, the CEO of
               Johnson & Johnson...when he found out
               that some lunatic had put poison in
               Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the
               FDA...  He didn't even wait for the FDA
               to tell him.  He just pulled Tylenol off
               every shelf of every store right across
               America.  Instantly.  And then he
               developed the safety cap...  Because,
               look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a
               great businessman, right?  But he's also
               a man of science.  He's not going to
               allow his company...to put on the
               shelf...a product that might hurt people.
                   (sarcastic)
               Not like the Seven Dwarfs...

                         LOWELL
               Seven dwarfs?

                         WIGAND
               The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco...they got
               up in front of Congress that time...it
               was on television...

                         LOWELL
               ...and swore under oath that they know
               nothing about addiction, disease...

                         WIGAND
               It was on C-SPAN.  Yeah.

                         LOWELL
               Okay, so, here you are...you go to work
               for tobacco.
                   (after beat)
               You come from corporate cultures where
               research, really, creative thinking,
               these are core values.  You go to
               tobacco...  Tobacco is a sales culture.
               Market and sell enormous volume.  Go to a
               lot of golf tournaments.  The hell with
               everything else.
                   (beat)
               What are you doing?  Why are you working
               for "tobacco" in the first place?

                         WIGAND
                   (deadly honest)
               I can't talk about it.  The work I was
               supposed to do...might have had some
               positive effect.  I don't know...it could
               have been beneficial.
                   (bitterness there)
               Mostly, I got paid a lot.  I took the
               money.  My wife was happy.  My kids had
               good medical.  Good schools.  Got a
               great house.
                   (simply)
               I mean, what the hell is wrong with
               that...?

     He looks at Lowell, as if needing validation...

                         LOWELL
               Nothing's wrong with that.  That's it;
               you're making money...you're providing
               for your family?  What could be wrong
               with that?

     It's quiet.  After some moments...

                         WIGAND
               I've always thought of myself...as a man
               of science.  That's what's wrong with it.

                         LOWELL
               Then...you're in a state of conflict,
               Jeff.

     Jeffrey doesn't say anything.

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
               Because, look, here's how it lays out: if
               you got vital, insider stuff the American
               people for their welfare really do need
               to know...and you feel impelled to
               disclose it and violate your agreement in
               doing so, that's one thing.  On the other
               hand, if you want to honor this
               agreement, then that's simple.  You do
               so.  You say nothing.  You do nothing.
               There's only one guy who can figure that
               out for you.  And that's you.  All by
               yourself.

     Lowell's evenhanded...is it too evenhanded?  As Wigand
     contemplates the edge he's standing on, they're quiet.  Then
     Wigand sees the time...

                         WIGAND
               I've got to go pick up the girls.  They
               only had half a day...

     Lowell nods.  Jeffrey starts the car.  The windshield wipers
     screech on a dry window.  Their eyes meet.  As they drive
     off...we HOLD on the Colgate-Palmolive Clock.

     INT. A KITCHEN AREA, CBS OFFICES, NEW YORK - DAY

     We've entered mid-scene...  A monitor on a cart plays a 1/2-
     inch VCR of a C-SPAN broadcast.  Seven CEOs of Big Tobacco...
     in front of a bas relief of the American eagle.  Each in turn
     swears nicotine is not addictive or he doesn't know anything
     about health risks, they're not sure, maybe, maybe not,
     etc....

                         LOWELL (OVER)
               He referred to this...the Seven Dwarfs...

                         MIKE WALLACE (OVER)
               What "Seven Dwarfs?"

                         LOWELL (OVER)
               The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... Referred
               to this...  Said they should be afraid of
               him...  I assume, afraid of what he could
               reveal.
                   (to Staff Lawyers)
               Now, you tell me.  What does this guy
               have to say that threatens these people?

     And, now, we see Lowell, Mike Wallace and Debbie DeLuca with
     two staff Lawyers, MARK STERN and JOHN HARRIS, sitting around
     a workstation used as an improvised eating area.

     Beyond them are the "60 MINUTES" offices, workstations, piles
     of material, television monitors hanging from the ceiling,
     all tuned to CBS programming...

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for
               you"...

                         LOWELL
               Hardly new news.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               No shit.

                         LOWELL
               What's this?

                         MARK STERN
                   (re:  video)
               What that is is tobacco's standard
               defense.  It's the "we don't know"
               litany:  "Addiction?  We believe not.
               Disease?  We don't know.  We take a bunch
               of leaves, roll 'em together.  You smoke
               'em.  After that?  You're on your own.
               We don't know."
                   (beat)
               So...tells me nothing.
                   (beat)
               Besides, you'll never get what he's got.

                         LOWELL
               Why not?

                         JOHN HARRIS
               Because of this guy's confidentiality
               agreement, he is never gonna be able to
               talk to you.

                         LOWELL
               That's not good enough.  This guy is the
               top scientist in the number three tobacco
               company in America.  He's a corporate
               officer.  You never get whistle-blowers
               from Fortune 500 companies.  This guy is
               the ultimate insider.  He's got something
               to say; he wants to say it; I want it on
               "60 Minutes."

                         JOHN HARRIS
               Doesn't matter what he wants.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Am I missing something here?

                         JOHN HARRIS
               What do you mean, Mike?

                         MIKE WALLACE
               He's got a corporate secrecy agreement?
               Give me a break.  This is a public-health
               issue, like an unsafe airframe on a
               passenger jet or...some company dumping
               cyanide into the East River.  Issues like
               that?  He can talk, we can air it.
               They've got no right to hide behind a
               corporate agreement.
                   (re:  his coffee)
               Pass the milk...

                         JOHN HARRIS
                   (does)
               They don't need the right.  They've got
               the money.

                         MARK STERN
               The unlimited checkbook.  That's how Big
               Tobacco wins every time.  On everything.
               They spend you to death.  $600 million a
               year in outside legal.  Chadbourne-Parke.
               Ken Starr's firm, Kirkland and Ellis.
               Listen.  GM and Ford, they get nailed
               after 11 or 12 pick-ups blow up.  Right?
               These clowns have never...I mean ever...

                         JOHN HARRIS
               Not even once...

                         MARK STERN
               ...not even with hundreds of thousands
               dying each year from an illness related
               to their product...have ever lost a
               personal-injury lawsuit.  On this case,
               they'll issue gag orders, sue for breach,
               anticipatory breach, enjoin him, you, us,
               his pet dog, the dog's veterinarian...
               Tie him up in litigation for ten of
               fifteen years.  I'm telling you, they bat
               a thousand.  Every time.  He knows that.
               That's why he's not gonna talk to you...

     Lowell's been quiet, thinking about something else...  Now...

                         LOWELL
               Okay, let's look through the looking
               glass the other way...

                         MIKE WALLACE
               What do you mean?

                         LOWELL
               We got a guy...who wants to talk but he's
               constrained.
                   (beat)
               What if he were "compelled"?

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (eating)
               Oh, torture?  Great ratings.

               What do you mean compelled?

                         LOWELL
                   (seriously)
               I mean compelled by a Justice Department,
               state courts, be a witness.  That would
               cut through any confidentiality
               agreement, wouldn't it?

                         MARK STERN
               Yeah...

                         DEBBIE DELUCA
               What does that do?

                         LOWELL
               What do you mean, what's it do?

                         DEBBIE DELUCA
               What I mean is, like, how does it cut
               through the confidentiality agreement?

                         LOWELL
               Because he has to reveal it in a court of
               law.  It's on record, it's out.  It's no
               secret anymore.  So how can they restrain
               his speech or retaliate?  It's out in the
               world...

                         MARK STERN
                   (nods)
               If you could engineer it into the court
               record, you might have something.  They
               would have a helluva time trying to
               restrain his speech then, wouldn't they?

     Pause.

                         JOHN HARRIS
                   (still skeptical)
               Yeah, but what venue?  And where does he
               get - does he have killer attorneys?

                         LOWELL
               I don't think he's got any attorneys.

                         MARK STERN
               He's gonna need attorneys who aren't
               afraid of risking years of litigation.
               And millions of dollars of their own
               dough in legal costs...

                         LOWELL
               What do you say, Mike?  What do you
               think?

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (pause)
               Even if he gets the defense team, will he
               go for it?

     INT. A HIGH SCHOOL CAFETERIA, LOUISVILLE - DAY

                         MRS. WATSON
               ...you're awfully overqualified, Dr.
               Wigand.

     The aftermath of a high school lunch.  Tables, covered with
     litter, as far as the eye can see.  And we see Jeffrey
     sitting with a formidable Black Woman in her mid-fifties, the
     High School Principal, CYNTHIA WATSON, drinking cups of
     coffee...

                         WIGAND
                   (after a beat, awkward)
               I'm trying to...start a new career...  I
               believe I could be a good teacher...

     She's quiet.  She senses this applicant has a lot on his
     mind.

                         MRS. WATSON
               Let me give it some thought...

                         WIGAND
                   (selling)
               ...and not a lot of companies in the
               health-care field hire ex-tobacco
               scientists.

     She nods, studying him.  They get up.

     INT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - DAY

     The house is nearly empty.  Liane, arms folded across her
     chest, is quietly standing in the empty living room.  Jeffrey
     comes down the stairs...

                         WIGAND
               That's it...

     And it's quiet.  And Liane holds herself, overcome...

                         LIANE
                   (beat)
               That's where our babies were born...
               Debbie took her first steps, right
               there...in the grass.

     And they're quiet.

                         LIANE (CONT'D)
               I didn't plan on this...

     Liane looks at him, afraid.  And as he moves to hold her.

                         WIGAND
               Hey, hey, hey, c'mon.  C'mon.  We can
               make this work for us.  Okay?  It's
               just...it's a smaller scale.
               Simpler...easier...more time.  More time
               together.  More time with the kids.  More
               time for us, okay?  It's just...  Can you
               imagine me coming home from some job
               feeling good at the end of the day?  This
               is gonna be better.  This is gonna be
               better.

     And instead of this downturn turning them against each other,
     it brings them closer together.  And as they stand in the
     empty house...

     INT. THE WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE - DAY

     We see unpacked boxes in the small 1970's kitchen.  Country-
     western music is playing on a radio.  And we see Liane busily
     putting things away in a cabinet.  And, then, stops and looks
     out the window.  She tightens a knob on a cabinet.  There's a
     moment of domestic peace for her as she sees...

     EXT. THE WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, THE BACKYARD - DAY

     Jeffrey with the Girls in a part of the backyard, kneeling in
     the dirt, planting a vegetable garden, putting in some small
     tomato trellises.  We see the house, now.  It's a small, one
     story.  Deborah sees her mom and waves.  It's an image from
     the 1950's post-war boom.  Liane waves back from behind the
     pane of glass...

     INT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

     Jeffrey's asleep on his side next to Liane, her back to him.
     His arm is draped over her, protectively.  There's a sound.
     He turns.  And he sees Barbara in her nightgown, standing in
     the doorway...

                         WIGAND
               Hey, baby.  What's wrong?

                         BARBARA
                   (terrified, whispers)
               What's that outside, Daddy?

                         WIGAND
               Did you see somebody or did you hear
               them?

                         BARBARA
               I heard them.

                         WIGAND
               Where?

                         BARBARA
               In the backyard.

     Fast, soundlessly, he's out of bed into old moccasins and
     trousers...

     INT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, BASEMENT - LATE NIGHT

     Jeffrey goes into a corner of the basement, around the corner
     from the furnace, where his "office" is now.  Unpacked boxes
     are on the floor.  He fumbles with the combination lock on a
     small gun safe, lifts the lid, taking out a hand gun.
     Barbara followed him.

                         WIGAND
               Sit at Daddy's desk, okay?  Why don't you
               just sit up at the desk.  Get out some
               paper and draw me a picture, okay?  What
               are you gonna draw me, baby?  An animal,
               something like that?  You stay down here
               until Daddy gets back...alright, Barbara?
               You stay down here.

     He keeps it hidden from Barbara.  He goes up the stairs.

     EXT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BACKYARD - LATE NIGHT

     It's still.  He steps further out onto the lawn with its dark
     shrubs and small tree in the corner.

     INT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BASEMENT - LATE NIGHT

     Meanwhile, Barbara in the basement, starts as the water
     heater comes on, scaring her.  She goes up the stairs to
     follow after her father...

     EXT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BACKYARD - LATE NIGHT

     Meanwhile, Jeffrey has crossed towards the darker back
     corners.  Sudden rustling.  He spins, gun ready.  And the
     yellow eyes of a RACCOON stare at him.

                         WIGAND
                   (to himself)
               You almost got your damn head blown
               off...

     The raccoon defiantly bares its teeth.

     Jeffrey starts to go...but he sees something and stops...

     Meanwhile, Barbara has come to the sliding glass door...

     Jeffrey sees one of the tomato trellises is crushed, stepped
     on...and in the vegetable garden's earth, are distinct,
     fresh, deep FOOTPRINTS...

                         BARBARA'S VOICE (OVER)
               Daddy...

     Wigand steps between her and the garden, hiding it...
     EXTREMELY CLOSE ON JEFFREY, as he covers, trying to keep from
     his daughter the invasion, trying to control his emotions...

                         WIGAND
                   (reassuring her)
               It's just a raccoon, baby...nothing.

     He crosses to her, putting his arm, around her, walking her
     back inside...

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
               They're nocturnal.  You know what that
               means?  That means that they only come
               out at nighttime.

     He locks the sliding glass door, takes a last look outside.

     INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE IN BERKELEY - LATE AT NIGHT

     The Phone suddenly RINGS.  Lowell asleep, alone...  He gets
     it...

                         LOWELL
                   (sleepy)
               Yeah...

     INT. WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, HALLWAY - LATE AT NIGHT

     It's dark, save a light from the living room.  Liane, in bed,
     seemingly sleeping.  And we see Jeffrey, just outside their
     door in the foyer, sitting on the floor against a curved
     wall, a drink at his side on the telephone...  A man with no
     one to talk to...

                         WIGAND
                   (after a beat)
               Lowell...  Jeffrey Wigand...

     INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BERKELEY - LATE AT NIGHT

     Lowell sits up...

                         WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER)
               Is it too late?

                         LOWELL
               No.  No, it's okay...  How's - how's the
               new place?

     INT. THE WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT

                         WIGAND
               The new place?  New.

     INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BERKELEY - LATE AT NIGHT

                         LOWELL
                   (intuiting)
               You okay?

                         WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER)
               Sure.

     Lowell knows he isn't...

                         LOWELL
               You know, I was thinking of calling you
               tomorrow, anyway.
                   (beat)
               How are your kids handling the new house?

     INT. WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - LATE AT NIGHT

                         WIGAND
               Good.
                   (beat)
               You have kids?

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
               We have a couple.  One's hers, one's
               mine.  Everybody uses a different name.
                   (wry)
               Modern marriage.
                   (beat)
               How's Liane?

                         WIGAND
               She's okay.

     He looks at Liane for beat.  We SEE his POV in medium shot.
     Then he moves and sits on the floor in the living room.

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
               Hold on a minute, Lowell...
                   (after a beat)
               ...somebody...may be following me.  I
               don't know.  They came on the property...

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
               What do you mean followed you?  Did you
               call the police?

                         WIGAND
               I don't want to be paranoid...  I mean,
               maybe it's a game.  Some kind of mind
               game.

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
               Well, what do you really think, though?

                         WIGAND
               I don't know what the fuck I really
               think!  Are they doing it?  Is some crank
               doing it?  Are they doing it to make me
               feel paranoid?  Are they doing it for
               real and don't give a shit what I think?
               I don't know!  I don't fucking know.

     And it's quiet again.

     INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BERKELEY - LATE AT NIGHT

     Lowell sitting in bed on the phone, alarmed, sharing Wigand's
     fears.

                         LOWELL
               Jeffrey, describe for me in detail what
               happened.

     INT. WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - LATE NIGHT

     And Jeffrey's emotions are back in check as...

                         WIGAND
               Well, no, look...I mean, there was a
               footprint.  Forget it.  It's probably not
               important at all.
                   (beat)
               You know, I got a job now.  I'm teaching
               high school. Japanese and Chemistry.
                   (beat)
               So, what were you calling about?

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
               You called me.

     He takes another drink...

                         WIGAND
               No, you said you were going to call me
               tomorrow.  So, what about?

                         LOWELL
                   (after a beat)
               Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did...I wanted to
               talk to you.  I wanted to hook up and
               talk to you.  About what we were talking
               about in your car.

                         WIGAND
               ...okay.

                         LOWELL
                   (after a beat)
               Makes you feel good?  Putting what you
               know to use?

     Jeffrey's impressed by Lowell's perceptivity...

                         WIGAND
               How'd you know that, Lowell?

                         LOWELL
               It's obvious, isn't it?

     He looks at Liane in the next room, asleep.

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
               Hello.  You there

                         WIGAND
               Yeah...  Look, thanks for talking.  I'm
               sorry I woke you up.

                         LOWELL
               It's okay.

     Jeffrey hesitates, holding the phone, then he hangs up...but
     the phone RINGS right away.

                         WIGAND
               Lowell...?

     But there's thick silence.

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
               Who is this?  Do not call here!  Do
               not...

     They hang up.  And he realizes he's talking to a DIAL TONE.
     He hangs up.  And as he sits in the patch of light from a
     street lamp, the gun in his hand on his lap, to be up all
     night guarding his family...

     INT.  THEIR BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

     And past Liane's sleeping form down the hall into the living
     room is her husband, his back to her, sitting in the
     trapezoid of light.  And as we DOLLY along her side, we come
     upon her face and discover she's been up all along and her
     eyes are pressed shut, her hands over her ears...her reaction
     to his raging on the phone.  She's far from "OKAY."

     INT. A JAPANESE RESTAURANT, WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

     And we see Lowell and Wigand sitting in their stocking feet
     at a traditional Japanese table in a private screened room...
     A traditionally-dressed Japanese Waitress waiting to take
     their order...  Wigand conversing with her in Japanese...

     The Waitress formally nods, and leaves...

                         LOWELL
               What did you get us?

                         WIGAND
               Tempura...

     And Wigand drinks some more saki.

                         WIGAND (cont'd)
               The internet said you did graduate work
               in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla
               with Professor...Marcus?

                         LOWELL
               Marcuse.  Yeah.  He was my mentor.  He
               had a major influence on the New Left in
               the late '60s...and on me, personally.

                         WIGAND
               Next to your father?

                         LOWELL
               My father?  What the hell's that got to
               do with my father?

                         WIGAND
               Is that why you became a journalist?
               Then you get to ask all the questions?

                         LOWELL
               You charge by the hour?

                         WIGAND
               My father was a mechanical
               engineer...most ingenious man I ever
               knew.

                         LOWELL
               Well, my father left us when I was five-
               years old.  He was not the most ingenious
               man I ever knew...  Let's get back to
               Brown & Williamson.  If you decide to go
               on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything
               about why you got fired.

                         WIGAND
               Why?

                         LOWELL
               They're gonna dig up stuff from your
               past, they're gonna throw it at you.  I
               got to know what they're gonna throw.
               You understand?

                         WIGAND
                   (concedes)
               I drink.  A couple of occasions more than
               I should have.
                   (thinks)
               I was cited for shoplifting once.  But it
               was a mistake...
                   (hesitant, after a beat)
               I pushed Liane one time.  We were both
               stressed out because of the pressure.
               She went to her mother's.
                   (out of the blue)
               I got fired because when I get angry I
               have difficulty censoring myself.  And I
               don't like to be pushed around!

                         LOWELL
               I'm not pushing you around!
                   (after a beat)
               I'm asking you questions.

                         WIGAND
               I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I?  I
               could be anything.  Right?  Anything
               worth putting on between commercials...

                         LOWELL
                   (honest)
               ...to a network, probably, we're all
               commodities.
                   (beat)
               To me?  You are not a commodity.  What
               you are is important.

     And he's begun to consciously or unconsciously "sell"...

                         LOWELL (cont'd)
               You go public and thirty-million people
               hear what you got to say, nothing, I mean
               nothing, will ever be the same again.

     Wigand doesn't react.

                         LOWELL (cont'd)
               You believe that?

                         WIGAND
                   (skeptical)
               No.

                         LOWELL
               You should.  Because when you're done, a
               judgment is going to go down in the court
               of public opinion, my friend.  And that's
               the power you have.

                         WIGAND
               You believe that?

                         LOWELL
               I believe that?  Yes, I believe that.

                         WIGAND
               You believe that because you get
               information out to people...something
               happens?

                         LOWELL
               Yes.

                         WIGAND
               Maybe that's just what you've been
               telling yourself all these years to
               justify having a good job?  Having
               status?  And maybe for the audience, it's
               just voyeurism?  Something to do on a
               Sunday night.  And maybe it won't change
               a fucking thing.  And people like myself
               and my family are left hung out to dry.
               Used up!  Broke, alone!

                         LOWELL
               Are you talking to me or did somebody
               else just walk in here?!  I never
               abandoned a source!

                         WIGAND
               I don't think you really understand --

                         LOWELL
                   (running over)
               No, don't evade a choice you gotta make
               be questioning my reputation or "60
               Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!

                         WIGAND
               I have to put my family's welfare on the
               line here, my friend!  And what are you
               puttin' up?  You're puttin' up words!

                         LOWELL
               Words!  While you've been dickin' around
               at fucking company golf tournaments, I
               been out in the world, giving my word and
               backing it up with action.

     Lowell is getting very close, in spite of the value of
     Wigand, to telling Jeff to take his story and stick it up his
     ass.

                         LOWELL (cont'd)
               Now, are you going to go do this
               thing, or not?

     Wigand abruptly rises...

                         WIGAND
                   (surprisingly mild)
               I said I'd call the kids before they went
               to bed.  Onisa...

     And turning, he crosses the restaurant.  And that's where it
     hangs.

     INT. A CBS EDITING SUITE, NEW YORK - DAY

     And we see we're watching footage in an on-line editing bay
     from what we will learn is Lowell's "N.O.P.D. Blue" on police
     corruption in New Orleans.

     Lowell, TONY BALDO (his editor), Debbie and an intense YOUNG
     MAN wearing glasses, an Intern, looking at the cut.  All the
     police are on horseback, lots of cops on horses.
     Lowell is waiting for a call to go through...

                         LOWELL
               The stringer was supposed to be shooting
               B-roll on street cops in New Orleans.
               What's with all the horses?

                         TONY BALDO
               Camera guy's got a thing about mounted
               police.

                         LOWELL
                   (re:  horses)
               Don't any of these guys ride in cars or
               walk?

                         TONY BALDO
               How long did he stay on this?

                         LOWELL
               What was he seeing?

                         DEBBIE DELUCA
                   (into phone)
               Yes, hello...  I'm trying to reach Mr.

     INT. A LEAR JET - DAY

     And we see the PILOT, a fit-looking, unassuming man, wearing
     aviator glasses, in his late forties.  A heavyset Man in his
     forties, riding up in the co-pilot's seat we'll come to know
     as RON MOTLEY.  The Pilot's on a headset...  He has a
     distinctive Southern accent...

                         THE PILOT
               This is Richard Scruggs...

                   (to Lowell)
               Lowell, I got him on the phone.

                         LOWELL
               Yes, I'm right here.  Could you call me
               back on a hard line?

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
               Alright.

     INT. A LOUNGE, PRIVATE AVIATION TERMINAL - DAY

     Through the window, we see Scruggs' plane being refueled
     while Scruggs and Motley in a run-down lounge are talking on
     a SPEAKER PHONE with Lowell.  They've taken over the
     Secretary's office for privacy.

                         LOWELL
                   (re:  footage)
               What do we do with that?

     The phone rings.

                         DEBBIE DELUCA
               I don't know.

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS' VOICE (OVER)
               Richard Scruggs...

                         LOWELL
               ...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on
               behalf of the State of Mississippi, did
               you not?

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
                   (nods)
               That's right...

                         LOWELL
                   (after a beat)
               Well, I'm working with someone, now, who
               was the former head of research at Brown
               & Williamson, a former corporate officer
               there.

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
               What's your interest in this, Mr.
               Bergman?

                         LOWELL
               Well, he may tape an interview with us.
               And, we believe if his testimony showed
               up in a court record first, it would free
               him up from his confidentiality agreement
               and give him some protection.

                         MOTLEY
               It could work.  If it's public record,
               it's public record.

                         LOWELL
               Yeah, and he's going to need legal
               representation.

                         MOTLEY
               He sure as hell will.

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
                   (a beat)
               Has he decided to go public?  Because
               let me tell you, we've been doing this
               for three years now, and we've worked
               with a lot of corporate cases involving
               whistle-blowers, so we know...  Big
               Tobacco will do everything in their power
               to stop him.  So, is your man truly
               committed?

                         LOWELL
               Well, actually, no.  Well, he's on the
               fence.  That's the point.

     Scruggs and Motley exchange a look...  Motley shrugs...

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
               Well, we'd certainly be interested in
               making his acquaintance, but without
               knowing what he's going to do...

                         LOWELL
               Well, would you want him to call you?
               Or, you want to call him?  How do you
               want to do it?

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
                   (no nonsense)
               It would be better if he called us.

                         LOWELL
               Yeah.

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
               Alright?

                         LOWELL
               Okay.  Thank you.

     At this moment, these two attorneys are unsold on the
     prospect of Jeffrey Wigand.  Scruggs disconnects.

     INT. THE WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, KITCHEN - TWILIGHT

     Liane cooking dinner, making pasta.  Ingredients, diced
     tomato, basil, are neatly ordered.  She's waiting for water
     to boil.  The kids are doing homework on the round table in
     the kitchenette.  It's an idle moment.  She's dazed-out
     watching them.

                         DEBORAH
               What are you cooking?

                         LIANE

                         DEBORAH
               Oh, I love that stuff.

     And now she hears from the basement the BELL RING on
     Jeffrey's computer.  It's a tiny bell, incessant...  She
     crosses to the basement stairs.

                         LIANE
               I'm going to have to go downstairs.

     INT. WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, BASEMENT OFFICE - NIGHT

     Liane down the stairs, approaching Jeffrey's computer.  And
     she SEES an incoming E-mail icon - a large letter with wings -
     flying repetitively across the screen.

     The bell RINGING is louder.  She calls-up the E-mail...  On
     the screen in large RED letters:

               WE WILL KILL YOU.  WE WILL KILL ALL OF
               YOU.  SHUT THE FUCK UP.

     And now Liane is shouting and running up the stairs and...

     EXT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - EVENING

     Jeffrey, having arrived home from work, pulls the mail out of
     the mailbox, now stands, frozen, staring at something...  And
     he sees, standing upright in the back of the mail box, like a
     monument of threat, a single hollow point .38 CALIBER BULLET.
     He freezes...  And simultaneously...

     Liane and the Girls are running toward him...like in a bad
     fucking dream.  He's looking at them.  Liane is saying
     something about E-mail, but his slow-motion attention is
     still arrested by the statuesque bullet.  As they close on
     him...

     EXT. NEW ORLEANS, THE FRENCH QUARTER - NIGHT

     And we see Lowell lit by FLASHING POLICE LIGHTS.  We're at a
     crime scene.  Uniformed cops on horseback.  Just arrived, the
     Cameraman's unloading his gear, preparing to shoot B-roll.

               shot to death.

                         LOWELL

               They're terrorizing us.  Death threats?!
               To my family?  My kids?!

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
               What are you talking about?

                         WIGAND
               Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.

                         LOWELL
               Jeff, call the FBI right away...

                         WIGAND
               They do this with impunity!

                         LOWELL
               Jeff...

                         WIGAND
               They get to go home at night.  What does
               it cost these people to do this to us?
               Nothing?!  My girls are crying, so fuck
               them!  I want to tape!  I'm done thinking
               about it.

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (frustrated)
               I heard you.  But I got to arrange a
               legal defense first.  I got to get you to
               testify in court, get it on public
               record.

                         WIGAND
                   (cuts in)
               Then hold it off the air until you got
               that.  But I want to go to New York.
               And I want to go on the record.  Right
               now!

                         LOWELL
               Good.  But Jeff...

                         WIGAND
               I'll call them, Lowell.

     INT. WIGAND'S HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

     And two older, local FBI AGENTS #1 and #2 are sitting with
     Jeffrey in his living room...

                         FBI AGENT #2
               Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?

                         WIGAND
               Yes, I'm afraid I did.

                         FBI AGENT #1
               We won't be able to lift usable prints.

                         FBI AGENT #2
               Do you own a gun, Mr. Wigand?

                         WIGAND
               A gun?  Yes.

                         FBI AGENT #2
               What caliber is your gun?

                         WIGAND
               What caliber is my gun?

                         FBI AGENT #2
               Yes, sir.  What caliber is your gun?

                         WIGAND
                   (a dawning realization)
               What does that have to do with the price
               of tea in China?

     Now one of the kids is crying, Liane trying to calm her,
     takes her out of the room.

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
                   (a beat, realizing)
               You think I put that bullet in the
               mailbox myself...?

                         FBI AGENT #2
               If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...

     And he gets up...  They follow him into the bedroom.  He
     unlocks the side drawer on his night stand, taking out a gun,
     giving it to one of the Agents.

                         FBI AGENT #1
               Why do you keep this gun?

                         WIGAND
               I don't think it's unconstitutional yet
               to own a gun.  I'm a target shooter.

                         FBI AGENT #2
               That bullet was for a .38 caliber.  Do
               you own a .38?

                         WIGAND
               Yes, I do.  A .38 Target Master.  In my
               gun safe downstairs.  A .45 Gold Cup.  A
               .22 target pistol.  So what?

                         FBI AGENT #2
                   (after a beat)
               Do you have a history of emotional
               problems, Mr. Wigand?

                         WIGAND
               Yes.  Yes, I do.
                   (beat)
               Yes, I get extremely emotional when
               assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!

     And we hear Liane's voice from downstairs...

                         LIANE'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (upset)
               I didn't tell you that so you could just
               pick it up and take it away.  Jeffrey!

     And we see Liane following FBI Agent #3, coming up the stairs
     from the basement, and the Agent is carrying Jeffrey's
     computer...

                         WIGAND
               What's going on?

                         LIANE
               I told him that you had an E-mail death
               threat that said if you didn't shut the
               "F" up, they were going to kill you...

     Agent #3 starts out of the house with the computer followed
     by #2.  Jeffrey runs out after them.

     EXT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE - NIGHT

                         WIGAND
                   (outraged)
               You can't take that...  It's personal
               property...!

                         FBI AGENT #2 (OR #3)
               We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand.
               There's been a death threat.

                         WIGAND
                   (after him)
               ...my files!  Personal correspondence...

     Agent #3 ignores him, putting the computer in the trunk of
     their car.  And FBI Agent #1, the .38 bullet in a baggie,
     comes out of the house.

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
               ...letters to my brother...my will.

     His shoes slip on the grass and he falls.  And the FBI are
     getting into their car.  And NEIGHBORS have come out,
     watching them.  Liane and the girls, standing halfway down
     the front lawn, the neighbors looking at them.  She and
     Jeffrey look at each other.  Will she go to him or not?  She
     goes to him as he rises...

                         WIGAND (cont'd)
               That computer has everything...

                         FBI AGENT #2
               You alright, Mr. Wigand?

                         FBI AGENT #1
               We need to take a look at your gun safe,
               Mr. Wigand.

     EXT. NEW ORLEANS, THE FRENCH QUARTER - NIGHT

                         LOWELL
                   (interrupts)
               I'm telling you, your agents in that
               office are acting improperly!  Now, who
               are they trying to protect?

     And we see a Man in his early forties, a neatly-dressed man
     who prides himself on his appearance, at his desk in the
     Bureau (FBI).  BILL ROBERTSON.  He's completely distracted,
     focused on agent travel orders...

                         BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE (OVER)
               Let me tell you something, Lowell.  Look,
               look, look.  You're talking about two
               agents in a regional office in
               Louisville.  I got the goddamn Unabomber
               threatening to blow up LAX!  I gotta move
               45 agents from all over the country into
               L.A.  Alright?  When I get a chance, I'll
               give it a look...

                         LOWELL
                   (heated)
               You better take a good look!  Because I'm
               getting two things:  pissed off and
               curious!  Now, any of these guys been
               offered jobs in corporate security after
               they retire?  Either one of those guys
               have ex-agent pals already in those jobs?
               Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor,
               who's already at Brown & Williamson as we
               fucking speak?

     INT. BILL ROBERTSON'S OFFICE, WASHINGTON - NIGHT

                         BILL ROBERTSON
                   (beat)
               I'll give it a look.

                         LOWELL
               You're getting my drift?

                         BILL ROBERTSON
               I'll give it a look.

     He hangs up.

     INT. DINING ROOM, THE FOUR SEASONS HOTEL, NEW YORK - NIGHT

     And we slide by some elegant diners to fall onto Lowell and
     Mike Wallace with Jeffrey and Liane in the Hotel's dining
     room, having ordered dinner.

                         LOWELL
               So, is everything okay?

                         MIKE WALLACE
               How are the rooms?  Comfortable?

                         LIANE
                   (to Mike)
               Yes, very.  You know, I enjoy your work
               so much...when you're talking to
               somebody, I always feel like I'm right
               there.

     And she laughs...

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Thank you got saying that...

                         LOWELL
               Do you think we could talk about the
               taping?  Tomorrow's taping, just so we
               can get it out of the way and order...

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Yeah, well, questions will go toward what
               work you did there, why you were fired.
               And others will deal...

                         LIANE
                   (not sure she quite heard)
               ...taping?
                   (beat)
               What are you taping?

                         WIGAND
               I'm doing an interview.

                         LIANE
                   (whispers)
               An interview!  Do you know what they will
               do to us...!  I thought...  Sorry.

     But she suddenly gets up and leaves, hurrying out of the
     dining room.  And Jeffrey oddly doesn't move.

                         LOWELL
                   (trying to intervene)
               Liane, this is a preliminary...
                   (after a beat)
               You didn't tell her we were taping?
               What did she think she was coming to New
               York for?

                         WIGAND
               ...to talk about it.  To think about it.
               I had a plan to ease her into it.  But, I
               really - I didn't know how to do that...

     Jeffrey abruptly crosses to the nearby Bar.

                         LOWELL
               Oh, man.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Who are these people?

                         LOWELL
                   (frustrated)
               Ordinary people!  Under extraordinary
               pressure, Mike.  What the hell do you
               expect?  Grace and consistency?

     And Lowell leaves the table.  And as Mike Wallace sits at the
     table, looking around, wondering what the fuck he's doing
     there.

     INT. THE BATHROOM, NEW YORK HOTEL - NIGHT

     Liane folds her arms protectively across her chest...

     INT. A STUDIO, CBS - MORNING

     And we see a small TAPING STUDIO separated by flats and black
     curtains from other CBS News sets.  Cameras are set up.

     INT. THE STUDIO, CBS - DAY

     And we enter mid-scene on Jeffrey in a more formal demeanor,
     sitting in a chair, Mike Wallace sitting across from him,
     under the lights, taping an interview.  Lowell, off camera.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               You heard Mr. Sandefur say before
               Congress that he believed nicotine was
               not addictive...?

                         WIGAND
                   (nods)
               ...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured
               himself because I watched those
               testimonies very carefully.

     Lowell's reaction.  Jeffrey's statements are stunning and
     powerful revelations...and dangerous ones to make.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               All of us did.  There was this whole line
               of people...whole line of CEOs up there
               all swearing.

                         WIGAND
               Part of the reason I'm here is I felt
               that their representation clearly
               misstated, at least within Brown &
               Williamson's representation, clearly
               misstated...what is common language
               within the company...we are in the
               nicotine delivery business.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               And that's what cigarettes are for...?

                         WIGAND
               A delivery device for nicotine.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               A delivery device for nicotine.  Put it
               in your mouth, light it up, and you're
               gonna get your fix...

                         WIGAND
               You're gonna get your fix...

                         MIKE WALLACE
               You're saying that Brown & Williamson
               manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix,
               not by artificially adding nicotine, but
               by enhancing the effect of nicotine
               through the use of chemical elements such
               as ammonia...

                         WIGAND
                   (nods)
               The process is known as "impact
               boosting..."  While not spiking nicotine,
               they clearly manipulate it.  There's
               extensive use of this technology, know
               as "ammonia chemistry."  It allows for
               the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed
               in the lung and therefore affect the
               brain and central nervous system.

     INT. THE STUDIO, CBS - LATER

                         WIGAND
               The straw that broke the camel's back for
               me and really put me in trouble with
               Sandefur was a compound called
               "coumarin."  When I came on board at B&W,
               they had tried to transition from
               coumarin to a similar flavor that would
               give the same taste, and had been
               unsuccessful.  I wanted it out
               immediately.
               I was told that it would affect sales, so
               I should mind my own business.  I
               constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur
               indicating I could not in conscience
               continue with coumarin in a product that
               we now knew, we had documentation, was
               similar to coumadin, a lung-specific
               carcinogen...

                         MIKE WALLACE
               And you sent the document forward to
               Sandefur?

                         WIGAND
               I sent the document forward to Sandefur.
               I was told that we would continue to work
               on a substitute, we weren't going to
               remove it as it would impact sales, and
               that that was his decision.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               In other words, you were charging
               Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with
               ignoring health considerations
               consciously...

                         WIGAND
               Most certainly.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of
               Brown & Williamson had you fired.  And
               the reason he gave you?

                         WIGAND
               Poor communication skills.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               And, do you wish you hadn't come forward?
               You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?

                         WIGAND
               Yeah, there are times I wish I hadn't
               done it.  There are times I feel
               compelled to do it.  If you asked me
               would I do it again?  Do I think it's
               worth it?  Yeah, I think it's worth it.

     INT. A HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE CLASS, LOUISVILLE - AFTERNOON

     Not too many kids paying attention.  Meanwhile, Jeffrey has
     written his name on the blackboard.

                         WIGAND
               Hi.

                         KIDS
                   (in unison)
               Hi.

                         WIGAND
               My name is Jeff Wigand.  You can call me
               Mr. Wigand; you can call me Dr. Wigand--I
               have a Ph.D. in biochemistry and
               endocrinology; you can call me Jeff...
                   (beat)
               Anything else you want to call
               me...you'll have to do so in private...
                   (a few kids smile)
               Okay...  I find chemistry to be magical.
               I find it an adventure.  An exploration
               into the building blocks of our physical
               universe...
                   (beat)
               So, how many of you have taken chemistry
               before?

     Nobody raises their hands.

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
                   (easy smile)
               Okay...I've never taught it before, so
               we're gonna be fine.

     A couple of laughs...  And we feel Jeffrey, for the first
     time is in a milieu that suits him.

                         WIGAND (cont'd)
               Our first experiment is...
                   (holds up cigarette lighter)
               ...going to be measuring the molecular
               weight of butane...

     INT. SCRUGGS' OFFICE

     Scruggs' office is decorated with watercolors of Phantom jets
     and A-6s as Scruggs takes off his glasses...

                         CHARLENE
               He's on line three.

     INT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR

     Jeffrey Wigand is on a pay phone in the corridor crowded with
     students...

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
               Hello.

                         WIGAND
               Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand.  Lowell Bergman
               said I should give you a call...

     INT. SCRUGGS' OFFICE

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
               My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have
               filed a lawsuit against the tobacco
               industry on behalf of the State of
               Mississippi to get the state reimbursed
               Medicaid costs for treating people with
               smoking-related illness.
                   (beat)
               If you'd be interested in talking to us,
               we'd certainly like to talk to you...

                         WIGAND
               When should we do this?

     EXT. WIGAND'S HOUSE #2, LOUISVILLE - TWILIGHT

     Jeffrey drives up the block and onto his driveway.  Seeing a
     MAN in a suit, an ear piece in his ear, disappearing around
     the corner of his house, Jeffrey leaps out of the car.  But
     the front door's open.  So instead of chasing after, he runs
     inside...

     INT. THE WIGAND'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY/TWILIGHT

     And he sees another Man is in the living room...

                         WIGAND
               Who the hell are you?!  What are you
               doing in my house?!

     And he sees Lowell enter from the dining room...

                         LOWELL
               It's okay, Jeff.

                         SECURITY GUARD
               Mr. Wigand, you need to speak to...

                         LOWELL
                   (wry)
               It's okay.  You got your own security
               now...

     Wigand catches his breath.

                         WIGAND
               Lowell, I can't afford --

                         LOWELL
               ...they "volunteered."  A friend owns a
               large security company.

                         TALIFARO
               How are you doing, Mr. Wigand?  I'm Jon
               Talifaro.  There'll be three of us on
               detail.

                         LIANE
                   (crossing through)
               I'm going to the store.  Please explain
               our new "houseguests" to your children.

     And Wigand looks at Lowell...  Barbara comes into the living
     room and holds onto her father's leg.

                         WIGAND
               I called Richard Scruggs in
               Mississippi...

                         LOWELL
               I heard.

                         WIGAND
               I'm going to be a witness for them in
               their litigation.  So I'm going to fly to
               Pascagoula to give a deposition...

                         LOWELL
               I know.  I'm going to go there tonight...

                         WIGAND
               Did you have a good day?

                         DEBORAH
               Yes, I did.  I had a great day.

                         WIGAND
               Coffee, Lowell?

                         LOWELL
               Yeah.
                   (to kids)
               Want to play that game we were playing
               before?  You know, I think you got it up
               to five.  I was ahead of you.

     She goes over and holds his hand.  And as he holds her hand,
     seeing what his life has become, he looks up and his glance
     connects with Lowell...

     INT. THE KITCHEN, THE WIGANDS' HOUSE - NIGHT

     We see out the window a Security Guard, incongruous, walking
     by.  And we see Liane, finished with the dinner dishes,
     silently wiping off the sink.  There's a pall you could cut
     with a knife.  A moment, and Jeffrey comes in the kitchen
     door from the garden...  He stops to wash his hands in the
     sink.

                         LIANE
               Please don't wash your hands in the sink.

                         WIGAND
               Where should I wash them?

                         LIANE
               Use the bathroom.

                         WIGAND
               What's the difference...

                         LIANE
               That's for food.

     But he ignores her, washing his hands...  And she turns the
     water off.  He turns it back on.  He thinks, then turns it
     off.  Then she turns it on.

                         LIANE (cont'd)
               Leave it on!  Just leave it on, okay?!

     And she turns and leaves the room, coldly, all her anger
     repressed.  For Jeffrey, everything else and now this?  The
     running faucet.

     EXT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - LATE NIGHT

     The house on the quiet suburban street.  A Security Guard,
     incongruous, a noticeable bulge where his shoulder holster
     is, sitting watch under the porch light on the small front
     porch in a metal porch chair.

     INT. THE BASEMENT, THE WIGANDS' HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

     And we see Jeffrey, unable to sleep, sitting at his desk,
     alone in the basement, listening to classical music.  He
     instinctively turns.  And he sees Liane, in her bathrobe, has
     come down to sit on the basement stairs.  He looks over at
     her.  And he thinks she's come down to make up.  And all she
     really wants him to do is say, "I need you..."  But he
     can't...  And like ships that pass in the night, nothing's
     said.  It's quiet.  She puts her hands protectively in her
     robe pockets.  And she starts to cry...

                         LIANE
               I don't think I can do this...  I want to
               stand by my husband...  I really do,
               Jeffrey.  But I don't think I can do this
               anymore.  I am so sorry...

                         WIGAND
               Can we talk about this when I get back?

                         LIANE
               Yes...Jeffrey.

     She goes back up the stairs.  And as Jeffrey sits in the
     basement, and the music plays.

     INT. THE LOUISVILLE AIRPORT - DAY

     We see Jeffrey and his Security Man.  He passes a small
     Filipino Woman in a nurse's uniform and a Man in clerical
     garb, who hands him a small American Flag, asking for
     donations.  And, now, he passes through the metal detector.
     He nods thanks and walks towards us, relaxing, looking behind
     every so often to see if anybody is following him.  As he
     passes Gate 3, he HEARS over his shoulder...

                         THE MAN
                   (friendly)
               Jeff...?

     Jeffrey turns and the Man throws a sheaf of SUBPOENAS at his
     chest...

                         THE MAN (CONT'D)
                   (nasty)
               You've been served.

     And he turns and walks off.  And as Jeffrey looks down at the
     subpoenas...

     INT. RICHARD SCRUGGS' KITCHEN - 7:00 A.M.

     Jeffrey is sitting with Scruggs and Motley in Scruggs'
     kitchen around a semi-circular counter.  Coffee and sweet
     rolls.  It's casual.  No one's dressed for court.  Scruggs
     has been looking through the sheaf of subpoenas.  About
     Motley, we sense power held in reserve.

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
               Now, what this one is, is a temporary
               restraining order, a gag order, issued by
               a Kentucky court.

     Meanwhile, a movie-star handsome man in shirtsleeves and a
     tie, a coffee cup in his hand, enters and sits casually on
     the arm of a chair.

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS (CONT'D)
                   (introducing)
               Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.

                         MICHAEL MOORE
               Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
               Mike's our Attorney General down here.
                   (to Moore)
               I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a
               Kentucky court to issue a gag order to
               stop his deposition today.

                         MICHAEL MOORE
               Right.

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
               Now, they tried to get the Mississippi
               Court to honor it, but the judge threw it
               out...
                   (to Jeffrey)
               However, for you, there is a more
               perilous effect to the Kentucky gag
               order...

                         MICHAEL MOORE
                   (after a beat)
               Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could
               happen, don't you?

                         WIGAND
               I'm not free to testify...here...?

                         MOTLEY
               That's right.  If you violate the
               Kentucky order, when you step foot back
               in Kentucky, they can find you in
               contempt and they can incarcerate you.
               And you ought to know that.

     And Jeffrey fairly turns white, it's never occurred to him he
     might go to jail...

                         WIGAND
               Jail?

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
               Possibly, yes.  That is one of the
               possible consequences of your testifying
               here today.  That's right...

                         WIGAND
               How does one..."go...to...jail?"  What
               does my family do?  Go on welfare?  If my
               wife has to work?  Who's going to look
               after the kids?  Put food on the table?
               My children need me.  If I'm not
               teaching...there's no medical...no
               medical...even on co-pay, that's like...
               Tuition...

                         MICHAEL MOORE
               Dr. Wigand, listen, you may not be able
               to do this thing.  As I understand from
               Dick, you're our key witness.  And, I
               hope you don't withdraw.  I guess we'd
               all understand if you did...
                   (at watch)
               Guys, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late
               for court.  I'll see y'all a little
               later.  Dr. Wigand, good luck.

     He leaves.  And Jeffrey's quiet, frightened.  Having shaken
     the departing Moore's hand, he now turns away from Scruggs
     and Motley, thinking about consequences.

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
               I know what you're facing, Jeff.  And, I
               think I know how you're feeling...

     Jeffrey's skeptical anybody could know "how it is"...

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS (CONT'D)
                   (low, personal)
               In the Navy I flew A-6's off carriers...
               In combat, events have a duration of
               seconds, sometimes minutes...  But what
               you're going through goes on day in and
               day out.  Whether you're ready for it or
               not, week in, week out...  Month after
               month after month.  Whether you're up or
               whether you're down.  You're assaulted
               psychologically.  You're assaulted
               financially, which is its own special
               kind of violence.  Because it's directed
               at your kids...what school can you
               afford...  How will that affect their
               lives.  You're asking yourself:  Will that
               limit what they may become?  You feel
               your whole family's future's
               compromised...held hostage...
                   (after a beat)
               I do know how it is.

     EXT. RICHARD SCRUGGS' HOUSE, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

     A white, traditional, Southern house, with a veranda and
     gables...a large front lawn with weeping willows.  And we see
     Lowell, hands in his pockets, not an insider or an outsider,
     waiting alone on the expansive lawn.  The front door opens.
     A Mississippi State Trooper, putting on his round brimmed hat
     comes out and crosses the driveway.  Then Jeffrey coming out
     with Motley.  Motley talks to him on the veranda for a moment
     and then heads towards his car.  Meanwhile, Jeffrey comes
     down over to Lowell on the lawn.

     And Jeffrey looks off, across the street from the house, at
     the Gulf.  And we see the street is blockaded by Mississippi
     State Police cars.  An armed camp.  Other men in suits,
     Lawyers and state officials, wait.  Ron Motley gets in his
     car and drives away.

                         LOWELL
               You attract a crowd.

                         WIGAND
                   (smiles, wry)
               Yeah, great.

                         LOWELL
               I heard about the Kentucky gag order...

                         WIGAND
               I don't know what to do.

     And they're quiet, a breeze of the Gulf ruffling their
     coats...  He looks out at the water, a cargo container ship
     passing by.  He watches its slow progress...

     And Jeffrey quietly starts to walk off across the lawn, hands
     in his pockets, shoulders bent, head down, thinking...  And
     Richard Scruggs comes out, tying his tie, to wait beside
     Lowell...

     EXT. COURTHOUSE, CANTY STREET, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI -
     DAY

     Motley's car parks, and he and an Assistant are approached by
     a flurry of media from the parking lot behind us, crossing
     Canty Street to intercept him.  And we SEE the lot is jammed
     with Mercedes-Benzes, Town Cars and limousines belonging to
     the 150-200 Big Tobacco, Wall Street lawyers.  Some hang out
     by their cars, killing time.  It's a tailgate party.  Beyond
     them are trucks and vans with satellite dishes supporting the
     media circus.  They're all here for Jeff's deposition.  The
     scale of it dwarfs the plebeian storefront with its sign
     "Temporary Jackson County Courthouse"...into which Motley
     enters...

     EXT. RICHARD SCRUGGS' HOUSE, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

     Jeffrey contemplating.

     INT. COURTROOM, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

     One TOBACCO LAWYER, an Edward Bennett-type while waiting is
     on his cell phone...

                         TOBACCO LAWYER
                   (into phone)
               Hold on a second...
                   (seeing Motley enter; to Jr.
                    Lawyer)
               Would you please ask Mr. Motley if he
               expects his witness to appear or not...?

     JR. LAWYER crosses to Motley.

     EXT. SCRUGGS' HOUSE, DOCK - DAY

     Jeffrey alone on the jetty, looking out to sea.  Trying to
     decide, trying to untangle identity and consequence.  A
     moment.  He turns, crossing to Lowell and Scruggs.  Then.
     it's the three men, standing on the lawn.  Time seems to
     slow...all of them aware it's a critical decision, personally
     and historically...

                         WIGAND
                   (severely conflicted)
               I can't seem to find...the criteria to
               decide.  It's too big a decision to make
               without being resolved...in my own mind.

     They're quiet.  Jeffrey, getting nowhere.  Lowell offers...

                         LOWELL
               Maybe things have changed...

     Long pause on Jeffrey as he contemplates his future.  And
     something just got resolved.  He asks Lowell, rhetorically...

                         WIGAND
               What's changed?

                         LOWELL
                   (unsure)
               You mean...since this morning?

                         WIGAND
               No.  I mean since whenever...

     Nothing's changed.  Wigand looks at them.  He found his own
     answer.

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
               Fuck it.  Let's go to court.

     And Dick Scruggs and Lowell look at this normal, somewhat
     flawed, very courageous man...

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
                   (to unseen staff)
               Dr. Wigand would like to leave now.

     And there's a sudden flurry of activity.  Jeffrey and Scruggs
     walk to a Mississippi State Police car.  Lowell gets into his
     car and drives away, separately.  Police, State Officials,
     run to their cars.  Cars starting, lights flashing, Wigand's
     car pulls into position.

     INT. SCRUGGS' CAR - JEFFREY - DAY

     in the back seat with Scruggs.  The driver's a State
     Policeman.  Jeffrey watches the small town of empty lots, old
     buildings, a 1930's Deco school pass by.  It's all
     heightened, especially vivid to his eyes somehow.  And he
     exhales heavily to calm himself, to focus...

     EXT. THE COURTHOUSE, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

     Some of the Tobacco Lawyers, their jackets off, still hanging
     across Canty Street by their cars.  And now they see the
     police lights turning, coming around a corner, moving towards
     the courthouse.  The caravan stops.  First, Scruggs gets out.
     A moment, then Jeffrey appears.  And the Reporters pounce on
     Jeffrey, cameras flashing...Mississippi Police leading him
     through the crowd...  Moore appears at courtroom door
     (already there).  And as he's whisked away into the
     courtroom.

     INT. THE COURTROOM, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

     The tobacco lawyers become dead quiet.  Cell phones are hung
     up.  Newspapers are put away.  Jackets are donned.  This is
     now very serious business.  Motley meets Jeffrey, all eyes on
     him.

                         MOTLEY
               Okay, Jeff, I'm going to sit you down at
               that table over there.  I'm going to
               start as fast as possible.  I don't want
               to give them a chance to get another
               restraining order, okay?  Let's go.

                         MICHAEL MOORE
               Good luck, Doc.

     Motley calmly motions Wigand to take a chair.  He settles in.

                         STENOGRAPHER
               Please stand.  Raise your right hand...
               Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole
               truth and nothing but the truth, so help
               you God?

                         WIGAND
               I do.

                         STENOGRAPHER
               You may be seated.

                         MOTLEY
               You understand, Dr. Wigand, you are under
               oath.  This is a sworn deposition.
               There's no judge.  It's not a trial.
                   (understatement of the century)
               Will you state your name for the record.

                         WIGAND
                   (after a beat)
               Jeffrey S. Wigand.

     He spells it for them...

     EXT. THE COURTHOUSE, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

     Lowell, waiting with the other journalists...

                         PHOTOGRAPHER
               Got any idea what's going on in there?

                         LOWELL
               No, I don't have a clue.

     INT. THE COURTROOM, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

     Motley still conducting the inquiry...  And the tobacco
     lawyers, like a pack of dogs, waiting to pounce...

                         WIGAND
               That is correct.

                         MOTLEY
               In other words, it acts as a drug?

                         TOBACCO LAWYER
               Object to the form of the question!

                         MOTLEY
               It acts as a drug on the body?

                         TOBACCO LAWYER
               Object to the form!

                         MOTLEY
               It acts as a...

                         TOBACCO LAWYER
               Object!

                         MOTLEY
               There an echo in here?  Your objection's
               been recorded.  She typed it into her
               little machine over there.  It's on the
               record.  So now I'll proceed with my
               deposition of my witness.  Does it act as
               a drug?

                         TOBACCO LAWYER
                   (shouts)
               Dr. Wigand.  I am instructing you...
                   (to Wigand)
               ...not to answer that question in
               accordance to the terms of the
               contractual obligations undertaken by you
               not to disclose any information about
               your work at the Brown & Williamson
               Tobacco Company.  And in accordance with
               the force and effect of the temporary
               restraining order that has been entered
               against you to by the court in the State of
               Kentucky!  That means you don't talk!
                   (beat)
               Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...

                         MOTLEY
                   (explodes)
               Oh, you got rights and lefts!  Ups and
               downs and middles!  So what?!  You don't
               get to instruct anything around here!
               This is not North Carolina, not South
               Carolina nor Kentucky.  This is the
               sovereign State of Mississippi's
               proceeding.  Wipe that smirk off your
               face!  Dr. Wigand's deposition will be
               part of this record.  And I'm going to
               take my witness' testimony!  Whether the
               hell you like it or not!
                   (to Wigand)
               Answer the question, Dr...

                         WIGAND
                   (slams it home)
               Yes.  It produces a physiological
               response, which meets the definition of a
               drug!  Nicotine is associated with
               impact, with satisfaction.  It has a
               pharmacological effect that crosses the
               blood-brain barrier intact...

                         MOTLEY
               Thank you, Doctor.  Thank you.

     EXT. THE SCRUGGS' HOUSE, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - NIGHT

     Lowell stands on the porch looking out at the rain.  There's
     a slight sound.  He turns.  And Jeffrey's come outside.  He
     stands leaning on the porch railing, looking out at the rain
     and windswept trees.  They're quiet.  They share a look.
     They nod to each other.  The smallest nod of accomplishment.
     And they're there on the porch, alone, outside the house in
     Pascagoula, Mississippi.

     INT. CBS EDITING ROOM, NEW YORK - AFTERNOON

     We see Lowell, unusually buoyant in the same clothes as
     yesterday.  He's working with Tony Baldo on a cut of the
     show, the net result of his architecture of events, his
     combination of persuasion and integrity...

     We see on the Avid monitor a single of Jeffrey...

                         WIGAND
                   (on monitor)
               "Part of the reason I'm here is I felt
               that their representation clearly, at
               least within..."

                         LOWELL
               Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's
               not addictive."  Run that on-camera.
               Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe
               they perjured..."  Then go wide to the
               CEOs all taking the oath.  Back on Jeff
               and play the pause after the word "felt"
               on the B-side...

     Widen to include Debbie DeLuca, the Intern, two other
     Editors, Felling.  They have gathered behind Lowell in the
     doorway.  This is a hot show and it's generated excitement
     among Lowell's co-workers.  And while Baldo cuts, we see...

     INT. CBS, CORRIDOR OUTSIDE EDITING ROOM - DAY

     ...the group has spilled out the doorway, watching Lowell's
     story come together.  Beyond them, approaching, is Mike
     Wallace, coming to work...

                         BILL FELLING
                   (leaving)
               ...helluva show, Mike.  Explosive
               material.

     People separate as Mike pushes in.  Lowell sees Mike.  While
     Tony Baldo is making the edits on the Avid...

                         LOWELL
                   (to Mike)
               It went great in Mississippi, Mike.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Good.

     Don Hewitt enters from the corridor without jacket.

                         DON HEWITT
               I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.

                         LOWELL
               Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal
               the secret formula of "Kools" to the
               world.
                   (seriously)
               "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs'
               litigation, and since we're the only ones
               with the story, I believe we're sitting
               on an exclusive.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               I like that...

                         DON HEWITT
               Corporate has some questions.  We've got
               a meeting at Black Rock first thing in
               the morning.

                         LOWELL
               When's the air date?

                         DEBBIE DELUCA
                   (to Lowell)
               Excuse me, Lowell.  Sharon's on line 3.

                         LOWELL
               Tell her I'll call her back in ten.

                         BALDO
               Here we go.

     Baldo now runs Lowell's edit of the above sequence.  And we
     SEE THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT.

     Sandefur in CLOSE-UP states "I believe that nicotine is not
     addictive."  Wigand in matching CLOSE-UP states "I believe he
     perjured himself."  Then all seven CEOs of Big Tobacco stand
     up and raise their hands and take an oath in front of
     Congress to tell the truth while Wallace says "...the whole
     line of people, the whole line of CEO's up there, all
     swearing that."  And Wigand says off-screen with great
     emphasis "Part of the reason I'm here is I FELT"...and it
     cuts to Wigand for a pause that makes the word "FELT" resound
     and, then, he goes on to say on-camera "that their
     representation clearly misstated what they commonly knew.
     We're a nicotine delivery business."  We see the combination
     of art and truth woven into impact that has an audacity
     that's stirring and beautiful...

     EXT. LOUISVILLE - DUSK

     We see an anonymous rental car moving through downtown
     Louisville.

     INT. THE RENTAL CAR - NIGHT

     It's Jeffrey in the front seat, driven by one of his security
     men.  He's coming home under the cover of darkness.  They
     pass a FLAMING CAR on the freeway shoulder.  Jeffrey turns to
     stare at it.  They turn off onto city streets and stop at a
     light.  Jeffrey's nervous.  Jeffrey instinctively turns.  A
     Police Car stops alongside.  The Policeman looks at him.
     Eyes meet.  Jeffrey looks away.  The signal takes forever.
     It changes.  And as the Police Car moves off...

     EXT. WIGANDS' HOUSE - NIGHT

     The car's stopped at the curb.  Jeffrey gets out.  He starts
     up the walk, and the Second Security Guard quickly crosses
     the lawn to intercept him...

     And Jeff opens the door going inside, anxious to be home...

     INT. WIGANDS' HOUSE - NIGHT

     The house is quiet, dark.  Too quiet.  Too dark.  Something
     isn't right.  He crosses to one of the children's rooms...the
     master bedroom.  The lights are on.  Both rooms are empty.
     He goes into the kitchen and sees a note that's been left for
     him...  He opens it.  He sits heavily in a chair, reading the
     note.  The Security Guard peers...  And as Jeffrey sits in
     the silent house, the hero come home...

     INT. THE CONFERENCE ROOM, CBS - DAY

     We're at a table.  Mike and Lowell laugh at some joke while
     HELEN CAPERELLI, CBS GENERAL COUNSEL, enters with the
     President of CBS News, ERIC KLUSTER.

                         HELEN CAPERELLI
               Shall I send for coffee?  Sorry I'm late.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               No, no, we're fine...

                         HELEN CAPERELLI
               Are you sure?

     Also there is Don Hewitt.  Caperelli is too well put
     together, too practiced, too polished.

     They nod.  They don't need coffee.

                         HELEN CAPERELLI (CONT'D)
               Alright, I thought we'd get together
               because there's a legal concept that has
               been getting some new attention recently,
               "tortious interference."
                   (beat)
               If two people have an agreement, like a
               confidentiality agreement, and one of
               them breaks it because they are induced
               to do so by a 3rd party, the 3rd party
               can be sued for damages for
               interfering...hence, "tortious
               interference."

                         DON HEWITT
               Interfering?  That's what we do.

                         LOWELL
               I think what we're trying to tell you is
               that it happens all the time.  This is a
               news organization.  People are always
               telling us things they shouldn't.  We
               have to verify if it's true and in the
               public interest...  And if it is, we air
               it.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               After we corroborate it.  That's why
               we've never lost a lawsuit and run a
               classy show.
                   (impatient, now)
               Anything else?

                         HELEN CAPERELLI
               And "60 Minutes'" verification is exact.
               And precise.  And I don't think it would
               hurt to make sure you're right...on this
               one.

                         DON HEWITT
               Why?  You think we have liability?
               What's the CBS News' position, Eric?

                         ERIC KLUSTER
               There's a possibility, it's rather
               remote...

                         HELEN CAPERELLI
               But one we have to check on, Mike.  I've
               retained outside counsel to do exactly
               that.  On a segment, I might add, that's
               already rife with problems...

                         LOWELL
               What does that mean?  "Rife with -- ?"

                         HELEN CAPERELLI
               I'm told unusual promises were made to
               Wigand.

                         LOWELL
               No, only that we would hold the story
               until it was safe for him...

                         HELEN CAPERELLI
                   (cuts in)
               And, I'm told there are questions as to
               our "star witness'" veracity.

                         LOWELL
                   (trying to control his anger)
               His "veracity" was good enough for the
               State of Mississippi.

                         HELEN CAPERELLI
                   (historic)
               Our standards have to be higher than
               anyone else's, because we are the
               standard...for everyone else...

     Whatever that means...

                         LOWELL
                   (wry)
               Well, as a "standard"...I'll hang with
               "is the guy telling the truth?"

                         HELEN CAPERELLI
               Well, with tortious interference, I'm
               afraid...the greater the truth, the
               greater the damage.

                         LOWELL
               Come again?

                         HELEN CAPERELLI
               They own the information he's disclosing.
               The truer it is, the greater the damage
               to them.  If he lied, he didn't disclose
               their information.  And the damages are
               smaller.

                         LOWELL
               Is this "Alice in Wonderland"?

                         MIKE WALLACE
               You said "on this one."  What about "this
               one"?

     And Lowell hears a changed note in Wallace's voice.  After a
     beat.

                         HELEN CAPERELLI
                   (familiar, seductive)
               If this holds up, and it very well may
               not, Mike...but, if it did.  And we aired
               this segment?  And CBS was sued by Brown
               & Williamson?  I think we could be at
               grave risk.

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (a beat)
               How grace?

                         HELEN CAPERELLI
                   (and she's been waiting for
                    this)
               Well, at the end of the day...because of
               your segment...the Brown & Williamson
               Tobacco Company...could own CBS.

     As if on cue, the alarm on Helen Caperelli's watch beeps.
     She glances at it.

                         HELEN CAPERELLI (CONT'D)
               You know, I am sorry.  But I'm due
               upstairs.

     She gets up, gathering her things.

                         LOWELL
               Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not
               go to air with this story?

                         HELEN CAPERELLI
               You're getting ahead of yourself.  We're
               all in this together.  We're all CBS.
               We'll find out soon.  Thank you,
               gentlemen.

     And taking up her briefcase, she leaves.  Don and Mike rise.

                         LOWELL
               "Tortious interference"?  Sounds like a
               disease caught by a radio.

                         DON HEWITT
                   (to Mike)
               Lunch?

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Sure.
                   (to Lowell)
               Don't worry, we call the shots around
               here.

     Lowell finds himself angry and alone.  He crosses to the
     window and pulls out his cell phone and goes to work.

                         DEBBIE DELUCA'S VOICE (OVER)
               Hello?

                         LOWELL
                   (into phone)
               Debbie, it's me.  I want you to check
               some filings and give me John Wilson's
               number at Bear-Stern.

     INT. CBS, HEWITT'S OFFICE - DAY

                         LOWELL
               What now?

                         DON HEWITT
               Kluster's coming over.

     Hewitt's on an unrelated call.  Lowell crosses to look out
     the window, a manila folder (the filing) under his arm with
     whatever he found out, like a bomb, feels distant from these
     people.  The door opens, and Eric Kluster, the President of
     CBS News enters...

                         ERIC KLUSTER
               Hello, Lowell, Mike, Don.

     Hewitt hangs up the phone.

                         ERIC KLUSTER (CONT'D)
               There has been so much soul searching
               about this Wigand, I've decided we should
               cut an alternate version of the show
               without his interview.

                         LOWELL
               So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's
               checking with outside counsel first, all
               that crap?

                         ERIC KLUSTER
               That's happening.  And, hopefully we
               won't have to use the alternate, but we
               should have it in the can.

                         LOWELL
               I'm not touching my film...

                         ERIC KLUSTER
               I'm afraid you are.

                         LOWELL
               No, I'm not...

                         ERIC KLUSTER
               We're doing this with or without you,
               Lowell.  If you like, I can assign
               another producer to edit your show...

     Lowell's stunned.  He looks like he's been hit with a
     hammer...

                         LOWELL
               Since when has the paragon of
               investigative journalism allowed lawyers
               to determine the news content on "60
               Minutes"?

                         DON HEWITT
               It's an alternate version.  So what if we
               have an alternate version?  And I don't
               think her being cautious is so damned
               unreasonable.

                         ERIC KLUSTER
                   (wry)
               So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen,
               Mr. Rather's been complaining about his
               chair again.
                   (laughter)

     As they start to leave...

                         LOWELL
                   (mild)
               Before you go...

     And Lowell takes out...

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
               I discovered this.  SEC filing...
                   (he gets their attention)
               For the sale of the CBS Corporation to
               Westinghouse Corporation.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               What?

                         DON HEWITT
               Yeah, I heard rumors.

                         LOWELL
               It's not a rumor.  It's a sale.
                   (rhetorical answer)
               If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share
               to Westinghouse and then is suddenly
               threatened with a multibillion-dollar
               lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that
               could screw up the sale, could it not?

                         ERIC KLUSTER
                   (serene)
               And what are you implying?

                         LOWELL
                   (to Kluster)
               I'm not implying.  I'm quoting.  More
               vested interests...
                   (reading from SEC filing)
               "Persons Who Will Profit From This
               Merger...
                   (beat)
               Ms. Helen Caperelli, General Counsel of
               CBS News, 3.9 million.  Mr. Eric Kluster,
               President of CBS News, 1.4 million..."

                         DON HEWITT
               Are you suggesting that she and Eric are
               influenced by money?

                         LOWELL
               Oh, no, of course they're not influenced
               by money.  They work for free.  And you
               are a Volunteer Executive Producer.

                         DON HEWITT
               CBS does not do that.  And, you're
               questioning our journalistic integrity?!

                         LOWELL
               No, I'm questioning your hearing!  You
               hear "reasonable" and "tortious
               interference."  I hear...  "Potential
               Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing
               the sale of CBS to Westinghouse."  I
               hear...  "Shut the segment down.  Cut
               Wigand loose.  Obey orders.  And fuck
               off...!"  That's what I hear.

                         DON HEWITT
               You're exaggerating!

                         LOWELL
               I am?  You pay me to go get guys like
               Wigand, to draw him out.  To get him to
               trust us, to get him to go on television.
               I do.  I deliver him.  He sits.  He
               talks.  He violates his own fucking
               confidentiality agreement.  And he's only
               the key witness in the biggest public
               health reform issue, maybe the biggest,
               most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case
               in U.S. history.  And Jeffrey Wigand,
               who's out on a limb, does he go on
               television and tell the truth?  Yes.
               Is it newsworthy?  Yes.  Are we gonna air
               it?  Of course not.  Why?  Because he's
               not telling the truth?  No.  Because he
               is telling the truth.  That's why we're
               not going to air it.  And the more truth
               he tells, the worse it gets!

                         DON HEWITT
               You are a fanatic.  An anarchist.  You
               know that?  If we can't have a whole
               show, then I want half a show rather than
               no show.  But oh, no, not you.  You won't
               be satisfied unless you're putting the
               company at risk!

                         LOWELL
               C'mon, what are you?  And are you a
               businessman?  Or are you a newsman?!
               Because that happens to be what Mike and
               I do for a living...

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Lowell.

                         LOWELL
                   (runs on)
               "Put the corporation at risk"...?  Give
               me a fucking break!

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Lowell.

                         LOWELL
               These people are putting our whole reason
               for doing what we do...on the line!

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Lowell!

                         LOWELL
               What?

                         MIKE WALLACE
               I'm with Don on this.

     And there it is.

     EXT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BERKELEY - AFTERNOON

     We see Sharon in a vegetable garden in their side yard...
     She turns, seeing him standing behind her...

     After a moment.  She knows.

                         SHARON
               What's wrong?

                         LOWELL
               They're killing the Wigand interview...

                         SHARON
               What?!

                         LOWELL
               They're pretending it's process.
               Bullshit, it's foregone.

                         SHARON
                   (beat)
               What are you and Mike going to do?

                         LOWELL
               I'm alone on this...

                         SHARON
                   (beat)
               Oh, baby...

     And the phone RINGS...  Sharon goes in the house to get it...
     She comes back out...

                         SHARON (CONT'D)
                   (after a beat)
               Jeffrey Wigand...

     INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, BERKELEY - LATE AFTERNOON

                         LOWELL
               Jeffrey...

     INT. A HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

     And we see Wigand looking rough, unshaven, sitting on a couch
     in a hotel room.  And we see his belongings, clothing, some
     boxes, a bottle of vodka, his computer, what's left of his
     world, are around the room.

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
               Jeffrey, how are you?  How's the family,
               okay?

                         WIGAND
               There is - there is no family.

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
               What do you mean there is no family?

                         WIGAND
               Liane has filed for divorce...

     INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, BERKELEY - LATE AFTERNOON

     And Lowell's dead quiet.

     INT. THE HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

                         WIGAND
               And, so, I moved out...  I see the girls
               a couple of days a week...

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (concerned)
               Where you staying now?

                         WIGAND
                   (sarcastic)
               Our favorite hotel, honey...  I checked
               into Room 930.  Odd choice?  Huh?

     And we don't know what he means by that...

     INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, BERKELEY - LATE AFTERNOON

     The last of the daylight shadows his office.

                         LOWELL
                   (after a beat)
               I don't know how to say this, Jeff,
               except to just say it right out, so I'll
               say it.  They do not want to air it.

                         WIGAND
                   (stops)
               What?!

                         LOWELL
               B & W may have threatened litigation...
               CBS is on the block...
                   (a beat)
               But you, I mean, I know how...

                         WIGAND
               No.

                         LOWELL
               No?  No, what?

                         WIGAND
               I do not think that you "know" for
               me...what it is to walk in my shoes...
                   (beat)
               ...for my kids to have seen it...for them
               to know why I've put them through what I
               did...the public airing of that...the
               testament to why I did what I
               did...you're telling me is not going to
               see the light of day.

     Lowell's quiet.  And Jeffrey starts to hang up...

                         LOWELL
               Jeff...

     And Jeffrey hangs up.

     INT. JEFFREY'S HOTEL ROOM, LOUISIANA - (PROCESS) - NIGHT

     Jeffrey silently sitting in the chair.  We COME AROUND and
     see why he's been purposely sitting there.  Why he's chosen
     this room.  Directly across the street is the Brown &
     Williamson Building.  The lights are on.  The building lit
     up.  And in an upstairs office Brown & Williamson lawyers,
     moving around a conference room, talking.  And as Jeffrey
     looks out the window...

     EXT. A SMALL TOWN, UPSTATE NEW YORK - DAY

     A peaceful, suburban street.  Small houses.  A PRIVATE
     INVESTIGATOR (P.I.) from IGI, in a raincoat, getting out of a
     car, going up the walk.  He knocks on the door.  Some
     moments.  A Woman in her late forties, handicapped, in an
     electric cart answers the door...

                         P.I.
               Mrs. Wigand?

                         THE WOMAN
               It hasn't been Mrs. Wigand for some time.

                         P.I.
               Well, I'm an investigator and I was - I
               was wondering if I could ask you a couple
               of questions about that?

                         THE WOMAN
               Alright...

     INT. JOHN SCANLON'S PUBLIC RELATIONS FIRM, A MEDIA ROOM,
     NEW YORK - DAY

     And on a TELEVISION SCREEN, SUSAN WIGAND, the woman in the
     electric cart, giving a taped interview to the P.I....

                         SUSAN WIGAND
               ...seven months after we were married we
               found out that I had multiple
               sclerosis...

     We PULL BACK to see John Scanlon and his Staff watching the
     tape...  His firm's logo, public relations campaigns for some
     of his high-profile clients are on the walls.  Scanlon's on
     the phone talking with somebody as the tape runs...

                         P.I.'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (on television)
               And, you had a daughter, Diane, with him,
               is that correct?

                         SUSAN WIGAND
                   (on television)
               Yes, in 1973.

                         JOHN SCANLON
                   (on the phone, whispering)
               ...come on, Tommy Sandefur told me
               himself, he's not gonna allow Brown &
               Williamson to be demonized to the
               American public, so I told Peter Jennings
               and I...hold on...

     He stops, listening to the videotape...

                         P.I.'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (on television)
               Would it be fair to say when he divorced
               you he left you in a precarious
               situation?  You had multiple sclerosis;
               you had a small child to raise.

                         JOHN SCANLON
                   (ignoring that part; to staff)
               Mention that part in the executive
               summary and in the chapters "First Wife"
               and "Estrangement of Daughter."
                   (beat; into phone)
               So, I was telling Pete, I said, "You've
               been taken in by this guy...

                         SUSAN WIGAND
                   (on television)
               Yes...
                   (beat)
               But you have to understand, the divorce
               was something that we both wanted...

                         JOHN SCANLON
               He's a total bullshit artist.  He's a
               shoplifter.  He's a convicted shoplifter.

     And as we end in a sea of documents, affidavits, court
     records, all from Louisville, all about Jeffrey.  We
     understand the war has only been begun...

     INT. CBS, "60 MINUTES," CORRIDOR, LOWELL'S OFFICE - MORNING

     Lowell, in his office, his door open for anyone to see him,
     an immovable force, sitting behind his desk.  Hewitt appears
     in his doorway...

                         DON HEWITT
                   (after a beat, cold)
               So, what are you going to do?

                         LOWELL
               Well, what do you think I'm going to do?
               Quit in protest?  I'm not going to do
               that.

                         DON HEWITT
                   (surprised)
               You're taking "no" for an answer?

                         LOWELL
               No.  I'm not going to take "no" for an
               answer.  No.

                         DON HEWITT
               Then what are you going to do?

     Hewitt looks at him...

                         LOWELL
               I'm staying right here.  Doing my job.
               Fighting to get my show on the air.  You
               don't like it?  Hey, I'll tell you
               what...fire my ass...

                         DON HEWITT
               End up in a high-profile lawsuit with
               Lowell, the First Amendment martyr?  I
               don't think so.
                   (laughs)
               Take a look at this...  This is a summary
               of a dossier that's being prepared.

     And he gives him a copy of it.

                         DON HEWITT (CONT'D)
               He would lie about his whole life...?
               Who's going to believe him about anything
               he says...?
                   (a beat, and the coup de grace)
               The Wall Street Journal's doing a major
               story and I think the Post.  You backed
               the wrong horse...

     He turns and starts off along the hall.  As he goes...

                         DON HEWITT (cont'd)
                   (his parting shot)
               The version without his interview is
               going to air the week after next.

     Lowell watches him walk away.  Debbie enters.

                         DEBBIE DELUCA
               What was that about?

                         LOWELL
               Get me Wigand.

                         DEBBIE DELUCA
               Sure.

                         LOWELL
               ...fuck is this?  Fuck!

     INT. THE PHONE BOOTH, HIGH SCHOOL, LOUISVILLE - DAY

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (on the phone, upset)
               You never told me you were married
               before...that you had a daughter...

     And Wigand is in the phone booth at the High
     School...students walking by...

                         WIGAND
                   (outraged)
               Well, how is that any of your business?!
               That is not something that you people
               need to know!

     His voice carries, a student looks over...

     INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE - DAY

                         LOWELL
                   (frustrated)
               Oh, you know what we do or do not need to
               know?  Since when have you become a media
               expert?

     INT. THE PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

                         WIGAND
                   (upset)
               What do you want to do, Lowell, look up
               my ass, too...!

     And he realizes he's said it too loud, a couple of passing
     students stop, looking at him...

     INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, CBS - DAY

                         LOWELL
               Oh, my God.

                         WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (after a beat, lowering his
                    voice, but contentious)
               You're not even on this anymore...  What
               do you care?

                         LOWELL
               Jeff!  Wake the fuck up!  Everybody is on
               the line here.  If they can catch you in
               a lie, they can paint everything with
               that brush.  Do you understand?
               Everything you say!

                         WIGAND
               I told the truth!

                         LOWELL
               Everything...you...say!  And I can't
               defend you, man, with one hand tied
               behind my back!  Because you keep from
               me...what they can discover.  And they
               will discover everything!  Believe me.

     INT. THE PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

     Wigand's quiet.  He looks out the phone booth.  After some
     moments...

                         WIGAND
                   (meaning his first wife and
                    their child, upset)
               ...I was young.  I was
               young...confused...  We didn't handle it
               the right way...

     INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, NEW YORK - DAY

                         LOWELL
                   (after a beat)
               She sued you for back payments of child
               support?

     INT. THE PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

                         WIGAND
               She did not sue me.  We had a dispute
               over money...  I settled it, she dropped
               the complaint...
                   (angry)
               Any other questions?

     And we'll go back and forth...

                         LOWELL
               Yes.  Did you lie about being on the
               American Judo Team in the Olympics?

                         WIGAND
               What?

                         LOWELL
               Some public relations guy got a hold of a
               tape of an interview...where you're
               saying you were on the American Judo Team
               in the Olympics...?

                         WIGAND
                   (explosive)
               What kind of shit is this?  I was not on
               the team, I sparred with the Olympic
               Team...okay?

     And we see, unbeknownst to Wigand, the P.I. in the raincoat,
     who interviewed his ex-wife, coming out of an administration
     office, walking towards us along the hallways...

                         LOWELL
               Alright...the ABC Telemarketing Company?

                         WIGAND
               ABC...?

                         LOWELL
               ABC Telemarketing Company.

                         WIGAND
                   (the absurdity)
               A can opener!  A $39.95 can opener.  I
               cancelled payment...  It was junk.
                   (sarcastic)
               You ever bounce a check, Lowell?  You
               ever look at another woman's tits?  You
               ever cheat a little on your taxes?
                   (a beat, angry)
               Whose life, if you look at it under a
               microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?

     The P.I. in the raincoat passes Jeffrey, now, and doesn't
     even glance at him...

                         LOWELL
               That's the whole point, Jeffrey.  That's
               the whole point.  Anyone's.  Everyone's.
               They are gonna look under every rock, dig
               up every flaw, every mistake you've ever
               made.  They are going to distort and
               exaggerate everything you've ever done,
               man.  Don't you understand?

                         WIGAND
                   (shouts)
               What does this have to do with my
               testimony?

                         LOWELL
               That's not the point.

                         WIGAND
               What does this have to do with my
               testimony?!  I told the truth!  It's
               valid and true and provable!

                         LOWELL
               That's not the fucking point, whether you
               told the truth or not!  Hello...?

                         WIGAND
               I told the truth...  I told the truth.

     And Wigand's quiet, a deep, dark depression.  The school bell
     RING snaps him out of it...

                         WIGAND
                   (after a beat)
               I've got to teach class.  I've got to go.
               I've got to teach class.

                         LOWELL
                   (undaunted)
               And I've got to refute every fucking
               accusation made in this report before The
               Wall Street Journal runs.
                   (a beat)
               I am trying to protect you, man!

     Wigand's quiet.

                         WIGAND
                   (after a beat, the killer)
               Well, I hope you improve your batting
               average.

     And he SLAMS the phone down.  And as he stands in the phone
     booth, like a man in a glass booth, all alone...

     EXT. CBS BUILDING, ROOFTOP - DAY

     ON the door to the roof.  It SLAMS open.  An enraged Lowell
     enters and walks out into the cold rain.  Like a prize-
     fighter, shoulders hunched against the cold, he buries his
     hands in his jacket pockets.  He crosses to the edge of the
     roof high above the city.  He's pissed off.  He takes out his
     cell phone.  He dials...  Lowell hears background NOISE...

     INT. WALL STREET JOURNAL - NEWS MEETING - DAY

     Twenty sub-editors and section heads sit and stand in a clear
     area...  One of them, a large man, is CHARLIE PHILLIPS on a
     cell phone.

                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS
               Hello?

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (cautious)
               It's Lowell.  Are you guys planning to do
               a piece on a former top executive in Big
               Tobacco?

                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS
               You caught me in a news meeting.

                         LOWELL
               Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?

                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS
               You bet we are.  And I can't talk to you
               now.

                         LOWELL
               We gotta hook up.

                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS
               Sure.  Where?

                         LOWELL
               P.J.'s.

                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS
               I'll be there.

     INT. A PHONE BOOTH, NEW YORK - NIGHT

     A busy New York street.  Light mist.  And we see Lowell is on
     the phone in a phone booth...

                         LOWELL
               Yeah, I got it.  500 pages of it.  They
               looked in every corner of this guy's
               life...from a spousal abuse charge, to
               shoplifting, to a traffic ticket he got
               once for running a red light.  It's Terry
               Lenzner's outfit, IGI.  Jack, listen to
               me.  Their strategy:  discredit this guy,
               ruin his reputation in The Wall Street
               Journal, and then nobody will ever listen
               to what he's got to say about tobacco.
               He's dead.  Unless I can get this thing
               knocked down.

     INT. A HOUSE IN SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

     A townhouse with a commanding view of the Bay.  And we see a
     broad-shouldered man in his late forties sitting at a desk on
     the phone.  JACK PALLADINO.  His wife, SANDRA SUTHERLAND,
     sitting across from him on another phone.  They're Private
     Investigators...

                         LOWELL
               To make it even a little more attractive,
               I don't know if you're ever gonna get
               paid.

                         SANDRA SUTHERLAND
               Is there any truth to any of it?

                         LOWELL
               That's a good question.  "Is there any
               truth to any of it?"  I doubt it.

                         PALLADINO
               What's their deadline?

                         LOWELL
               Soon.

     Palladinos exchange looks; she nods.

                         PALLADINO
               Fax me the summary.

                         LOWELL
               That's great, Jack.

     Lowell hangs up and walks towards us to enter...

     INT. BAR - NIGHT

     CLOSE on Lowell entering, moving through the crowd of sports
     writers, feature writers, sub-editors, etc.  He comes upon a
     rugged-featured man, JIM COOPER from The New York Times,
     sitting next to Charlie.

                         JIM COOPER
               Hey, Lowell.

                         LOWELL
               How are you, Jim?

                         JIM COOPER
               Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting
               on something sensational over there.

     Lowell looks at Cooper quizzically.

                         LOWELL
               Really?  Hi, Joan.

     Just then Jim's wife enters.  They exchange greetings.

                         JIM COOPER
               Hi, baby.

                         LOWELL
               Catch you later.

     Cooper and his wife leave.  Charlie and Lowell are alone in
     the crowded bar.

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
               When's your deadline?

                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS
               Monday.

                         LOWELL
               Push it.

                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS
               What?  Forget it.

                         LOWELL
               It's a smear campaign, Charlie.

                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS
               It's drawn from a selectively
               circulated...

                         LOWELL
                   (cuts in)
               Oh, it's real selective...about as hard
               to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone
               book.

                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS
               Well, it's authoritative and is
               overwhelmingly documented.

                         LOWELL
               And it's bullshit.  And if I'm right, are
               you going to put the Journal's reputation
               behind a story that's going to blow up in
               your face?

                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS
               I'll take a look at what you got.  But I'm
               not moving any deadlines 'cause you say
               so.

     That's the way it lays.  In a different, personal tone...

                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS (cont'd)
               Are you all right?

                         LOWELL
               Yeah.  Catch you later.

     INT. A COFFEE SHOP, LOUISVILLE - DAY

     And we see a Policeman sitting at the counter having a cup of
     coffee...

                         SANDRA SUTHERLAND
               Officer Murabchick?

     He turns as Sandra Sutherland sits at the counter to the left
     of him.

                         SANDRA SUTHERLAND (cont'd)
               Officer Muravchick.  How are you?  I'm
               Sandra Sutherland.

                         POLICEMAN
               How do you do?

                         SANDRA SUTHERLAND
               Fine, thank you.  I'm doing a background
               check.  Mind if I sit down?

     INT. COURTROOM, LOUISVILLE - LATE AFTERNOON

     An older Man is on the bench.  He's just recessed his court.
     As everybody streams out, going against the tide is Jack
     Palladino.  He approaches the judge, crossing to a side
     door...

                         PALLADINO
               Your honor, could I have a word with you?
               You presided in a dispute over support
               payments...

     INT. A COFFEE SHOP, LOUISVILLE - DAY

                         POLICEMAN
               Jeffrey Wigand?  Yeah, I cited him.

     INT. EDITING ROOM, CBS - DAY

                         DAN RATHER
                   (on monitor)
               CBS is under criticism, because the CBS
               News program "60 Minutes" will not be
               presenting an interview...

     Lowell's destroying his own work product, taking apart his
     creation that we saw earlier to be so impactful.  Tony gets a
     call as Hewitt enters.

                         DON HEWITT
               What the hell are you doing?

                         LOWELL
               What does it look like I'm doing?  I'm
               editing.

                         DON HEWITT
               No, not that.  I'm talking about the
               Associated Press.  They got this story
               that we pulled this interview and they
               talked to Mike and I.  Did you tell them
               that we were lying?

                         LOWELL
               No.  I should have.  I told them I
               disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that
               this segment is as good as the original.
               I'm not lying for you.  I'm not gonna
               shut up for you.  Not on any of it.

                         DON HEWITT
               Hey!  I'm not going to fire you, okay?
               Take a vacation.  Now!

     INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE - EVENING

     A suitcase is on the floor.  Lowell, finishing packing up his
     things from his office.

                         MIKE WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER)
               Lowell.  I decided to preface Sunday's
               show.  I did three minutes on the
               "Evening News."  You'll want to see it.
                   (beat)
               Where you going?

     And he sees Wallace has stopped at his door...

                         LOWELL
               I've been banished.  In lieu of being
               fired.

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (disinterested)
               I took off on Tisch.  I took off on
               corporate.  They'll know they're not
               going to see everything on Sunday
               night...

                         LOWELL
               I don't know.  How does that get Wigand
               on the air?

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (goes up)
               Do me a favor, will you?  Spare me, for
               God's sake.  Get in the real world.  What
               do you think?  I'm going to resign in
               protest?  To force it on the air?  The
               answer is "no."  I don't plan to spend
               the end of my days wandering in the
               wilderness of National Public Radio.
                   (beat)
               That decision I've already made.

                         VOICE
                   (from corridor; to Mike)
               It just started, Mike...

     Wallace waves Lowell's remark aside and exits.  We dwell on
     Lowell until he exits...

     INT. CBS CORRIDOR - EVENING

     ...into the hall.  Dan Rather introduced Mike.  As Lowell
     exits, we SEE Hewitt, Kluster and Caperelli outside of
     Hewitt's office watching...  Lowell, disgusted, takes a
     cursory look and moves towards the elevator.  But he hears...

                         MIKE WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER)
               Where's the rest?  Where the hell's the
               rest?!!

     Lowell turns to see Wallace shouting up at the monitors in
     disbelief...

                         MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D)
               You cut it!  You cut the guts out of what
               I said...!

     Wallace moves in on Kluster...

                         ERIC KLUSTER
               It was a time consideration, Mike...

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Time?  Bullshit!  You corporate lackey!
               Who told you your incompetent little
               fingers had the requisite skills to edit
               me!  I'm trying to Band-Aid a situation,
               here, and you're too dim to...

                         HELEN CAPERELLI
                   (interrupts, familiar)
               Mike...  Mike...  Mike...

                         MIKE WALLACE
               "Mike?"

     It was a big mistake.  Now, he turns on her.  Zeroing in,
     getting closer...

                         MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D)
               "Mike?"  Try "Mr. Wallace."  We work in
               the same corporation doesn't mean we work
               in the same profession.  What are you
               gonna do now?  You gonna finesse me?
               Lawyer me some more?  I've been in this
               profession fifty fucking years.  You and
               the people you work for are destroying
               the most-respected, the highest-rated,
               the most-profitable show on this network!

     EXT. THE EAST RIVER - NIGHT

     A Range Rover pulls up.  Charlie Phillips gets out.  He
     crosses to Lowell who's been waiting by his own taxi.

                         LOWELL
               Here.

     He hands Charlie a folder with the brown notebook inside that
     is the partially complete Palladino/Sutherland/Lowell work
     product.

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
               These are their leads, their sources.  I
               want you to have your reporters...

                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS
               Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.

                         LOWELL
               Have them make their own calls.  They'll
               find that these sources have a different
               story than the one that's in the
               dossier...
                   (demands)
               Push the deadline, Charlie...

     Charlie starts looking through the Palladino/
     Sutherland/Lowell work product.  Meanwhile...

                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS
               I'll push it for a week.  Let Milo and
               Suein go through it.

     INT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, KITCHEN - DAY

                         BARBARA
               He's into kind of little cars, that...

                         LIANE
               That remote control thing?

                         BARBARA
               Yeah.

                         LIANE
               Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.

                         BARBARA
               Mom.

                         LIANE
               Yes, baby?

                         BARBARA
               There's Dad, on TV.

     INT. A BAR, LOUISVILLE - DAY

     And we see Jeffrey in a quiet Bar.  The television's on, the
     sound low, the midday news.  As Jeffrey looks up and sees his
     photograph on TELEVISION.  In his LOCAL WORLD the impact is:

                         LOCAL NEWSCASTER
               And in local news, WLKO Louisville has
               gained access to a five-hundred-page
               dossier on former Brown & Williamson
               research head Jeffrey Wigand detailing
               charges of spousal abuse, shoplifting...

     And Jeffrey looks as if something just detonated inside of
     him.

     WE'RE LOOKING AT MIKE WALLACE SITTING IN FRONT OF A BACKDROP
     ON "60 MINUTES," ON A TELEVISION...

     INT. HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

     And Jeffrey sitting alone in the hotel, watching the show...

                   (on "60 Minutes")
               "...thousands of documents from inside
               the tobacco industry have surfaced over
               the past year, documents that appear to
               confirm what a former..."

     And as we look at Jeffrey's face, set in stone...

     INT. MIKE WALLACE'S APARTMENT, NEW YORK - NIGHT

     Mike Wallace is in his study, watching the show alone.  As we
     slowly move in on Mike, seeing himself on television...

                   (on "60 Minutes")
               "The management of CBS has told us that
               knowing he had that agreement..."

     And the look on his face says:  HE DOES NOT LIKE THIS.

     INT. THE CARIBBEAN BUNGALOW - DAY/NIGHT

     Lowell silently watching the broadcast...

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (on "60 Minutes")
               "...if were to broadcast an interview

                   (on "60 Minutes," from the
                    interview with Wigand...)

               confidentiality agreement with...(blip)
               is still in force?'"

     And all we can hear is an ELECTRONICALLY-ALTERED VOICE and
     the BLANKED-OUT image of a man...

                         WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER)
               "Yes, it is."

                   (on "60 Minutes")
               "So, what are they gonna do?  Sue you for

     Jeffrey, motionless...  A man, no longer with a face or a
     voice...  And as he gets up, and quietly turns off the
     television...

     INT. MIKE WALLACE'S APARTMENT, NEW YORK - NIGHT, LATER

     Wallace, hasn't moved, still in his chair.  He stares,
     ignoring the CBS programming, on the phone, making a call...

     EXT. THE CARIBBEAN BEACH - NIGHT

     Lowell, walking up the sand, his cell phone rings.

                         LOWELL
               Yeah.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               You disappeared on me.  How long you
               staying?

                   (absurd)
               I disappeared on you?

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (meaning the show)
               Alright.  What did you think?

                         LOWELL
                   (after a beat)
               I think it was a disgrace.

     The look on Wallace's face says he thinks so, too.  It's
     obvious.  He hangs up the phone.

     EXT. LOWELL'S BUNGALOW, THE CARIBBEAN - NIGHT

     Lowell is on the phone, now.  The moon lights the water, the
     empty beach.  He listens as a phone, through STATIC, RINGS
     and RINGS and RINGS.

     INT. WIGAND'S HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

     And we hear the phone RINGING.  We slowly PAN across the
     hotel room.  We see on the floor a pair of men's tasseled
     loafers...  A discarded sport jacket...  And we see Jeffrey,
     barefoot, sitting in a chair in the center of the room.  He's
     looking out the window at B&W.  The curtains are blowing...
     And he's still...  The sound of the phone RINGING and
     RINGING...

     EXT. THE BEACH, THE CARIBBEAN - NIGHT

                         AN OPERATOR'S VOICE (OVER)
               Sir, there's still no answer in that
               room.

                         LOWELL
               Alright.  Get me the manager's office...

     INT. THE HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

                         HOTEL DESK CLERK
               David?  David, you've got a call on line
               4.  I think you better take it.

     A thin Man answers the phone.

                         THE HOTEL MANAGER
               This is David MacDougal.  How can I help
               you?

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
               Mr. MacDougal, my name is Lowell Bergman.
               I'm a producer for "60 Minutes"...
               I'm concerned with a friend of mine who's
               staying at your hotel right now.

     INT.  THE HOTEL CORRIDOR, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

     And we see the Hotel Manager, walking along with a Security
     Guard, and now KNOCKING on Jeffrey's door...

     And when there is no response, the Manager nods to the
     Security Guard, the Guard using a pass key, unlocking the
     door.  But the door stops, the chain-lock drawn.  The Manager
     looks in through the chain...and he can see Jeffrey sitting
     in the chair...

                         THE HOTEL MANAGER
               Mr. Wigand?  Mr. Wigand?

     Jeffrey's still.  The Manager quickly takes a cell phone from
     the Security Guard.

     EXT. THE CARIBBEAN - NIGHT

     Lowell, standing on the beach anxiously waiting.

                         THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (upset)
               I think I need to call the police.  He
               won't respond...

                         LOWELL
               No, no.  Don't call the police!
                   (urgent)
               Just tell him I'm on the phone with
               you...  My name is Lowell Bergman...
               Just tell him that.

     INT. THE HOTEL CORRIDOR, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

                         THE HOTEL MANAGER
                   (through the door, frightened)
               Mr. Wigand...Mr. Bergman is on the
               telephone.

     Jeffrey's quiet.

     EXT. THE CARIBBEAN - NIGHT

                         LOWELL
               Did he hear you?

                         THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE (OVER)
               You're breaking up.  I can't hear you.

     Lowell goes deeper into the water.

                         LOWELL
               What about now?

                         THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE (OVER)
               What?

                         LOWELL
               Hello, can you hear me now?

     INT. WIGAND'S HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

     And now the walls behind MORPH into a green daytime garden,
     the garden behind his house.  And as we DOLLY AROUND Wigand,
     more walls MORPH into the side yard, and, turning slowly, he
     sees Barbara and Deborah in the emerald-green grass.  They
     stop and smile, then they stare at us, at their father.  And
     he looks at his children, at an idyll lost...  The chair, the
     man are the only real objects left in the view from inside
     his head...

     EXT. THE CARIBBEAN - NIGHT

     Lowell anxiously moves along the beach, trying to be heard,
     the phone chattering with static...

                         LOWELL
                   (alarmed)
               What's happening?!

                         THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (afraid)
               He doesn't seem to be listening...

                         LOWELL
                   (on the cell phone, shouts,
                    urgent)
               Alright, now listen to me.  I want you -
               I want you to tell him, in these words:
               get on the fucking phone...!

                         THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE (OVER)
               I can't say that!

                         LOWELL
               No, you can.  Tell him to get on the
               fucking phone!

     INT. THE HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

                         THE HOTEL MANAGER
                   (at the door, to Jeffrey, loud)
               He told me to tell you, to get on...the
               fucking phone...!

     And even he's surprised by his language.  And suddenly
     Jeffrey gets up, unlatches the door, grabs the phone from the
     Hotel Manager.  Wigand in the hotel corridor, Lowell standing
     knee-deep in the water...

                         WIGAND
                   (on the phone, angry)
               You manipulated me into this...!

                         LOWELL
               That's bullshit, Jeff!

                         WIGAND
               You greased the rails!

                         LOWELL
               I greased the rails for a guy who wanted
               to say yes.  I helped him to say yes.
               Alright.  You're not a robot, Jeff!
               That's all.  You got a mind of your own,
               don't you?

                         WIGAND
                   (running on)
               "Up to you, Jeffrey.  That's the power
               you have, Jeffrey.  Vital insider
               information the American public need to
               know."  Lowell Bergman, the hot show who
               never met a source he couldn't turn
               around.

                         LOWELL
                   (running on)
               I fought for you...and I still fight for
               you.

                         WIGAND
               You fought for me...?!
                   (running on)
               ...you manipulated me...into where I am
               now...staring at the Brown & Williamson
               Building.  It's all dark.  Except the
               10th floor!  That's the legal department.
               That's where they fuck with my life!

                         LOWELL
                   (beat)
               Jeffrey, where you going with this?  So
               where you goin'?
                   (quiet)
               You are important to a lot of people,
               Jeffrey.  You think about that.  You
               think about them.

     CLOSE ON JEFFREY:  standing in the room with the blowing
     curtains...

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
               I'm running out of heroes, man...
                   (after a beat)
               Guys like you are in short supply.

     And for the first time, Wigand smiles.

                         WIGAND
                   (a beat, wry)
               Yeah, guys like you, too.

     And the grave situation passes.

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
                   (after a beat)
               Where are you, anyway?

                         LOWELL
               I'm on a leave of absence.  Forced
               vacation.

                         WIGAND
                   (a rare laugh, his sarcasm)
               You try and have a good time.

                         LOWELL
                   (droll)
               Yeah.  Yeah, I will.

     INT. THE CARIBBEAN BUNGALOW - DAY/NIGHT

     Sharon's cooking across the room...  And there's just the
     sound of the ceiling fan turning.

                         LOWELL
               "I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60
               Minutes.'"  You know, you take the "60
               Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody
               returns your phone call.  Maybe Wigand's
               right.  Maybe I'm hooked.  What am I
               hooked on?  The rush?  "60 Minutes"?
               What the hell for?  Infotainment.  It's
               so fucking useless, all of it.

                         SHARON
                   (a beat)
               So, it's a big country with a free press.
               You can go work somewhere else.

                         LOWELL
               Free press?  Press is free...for anyone
               who owns one.  Larry Tisch has a free
               press.

                         SHARON
               Get some perspective, Lowell.

                         LOWELL
               I got perspective.

                         SHARON
               No, you do not.

                         LOWELL
               From my perspective, what's been going on
               and what I've been doing is ridiculous.
               It's half-measures.

                         SHARON
               You're not listening.
                   (beat)
               Really know what you're going to do
               before you do it.

     And as the fan squeaks, turning...  Lowell stares at Sharon.

     WE SEE SNOW IS ON THE GROUND.

     EXT. LINCOLN, MONTANA - DAY

     Between two curved colonnades of SNOW-covered trees drives a
     rental car.  CLOSER, it's Lowell.  His POV spots a dirty SUV
     and he pulls into park across from a coffee shop in this out-
     of-context mountain town.  His pager beeps.  He looks at it.
     He detours from the coffee shop to a pay phone on the corner
     of the Moose Lodge.

                         DEBBIE DELUCA'S VOICE (OVER)
               I've got Richard Scruggs on the phone...

                         LOWELL
               Patch him through.

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS' VOICE (OVER)
               Well, Lowell, you are not going to
               believe this...

     INT. A COURTROOM + ROTUNDA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

     And we see the back of a crowded courtroom.  Richard Scruggs
     is standing in the rear amongst bailiffs an witnesses,
     talking on his own cell phone.

                         RICAHRD SCRUGGS
               The Governor of Mississippi is suing his
               own Attorney General...to abandon
               litigation against Big Tobacco...

                         LOWELL
               Oh, good...

     Waiting media are relaxing as Scruggs continues to Lowell...

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
                   (after a beat)
               But, now that the version without Jeff
               ran...what's the chance of getting his
               interview on the air...?
                   (beat)
               Hello?

     Sudden STATIC.  Scruggs now exits the building, past the
     metal detector, seeking better reception.

                         LOWELL
               Yeah, I'm here.

     EXT. COURTHOUSE STAIRS, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
               What chance is there of getting Jeff's
               interview on the air...?

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (droll)
               Less than great.

     And the courthouse doors suddenly burst open, Michael Moore
     and his attorneys coming out.  Scruggs comes further down the
     steps so he can hear, away from Michael Moore who begins
     answering questions from the Press.

                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
                   (after a beat)
               ...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell

     INT. CAFE, LINCOLN, MONTANA - DAY

     Lowell walks right in and up to a booth and a COUPLE in
     hiking pants and hiking boots.  They look up at him...

                         LOWELL
               Hi.  So, what are you folks doing here in
               Lincoln?

     And we sense something is all wrong here.

                         MAN GEOLOGIST
                   (affable)
               Geology survey.

                   (nods)
               Geology.  Yeah?  Really?

                         WOMAN GEOLOGIST
               How about you?

                         LOWELL

               Oh, yeah?

     Lowell nods.  They look at each other and they both know
     there's a lot more than meets the eye.  And as Lowell gets up
     and leaves...

     EXT. A PAY PHONE, LINCOLN, MONTANA - DAY

     And we see Lowell on the PAY PHONE again.

                         LOWELL
               Just ran into two of your "geologists."

                         LOWELL
               How long?

                         BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE (OVER)
               Three hours.

                         LOWELL

     INT. LOWELL'S ROOM, MOTEL, MONTANA - NIGHT

     Lowell is in a T-shirt and sweat pants, sitting in an old, re-
     upholstered-one-too-many-times chair in a room barely big
     enough for a chair, a bed and the TV/VCR combo on the cheap
     dresser.  It's playing Lowell's cut of the full Wigand
     interview.  He watches the show that will never see the light
     of day.

                         MIKE WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER)
               "...like the testimony before Congress of

                         WIGAND
                   (in matching CLOSE-UP)
               "I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured
               himself...  Because I watched those
               testimonies very carefully."

     Then it cuts to all seven CEOs of Big Tobacco raising their
     hands and taking the oath in front of Congress to tell the
     truth while...

                         WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER)
               "All of us did...there was this whole
               like of people, the whole line of CEOs up
               there, all swearing that."

                         WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER)
               "Part of the reason I'm here is I
               FELT..."

     And the PAUSE after the word makes "FELT" resound, and as it
     CUTS TO Jeffrey ON CAMERA saying...

                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
               "...that their representation..."

     And Lowell FREEZES after the image...  He gets up, looking
     out the window through the curtain with the spill from the
     neon motel sign.  Outside are horse trailers.  He goes back
     to watching the show...standing there...in touch with his
     own creative work product and the ideas inherent in it in
     this decision-making process that we feel is critical to him.
     Turning, he dials the phone and we intercut with...

                         JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER)
               Hello?

                         LOWELL
               Jim, it's Lowell.

     INT. NEW YORK TIMES - NIGHT

                         JIM COOPER
               Hey!  Where are you?

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
                   (doesn't answer)
               Remember that night at P.J.'s?  You asked
               me if we were sitting on something
               "explosive"?
                   (beat)
               Well, we're not "sitting on" it.
                   (beat)
               CBS corporate leaned on CBS News which
               yanked an interview we did with a top-
               ranking tobacco scientist.  A corporate
               officer.  They are trying to close down
               the story.

                         JIM COOPER
                   (sarcastic)
               You mean, "60 Minutes" is letting CBS
               corporate decide what is or is not news?
                   (beat)
               What's Wallace think about this, or
               Hewitt, or...?

                         LOWELL
               How prominent?  What kind of placement?

                         JIM COOPER
               Oh, c'mon, Lowell.  This is The New York
               Times.  I don't know...

                         LOWELL
               Well, until you do, all I can tell you is
               what you already know...they will not air
               an interview.

                         JIM COOPER
               Call me back in ten.

     Lowell hangs up.  Re-dials.

     INT. DEBBIE DELUCA'S APARTMENT - NEW YORK - LATE NIGHT

     Debbie answers, intercutting with above...

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
               Debbie.  It's me...

                         DEBBIE DELUCA
               Hi.  What time is it?

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
               Oh, it's late.

                         DEBBIE DELUCA
               That I know.  When are you coming back?

                         LOWELL
               I can't get out of here til mid-morning.
               I'll be in tomorrow night...
                   (beat)
               Listen, could you call a number for me,
               it's in Mississippi...

                         DEBBIE DELUCA
               Okay.  Hold on a second...  What is it?

     INT. NEW YORK TIMES - NIGHT

     Jim Cooper's workstation.  His phone rings.  He grabs it.

                         JIM COOPER
               Hello?
                   (beat)

                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
               Lowell.

                         JIM COOPER
               Alright, Lowell.  Page one.  Editorial's
               interested.  Let's talk.

     INT. MOTEL, LINCOLN, MONTANA - NIGHT

                         LOWELL
               Here's how it works.  You ask me
               questions.  I tell you if you're wrong.

                         JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER)
               Okay.
                   (pause)
               Lowell?

                         LOWELL
               Yeah?

                         JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER)
               You're sure you want to do this?

                         LOWELL
               Why?

                         JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER)
               Hey, it doesn't work?  You've burned your
               bridges, man.

                         LOWELL
               You ready...?

                         JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER)
               Okay...  About this whistle-blower...
               Did Mike and Don go along with the
               corporate decision?

     No answer.

                         JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER)(cont'd)
               Lowell?

                         LOWELL
               Did I tell you you were wrong?

                         JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER)
               No.
                   (beat)
               I'm assuming the cave-in begins with the
               threat of litigation from Big Tobacco.
               Are we talking...are we talking Brown &
               Williamson, here?

     MOVING CLOSER into the face of Lowell.  His gaze falters.
     His eyes go back to the motel TV mutely frozen on the show.
     Whatever he's seeing there, his gaze is steadfast.

     EXT. STREET, NEW YORK - 5:30 A.M.

     Newspaper box is loaded with The New York Times.

     EXT. HOTEL, NEW YORK - 5:30 A.M.

     Cab pulls to curb and a raincoated Man emerges.  We SEE he
     carries a copy of this morning's New York Times.

     INT. A HOTEL ROOM, NEW YORK - DAWN

     A suitcase is half-unpacked on the floor...a sleeping
     figure...  There's a knock.  Irritated, a sleeping Lowell
     gets up to answer it.  He looks through the security peep
     hole.  He opens it.  And Mike Wallace, a newspaper under his
     arm, is standing in the doorway.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Did I get you up?

                         LOWELL
               No, I usually sit around in my hotel
               room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the
               morning, sleepy look on my face.

     There's an awkward quiet.  Mike enters.  He slows, looks
     around.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               How many shows have we done?  Huh?
               C'mon, how many?

                         LOWELL
               Oh, lots.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Yeah, that's right.

                         LOWELL
               But in all that time, Mike, did you ever
               get off a plane, walk into a room, and
               find that a source for a story changed
               his mind?  Lost his heart?  Walked out on
               us?  Not one fucking time!  You want to
               know why?

                         MIKE WALLACE
               I see a rhetorical question on the
               horizon.

                         LOWELL
               I'm going to tell you why.  Because when
               I tell someone I'm going to do something,
               I deliver.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell
               Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down
               the shining path.  To show me the way.

                         LOWELL
               Oh, please, Mike...

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (beat)
               Give me a break!

                         LOWELL
               No, you give me a break!  I never left a
               source hung out to dry, ever.  Abandoned.
               Not 'til right fucking now!  When I came
               on this job, I came with my word intact.
               I'm gonna leave with my word intact.
               Fuck the rules of the game!  Hell, you're
               supposed to know me, Mike.  What the hell
               did you expect?  You expect me to lie
               down?  Back off?  What, get over it?

                         MIKE WALLACE
               In the real world, when you get to where
               I am, there are other considerations...

                         LOWELL
               Like what?  Corporate responsibility?
               What, are we talking celebrity here?

                         MIKE WALLACE
               I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS.
               I'm talking about when you're nearer the
               end of your life than the beginning.
               Now, what do you think you think about
               then?  The future?  "In the future I'm
               going to do this?  Become that?"  What
               "future"?  No.  What you think is:  how
               will I be regarded in the end?  After I'm
               gone.

     He trails off.  They look at each other.

                         MIKE WALLACE (cont'd)
               Now, along the way I suppose I made some
               minor impact.
                   (beat)
               I did Iran-Gate and the Ayatollah,
               Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Saddam,
               Sadat, etcetera, etcetera.  I showed
               them thieves in suits.
                   (beat)
               I've spent a lifetime building all that.
               But history only remembers most what you
               did last.  And should that be fronting a
               segment that allowed a tobacco giant to
               crash this network?
                   (beat)
               Does it give someone at my time of life
               pause?
                   (simply)
               Yeah.

     And the look on Wallace's face is "It did.  Whether it should
     or should not...what difference does that make?  It did."
     And we realize only now that he has not come to argue.

                         LOWELL
               Mike...in my...

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (low)
               You and I have been doing this together
               for fourteen years.

     And he gives Lowell a copy of The New York Times.

                         MIKE WALLACE (cont'd)
               This is today's New York Times.
                   (beat)
               In it is the whole sordid story of what
               went on inside our shop.

     Lowell looks down at the page.  The headline is "'60 MINUTES'
     ORDERED TO PULL INTERVIEW IN TOBACCO REPORT."

                         MIKE WALLACE (cont'd)
               And in the editorial...  It accuses
               us...of betraying the legacy of Edward R.
               Murrow.

     Turning, he walks out and down the hallway.  Lowell looks at
     the newspaper.

     INT. THE COMMUTER HELICOPTER - MORNING

     The helicopter approaching Manhattan.  John Scanlon sitting
     with Hewitt, both of them reading The Wall Street Journal
     Wigand article.

                         DON HEWITT
                   (troubled)
               They conclude most of it seems pretty
               unsubstantiated...
                   (looking at him, sickened)
               You're full of shit, John.

     INT. COFFEE SHOP, NEW YORK - MORNING

     Lowell at a table littered with New York Times, New York
     Daily News, etc.  His phone rings...

                         LOWELL
               Yeah.

     INT. A CITY BUS, NEW YORK - MORNING

     Broadway backgrounds streak past Debbie DeLuca's head as she
     rides, talking on a cell phone, The Wall Street Journal in
     her hand.

                         DEBBIE DELUCA
               ...front page.  There's a picture of
               Wigand.  Article's entitled, "Getting
               Personal," by-lined to Suein Hwang and
               Milo Geyelin.  Wait, hold on a second,
               Lowell.

     Debbie hits "call waiting."

                         DEBBIE DELUCA (cont'd)
               Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  I'll see if I can
               find him.  Hold on...
                   (beat; to Lowell)
               Yeah, Don's looking for you...

                         LOWELL
               Good.

                         DEBBIE DELUCA
               The sub-heading is, "Brown & Williamson
               Has a 500-Page Dossier Attacking Chief
               Critic."
               It quotes Richard Scruggs calling it "the
               worst kind of an organized smear campaign
               against a whistle-blower."

     INT. COFFEE SHOP, NEW YORK - MORNING

     EXTREMELY CLOSE Lowell.

                         DEBBIE DELUCA'S VOICE (OVER)
               "...a close look at the file, and
               independent research by this newspaper
               into its key claims, indicates that many
               of the serious allegations against Mr.
               Wigand are backed by scant or
               contradictory evidence..."

     EXT. STREET, NEW YORK - MORNING

     As Lowell hails a cab in a WIDE ANGLE and runs towards us,
     jumping into the cab...

     INT. DON HEWITT'S OFFICE - DAY

                         DON HEWITT
               The news division has been vilified in
               The New York Times, in print, on
               television, for caving to corporate
               interests!

     We PULL BACK and we see that Lowell's with Hewitt in Hewitt's
     office...

                         DON HEWITT (CONT'D)
               The New York Times ran a blow by blow of
               what we talked about behind closed doors!
               You fucked us!

                         LOWELL
                   (shouting)
               No, you fucked you!  Don't invert stuff!
               Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you
               bought it.  The Wall Street Journal,
               here, not exactly a bastion of anti-
               capitalist sentiment, refutes Big
               Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest
               form of character assassination!  And
               now, even now, when every word of what
               Wigand has said on our show is printed,
               the entire deposition of his testimony in
               a court of law in the State of
               Mississippi, the cat totally out of the
               bag, you're still standing here debating!
               Don, what the hell else...do you need?

     And Hewitt, looking around.

                         DON HEWITT
               Mike, you tell him...

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (simply)
               You fucked up, Don.

     And Don's taken off stride...

                         DON HEWITT
                   (recovers fast)
               Hey, it's old news!  Stick with me.  Like
               always, we'll be okay.  These things have
               a half-life of fifteen minutes...

                         MIKE WALLACE
               No, that's fame.  Fame has a fifteen-
               minute half-life...
                   (droll)
               Infamy...lasts a little longer.

     Lowell looks at Wallace.

                         MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D)
               We caved.  It's foolish.  It's simply
               dead wrong.
                   (in his face, so there's no
                    doubt)
               Now, this is what we're going to do.
               We're going over to Black Rock...

     INT. A HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE CLASS, LOUISVILLE - AFTERNOON

     Jeff is in front of his class, teaching...

                         WIGAND
               Okay, so let's get back to it.  Alright,
               now, what we saw there was...

     INT. LAX - ECU:  LOWELL - NIGHT

     Tired, his suitcase at his feet.  We don't know if he's
     coming or going.  He's at a pay phone in the more-deserted-
     than-not airport.

                         LOWELL
                   (into phone)
               They cancelled the six o'clock.
                   (beat)
               I don't know why.  I'm on the 8:10.  I
               should be home...9:30.  I'll see you
               then.  Love ya'.  Bye...

     He hangs up and ambles over to a lounge with a few travellers
     sitting in it.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               "CBS Management wouldn't let us broadcast
               our original story and our interview with
               Wigand because they were worried about
               the possibility of a multi-billion dollar
               lawsuit against us for tortious
               interference...  But now things have
               changed."

     INT. JEFFREY WIGAND'S APARTMENT, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

     A small apartment.  Jeffrey dishes out second helpings of
     pasta primavera into two pasta plates and brings them into
     the kitchenette to his girls, Deborah and Barbara.  And now
     we SEE AND HEAR the small television on the table playing "60
     Minutes" and...

                         MICHAEL MOORE
                   (on television)
               "...in my opinion, is an industry that
               has perpetrated the biggest fraud on the
               American public in history."

     Deborah looks proudly at her father.

     Wigand's gotten up and gone out of the kitchenette.  He has
     stopped for a moment around the corner in the hallway.  His
     kids can't see him.  We can.  And he watches them and his
     eyes get shiny and start to tear.  And as he stands there,
     watching his girls at the kitchen table witnessing their
     father's hard-earned "truth" on television, we realize that
     of all the audiences, his girls are the one he cares about
     most...

     INT. AIRPORT LOUNGE

     And Lowell in his moment of victory is watching his "60
     Minutes" double segment on a departure lounge television with
     his feet resting on his suitcase, next to a Chicano woman
     with two kids and her mother and an older man with a beard
     and cane.  An airport cleaner stops to watch, too.  Lowell
     glances at him...

     Unbeknownst to these viewers, arrested by the content on the
     television screen, is that the man who made it sits casually
     among them, watching his work.

     INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, KITCHEN, BERKELEY - NIGHT

     Sharon sits at the kitchen table.  She watches in a far
     corner a small countertop television.  It's "60 Minutes," the
     full show entitled "Jeffrey Wigand, Ph.D." and on the top
     right, "PRODUCED BY LOWELL BERGMAN."  As Sharon continues
     watching the television playing on the counter, the emotional
     currents within her remaining unrevealed...

     INT. MIKE WALLACE'S STUDY - ON MIKE WALLACE - NIGHT

     watching the show.  He sees himself...

                         MIKE WALLACE
                   (to Wigand)
               "You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"

                         WIGAND
                   (on television, hesitating)
               "There are times...I wish I hadn't done
               it.  But there are times that I feel
               compelled to do it..."
               "I've - if you asked me if I would do it
               again or if it's - do I think it's worth
               it.  Yeah.  I think it's worth it."

     Wallace, satisfied, rises to refill his glass, as...

     INT. AIRPORT LOUNGE

     Lowell watching show in airport.

     INT. A SURVEILLANCE VAN, LINCOLN, MONTANA - NIGHT

     And we see the FBI Agent, BILL ROBERTSON on the phone.

                         BILL ROBERTSON
               I promised you a three-hour heads-
               up...well, here it is.  Have a camera
               crew standing by in Helena, Montana on
               Tuesday and I'll give you a three-hour
               head start.  Alright?  By the way, that
               was a hell of a good show tonight...

     INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BERKELEY - NIGHT

                         LOWELL
                   (nods, trustworthy)
               Thank you, Bill.

     And he quietly hangs up.  And it's still.  Sharon's laid
     down, closing her eyes.  They lie close together.  After some
     moments, she opens her eyes and lets us know what she's been
     thinking...

                         SHARON
                   (understated)
               You won.

     This time he isn't droll.

                         LOWELL
               Yeah?
                   (a beat)
               What did I win?

     There's an odd look on his face, not the look of a victor.
     He shuts off the light.  And as they lie close together in
     the dark in each other's arms...

     WE'RE LOOKING AT THE FAMILIAR CBS EYE ON A TELEVISION SCREEN.
     AND THEN THE WORDS:  "SPECIAL REPORT."

     INT. MASTER CONTROL ROOM, CBS - DAY

     Lowell, entering through machine rooms, into a state-of-the-
     art Master Control Room.  On a wall are fifty or more
     monitors, in the humidity-and-temperature-controlled nexus of
     CBS operations.  And it's jammed with people, witnessing a
     fast-breaking, major news event.  Mike Wallace stands near
     Felling.  Lowell crosses past Felling and stands next to Mike
     Wallace.

     And we see footage of a handcuffed, bearded, barefoot
     Man...THEODORE KACZYNSKI, the UNABOMBER, being taken in by
     the FBI.  A director counts down.  Dan Rather launches...

                         DAN RATHER
               "Reporting from CBS World News
               headquarters in New York, good afternoon.
               There has been a major break in the case
               of the so-called 'Unabomber.'  CBS News
               has learned that a remote homesite
               outside Lincoln, Montana has been under
               FBI surveillance..."

                         BILL FELLING
               Thanks for this.  You know, we beat
               everybody.  ABC, NBC, CNN.

     Mike motions Lowell out into the corridor so they can be
     alone.

     INT. CORRIDOR, CBS - DAY

     The control room and crowd are seen through the glass wall.
     After some moments:

                         MIKE WALLACE
               That Canada story?  Still interest you?

                         LOWELL
                   (nods)
               Everything interests me.

     Mike nods...  Lowell puts his hands in his jacket pockets...
     After some moments...

                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
               I quit, Mike.

     Mike's startled.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               Bullshit.

     Lowell shakes his head "no."

                         MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D)
               C'mon, it all worked out.  You came out
               okay in the end...

                         LOWELL
               I did?  What do I tell a source on the
               next tough story?  Hang in with us.
               You'll be fine...maybe?

     They look at each other.  Lowell says to Mike, intimately,
     what he knows Mike knows...

                         LOWELL (cont'd)
               What got broken here...doesn't go back
               together again.

     Lowell's heartfelt regret.  He starts to leave.  They look at
     each other.

                         LOWELL (cont'd)
               So, uh...

     And Lowell moves off along the hallway, the monitors all
     showing CBS programming.  He doesn't even look back...

             FADE IN:

             On credit sequence...

             AN ARM

             stretched out.  Long, alabaster white.  Beautiful.  A WASH
             CLOTH enters frame.  Starts washing the arm with long, tender
             strokes. 

             A TUMBLE OF HAIR
 
             thick and auburn.  Being gently washed.  

             FINGERNAILS

             being clipped with a shiny nail clipper.  Short.  Uniform.
             Tidy.

             EYEBROWS

             brown with a touch of gold.  A BRUSH comes into view.
             Brushes against the eyebrow hair, then back again.  Against.
             Then back again.

             PANTY-HOSE

             pulled gingerly off a long leg.  Folded neatly.  The wash
             cloth begins between the toes.  Warm, soapy water.

             HAIR

             now dry.  The HAND appears with a comb.  Pulls down through
             the thick tresses.

             It is only now that we see the hand is wearing a SURGICAL
             GLOVE.

             The gloved hand holds up the comb and pulls stray hairs from
             it.  Places them in a big, clear, plastic bag.  In the bag we
             see the panty-hose, a folded flower dress, the nail
             clippings.

             Goes back to combing.  Comes across a knot and yanks the comb
             through.  The HEAD rolls over to us.  Her face is bruised,
             her eyes blank.  She is lying on the floor.

             Dead.

             End of credit sequence.

             INT. BUSH PLANE - THE KILBUCK MOUNTAINS, ALASKA - DAY

             The loud THRUM of a bush plane.  We CLOSE ON a small, cloudy
             window.  Through it we see an endless expanse of pine trees.

                                 HAP (O.S.)
                       Jesus.  Just look at all that.

             PULL BACK to reveal HAP ECKHART and WILL DORMER sitting side
             by side.  Hap's at the window.  Greying moustache, a little
             pudgy, wearing a brown suit.  Holding a folded over Seattle
             Times.

                                 HAP (cont'd)
                       I thought we had a population problem.
                       Everyone should just move up here.
                           (taps window)
                       Just look at it, Will.

             Will's eyes remain on the file on his lap.

                                 WILL
                       I don't need to look at it.

             Will Dormer.  Tall, handsome, expensively tailored suit.
             Snakeskin cowboy boots.  There's both a magnetism and a
             distance to him.  An intense mixture.  Hap glances at him.
     
                                 HAP
                       Nothing wrong with smelling the roses.

             Will looks up.  We see the trace of a thick, ropy SCAR by his
             Adam's apple.  There's tension between him and Hap, just
             below the surface.  He taps the file.

                                 WILL
                       Tell that to her, partner.

             ANGLE ON THE FILE

             a stack of 8x10 PHOTOGRAPHS.  Of the dead girl.  Her eyes
             puffed up from bruises.  The whites bloody.  Contusions along
             her breasts and shoulders.

                                 PILOT (O.S.)
                       Detective?

             The PILOT's looking back at Will.  Wearing a leather red
             baron hat.

                                 PILOT (cont'd)
                       Better check your belts.  We'll be
                       landing in about fifteen minutes.

             Will nods.  The plane lurches.  The file falls to the floor
             and the photographs scatter.  The pilot catches a glimpse of
             them.  Looks at Will.

             EXT. BUSH PLANE - CONTINUOUS

             The small yellow plane veers left.  Clears a mountain top and
             gives view to the spectacular Alaskan coastline.  The green
             of the Bering sea, the blanket of pine trees, the jagged rock
             of the beaches.  Enormous.


             EXT. LANDING STRIP - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - DAY

             A SIGN swinging in the wind: Nightmute, Alaska.  Halibut
             Fishing Capital of the World!

             PULL BACK to reveal it hanging from the eave of a small,
             corrugated building.  The "airport."  Nothing else for miles
             around.

             A mud-splattered Jeep Cherokee pulls up next to it.  Brakes
             SCREECHING.  A YOUNG WOMAN hops out.  About 23.  Petite with
             short, brown hair.

             Peers up at the sky.  Brightens at the sight of the BUSH
             PLANE coming in for landing.  Smooths down her down vest.
             Making sure the GOLD SHIELD on her belt's visible.  Nervous.
             Excited.

                                 OLD MAN (O.S.)
                       Eleanor?

             ELLIE BURR turns.  Shields her eyes from the sun.  An OLD MAN
             hosing down the side of the building.

                                 ELLIE
                       Hey, Mr. Angstrom!

                                 MR. ANGSTROM
                       What're you doing here?

             Ellie puffs up.

                                 ELLIE
                       Police business.

                                 MR. ANGSTROM
                       Police business?

             The old man screws up his face, confused.  

                                 MR. ANGSTROM (cont'd)
                       Didn't you used to baby-sit for us? 

                                 ELLIE
                       I don't babysit any more, Mr. Angstrom.
                       Just made detective three weeks ago.

             A CAT jumps down off the roof.  Angstrom sprays it.

                                 MR. ANGSTROM
                       Boy, Charlie must be short-handed down at
                       the station.

             Ellie, used to not being taken seriously.  Turns back to THE
             ROAR of the bush plane as it taxis down the strip.  Coming to
             a stop.  She hurries over as the door swings open and...

             WILL DORMER steps down.  Slipping on his sunglasses.
             Scanning the nothingness around him.  Spots the swinging
             sign.

                                 WILL
                       "Halibut fishing capital of the world."

             Hap, right behind him.  Rubs his neck.

                                 HAP
                       This ought to be interesting.

                                 ELLIE
                           (over the engine)
                       Detective Dormer!

             They look down.  Ellie reaches up and takes Will's bag.  Then
             his hand.  Shakes it vigorously.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       It's a huge honor to meet you!  Ellie
                       Burr.  I'm here to take you to the
                       station!

             Will motions to Hap.

                                 WILL
                       My partner...

                                 ELLIE
                       Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to
                       Nightmute!

             She leads them away from the plane.  Takes Will's briefcase.

                                 ELLIE
                       I just want to say how incredible it is 
                       to have you working with us, Detective
                       Dormer.  I've followed all your cases.
                       Theodore Dineli, Frank and Casey
                       Prud'homme, the Port Angeles shootings...

             Opens the back of the Jeep.  Puts the bags inside.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       ...And especially the Leland Street
                       Murders.  That was my case study at the
                       Academy.

             The Pilot walks by.  Taps her on the shoulder.

                                 PILOT
                       Tell your dad the game's gonna start late
                       this week, Ellie.

                                 ELLIE
                       Sure thing, Spence.

             She looks back at Will.  Can't help but focus in on his scar.
             Touches her own smooth neck.  In awe.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       That's where Ronald Langley cut you in
                       the basement of his father's house on 325
                       Leland, isn't it?

             Will smiles, taken aback by this girl's exuberance.

                                 WILL
                       You did your homework, Officer.

                                 ELLIE
                       Actually...

             She throws a quick glance at Angstrom.  Out of ear-shot.

                                 ELLIE
                       I just made detective three weeks ago.

             EXT. NIGHTMUTE POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

             The Cherokee parked next to a police car outside a plain, one-
             storey building.  The Nightmute Police Department.  A totem
             pole stands out front.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (O.S.)
                       Will Dormer!

             INT. CHIEF CHARLES NYBACK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

             Nightmute Police Chief CHARLES NYBACK gets up from behind his
             desk with a big smile.  Ruddy, red hair sprinkled with grey,
             Nyback wears a faded army sweater over his uniform.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       I'll be damned!

             Limps from behind his desk and gives Will a shake and a slap
             on the back.

                                 WILL
                           (warmly)
                       How you doing, Charlie?

             Nyback shakes Hap's hand.  A reunion.

                                 HAP
                       Hey, Charlie.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       Christ.  I haven't seen you boys since...

                                 WILL
                       Just after Leland Street.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       What's that, then?

                                 HAP
                       Eight years.

                                 WILL
                       Seven years.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       Seven years?  Where does it all go?  That
                       was some amazing time, though, wasn't it?

             Looks at Will.  Down at his boots.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
                       You haven't changed a bit, Will.

             Will.  Looks at Nyback's gut.

                                 WILL
                       You have, Chief.

             They LAUGH.  Eyes twinkling.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       I knew that was coming.  I deserve it.

             He starts back over to his desk.  Notices Ellie still
             standing by the door.  Points to Will.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
                       Pay attention to this man, Ellie.  He'll
                       teach you how to be a great cop.

             Ellie straightens.  Smiles.  Looks over at Will.

                                 ELLIE
                       Yes, sir.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       That's all, for now.

             Ellie, realises they want to be alone.

                                 ELLIE
                       Oh.  Right.  Okay.

             Backs out.  Quietly closing the door behind her.  Will
             unbuttons his jacket.  Takes a seat.

                                 WILL
                       Nice kid.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                           (sits with a SIGH)
                       Got a love affair with police work.
                       Drives me crazy with it.

             Will surveys the fishing poles leaning against the gun rack.

                                 WILL
                       Keeping you busy up here, Charlie?

             Hap picks up a cheap trophy.  Reads the base.

                                 HAP
                       "2nd prize Great Kodiak Salmon Catch."

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       I told you seven years ago this was a 
                       stepping stone to retirement.

             Nyback nods to Hap's Seattle Times.  The headline:  "Deeper
             Investigation into Special Branch"...

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
                       Looks like it's a good time for you to
                       get up here, too.  With all the bad
                       business going on down at Special Branch.

             Will and Hap share a look.  No more joking.  Hap folds over
             the paper.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
                       Just five bad apples so far?

                                 WILL
                       So far.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       What's the D.A. got them on?

                                 WILL
                       Four unwarranted shootings, witness
                       intimidation, and cocaine theft.

             Nyback winces.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       How about you?  How you faring?

                                 HAP
                       They're all over us, Charlie.

                                 WILL
                       They're all over everybody.

                                 HAP
                       I.A.'s calling themselves the "Corruption
                       Task Force."  Can you believe that?
                       Trying to root out any mistakes or
                       "oversights" any other Detectives may
                       have made over the years.  They're
                       turning it into a witch hunt.  Something
                       on the news about it practically every
                       night.

             Nyback pulls a stack of messages from his desk.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       Got a bunch of messages here from some
                       guy named Warfield.

             Hap tosses a glance over at Will.

                                 WILL
                       That's I.A.'s pit bull.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       Wants me to keep him posted on all your
                       movements up here.

             Nyback turns and ceremoniously drops the messages into the
             trash.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
                       I'm just glad Buck could spare you a
                       couple of weeks.  Take you out of the
                       frenzy.  I gotta tell you, though, I sure
                       don't miss big city police work.  Not
                       that I was ever a great detective.  But
                       up here there's no Bureaucracy.  No
                       Public Relations.  No blurred lines.
                       Just good guys and bad guys.  Simple.

             A cloud passes over his face.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
                       Except for this.

             Holds up a file.  The name written on the lip:  KAY CONNELL.

             INT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

             Nyback leads Will and Hap down a hallway.  Crooked plaques
             and black-and-white pictures line the walls.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       Couldn't get a thing from the body.  Not
                       a trace.  Town's never dealt with
                       anything like this before.

             They turn a corner and stop at a door.  Will glances up:
             MOOSE ANTLERS hanging over it.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
                       I've briefed everybody about your coming.
                       They know to follow your lead.

             Nyback opens the door onto...

             INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - CONTINUOUS

             ...the bullpen of Nightmute PD.  Wooden desks, a couple
             computers, a jumbled corkboard, an impressive gun cabinet.  A
             RADIO's playing.

             Three MEN look over.  A young uniformed cop and two guys with
             heavy facial hair, Timberland boots, and flannel shirts.  One
             of them's part Inuit.  Ellie sits in the back.  Reaches over
             to turn off the radio.

             Will and Hap stand in the doorway.  Sticking out like sore
             thumbs in their suits.  Nyback jerks his thumb towards them.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       This is Detective Dormer and his partner
                       Detective Eckhart.  On loan from Buck
                       Lundgard, Seattle Robbery and Homicide
                       Special Branch.  They'll be helping with
                       the Connell case.

             The Inuit, FRED DUGGAR, snorts.  Takes his feet of the desk.

                                 FRED
                       Helping?  

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                           (ignoring him)
                       Anything they need to see, you show them;
                       anywhere they want to go, you take them.
                           (nods to Fred)
                       This is Detective Fred Duggar.  He's been
                       leading the investigation up to now.

             Will puts out his hand.

                                 WILL
                       Detective...

             Fred tugs at his dark handlebar moustache.  Stands.

                                 FRED
                       Suppose you want to see the body.

             EXT. NIGHTMUTE POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

             Fred steps out of the station, pulls on a baseball cap.

                                 FRED
                       We can walk from here.

             He heads off across the parking lot.  Will and Hap exchange a
             glance.

                                 WILL
                       Guess that's what they call Alaskan
                       hospitality.

                                 ELLIE (O.S.)
                       Don't worry about him...

             They turn.  Ellie's come up behind them.  Looks over at the
             hunched figure to Fred.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       He's just mad 'cause you're taking over.

             Fred stops up ahead.  Sees her.  Annoyed.

                                 FRED
                       Ellie!  Go type something!

             INT. NIGHTMUTE MORGUE - LATER

             CLOSE ON a faucet.  A bead of water, quivering at the mouth.
             Falls with a BLIP!

                                 CORONER (O.S.)
                       Did a fundascopic examination and found
                       papilledema and petechiae of the retina.

             PULL BACK to reveal Will, Hap, and the COUNTY CORONER
             standing by a stainless steel table.  The naked body of KAY
             CONNELL is laid out before them.  Fred hangs back.

             The coroner tugs at her surgical gloves.  She's in her late
             seventies.

                                 CORONER (cont'd)
                       Clear cause of death was herniation of
                       the brain stem due to intracerebral
                       hemorrhage.

                                 HAP
                       Beaten to death.

                                 CORONER
                       Beaten to death.

             Will points to the bruises on the body's shoulders and
             breasts.

                                 WILL
                       What about these contusions?

                                 CORONER
                       Superficial.

                                 WILL
                       Any signs of rape?

                                 CORONER
                       None.

             The coroner starts to cover the body with a sheet.

                                 CORONER (cont'd)
                       She was a nice girl.  Played flute with
                       my granddaughter.

             Will stays her hand.

                                 WILL
                       Wait.

             He pulls the sheet back down.  Studying the body of Kay
             Connell.  Starts walking slowly around the table.  In his
             element.  The faucet drips.  Drips.  Drips.

             He bends down to smell her hair.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       He washed her hair.

             Takes a handful and lets it fall from his fingers.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Combed it.

             Continues around the table.  Picks up one of her hands.
             Examines her fingers, her nails.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Cleaned under her fingernails.  Clipped
                       them.

             Continues down around her feet.  Checks between her first and
             second toes.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Toes, too.
                           (to Fred)
                       You found nothing on the body?

                                 FRED
                       No.
 
                                 WILL
                       No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...

                                 FRED
                       Like I said, no.  We know about those
                       things up here.

             Will stands there.  Looking down at the body.  Slim.  Young.
             Beautiful.  Skin like marble.

                                 WILL
                       He knew exactly what we'd be looking for.
                       Made sure to cover up all his tracks.

                                 HAP
                       Even the best make mistakes.

             Will looks up and locks eyes with his partner.

             INT. PIONEER LODGE - NIGHTMUTE - NIGHT

             Will and Hap enter the lobby of the Pioneer Lodge.  Big stone
             fireplace and heavy ceiling beams.  MOOSE ANTLERS mounted
             above reception.  They put their bags down by the desk.  Look
             around.

                                 RACHEL (O.S.)
                       Lower forty-eight.

             They turn.  RACHEL CLEMENT stands in a doorway behind the
             desk.  Dunking a teabag into a mug.  Long dark hair and
             intelligent eyes.

                                 HAP
                       Lower forty-eight?

                                 RACHEL
                       You're not from here.  I can tell by your
                       walk.

                                 HAP
                       Oh?  And how's that?

                                 RACHEL
                       Unsure.

             Hap smiles at her.  Will checks his watch.

                                 WILL
                       Detectives Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart.
                       There should be a reservation for us.

             Rachel looks at him.  Goes to a small file box on the desk.

                                 RACHEL
                           (to Hap)
                       Your friend's all business.

                                 WILL
                       I'm always all business.

             He glances out the window.  It's as bright as day.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Is it really 9:30?

                                 RACHEL
                           (nods)
                       Alaskan summers.  Hope you're an easy
                       sleeper.  It'll be like this all night.

             She hands them two cards.

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - NIGHT

             Will's taken off his jacket and is unpacking.  The room is
             sparse and creaky.  Bed dips in the middle.  He hangs a
             jacket in the armoire then returns to his suitcase.  Pulls
             out his SMITH AND WESSON 45.

             Lays it on the bedside table.  Takes out a shoulder holster.
             A back holster.  A handful of shells.  Lays them on the 
             table.  Then a small SMITH AND WESSON 39/13 9MM.  Checks the
             magazine.

             There's a KNOCK on the adjoining door.

                                 HAP (O.S.)
                       Me.

             Will SLAPS the magazine back.

                                 WILL
                       Come on in.

             Hap opens the door.  A glimpse into his room: family PICTURES
             on his bedside table - a WOMAN and three teenage GIRLS.

                                 HAP
                       See you have the same decor as my room.

             He walks over to the big window.  It overlooks the harbor.
             Big, snow-capped mountains in the distance.  One lone TUGBOAT
             in the harbor towing a freighter.

                                 HAP (cont'd)
                       Same view, too.
                           (looks out)
                       I've been watching that tugboat for the
                       last half hour.  So small, pulling all
                       that weight.
                           (beat)
                       We have to talk, Will.

             Will reaches into his suitcase.  Pulls out a shirt.

                                 WILL 
                       What do you want to talk about?

                                 HAP
                       You know what about.

             Will throws him a look.

                                 WILL
                       We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.

                                 HAP
                       When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...
                           (heads over to him)
                       We have to figure out a plan of action
                       now.

                                 WILL
                       You know my plan of action.

                                 HAP
                       To do nothing.

                                 WILL
                       That's right.

                                 HAP
                       Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up
                       in his office again for five hours
                       yesterday.  Five hours.  Asking all kinds
                       of questions...

                                 WILL
                       He's asking everybody questions.

                                 HAP
                       But he's zeroing in on me.  On us.
                       Everyone's talking about it.

                                 WILL
                       He's just rattling your cage.

                                 HAP
                       Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife,
                       three kids, and a pension plan in the
                       balance, it's rattling hard.

                                 WILL
                       We say nothing.  It goes away.  Simple as
                       that.

             Will goes back to his suitcase.  Hap follows.  A thin film of
             sweat on his upper lip.

                                 HAP
                           (lowers voice)
                       Look.  We've tampered with evidence.
                       We've pushed witnesses.  We've planted
                       shit.  And they're sniffing around like
                       dogs.  Especially on the Dobbs case...

             Will flares up.  Struck a nerve.  Turns to his partner.

                                 WILL
                       Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy
                       and left him hanging in the basement like
                       a piece of meat.  You remember that?

                                 HAP
                       You know I remember that.

                                 WILL
                       One word to I.A. and he walks.

                                 HAP
                       Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...

                                 WILL
                       No way.

                                 HAP
                       Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's 
                       what Flynn's doing...

                                 WILL
                       Mike Flynn's a dirty cop, Hap!  We are
                       nothing like Mike Flynn.  We did what we
                       needed to do to make sure that son-of-
                       bitch Dobbs paid for what he did.  And
                       every bastard like him.  We say one word
                       about it and every case we ever brought
                       in is going to blow wide open and they'll
                       all walk.  Every last one.  And I am not
                       going to let that happen.  No deals.  No
                       compromises.  No discussions.

             He grabs a hanger.

                                 HAP
                       Goddammit, Will.  You grab on to
                       something and you don't let it go.

             He takes out a handkerchief.  Wipes his brow.

                                 HAP
                       I don't know if it's because you think
                       it's the right thing to do or because
                       your pride won't let you do anything
                       else.  I can't tell any more.
                           (steps back)
                       But I can tell you one thing.  I'm
                       getting too old for this cowboy cop
                       stuff.  Breaking the rules.  Cleaning up
                       messes.  We're a dying breed, Will.
                       You're a dying breed.  I.A., the D.A.,
                       all those reporters - they don't care
                       what you did at Leland Street seven years
                       ago.  They don't care that you've made
                       this your life.  They don't care about
                       getting the bad guy...

             Will turns on his partner, eyes burning.

                                 WILL
                       I care.

             The partners, lock eyes.  Years of working together.  A
             thousand things unsaid.  Hap reaches for the door.

                                 HAP (cont'd)
                        They're watching us, Will.  Like it or
                        not.  They're watching us.

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - NIGHT

             Will's asleep.  Kay Connell's folder open on his chest.  It's
             dark in his room, quiet.  Suddenly the shade on his window
             quivers and SNAPS up, flooding the room with light.

             Will's eyes pop open.  He rolls over to look at the clock:
             3:15.  Squinting, he gets up and walks over to the window.
             We can see the rest of his scar.  Runs down deep across his
             sternum.

             He yanks the shade back down.  It bucks, then settles.
             Satisfied, Will returns to bed.  Plumps the pillow, pulls the
             blanket up around him.  Closes his eyes.

             The shade lurches halfway.  Then SNAPS back up.  Light pours
             in.  Will's eyes open.

                                 WILL
                       You got to be kidding me.

             EXT. STREET - NIGHTMUTE - DAY

             Will jogs along in a Sonics sweatshirt, a ring of sweat
             around his collar.  He looks out over the harbor.  Fishing
             boats coming in with their early morning haul.  More halibut.
             He checks his watch.  Slows to a walk.  Looks up and sees...

             Ellie Burr standing on the front steps of the Pioneer Lodge.
             Smiles.  Holds up some car keys.

                                 ELLIE
                       Fred wants us to meet him at the
                       Connell's.

             INT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - DAY

             Ellie driving.  A hula-girl, swinging from the rear-view
             mirror.  Will in the passenger seat.  Wearing a crisp suit.
             Ellie hands him a take-out bag.

                                 ELLIE
                       Brought you a bear claw.  Just in case
                       you were hungry.

             Will takes the bag.  Looks inside.  Yikes.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       Local delicacy.

                                 WILL
                       Think I'll pass.

             He puts the bag on the dash.  Looks out the window.
             Nightmute's main street.  A line of shops.  Undistinguished
             Town Hall.  Elementary school up on a hill.  Sign out front:
             Sign-ups for Midnight Little League!

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       What kind of calls you get around here?

                                 ELLIE
                       Oh.  You know.  Small-time stuff.
                       Nothing like what you must get.  Mostly
                       drinking-related problems.  Domestic
                       abuse.  Barroom fights.  Stuff like that.

             She shifts down.  Takes a steep turn.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       In the summer months it's pretty quiet.
                       That's when there's work out on the
                       boats.  The rest of the year, though...

             They pass a MAN walking along the road.  Gnarled walking
             stick.  Ellie calls out the window.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       Hey, there, Joe!

             JOE waves.  They pass.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       That's Joe Willy.  Took his family 
                       hostage in November.  That was the most
                       exciting thing that happened last year.
                       I wasn't there, though.
                           (grinds gear)
                       Chief barely lets me handle anything
                       above a misdemeanor.

             Will looks over at her.  Smiles.

                                 WILL
                       Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.

                                 ELLIE
                       But they're so boring.  All small stuff.

                                 WILL
                       It's all about the small stuff.  Small
                       lies.  Small mistakes.  Small oversights.
                       People give themselves away in a traffic
                       violation just as much as they do in a
                       murder case.  It's human nature.

             He looks over.  Ellie's listening intently.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Aren't you going to write that down?

             Ellie, searching her pockets for something to write with...

                                 ELLIE
                       Let me just...

             Stops.  Looks over.  Realises Will's teasing her.

             EXT. CONNELL HOUSE - DAY

             A small ranch house.  Aluminum siding.  FLOWERS piled up by
             the front door.  TEDDY BEARS.  RIBBONS.  Left by well-wishers.

                                 MRS. CONNELL (O.S.)
                       I haven't tidied up, since Fred told me
                       not to touch anything.

             INT. HALLWAY - CONNELL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

             MRS. CONNELL, a big woman with a thick grey braid down her
             back, opens the door to her daughter's room.  Looks at Will.

                                 MRS. CONNELL
                       I don't believe in keeping a child's room
                       like a shrine.

             Will heads into the room.  Hap follows.  A palpable
             uneasiness between them.  Fred and Ellie stand in the
             doorway.  Mrs. Connell turns to go.

             INT. KAY CONNELL'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

             A small bedroom.  Pink shag carpeting and clouds painted on
             the ceiling.  Pictures cut from magazines pasted on the
             walls.  A stack of tapes and a boom box in the corner.

             Will stands in the middle of the room.  Taking it in.

                                 WILL
                       Typical seventeen year-old.
                           (beat)
                       She went to a party Friday night?

                                 ELLIE
                       Down at a local dive the kids like to
                       hang out in.

             Fred throws Ellie a look.  "Kids?"  She's practically a kid
             herself.  Will opens the top drawer of the bureau.  Roots
             beneath the panties.

                                 WILL
                       No diary.

             On top of the bureau, a stack of photos.  A couple torn up.
             Kay Connell and a GIRL with white-blonde hair.  Laughing.

                                 FRED
                       She left the party early.  Friends said
                       she had a fight with her boyfriend and
                       stormed out.

                                 WILL
                       What time was that?

                                 FRED
                       Around twelve-thirty.

             Hap picks up a bear on Kay's bed.  A bell JINGLES when he
             shakes it.  Will crosses to a closet in the corner.

                                 WILL
                       Who was the last one to see her alive?

                                 FRED
                       Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've
                       questioned him, searched his place.
                       Didn't find anything.

             Will pulls a dress out of the closet.  Small, black, elegant.
             The tag's been cut out.  He pulls out another, then another.
             Feels the fabric.

                                 WILL
                       These are designer.  Expensive.
                           (looks up)
                       Could Randy Stetz afford these?

             Fred and Ellie exchange a look.

                                 ELLIE
                       He fixes boat engines.

             Will looks around.  Cheap wallpaper, torn window screens.

                                 WILL
                       Well her mother didn't buy them for her.

                                 HAP
                       What are we thinking?

             Will reaches over to a heart-shaped box on the bedside table.
             Pulls out a pretty gold necklace.  Holds it up.

                                 WILL
                       Kay Connell had an admirer.

             He hands the dresses to Ellie.  Heads out of the room.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       I want to talk to the boyfriend.

             INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

             CLOSE ON a hand squeezing a shoulder.  Hard.

                                 WILL
                       You don't seem all that sad.

             The shoulder jerks away.  PULL BACK to reveal RANDY STETZ
             sitting at a wooden table in an interrogation room.  Longish
             blond hair, wearing a Metallica t-shirt, trying like hell to
             grow a moustache.

                                 RANDY
                       I haven't had a chance!  You fuckers been
                       all over my back since Monday!

             He takes out a cigarette.  It's bent.  He lights it.  Hap
             sits opposite.

                                 HAP
                       You know smoking stunts your growth.

             Randy throws him a look.

                                 RANDY
                       Yeah, okay, fat-ass.

                                 HAP
                           (smiles at Will)
                       More Alaskan hospitality.

             Will goes over to a coffee machine.  Pours a cup.

                                 WILL
                       Did you love her?

                                 RANDY
                       Huh?

                                 WILL
                       Kay Connell.  Did you love her?

             Randy flicks his ash.  Shrugs.

                                 RANDY
                       Sure.  She was nice.

             Will turns with his coffee.

                                 WILL
                       "She was nice."  Wow.  That makes me all
                       soft inside.  Ever occur to you she
                       didn't love you back?

                                 RANDY
                       Huh?

                                 WILL
                       You heard me that time.

                                 RANDY
                       She loved me.  She wanted to see me every
                       night.

                                 WILL
                       But she was seeing someone else on the
                       side.

             Randy glares.

                                 RANDY
                       I don't know what you're fucking talking
                       about.

                                 WILL
                       Friday night, at the party - what'd you
                       fight about?

                                 RANDY
                       Stuff.

                                 WILL
                       What kind of stuff?

                                 RANDY
                       Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.

                                 WILL
                       The other guy?

                                 RANDY
                       I told you I don't remember.

                                 WILL
                       After that she left the party to go to
                       him.

                                 RANDY
                       How should I know?...

                                 WILL
                       Ran like hell to go to him...

                                 RANDY
                       Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your
                       fucking cop questions...

             Will suddenly hurls his coffee cup and grabs Randy up by the
             collar.  Nose to nose.

                                 WILL
                       Now you listen to me, you little shit.
                       This fuck-the-world-Metallica-t-shirt 
                       crap may work with your mamma, but it
                       doesn't work with me.  You got mad at
                       your girlfriend because she was seeing
                       someone else.  You want to be the last
                       person who saw her alive or are you going
                       to tell me who that is?

             Randy's lip curls.  Red-faced.

                                 RANDY
                       I don't know.

                                 WILL
                       You don't know.

                                 RANDY
                       She didn't tell me.

             Disgusted, Will shoves Randy back into his seat.

             INT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

             Will walking out of the interrogation room.  Ellie joins him.

                                 ELLIE
                       He's a little surly, isn't he?

             Will smooths back his hair.  Checks his tie.

                                 WILL
                       Just a little.

             He reaches into his pocket and pulls out the gold necklace
             from Kay's room.  Hands it to her.

                                 WILL
                       I want you to check this out, Ellie.

                                 ELLIE
                       We already did.

                                 WILL
                       Do it again.

                                 ELLIE
                       But there wasn't any...

             Will stops.  Ellie stops.  Will puts a hand on her shoulder.

                                 WILL
                       The small things - remember?  The second
                       you're about to dismiss something - look
                       at it again.

             Ellie smiles, teasing.

                                 ELLIE
                       You want me to write that down?

             Will, has to smile.  She's quick.  Looks down the hall.  A
             bearded GUY on crutches.  Ellie follows his gaze.

                                 WILL
                       Who's that?

                                 ELLIE
                       The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there
                       Friday night.

                                 WILL
                       Good.  He's up next.

             Will heads over to him.  Ellie watches his neck.  Her hand
             closing over the necklace.

             INT. RESTAURANT - PIONEER LODGE - NIGHT

             The Pioneer Lodge restaurant.  Small, dark wood, a RADIO
             playing something between Bluegrass and Folk.  Some rough-
             looking GUYS at the bar.  Throwing looks over at...

             Will and Hap, sitting at a table.  Studying faded menus.

                                 WILL
                           (reading)
                       Halibut Calabrese.  Halibut Olympia.
                       Halibut Cajun Style.  Halibut fish and
                       chips...

             He puts down his menu.  Reaches for his drink.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Can't wait to see what's for dessert.

                                 HAP
                       At least there's variety.

             Will drains his drink.  Locks eyes with a big GUY over at the
             bar.  Beer froth on his moustache.

                                 WILL
                       Looks like the natives are restless.

                                 HAP
                       Will?

             Will looks back at his partner.  Hap's fidgeting with the end
             of his tie.

                                 HAP (cont'd)
                       I think, I think I'm gonna talk to Buck
                       when we get back to Seattle.

             A cold flash down Will's spine.

                                 HAP
                       I wish I could stick it out like you.  I
                       just, with Trish and the kids...

                                 WILL
                       Don't do this, Hap...

             Hap avoids his eyes.

                                 HAP
                       I'm thinking I could get off with
                       probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's
                       all I want.

                                 WILL
                           (hisses)
                       Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're
                       doing...

                                 HAP
                       You don't have to be involved, Will.

                                 WILL
                       You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I
                       like it or not...

                                 RACHEL (O.S.)
                       Ready to order?

             The men look up, interrupted.  Rachel is standing by the
             table with a pad.  Hap tries to recover with a big smile.

                                 HAP
                       Hey - you do everything around here?

                                 RACHEL
                       Just about.

             Will stands abruptly.  Eyes on Hap.  Trying not to explode.

                                 WILL
                       I'll just have another Scotch in my room.
                           (turns to Rachel)
                       If you don't mind.

             Just then, his cell phone RINGS.

             INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - NIGHT

             Will bursts into the bullpen.  Hap behind.

                                 WILL
                       Where is it?

             Ellie, Fred, and a couple other GUYS huddled around a desk.

                                 ELLIE
                       Over here.

             Will and Hap head over to them.  One of the younger guys,
             FARRELL, intimidated by Will's presence.  Tucks his shirt
             into his dirty jeans.

             They part to reveal a BLUE KNAPSACK laying on the desk.  Mud
             spots all over it.  An embroidered daisy.  Will examines it.

                                 WILL
                       We're sure it's hers?

                                 FRED
                       Has her books in it.

                                 HAP
                       What about prints?

             Ellie shakes her head, unfortunately not.  Will reaches into
             the bag.  Pulls out two text books.

                                 WILL
                       Biology and Algebra.

             He shoves the books towards one of the guys.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Find out who she studied with.

             He continues through the bag.  Pulls out a little plastic bag
             with "Hello Kittys" all over it.  Dumps out the contents.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Make-up.

             Looks up at Fred.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Find out where she bought it.

             Fred looks at him.  Not happy with make-up duty.  Will pulls
             out a hair brush.  Hands it to Ellie.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Lab.

             Next, a couple worn paperbacks.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                           (reading titles)
                       Otherwise Engaged, Murder at Sunset.

             He looks up at the group.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Who here reads this kind of crap?

             Farrell straightens.

                                 FARRELL
                       I read that kind of crap.

             Will tosses them to him.

                                 WILL
                       Read them.  Tell me anything that strikes
                       you.

             Down to the bottom of the bag.  A Ziploc with a half-eaten
             sandwich and an apple core.  Will hands them to Ellie.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Lab.

             Upends the knapsack.  Scraps, paper clips, gum wrappers.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       That's it.

             Fred reaches for the knapsack.

                                 FRED
                       I'll stick it in the evidence locker...

                                 WILL
                       No.

             Will takes it, walks slowly over to the window.  Thinking.
             Twists the knapsack in his hands and looks out at the
     
             TOTEM POLE standing tall outside.  A black RAVEN alights on
             top of it.  Pecks at the air.  Turns.  Seems to look right at 
             Will.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       We put it back where we found it.

             Will turns to them.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       You said it was a fishing cabin.

                                 FARRELL
                       Uh, right.  About two miles outside of
                       town.

                                 ELLIE
                       On the beach.

             Fred tightens his jaw.

                                 FRED
                       Why are we taking it back?

             Will ignores the question.  Walks back towards them.

                                 WILL
                       This murder was in the papers, right?

                                 ELLIE
                       Yeah.  All over.

                                 WILL
                       Call all of them from here to Anchorage.
                       Tell them we now know that Kay Connell
                       left the party with a dark blue knapsack,
                       but we haven't recovered it yet.
                           (checks watch)
                       We can get it in by the morning editions.

             He hands the bag to Farrell.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Fill this with random books.  Make it
                       look heavy.

             Will pulls out a handkerchief.  Wipes the mud off his hands.
             Taking his time.  Finally turns to Fred.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       It'll eat this guy alive if he thinks he
                       overlooked a detail.

             EXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - MORNING

             POV through BINOCULARS

             A WOODEN CABIN comes into focus.  Right by the water.  Hasn't
             been used in years.  Weathered, slate roof.  Algae growing up
             the sides.

                                 HAP (O.S.)
                       Nice.  Lighter than I remembered.

             WILL lowers his binoculars.  He's standing on the black rocky
             beach.  It's damp, slick, and cold.  A fog's rolling in.

             Hap and Farrell are sitting behind a cluster of rocks.  A
             couple paper bags and a megaphone.  They're comparing guns.

                                 FARRELL
                       Glock 40.  All plastic save the barrel
                       and firing pin.  Never rusts.  What do
                       you carry down in Seattle?

             Hap reaches into his holster.  Pulls out a...

                                 HAP
                       Smith and Wesson 45.

                                 FARRELL
                       Excellent!

             Fred Duggar's standing on the other side of them.  He's got a
             pair of binoculars, too.  They're staking out the cabin.
             Been there a while.

                                 ELLIE (O.S.)
                       Brought some coffee...

             Ellie appears with a thermos.  Crouching down.  Fred turns,
             annoyed.

                                 FRED
                       What are you doing here?

                                 WILL
                           (answering for her)
                       I told her to come.

             Fred shoots Will a look.  Down at his cowboy boots.  Will
             gives him a smile.

                                 ELLIE
                       Anything yet?

                                 WILL                    FRED
                       Nothing.                Nothing.

             Fred goes back to scanning, pissed.

                                 FARRELL
                       Maybe this guy doesn't read the papers.

                                 HAP
                       Or goes straight to the Sports Section.

             Hap and Farrell chuckle.  Hap unscrews the thermos.  A cloud
             of steam.

                                 HAP (cont'd)
                       Who gets first dibs?
                           (looks up at Will)
                       Will?

             Will looks down at his partner.  Holding out the thermos like
             a weird kind of truce.  Will turns away, rejecting it.  A
             swath of thick fog unfolds over the black rocks as...

             Fred tenses.

                                 FRED
                           (looking through binoculars)
                       I see someone!

             Hap and Farrell scramble to their feet.  Will whips up his
             binoculars.

             POV THROUGH WILL'S BINOCULARS - a FIGURE making its way to 
             the cabin.  Furtive.

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                       That's him.

             Will lowers the binoculars.  Snaps his fingers at the men.
 
                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Fan out.

             Fred, Farrell and Hap.  Start spreading out.  Ellie steps
             up.  Will looks back at her.  Too dangerous.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Stay here, Ellie.

                                 ELLIE
                       But...

             Will puts up his hand.  She stops short.  He plunges ahead.

             Hap.  Will.  Farrell.  Fred.  Fanning out.  Silent.  Keeping
             eye-contact.  Will points to Farrell.  Wants the megaphone.
             Farrell, balancing on a rock, holds it out.  Accidentally
             keys it.  The feedback SQUAWKS.  Fuck.

                                 FRED
                       He's bolting!

             POV THROUGH WILL'S BINOCULARS - the FIGURE, looking around,
             running towards the cabin.  Leaping from rock to rock.

             WILL reaches for his Smith and Wesson.

                                 WILL
                       Go!  Go!  Go!

             The men jump into action.  Race down towards the cabin.

             Fred and Farrell, nimble over the wet rocks.  Will and Hap,
             harder going.  Grab onto jagged edges, slip down small
             crevices.  Rocks sticking out every which way.  The fog,
             thick and white...

             THE FIGURE disappears into the cabin.

             FRED AND FARRELL leap up onto a tall boulder and jump down.
             Run over to the door of the cabin, guns at the ready...

             WILL rounds the boulder, Hap panting behind him.  Joins Fred
             and Farrell at the door.

             Will levels his Smith and Wesson at the door, and with a nod
             to Fred as he KICKS it in...

             INT. FISHING CABIN - CONTINUOUS

             ...the door CRACKS and swings in.  The men rush inside.

                                WILL
                       Police!

             They look around:  Nothing.  A few old nets, a wooden table
             rotted through.  No knapsack.

             In the corner, a TRAP DOOR, left open.  Will races over.
             Looks down into the darkness.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Goddammit!

             Turns and points to Farrell.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       You!  Head back up to base...
                           (to Fred)
                       You!  Go right and follow along the
                       water...
                           (to Hap)
                       Hap!  You go left...

             The men nod.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Go!

             They rush out the door and split directions.  Will crouches
             down by the trap door and...

             INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

             ...drops down into a dark, dank TUNNEL.  Water dripping.
             FOOTFALLS echoing.  Will cocks his head.  Left or right?
             Starts sprinting down towards the lighter end of the tunnel,
             his own footsteps bouncing against the tunnel walls.  He
             rounds a curve.  Sound recedes...

             EXT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

             ...He exits the tunnel onto the rocky beach.  Stops short.

             FOG

             has enveloped everything - obscuring all vision, dulling all
             sound.  Like a strange dream.  Eerie.

             Will blinks against the thick whiteness.  Strains to hear any
             sound, anything.  There's only the distant LAPPING of the
             water.

             He tightens his grip on his gun and plunges into the fog.
             Quick, careful steps.  Stumbles over a rock.  Waves his gun
             in defense.  Eyes wide open like a blind man...

             SUDDENLY

             a GUNSHOT.  Off to the right.  Will whips his head around.

             EXT. UP ON THE BEACH - CONTINUOUS
 
             Ellie, alone, jumps at the sound.  Reaches for her weapon...

             EXT. DOWN THE BEACH - CONTINUOUS

             Will heads towards the sound.  Reaching out for approaching
             rocks.  Scrambles over a small bank and finds...

             FARRELL rolled up into a fetal position on the ground. 
             Clutching his thigh.  Blood seeping through his fingers.  He
             looks up.

                                 FARRELL
                       Sorry about...

                                 WILL
                       Where is he?

             Farrell can't answer that.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                           (impatient)
                       Where'd the shot come from?

             Farrell lifts his bloody hand.  Points off towards the water.

                                 FARRELL
                       Over there.

             Will disappears back into the fog, leaving Farrell behind.

             Clambers back down towards the water, pausing every few 
             seconds to listen, to adjust.  Heart POUNDING.  Blood 
             pumping.  Like an animal tracking its prey.  Leaps up onto a
             plateau of rocks when...

             SUDDENLY

             a DARK FIGURE

             flashes past him.  The killer!  Inches away.  Will wheels
             around...

                                 WILL
                       Freeze!

             CRACK!  Squeezes off a shot.  Misses!  Can't believe it.
             Goes for another... Nothing!  Jammed!  The figure,
             disappearing.  Will tosses his Smith and Wesson, reaches
             behind his back and whips out his SMITH 39/13...

             EXT. UP ON THE BEACH - CONTINUOUS
 
             Ellie, weapon drawn, making her way down the rocks.  A HAND
             suddenly grabs her arm.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                       Dammit, Ellie!...

             Fred emerges from the fog.

                                 FRED (cont'd)
                       Put that thing away!  Farrell's down!...

             CRACK! as another shot rips through the air.  Fred and Ellie
             freeze.

             EXT. DOWN BY THE WATER - MINUTES LATER

             Fred and Ellie, skittering down the rocks.  Getting closer to
             the water.  Hear a voice ring out...

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                       Hap!

             The fog starts to dissipate.  They reach the water to see...

             WILL DORMER

             kneeling beside the body of his partner.  Lying in the water.
             Shot in the stomach.  Blood dribbling from his mouth.  Will
             grabs him up by the collar.

                                 WILL
                       Hap!

             Starts shaking the limp body.  Teeth clenched.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Hap!

             Hap's head, rolls back.  Mouth agape.  Face white...

             Will, rips off his tie.  Presses it to the gaping wound...
             trying to stop the bleeding...warm blood, pumping into the
             water...

             Ellie watches.  Horrified.  Fred races over to the body.
             Feels for Hap's pulse.

                                 FRED
                       Dormer...

             Will, shaking Hap again.  Jaw set.  Eyes intense.  Veins
             popping up along his temples.  Fred catches his shoulder.

                                 FRED (cont'd)
                       Dormer!  He's gone.

             Will looks up at Fred.  His face contorts.

             Suddenly leaps to his feet.  Grabs a rock and hurls it
             savagely into the thick fog.

             INT. CHIEF CHARLES NYBACK'S OFFICE - NIGHT

             Chief Nyback sits in his chair.  Fingers interlaced.  A 
             somber expression on his face.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       And then you lost him.

             Will sits opposite him.  Wet, dishevelled, dirty.  Hap's
             blood smeared all over his shirt.  Staring off into space.

                                 WILL
                       And then I lost him.  In the fog.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       About how long 'til you heard the
                       suspect's second shot?

             Will, hesitates.

                                 WILL
                       Twenty, thirty seconds.  I followed the
                       sound down to the water.  That's where...

             He blinks.  Looks down.  Swallows.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       That's where I found Hap.

             Nyback sighs, shakes his head.  Reaches down to his bottom
             drawer and pulls out a bottle of bourbon and a glass.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       I think you need a glass of this.

             He goes to unscrew the bottle, but Will shakes his head.
             Stands.  Paces.  Rakes his hand through his hair.

             Turns suddenly and swipes his arm across Nyback's desk.
             Everything CRASHES to the floor.

                                 WILL
                           (yells)
                       Why didn't I know about that goddamn
                       tunnel, Charlie?

             Nyback looks up at him.  Calm.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       There's a bunch of those tunnels out
                       there, Will.  From bunkers over sixty
                       years old.  I don't even know half of
                       them myself, and I grew up here.

             Will clenches his fists.

                                 WILL
                       I had him, Charlie.  Right in front of
                       me.  Not two feet.  I could smell the son-
                       of-a-bitch.  Playing with me.  And I
                       missed the shot.  He was right there and
                       I missed the shot!  Then my goddamned gun
                       jammed...

             Nyback gets up.  Limps over to his old friend.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       Will, you can't blame yourself.

                                 WILL
                       I had him!

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       It's only gonna make you crazy.

             Just then there's a soft KNOCK on the door.  The men look
             over.  Ellie sticks her head in.  Speaks in a tone that
             belies that a man has recently died.

                                 ELLIE
                       You wanted to see me?

             Will turns his back to her.  Nyback heads over.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       Right, Ellie.

             Ellie flicks a look at the pile on the floor.  At Will's
             back.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
                       I want you to take care of the
                       investigation into Detective Eckhart's
                       shooting.

             Ellie looks at him.  Confused.  Lowers her voice.

                                 ELLIE
                       But what about the Connell case?  I'm on
                       the Connell case.

             Nyback puts a hand on her shoulder.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       We need paperwork, Ellie.  You know that.
                       Just write up a quick report.

             Ellie's shoulders droop.  Thought she was playing with the
             big boys.  Just then Will turns abruptly and grabs his coat.

                                 WILL
                       I'm going to check on the roadblocks...

             Nyback catches his arm.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       You're no good right now, Will.  Go back
                       to the Lodge.  Try to get some rest.

             Will looks at him.  Know's he's right.

             EXT. ROAD - NIGHTMUTE - DAY

             CLOSE ON a SQUEALING tire, ripping around a curve...

             INT./EXT. SILVER JEEP CHEROKEE - CONTINUOUS

             Will driving.  Speeding.  Scenery whipping past the window.
             His hands, tight around the steering wheel.  The hula-girl,
             dancing beneath the rear view mirror, a smile plastered to
             her face.

             He grows suddenly pale.  Pulls the Cherokee off to the side.

             EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

             Will jumps out of the Cherokee, leaving the door open.  Runs
             down an ALLEY behind a row of shops.

             INT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

             A couple industrial trash bins.  Will leans his hand against
             the wall and vomits.  Hovers for a moment, saliva dripping
             from his mouth.  Braces himself.  Heaves again.  Hears a 
             BUZZING behind him.  Turns.

             A DEAD DOG lying next to a dumpster.  FLIES buzzing around
             its head.  Teeth bared.  Eyes wide open.

             Like it's watching him.

             INT. PIONEER LODGE - LATER

             Will walks up to reception.  No one there.  Just wants his
             key.  Rings the bell.  In the back room, he hears a RADIO.

                                 RADIO
                       ...earlier this evening after an aborted
                       attempt to apprehend a suspect.  He was
                       forty-five...

             It clicks off abruptly.  Rachel appears in the doorway.
             Takes in the blood on Will's shirt.

                                 RACHEL
                       I'm sorry about your partner.

             Will looks at her.  She walks over to the desk.

                                 RACHEL (cont'd)
                       It's been on the radio for the last two
                       hours.  Nothing but that.  Like when they
                       found Kay Connell's body.
                           (sympathetic smile)
                       We're not used to this sort of thing up
                       here.

             She reaches for his key.

                                 RACHEL (cont'd)
                       He was standing right there just a couple
                       of days ago.  Your partner.  Exactly
                       where you are now.
                           (beat)
                       I hope I was nice to him.

             Will takes his key.

                                 WILL
                       You were nice to him.  He liked you.

             He smiles faintly, turns to go.  Just then the phone RINGS.

                                 RACHEL
                           (answering)
                       Pioneer Lodge?...
                           (listens)
                       Hold on a second.  He's right here.

             Will stops.  Turns.  Rachel holds up the phone.  Covering the
             mouthpiece.

                                 RACHEL (cont'd)
                       John Warfield.  He's called a couple of
                       times.

             Will's stomach drops.  That's the last phone call in the 
             world he wants to take.  Rachel reads his face.

                                 RACHEL (cont'd)
                       Want me to lie?

             Will shakes his head.  Steps back and takes the phone.
             Clears his throat.

                                 WILL
                           (into phone)
                       Dormer.

             PAUSE.  A bemused VOICE on the other end.

                                 WARFIELD'S VOICE
                       Detective Dormer.  I've been trying to
                       reach you.  I was very sorry to hear
                       about your partner, Detective Eckhart.
                       It must have been a terrible shock, what
                       happened this morning.

             Will.  Not giving this asshole an inch.  Rachel, trying not
             to listen.

                                 WILL
                           (into phone)
                       That's not exactly how I'd put it.

                                 WARFIELD'S VOICE (cont'd)
                       No, no.  I suppose not.  But I look
                       forward to reading the report.  Very
                       sad.  Very sad.  Funny...

                                 WILL
                           (into phone)
                       What do you mean, "Funny?"

                                 WARFIELD'S VOICE
                       Oh, nothing.  Just that I felt Detective
                       Eckhart and I, Hap and I, were starting
                       to make a real connection before you
                       left.  I sensed that he was ready to get
                       some things off his chest.  Did you
                       sense anything like that, Detective?  I
                       mean, as his partner?...

             Will, squeezing the phone cord with his bloody fist.

                                 WARFIELD'S VOICE (cont'd)
                       ...You were his partner for, what, about
                       ten years?...

             Will turns from Rachel.  Eyes burning.  Voice steady.

                                 WILL
                           (into phone)
                       You know why everyone hates you,
                       Warfield?  It's not your questions, it's
                       not your press conferences, it's not even
                       your cheap suits; everyone hates you
                       'cause day after day you suck the marrow
                       out of real cops when you never had the
                       balls to become one yourself.  Well I got
                       to tell you, it's a shame you're not up
                       here with me because I'd love to show you
                       right now just what a real cop is capable
                       of.  You just remember that when you're
                       sitting at your bullshit desk reading
                       your bullshit report on my dead partner!

             SLAM!  He hangs up the phone.  Runs his hand through his
             hair.  Turns back to Rachel.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Next time.  Go ahead and lie.

             EXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - MORNING

             Fog everywhere.  Dense.  White.  Suffocating.

             We're running through it.  Clambering over rocks.  Hearing
             the sound of our own BREATHING.  Our own HEARTBEAT.
             Adrenaline pumping.  An animal tracking its prey...

             SUDDENLY a DARK FIGURE

             flashes past.  Just inches away.  Playing with us.  Taunting
             us.  We whip round with our weapon and...

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT

             BANG!  Will bolts upright in bed.  A film of sweat over his
             body.  Breathing hard.  The sound that woke him: the window
             shade FLAPPING open.  LIGHT floods the room.

             Will gets up.  Goes over to the shade and pulls it down.  It
             lurches up halfway.  He tugs it down again.  It slaps all the
             way open.  Will yanks it down so hard it rips off the window.

                                 WILL
                       Goddammit!

             He gets tangled in it.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Goddamned...thing!

             Pulls it off and flings it in the corner.

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:22 A.M.

             The digital clock flips to a new minute:  4:23.  Will,
             pacing.  Scratching at his stubble.  Unable to sleep.  Keeps
             stepping on a SQUEAKY floorboard.

             Slows near the ADJOINING DOOR that leads into Hap's room.
             Hovers.  Lightly pushes the door open.  Sees...

             THE PICTURES on the bedside table.  A WOMAN and three teenage
             GIRLS.  Hap's family.

             INT. BATHROOM - 5:18 A.M.

             Water gushing out of the faucet.  Will's WATCH sitting on the
             sink's edge.  5:18.

             Will reaches up into the open medicine cabinet for a bottle
             of aspirin.  Shakes out a couple.  Cups his hand under the
             water and knocks the pills back.

             Closes the medicine cabinet and CRIES out...

             HAP'S REFLECTION

             looming behind him.

                                 HAP
                       They're watching us, Will...

             Will whirls around...

                                 WILL
                       Hap!

             ...nothing.  No one's there.

             EXT. MAINSTREET - NIGHTMUTE - MORNING

             CLOSE ON running shoes, POUNDING the tarmac.  PULL BACK to
             reveal Will running down Nightmute's main street.  Eyes
             bloodshot.

             A COUPLE NATIVE ALASKANS walking into a hardware store.  Stop
             talking and glance over at him.

             A YOUNG MOTHER in her husband's work shirt.  Lifts her small
             KIDS into the cab of a 4x4.  Watches him pass.

             AN OLDER MAN fixing the broken "E" on his store front.  Turns
             at the sound of Will's footfall.

             Everyone edgy.  Cautious.  A murderer amongst them.

             Will continues on.  Looking straight ahead.  Wipes the sweat
             from his neck.  Slows to a stop just outside the...

             LOCAL CONVENIENCE STORE

             A blown-up picture of KAY CONNELL in the window.  Below, a
             painted sign:  We miss you, Kay.

             A stack of newspapers by the front door.  The "Nightmute
             Ledger."  The headline:  Seattle Cop Killed by Suspect.

             Will picks one up.  Stares down at it.  Rain starts to dot
             the paper.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (O.S.)
                       ...We're going to bring down a couple of
                       guys from Ridgemount, but I want us to
                       step up the investigation here...

             INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - CONTINUOUS

             Rain hammering against the windows.  Chief Nyback addresses
             the bullpen.  Everyone's there except Farrell.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       ...Nightmute hasn't lost an officer in
                       thirty-seven years, and even though
                       Detective Eckhart wasn't from here, he
                       was as good as one of us on this case.  I
                       had the honor of working with him down in
                       Seattle for a number of years.  He was a
                       fine detective and an even better man.

             Will stands nearby, watching the rain hit the windows.  His
             suit pants are slightly wrinkled.  Nyback nods towards Fred.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
                       Fred, you'll be working with Detective
                       Dormer directly from now on.

             Fred, stroking his moustache, nods.  Nyback turns to Will.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
                       Will?  Anything you'd like to add?

             Will looks up.  Everyone's eyes turn to him.  He shakes his
             head.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       Okay.  Then let's get to it.

             Feet shuffling.  Chairs scraping the floor as people get up.
             A sense of determination in the air.  Will grabs his coat.

                                 ELLIE (O.S.)
                       Detective Dormer?

             He turns.  Ellie is beside him, holding a map.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       I'm sorry to bother you, but I was asked
                       to write the report on...
                           (lowers eyes)
                       ...you know what I was asked to write the
                       report on...
                           (looks back up)
                       ...Could you, just to be accurate, for
                       the report, could you just point out
                       where you were when you saw Detective
                       Eckhart yesterday?

             She holds out the map.  It's of the small stretch of
             coastline.  Red circles marking various points.

             Will looks down at her.  Takes the map.  Turns it around.

                                 WILL
                       It's good to be accurate, Ellie.  You're
                       doing your job.

             He looks down at the map.  Ellie watching his face.

                                 ELLIE
                       I'm so sorry about what happened.  I know
                       you did everything you could...

             Will points to a spot.  Cutting her off.

                                 WILL
                       I was here.

             Hands her back the map.  Smiles.  Just then Fred walks up.

                                 FRED
                       Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that
                       went through Farrell.

                                 WILL
                       I'm going to the hospital to talk to him
                       now.
                           (looks at his watch)
                       You get the search party together.  No
                       fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you
                       in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't
                       waste any time.

             He pulls on his coat and heads for the door.  Fred watches
             him leave.  Sticks a toothpick in his mouth.

                                 FRED
                       Partner or no partner.  That guy's a
                       prick.

                                 ELLIE
                       He has to be a prick, Fred.  He's a great
                       detective.

             INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - ST. FRANCIS HOSPITAL - DAY

             CLOSE ON the cover of one of the paperbacks, Otherwise
             Engaged by Walter Byrd.

             PULL BACK to reveal Farrell lying in a hospital bed in
             striped pajamas, reading it.  A tear runs down his cheek as
             he turns the page.

             A SNICKERS BAR is tossed onto his lap.  He looks up.  Face
             brightens.

                                 FARRELL
                       Detective Dormer!

            Will stands by his bed.  Farrell puts down the book.  Picks
            up the Snickers.

                                 FARRELL (cont'd)
                       You don't seem like the bring-an-
                       underling-who's-in-the-hospital-a-
                       Snickers-bar kind of guy.

                                 WILL
                       I'm not.

             He pulls up a chair.  Nods to the paperback.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       How's the book?

             Farrell bites into the candy bar.

                                 FARRELL
                       Oh, a real tear-jerker.  Brody, the good
                       guy, just got shot.

             He stops chewing.  Realises the association.  Swallows
             uncomfortably.

                                 FARRELL (cont'd)
                       Oh.  I'm sorry.  About Hap.  Detective
                       Eckhart.

                                 WILL
                       Thanks.

                                 FARRELL
                       I wish I'd had the chance to get to know
                       him better.  Take him fishing or
                       something.

                                 WILL
                       He would have liked that.

                                 FARRELL
                       We just gotta catch the bastard, right?

                                 WILL
                       That's why I'm here.  I need to know
                       exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.

                                 FARRELL
                       What I saw?

                                 WILL
                       Anything.  It's important.

             Farrell takes another bite of the Snickers.  Like a little
             boy.  Furrows his brow, trying to remember.

                                 FARRELL
                       Pretty much nothing.  That fog was so
                       thick.  The bullet seemed to come out of
                       nowhere.  I don't even remember seeing 
                       any shapes.  Then I saw you.  But only
                       when you came up close.  Then you
                       disappeared again.
                           (shrugs)
                       I guess I heard more than I saw.

             Will sighs, rubs his eyes.

                                 FARRELL (cont'd)
                       Sorry.

                                 WILL
                       No.  No.  Don't be sorry.  It's not your
                       fault.

             Just then a NURSE comes in with a Dixie cup.  Pretty,
             freckled face.  Not much older than Kay Connell.

                                 NURSE
                       Time for your meds.

             Farrell smiles at her, winks at Will.

                                 FARRELL
                       Lonnie and I went to high school
                       together.

             Lonnie gives him the cup.

                                 LONNIE
                       Just take the pills, Farrell.

                                 WILL
                       How's the leg?

                                 FARRELL
                       Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much.
                       Bullet went right through.

                                 WILL
                       Right.  Got lost in the rocks.

                                 FARRELL
                       We'll get the other one, though.

             Will looks up.  Farrell pops the rest of the Snickers in his
             mouth.

                                 FARRELL (cont'd)
                       After the autopsy.

             INT. HALLWAY - HOSPITAL - LATER

             Will walks down the hallway.  Light pouring in from a set of
             high windows.  He looks tired.  Set-upon.

             POV of SOMEONE

             WATCHING HIM.  From a doorway.  Not close, not far.  A HAND
             comes into view.  Small.  Bruised knuckles.  Holds on to the
             door jamb.  Watches as...

             Will suddenly stops.  Skin prickling at the back of his neck.
             Turns and looks around.

             A MAN in a wheelchair.
 
             A LITTLE GIRL tugging at her hospital gown.

             A couple of NURSES laughing at check-in.

             An empty doorway.

             Nothing.

             EXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - MORNING

             Back at the beach.  We see nothing but fog.  A VOICE comes
             through.

                                 ELLIE (O.S.)
                       ...and it was at this point that Detective
                       Dormer headed towards the noise...

             Ellie emerges from the fog.  Carrying the map and talking
             into a small tape recorder.  She's climbing over the rocks,
             wearing a windbreaker a couple sizes too big.

             A UNIFORMED OFFICER follows, carrying a camera.  She turns to
             him.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       Remember, Kepp, shoot everything...
                           (back to the tape recorder)
                       ...wherein he discovered the wounded
                       Detective Farrell Brooks, having been
                      shot in the vastus externus of the upper
                      left thigh...

             She climbs over the same bank Will Dormer climbed two
             evenings before.  Finds...

             ANOTHER UNIFORMED OFFICER, hanging out and smoking.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       Francis!

             He looks up.  Pimples on his chin.

                                 FRANCIS
                       What?

                                 ELLIE
                       You're supposed to be Farrell.  Shot in
                       the thigh and writhing in pain.

                                 FRANCIS
                       C'mon, Ellie.  What's it matter?

                                 ELLIE
                       Accuracy.  That's what.
                           (points to the ground)
                       Now get down.

             Francis looks up at her.  Flicks his cigarette away and gets
             down amongst the rocks.  Holds his thigh like he was shot.

                                 FRANCIS
                       Ow.

             CLICK!  Kepp takes the picture.

             EXT. DOWN BY THE WATER - MINUTES LATER

             Ellie sloshes through the water.  Ankles getting cold.
             Cheeks pink.  But it doesn't matter.  She's investigating.

                                 ELLIE
                           (into tape recorder)
                       ...shortly after hearing the second shot,
                       Detective Dormer continued through the
                       water until he spotted the body, lying
                       approximately fifteen feet away.

             She stops.  Looks at the map.  At the spot Will pointed out.
     	     Looks back up.  Fog.  Clicks off the recorder.  Calls out.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       You there, Rich?

             A VOICE calls back.  Someone pretending to be Hap.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                       Yeah.  And I'm freezing my nads off!

             Ellie furrows her brow.  Just then...

             FRANCIS appears.  Slips on a rock but catches his fall.

                                 FRANCIS
                       Ellie!  Think I found something!

             EXT. ROAD NEAR BEACH - DAY

             CLOSE ON a row of FEET.  Mostly boots.  Some more beat-up
             than others.  Inching forward along a road.

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                       ...Anything catches your eye, you put it
                       in a bag.  Anything looks strange, you
                       put it in a bag...

             PULL BACK to reveal a long line of PEOPLE stretched out
             across the road about a mile up the beach.  Some old, some
             young.  Linking arms and moving forward.  Looking down.  The
             SEARCH PARTY.

             Will, walking up and down behind the line.  Talking through a
             megaphone.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       ...Anything he may have dropped, moved,
                       kicked, or stepped on, you put in a bag.
                       Cigarette butts, gum wrappers, paper
                       clips, coins, buttons - nine times out of
                       ten a suspect leaves something behind...

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                       Detective?

             Will turns.  A couple burly GUYS with some BLOODHOUNDS.

                                 BURLY GUY #1
                       Where do you want us?

             Will points over to the woods on the other side of the road.

                                 WILL
                       The woods.  One group heading south, the
                       other heading north.

             Nods to Fred who's standing nearby.  He hands the guys two
             radios.
 
                                 FRED
                       Make sure they're set to channel 6...

             Just then two young OFFICERS pull up in a squad car.  Young
             and apple-cheeked.  The first one holding a piece of paper.

                                 OFFICER #1
                       We did the interviews with all the nearby
                       houses like you asked.

                                 WILL 
                       Anything?

                                 OFFICER #1
                           (shakes his head)
                       Here's a list of who we talked to.

             Hands the list to Will.  He glances it.

                                 WILL
                       Alright.  Go back and set up some follow-
                       ups for this afternoon.

             The Officers nod, put the car in reverse.  Fred saunters
             over.  Nods towards the searchers.

                                 FRED
                       You don't think they should start further
                       back?

             Will shakes his head.

                                 WILL
                       He had to have exited here.  Over those
                       boulders.  I saw him move, he's nimble.
                       Would have taken the hardest way out.

             Fred shrugs, skeptical.  Just then, his cell phone BLEATS.
             He reaches for it.

                                 FRED
                           (into phone)
                       Duggar...

             Will looks back at the search team.  Slow.  Meticulous.

                                 FRED (cont'd)
                           (into phone)
                       Where was it?

             A local WOMAN.  At the end of the line.  Glances over her
             shoulder.  Looks at Will.  Smiles.  You'll help us catch him.

                                 FRED (cont'd)
                           (into phone)
                       Okay. 
                           (slaps phone closed)
                       That was Ellie.

             Will turns back to him.

                                 FRED (cont'd)
                       They found Farrell's bullet.  Says it
                       looks like a 357.  After the autopsy Rich
                       can drive 'em both to the lab in
                       Anchorage.  Have a murder weapon by
                       morning.

             Fred crosses his arms.  Sarcastic.

                                 FRED (cont'd)
                       That is, if it's alright with you.

             EXT. PIONEER LODGE - NIGHTMUTE - NIGHT

             Thunder RUMBLING.

             INT. PIONEER LODGE - NIGHTMUTE - NIGHT

             Rachel winding an old grandfather clock with a key.  Looks
             about a hundred years old.

             Will enters the lobby.  Soaked through.  Carrying an armload
             of wet files.  Rachel turns, sees him.  Reaches over to an
             umbrella stand.  Hands him an umbrella.

                                 RACHEL
                       Here.  It's on the house.

             Will takes it.  Preoccupied.

                                 WILL
                       Thanks.

             He starts up the stairs.  Notices Rachel straining to return
             the key to the top of the clock.  Backtracks to help her.
             She gets it without his help.

                                 RACHEL
                       I got it.
                           (smiles)
                       Don't know why I bother.  It's been
                       broken for two years.

                                 WILL
                       Habit.

             Rachel looks at him.  Can't figure this guy out.  Remembers
             something.

                                 RACHEL (cont'd)
                       Oh.  A man came by to see you earlier.
                       Said he was your new partner.

             A TINGLE skips down Will's spine.  He looks at her.

                                 WILL
                       Fred Duggar?

                                 RACHEL
                       No.  He didn't say what his name was.
                       Only that you were expecting him.

                                 WILL
                       I'm not expecting anyone.

                                 RACHEL
                       That's not what he thinks.

                                 WILL
                       What did he look like?

             Rachel thinks for a second.  Leaning against the clock.

                                 RACHEL
                       Short.  Dark hair.  Not that memorable.

             Will nods, rubs his forehead.  Suddenly has a pounding
             headache.  Turns for the stairs.  Hesitates.

                                 WILL
                       I need to borrow something.

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - NIGHT

             CLOSE ON a nail.  One THWACK of a hammer and it bites into
             the wall.  PULL BACK to reveal Will nailing the corner of a
             blanket to one side of the window.  An ad hoc curtain.

             He finishes that side.  Starts to stretch the blanket across
             the window.  Hesitates.  Looks outside.  To the left.  To the
             right.  To see if anybody's out there.  If anybody's
             watching.  Sees instead...

             A LONE TUGBOAT chugging across the harbor.  Pulling a huge
             freighter.  Will squeezes his eyes shut.  Opens them again.
             Pulls the blanket fully across the window.

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - 1:05 A.M.

             The FILES spread across the floor.  Their edges buckled from
             the rain.  Dozens of pictures of Kay Connell.  School
             records.  Private letters.  Health files.  Coroner's report.

             Will.  Pacing.  Back and forth.  Thinking.  Over that same
             SQUEAKY floorboard.  The clock reads: 1:05.

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - 2:20 A.M.

             Will lying in bed.  On top of the blanket.  Wide awake.
             Staring at the ADJOINING DOOR.  Into Hap's room.

             EXT. PIONEER LODGE - NIGHTMUTE - LATE NIGHT

             Will, in a sweatshirt and coat, heads down the front steps of
             the Pioneer Lodge.  Jams his hands in his pockets.  The walk
             of an insomniac.

             EXT. MAINSTREET - NIGHTMUTE - LATE NIGHT

             Will walking down main street.  In the middle of the road.
             The dead of night.  No cars.  The sky a blinding white.

             Hears some rowdy NOISE coming from a corner bar, beer lights
             flickering.  A WOMAN rides by on a bicycle.  Birds SINGING.
 
             Not day.  Not night.  Stuck somewhere in between.  Like a
             dream.

             Turns down a side street.  Passing more stores.  Guns and
             Ammo.  Patty's Hair and Nails.  General Store.  Comes upon
     
             THE ALLEY

             where he vomited the day before.  Stops.  Sees the DEAD DOG,
             still down at the end.  Half obscured by the dumpster.

             Will wavers, pale.  Suddenly...

             A HOMELESS MAN emerges from the shadows.  Big.  Wild-eyed.
             Awakened from his sleep.  Will, quickly backtracks to the
             sidewalk.  Spooked.

             JUST THEN the CRACK! of bat hitting ball.  He turns.  In the 
             distance.  Nightmute Elementary School.

             EXT. NIGHTMUTE ELEMENTARY - LATE NIGHT

             A Little League game in full swing.  The uniforms, a little
             faded.  The diamond, a little unkempt.  A smattering of
             SPECTATORS.  Mostly dads with six-packs.

             Will wanders over to the fence.  Spots Ellie sitting alone on
             the bottom bleacher.

                                                                   CUT TO:

             POV OF SOMEONE

             WATCHING HIM.  From afar.  The SOUNDS of the game, delayed a
             few seconds.  Watches as Will crosses to the bleachers...

                                                              CUT BACK TO:

             ...and sits down next to Ellie.  She turns, surprised.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       Detective Dormer!  What are you doing
                       here?
                           (looks at watch)
                       It's two-thirty in the morning.
                       Shouldn't you be asleep?

             Will glances out at the game.

                                 WILL
                       I could say the same thing about you.

                                 ELLIE
                       Oh.  We always have play-offs in the
                       middle of the night.  It's the best time.

                                 WILL
                       Who's playing?

                                 ELLIE
                       The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in
                       extra innings.  The Hawks have a really
                       good line-up this year.

             She sips on a take-out coke.  Looks back at the game.  A
             plump, redheaded GIRL comes up to bat.  Blows a bubble.

                                 ELLIE
                       That's my sister.

             Will looks over just in time to see the girl swing and miss
             by a mile.  Ellie cups her hands around her mouth.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                           (calling out)
                       That's okay, Lib!
                           (to Will)
                       Usually she's better.

                                 WILL
                       She your only sibling?

                                 ELLIE
                           (nods)
                       Twelve years younger.

             Libby takes another swing.  Connects with the ball.  Drops
             the bat and runs to first.  Ellie gives a sharp WHISTLE.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       What about you?  You have any siblings?

                                 WILL
                       No.
                           (rubs his eyes)
                       Well.  I had a brother.  He died when I
                       was eleven.

             Ellie, sits up...

                                 ELLIE
                       Oh, I shouldn't have...

                                 WILL
                       It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He
                       was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.

                                 ELLIE
                       That must have been awful for you.

             Will leans back.  Stretching his legs.  Remembering.

                                 WILL
                       Not really. 
                           (slight smile)
                       I remember I was more embarrassed that he
                       had died.  Embarrassed that it made me
                       different.  So I didn't tell the other kids
                       at school what had happened.  They'd ask 
                       me where he was, where he'd gone.  And I'd
                       make up stories.  He was visiting an aunt up
                       north, he'd broken his leg, he was in a 
                       Swiss boarding school.  Stuff like that.
                           (shakes his head)
                       Nice kid, huh?  Just kept making up more
                       and more lies...

             Suddenly, he stops talking.  Slowly sits up.  Sensing 
             something.  Ellie, noticing the shift.

                                 ELLIE
                       You okay?

             The row of DADS behind them.  Jump up and start CHEERING.

                                                                   CUT TO:

             POV OF THE PERSON

             WATCHING WILL.  Sees him sit up.  Look around.  That same
             prickle at the back of his neck.  A KID slides home just as...

                                                              CUT BACK TO:

             ...Will stands.  Trying to shake the feeling.

                                 WILL
                       I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie.
                       Still need to go through some of Kay
                       Connell's school records.

                                 ELLIE
                           (unsure)
                       Okay.

             He turns to go, scanning the area.  Ellie calls after him.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       Try to get some sleep!

             EXT. NIGHTMUTE MORGUE - EARLY MORNING

             The Nightmute morgue.  Next morning.  A SQUAD CAR pulls up.
             Francis gets out, whistling.  Starts for the morgue's
             entrance.

             INT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - EARLY MORNING

             Will in the Cherokee.  Dark circles under his eyes.  Suit
             jacket wrinkled.  Pulls in next to Francis' squad car.

                                 WILL
                           (calls out window)
                       Officer!...

             Francis turns.

                                 WILL 
                       I'll pick it up.  You head back to the
                       station.

             INT. HALLWAY - NIGHTMUTE MORGUE - EARLY MORNING

             Will walking down a hallway.  Fluorescent lights.
             Cinderblock walls.  On his cell phone.

                                 WILL
                           (into phone)
                       Duggar - I'm at the coroner's now.  I'll
                       be back in about twenty minutes...

             Stops at an open doorway in time to see
    
             THE CORONER pull a sheet over the cold, blue body of Hap
             Eckhart.

             Will's heart lurches.  He grabs on to the door jamb.  Wasn't
             ready for that.  The coroner looks up.

                                 CORONER
                       Detective.  Thought you were sending one
                       of your lackeys.

             Will clears his throat.  Closes his cell phone.

                                 WILL
                       I thought it was better if I came.  Under
                       the circumstances.

             The coroner nods.  Goes to wash her hands.

                                 CORONER
                       It's different when you know them, isn't
                       it?
                           (nods to clipboard)
                       Just sign over there and she's all yours.

             Shrugs off her lab coat.  She's wearing a blue dress.  Looks
             like a piano teacher.  Heads into an adjoining office.

             Will.  Alone.  Steps into the room.  The smell of
             formaldehyde.  Bloody instruments on a stainless steel tray.
             Walks towards the clipboard, eyes flicking over to the shape
             under the sheet when...

             SUDDENLY Hap's HAND drops down.  Thick fingers.  Wedding
             band.

             Will jumps...

                                 CORONER (O.S.)
                       Your partner didn't suffer much...

             The coroner re-emerges from the office with a manila
             envelope.  Hap Eckhart written on it in black pen.

                                 CORONER (cont'd)
                       Maybe for a minute or two.

             Will rubs his face.  Tries to focus on the clipboard.  The
             coroner holds out the envelope.  Smiles.

                                 CORONER (cont'd)
                       Just enough time to reflect.

                                 WILL
                       Thanks, Doc.

             He takes the envelope.  The coroner peers up at him.

                                 CORONER
                       You're looking a little green, Detective.

             INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY

             Fred Duggar, dialing the phone at his cluttered desk.

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                       So where's the other bullets?

             He looks up.  Will standing before him, holding the manila
             envelope.

             INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY

             CLOSE on a key slipping into a padlock.  Opens with a CLICK!

             PULL BACK to reveal Fred and Will in a small storage room.
             Standing in front of an army-green LOCKER.  The evidence
             locker.  Room's stuffed with old files and boxes.  MOOSE
             ANTLERS hanging over a small window.  Will glances up.

                                 WILL
                       What's with all the moose antlers around
                       here?

             Fred throws a look over his shoulder.  Opens the locker.

                                 FRED
                       Lots of moose.

             INSIDE THE LOCKER - another manila envelope.  The name on
             this one: Farrell Brooks.

             Fred reaches back for the other envelope.  Will, hesitant to
             give it to him.  Feeling the bump of the bullet in the bottom
             corner.  Hands it over.  Wipes his brow.

                                 WILL
                       When's Rich coming?

             Fred slides it in beside Farrell's.  Closes the locker door.

                                 FRED
                       I'll call him now.

                                 WILL
                       First I need a copy of the key.

             Fred turns, a twinkle in his eye.

                                 FRED
                       This isn't Seattle, Detective.  We don't
                       have copies.
                           (holds up key)
                       This is the only one.

             Will looks at him.  At the key.  Plucks it from his hand.
             Just then Nyback's SECRETARY appears in the doorway.

                                 SECRETARY
                       Detective Dormer?  Telephone.

             INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY

             The secretary hands Will the phone.  Pulls something from
             under the desk.  A beat-up BOX.  Will's name on it.

                                 SECRETARY
                       This came for you earlier.

             Will glances at it.  Takes the phone.  Rubs his eyes.

                                 WILL
                           (into phone)
                       Dormer.

             Nothing.  Someone's there but they're not saying anything.
             Will, too tired for this shit...

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Goddammit, Warfield, if you're gonna
                       check up on me every...

             Then...the VOICE.  A MAN's voice.  Not John Warfield's.
             This voice is medium-ranged.  Higher.  Nose sounds stuffed.

                                 MAN'S VOICE
                       I bet you haven't been getting much
                       sleep.

             Will straightens.  Something weird.

                                 WILL
                           (into phone)
                       What?

             A little TITTER on the other end.

                                 MAN'S VOICE
                       You lower-48s.  You think the white
                       nights are kind of neat.  Then you can't
                       sleep for days.  I've seen it happen
                       about a million times.  But you can't
                       sleep for a different reason.

                                 WILL
                           (into phone)
                       Who is this?

             A PAUSE.  Will loosens his tie.

                                 WILL 
                           (into phone)
                       I said, who is this?

             The voice.  Dropping to a WHISPER.

                                 MAN'S VOICE
                       I saw what really happened, Will...

             Will, furrows his brow.

                                 MAN'S VOICE
                       I saw you kill your partner.  With your
                       back-up weapon.  Out there on the beach.
                       I saw you shoot him dead...

             CLOSE ON

             Will Dormer's face.

             As all the blood drains from it.

             As all SOUND

             fades around him.

             As his heart
 
             begins to POUND against his chest.

             He falters, reaching out for the desk.  To steady himself.
             As if the floor's just dropped out beneath him.  Eyes,
             darting around the bullpen...

                                 WILL
                           (sotto, into phone)
                       Now you listen to me...

                                 MAN'S VOICE
                       Don't worry.  I won't tell anyone.  Oh,
                       and I saw you take my gun.  My uncle's
                       old 357.  I dropped it in the rocks.
                       But you can go ahead and keep that.

             CHIEF NYBACK, exits his office.  Looks at Will and smiles.

                                 MAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
                       ...I mean...
                           (beat)
                       ...Now that we're partners.

             CLICK.  The line goes dead.

             Will, throat constricted.  Listening to the DIAL TONE.
             Smiles back at Nyback.  Turns.  Slowly hangs up the phone.
             White as a sheet.  Trying to act normal.  Trying to act calm.
             SOUND returning to the bullpen, like nothing's different.
             Looks over at

             THE BOX

             sitting on the edge of the secretary's desk.  He reaches for
             it.  Carefully, rips the packing tape.  Bends back a flap.
             Inside, some dark blue material.  An embroidered daisy.
  
             Kay Connell's knapsack.

             EXT. NIGHTMUTE POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

             Will, heading for the Cherokee.  Clutching the box.  Face
             pale, pace quick.  Everything's different now.

                                 ELLIE (O.S.)
                       Detective Dormer!

             He closes his eyes.  Now is not the time.  Reaches the
             Cherokee.  Yanks open the driver's side door.  Ellie catches
             up with him.  Out of breath.

                                 ELLIE
                       You look like you're in a hurry.  I just
                       wanted to ask you about these pictures.

             She smiles, holds up some PHOTOGRAPHS.  They're of the BEACH.
             The ones Kepp took.  Almost all fog.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       I know they're not great quality, but
                       this is where you said you were when you
                       first saw Detective Eckhart, right?

             Will.  Barely glancing at them.  Tosses the box into the car.

                                 WILL
                       Right.

             Gets in and closes the door.  Puts his hand over the box.
             Ellie comes up to the window.

                                 ELLIE
                       But here's the thing.  I retraced your
                       exact steps according to your statement.
                       You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart
                       from there.  I mean, not in that fog.

                                 WILL
                       Then change it.

                                 ELLIE
                       How much closer would you say you were?

                                 WILL
                       I don't remember.

                                 ELLIE
                       Five feet?  Seven feet?

             Will, about to seriously lose his shit.  Looks at Ellie.
             Eyes dark, distant.

                                 WILL
                       Listen, Ellie.  I don't have time for
                       this shit.  Five feet, seven feet, twenty
                       feet.  Put down whatever you want in your
                       report, alright?

             He turns the ignition.  Pulls out with a SQUEAL.  Ellie
             steps back, watching him drive away.  More curious than
             stung.

             EXT. OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - DAY

             The Cherokee.  Parked off-road.  A remote spot by the water.
             The driver's side door, left open.  The PING-PING-PING of the
             interior BELL.

             EXT. BREAKFRONT - DAY

             Will Dormer, walking along a breakfront.  Aimless.  One foot
             in front of the other.  Staring out at nothing.  The endless
             sea.  Waves CRASHING.  Wind HOWLING.  Seagulls SCREECHING.

             Everything.  Closing in on him...

             He stumbles over a rock.  Grabs his head in his hands.

             Stunned.  Guilty.  Ashamed.  Fucked.

             He saw it.  He saw it!

             A WAVE, explodes nearby.  Drenching him in sea spray.

             Will turns, raking his hand across his face.  Blinking.  Eyes
             stinging.  Trying to focus.  Trying to think this through...

             Hears a dog BARKING in the distance.

             Shakes his head.  Looks at his watch.

             Got to deal with the problem at hand.

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - PIONEER LODGE - DAY

             Will, bursts into his room at the Lodge.  The shoulders of
             his coat still wet with sea spray.  Crosses to the area of
             the floor where Kay Connell's files are still spread out.

             Starts pressing the floorboards with the toe of his boot.
             Testing.  Testing.  Until...he finds the one that SQUEAKS.

             Gets down on his knees.  Hesitates.  Then jams his fingers in
             around the loose board.  Starts pulling it up.  Face
             reddening.  Knuckles whitening.  Slips his hand into the gap.

             Pulls out a muddy 357 RUGER.

             The killer's gun.

             Will, stares down at it.

             INT. ALLEY - DAY

             Will, standing at the mouth of the ALLEY.  Just like the
             night before.  Steps inside.  Cautious.  Eyes darting.
             Peering into the shadows for the HOMELESS MAN...

             Not there.  Coast's clear.  Heads for the dumpster at the end 
             of the alley.  Shoves it aside.  Looks down at...

             The DEAD DOG.  Rancid.  Rotting.  Will gags.  Holds a
             handkerchief to his face.  Waving away the flies.

             Then.  Pulls the 357 Ruger from his pocket.  Shrugs his coat
             off and wraps it around his hand and the gun.  Looks away.
             Fires a muffled SHOT into the dog's side.  The body kicks.

             Crouches down.  Feels along the dog's ribs for the bullet's
             point of entry.  Finds it.  Pulls out a PENKNIFE and extends
             one of the blades.  Cuts into the gash, fingers probing deep
             for the lodged bullet.  He finds it.  Pulls it out.

             Looks back at the dog.  Takes a deep breath.  Wipes his brow.
             A little smear of the dog's blood left on his forehead.
             Turns and pulls a bottle of RUBBING ALCOHOL from his pocket. 
             Douses the bullet.  Cleaning it.  Glancing at his watch.
             Running out of time...

             EXT. NIGHTMUTE POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

             The rear of the Nightmute PD building.  Will, looking around,
             heads briskly for the back door...

             INT. HALLWAY - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY

             ...steps into the HALLWAY leading towards the bullpen.  Hears 
             VOICES.  Nearby.  Ducks back.  Waiting for them to fade.

             Safe.  Heads down towards the STORAGE ROOM.  Glancing briefly
             at the PICTURES hanging on the wall.  Of old time POLICE
             OFFICERS.  Striking brave poses...

             INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY

             The storage room.  Hot.  Stifling.  The moose antlers LOOMING
             over his shoulder.  Will pulls the evidence locker key from 
             his pocket.  Unlocks the padlock.  Swings the door open.

             Pulls the Hap Eckhart envelope out.  Throwing a look over his
             shoulder.  Opens it.  Shakes out the bullet that was lodged
             in Hap's spine.  Then fishes a plastic bag from his pocket.
             The bullet he shot into the dead dog.  Drops that into the
             envelope and reseals it.  Hands shaking.

             Something.  Catches the corner of his eye.  He turns.

             HIS REFLECTION in the locker mirror.  The blood smear still
             on his forehead.

                                 FRED (O.S.)
                       Dormer...

             Will jumps.  Quickly wipes the smear off and turns.  Fred 
             Duggar standing behind him.  RICH by his side.  Will clears
             his throat, shoves Hap's envelope into Fred's hand.  Then
             Farrell's.  Angry.

                                 WILL
                       These should have gone out two hours ago.

             SLAMS the locker door and brushes past him.  Fred and Rich
             exchange a glance.

             EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHTMUTE - DAY

             CLOSE ON a YOUNG GIRL's face.  Dark hair held up in two
             barrettes, wind tousling the curls.  Reading from a piece of
             paper. 

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                       ...And that's how I think Kay would want
                       us to remember her...

             PULL BACK to reveal Kay Connell's funeral.  PEOPLE standing
             by the grave, most of them HIGH SCHOOLERS.  The sky's a
             brilliant blue.  Red fireweeds blanket the hillside.

                                 YOUNG GIRL (cont'd)
                       ...Swimming, reading, hiking through the
                       Kebaughs...

             FRED, ELLIE AND WILL

             stand off to the side.  Dressed in black.  Fred looks like
             he's never worn a tie before.  Ellie holds a potted plant.  A
             gift for the bereaved.

                                 YOUNG GIRL (cont'd)
                       ...playing her flute, meeting at Darrow's
                       after school...

             Will.  Eyes bloodshot.  Not really listening.  Not really
             paying attention.  A thousand miles away.  Tugs at his
             collar.  Feels tight.

                                 YOUNG GIRL 
                       ...And always, always with a smile on her
                       face.

             The young girl looks up.  Folds the paper closed.  People
             SNIFFLE.  Mrs. Connell, reaches out to squeeze her arm.

             Some CHILDREN.  Start circulating with plastic buckets.
             Filled with white carnations.  Handing them out.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                       Want one?

             Will, startled, looks down.  A LITTLE GIRL stands before him.
             Curly hair.  Glasses.  Holding up a bucket.  He shakes his
             head.  Looks back up at

             THE MOURNERS lining up to place the carnations on Kay's
             casket.

             AN OLD MAN with a brass-tipped cane.  Two GIRLS, look like
             sisters, holding each other up.  A MAN with a thick red
             beard.  A LITTLE BOY, about five, clutching a FLUTE tied with
             a pink ribbon...

             Will, looks away.  Then.  At the end of the line.  Something
             catches his eye.

             RANDY STETZ

             in tight jeans and a down vest.  In front of him stands a 
             GIRL with white-blonde hair.

             From the torn pictures in Kay Connell's room.

             Will, straightens at the sight of her.

             Sees Randy surreptitiously caress her ass.

             EXT. CEMETERY - LATER

             The service is over.  People are heading back to their cars.
             Fred yanks off his tie.  Looks at Ellie.

                                 FRED
                       We should go say hello to Mrs. Connell.

             He starts off.  Ellie, looks back at Will.

                                 WILL
                       You go ahead.  I'll be there in a second.

             Ellie nods.  Catches up to Fred.  Will turns his attention
             back to RANDY AND THE GIRL.  Over at the far end of the 
             cemetery.  Standing next to Randy's motorcycle.

             EXT. AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST - MINUTES LATER

             Randy gets on his bike, strapping his helmet on.  The girl's
             about to get on behind him.

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                       Why don't I give her a ride?

             They look over.  WILL walking towards them.  The wind
             whipping his jacket.  His tie.  Randy makes a face.

                                 RANDY
                       Thought I smelled something.

                                 WILL
                       Good to see you, too, Randy.

             Will arrives at the bike.  The girl, TANYA FRANCKE, looks at
             him curiously.  Her long white-blonde hair, her skin almost
             translucent.  Something sexy about her.  Has the carnation
             stuck in the buttonhole of her jean jacket.

                                 TANYA
                       Who're you?

             EXT. GRAVESITE - CONTINUOUS

             Fred shakes Mrs. Connell's hand.  Ellie waits.  Looks over
             and sees
 
             WILL standing with Tanya and Randy.

             Shifts the plant in her hands.

             EXT. AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST - CONTINUOUS

             Will shows the gold shield on his belt.

                                 RANDY
                       Fuckin' cop.

             Randy kick starts the bike.  It dies.  He kicks it again.
             Calls out over his shoulder.

                                 RANDY
                       You coming or not?

             INT. CHEROKEE - FOREST - DAY

             Sunlight dappling through tall fir trees.  Will drives.
             Tanya sitting next to him.  Her black skirt riding up.
             Picking at the flaking polish on her nails.
 
                                 TANYA
                       I never met anyone from Seattle before.

                                 WILL
                       You're not missing much.

                                 TANYA
                       What are you doing in this shit-hole
                       town?

             Will, shifts.  Looks over.

                                 WILL
                       You were good friends with Kay Connell,
                       weren't you?

             Tanya hesitates.  Pulls a cigarette from her purse.

                                 TANYA
                       I was her best friend.

                                 WILL
                       Best friend?

                                 TANYA
                       Since grade school.

                                 WILL
                       That's a long time.

                                 TANYA
                       We were like sisters.  Knew everything
                       about each other.

                                 WILL
                       Must be tough for you.  What happened.

             Tanya shrugs.  Lights the cigarette.  Takes a drag.

                                 TANYA
                       Everybody says I'm holding up great,
                       considering.  Don't even care if I go to
                       school.  They're all worried I haven't
                       cried yet.

             She stretches.  Her midriff showing.  Shifts her body towards
             Will.

                                 TANYA (cont'd)
                       But there's no law against not crying,
                       right?

                                 WILL
                       What about Kay's other friends?

             Tanya makes a face.  Reaches out and taps the hula-girl.

                                 TANYA
                       Do we have to talk about Kay?  I don't
                       want to talk about her right now.  Let's
                       just drive.  Go somewhere.

             Will looks over at her.  She blows out a plume of smoke.
             Smiles.  Seductive.

                                 WILL
                       You want me to take you somewhere?

                                 TANYA
                       Long as it's fun.

             She reaches out a sinewy arm.  Starts massaging the back of
             Will's neck.

                                 TANYA (cont'd)
                       Young, impressionable girl left alone
                       with older, Seattle detective.  Who knows
                       what we could get up to.

             Will, impervious to the touch.  Head, throbbing.  Reaches for
             the gear.  His foot, pressing harder on the gas.

             EXT. CHEROKEE - FOREST ROAD - CONTINUOUS

             SCREECH!  The Cherokee whips around a curve.

             INT. CHEROKEE - CONTINUOUS
 
             Tanya giggles.  Likes the speed.  Will, goes even faster.

             EXT. CHEROKEE - CONTINUOUS
 
             The Cherokee breaks free from the forest.  Racing along a
             coastal road.  Water CRASHING against the rocks.

             Up ahead, a LOGGING TRUCK coming the other way.  The Cherokee
             shifts lanes.  Heading straight for the truck.

             INT. CHEROKEE - CONTINUOUS

             Tanya looks out at the truck.  Still giggling.

                                 WILL
                       How about this.  You like this?

             The truck BEEPS.  Will goes faster.  Tanya takes her hand
             from Will's neck.  Holds on to her seat.

             EXT. CHEROKEE - CONTINUOUS

             The gap's closing fast.  The truck BEEPS again.

             INT. CHEROKEE - CONTINUOUS

             Tanya looks over at Will.  Not giggling any more.

                                 TANYA
                       Hey...

                                 WILL
                       Thought you wanted something fun...

             Will goes even faster...

             EXT. CHEROKEE - COASTAL ROAD

             The truck and the Cherokee.  On a collision course.  The
             truck BEEPS wildly.

             INT. CHEROKEE - CONTINUOUS

             Tanya squirming in her seat.  Not liking this any more.

                                 TANYA
                       Move over!

             Will staring dead ahead.  Tensing his jaw.  The TRUCK...
             bearing down on them...

             Tanya reaches for the wheel...Will pushes her hands away...
             The TRUCK...a breath away...

                                 TANYA (cont'd)
                           (screaming)
                       Move over, you crazy fuck!

             EXT. CHEROKEE - COASTAL ROAD

             The truck and the Cherokee...just feet from each other...at
             the last moment...the Cherokee jerks out of the way...

             EXT. ICICLE FISHING CANNERY - DAY

             ...SCREECHES to a stop near an old sign, Icicle Cannery.
             Gravel flying.  Will gets out.  Slams his door.  Rounds the 
             car and opens Tanya's door.  She's screaming at him.

                                 TANYA
                       You crazy son-of-a-bitch!  You could have
                       killed us!

             Will reaches in and pulls her out of the car.

                                 TANYA (cont'd)
                       Ow!  You're hurting me!

             Will pulls her up a steep hill of garbage and broken crates.
             Pushes her down the other side.  She stumbles.

                                 TANYA (cont'd)
                       You want to tell me what the fuck this is
                       all about?

             Will stands above her, on the hill.  His face set like stone.

                                 WILL
                       You and Kay were like sisters?

                                 TANYA
                       That's what I said.

                                 WILL
                       Told each other everything.
                           (heads down the hill)
                       That why your picture's torn up in the
                       top drawer of her bureau?

             Tanya steps back.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Why her boyfriend's hand was clamped on 
                       your ass at her funeral?

             He grabs her by the arm.  Jerks it up.  She CRIES out.  Will
             leans in.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       You like games, little girl?  Well how
                       about this one - you're standing right
                       where her naked body was found wrapped up
                       in a garbage bag.

             Tanya's eyes grow wide.  She looks around her.  Disgusting,
             rotten.  A SEAGULL pecking at the body of a dead bird.  She
             tries to break away...

                                 TANYA
                       No...

                                 WILL
                       Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?

             Tanya looks away.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Who gave her those dresses?

             She struggles more.  No good.  Will's grip is like a vice.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       I need a name.

                                 TANYA
                       I don't know.

                                 WILL
                       You don't know.

                                 TANYA
                       She wouldn't tell me!

                                 WILL
                       But you were such good friends...

             Tanya, squirming.  Angry.

                                 TANYA
                       It was like some big fucking secret!

                                 WILL
                       What was?

                                 TANYA
                       She kept saying she was gonna get out of
                       here.  Leave us all behind.  That he was
                       going to take her!

                                 WILL
                       Who?

                                 TANYA
                       My arm!

                                 WILL
                       Who?

                                 TANYA
                       She used some stupid code name.

                                 WILL
                       What was it?

                                 TANYA
                       Brody...I don't know...
                           (crying)
                       ...Something Brody!

             Will straightens.  He's heard that name before.

             Suddenly Tanya jams her heel into his shoe.  He CRIES out.
             She breaks away from him.  Runs up the hill.  Turns.  Tears
             streaking her face.  Throws the carnation to the ground.

                                 TANYA (cont'd)
                       You happy now, you fucking bastard?

             INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHTMUTE - DAY

             CLOSE ON a FINGER.  Running along a row of book spines.
             Brundt...Buckley...Buss...Buckham...Byrie...

             PULL BACK to reveal will in Nightmute's small bookstore.
             Still in his funeral clothes.

             In the "Mystery!" section.  Not finding what he wants.  Then,
             something catches his eye:  A BARGAIN BIN at the end of the 
             aisle.  Will limps down to it.  Avoides eye-contact with a
             YOUNG WOMAN shelving "New Arrivals!"

             Reaches into the bin.  Rummages through some paperbacks.
             Then he finds it:  Otherwise Engaged by Walter Byrd.
             Underneath the title, he finds what he's looking for:
             Another J. Brody Mystery.  Flips to the inside of the cover.

             A BLURRY PICTURE of Walter Byrd.  Head turned to the side.
             Walter Byrd was born in Watson Lake, Canada.  He graduated...

             Will's eyes skip down to the bottom:

             Mr. Byrd currently lives in Umkumiut, Alaska, with his two
             labrador retrievers, Lucy and Desi.

             Will looks up.  Slaps the book closed.

             INT./EXT. CHEROKEE - ROAD - DAY

             Will drives, sipping take-out coffee.  Trying to fight the 
             stinging in his eyes.  Passes a sign:  Umkumiut, 30 miles.

             EXT. TESORO ALASKA GAS STATION - UMKUMIUT - DAY

             Will stands in a phone booth at the gas station.  Flips
             through the phone book.  His finger tracing down the "B"s.
             Finds it:  Walter Byrd, 451 S. Diamond Tooth, Apt. B.

             EXT. DIAMOND TOOTH ROAD - UMKUMIUT - DAY

             Sky's become overcast.  Will stands across the street from a
             pale blue building.  On the ground floor, a tackle store.
             Above, looks like several apartment units.

             He starts across.

             INT. HALLWAY - APARTMENTS - DAY

             Will heads down a narrow hallway.  Tiled floor.  Passes door
             "A."  Stops at the next one, "B."  Knocks.  Hears nothing but
             the muted tv from apartment "A."  Pulls out his gloves.

             INT. WALTER BYRD'S APARTMENT - DAY

             With a CLICK the door swings open.  Will, gloves on, pockets
             his credit card.  Hears the CHING CHING of dog collars as
 
             TWO LABRADOR RETRIEVERS stand at attention, GROWLING.  Will's
             prepared.  Takes a bag of treats from his pocket.

                                 WILL
                       Lucy.  Desi.

             The dogs break.  Trot over to him.  Wolf down the treats.
             Will scans the place.  Small, cheap.  Matching sofa and easy
             chair, corduroy upholstery.  The walls, lined with old 1950s
             movie posters.  All second-rate detective movies:  "Another
             Shot in the Dark," "Lady Luck," "He wore a Black Hat."

             Will walks across the room.  Repulsed.  The pathetic hovel of 
             a killer.  Looks into the
   
             BEDROOM

             Single bed.  Books and magazines.  A half-eaten tuna sandwich
             on the bedside table.  "NYPD BLUE" calendar on the wall.

             It's quiet.  He walks over to a large DESK by the window.
             Scattered papers.  Computer.  Mini cassette recorder.
     
             On the wall, hundreds of newspaper articles.  Some yellowing,
             some fresh.  All about cops: "Officer Louis Saved My Life!"
             "Shoot-out in Soho," "South Street Cop Takes Down Drug
             Ring," "Seattle Cop Killed by Suspect..."

             Will curls his lip.  Starts looking through the papers on the
             desk.  Underneath a stack, he finds an 8x10 PHOTOGRAPH.  It's
             of Byrd, standing in front of a big, lakeside HOUSE.  A RADIO
             TOWER in the background.  Walter Byrd's face is blurred,
             turned to the side.  The photo from the book bio.

             Will takes it.  Starts roughly opening drawers.  A box of
             animal crackers, a rubber band ball.  Then, shoved in the
             back of the top drawer, an APPOINTMENT BOOK.  Will flips
             through to today's date.  Blank.  Shoves the book into his
             pocket.  Slams the door closed.
  
             Then reaches back for his Smith 39/13.  Checks the magazine.
             Slaps it back in place.  He's ready.

             SUDDENLY the phone RINGS.  A beige rotary on the desk.
             Plugged into an ancient answering machine.  It RINGS again.
             The answering machine WHIRS.  Then BEEPS.

                                 WALTER'S VOICE
                       Now you're mad at me.

             Will freezes.

                                 WALTER'S VOICE (cont'd)
                       ...I spotted your car around the corner.
                       You must have been in a hurry.  Put some
                       pieces together.  Don't worry, I would
                       have done the same thing...

             Will turns back to the window.  Looking furiously...

                                 WALTER'S VOICE (cont'd)
                       Anyway...
                           (blows nose)
                       ...I'm not coming home.  So you
                       shouldn't wait there all day.  I mean,
                       they'll wonder about you at the station.
                       You should be careful about following
                       procedure, Will, especially now that...

             Will lunges for the phone.  Snatches it up just as CLICK! the
             tape cuts off.

                                 WILL
                       Goddammit!

             Enraged, he PUNCHES the receiver through the wall.

             INT. HALLWAY - APARTMENTS - DAY

             Will exits the apartment.  Cradling his hand.  Looks down at
             the tile floor.  Scanning it for a broken tile.  Finds one.
             Bends down and plucks out a broken corner.

             Places it carefully where the bottom of the door meets the
             door jamb.  Just then.  His BEEPER goes off.

             INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY

             Will strides into the bullpen.  Wounded hand in pocket.
             Ellie hunts and pecks at a typewriter.  Glances up.

             Fred, over in the corner.  SLAMS a drawer in the filing
             cabinet.  Turns.

                                 FRED
                       Forget your pager?

                                 WILL
                       What?

                                 FRED
                       I beeped you over two hours ago.

             Holds out a one-page report.

                                 FRED (cont'd)
                       Got a fax from the lab.  Murder weapon
                       was a 357 Ruger.

             Will takes the report.  Heads over to the coffee machine.

                                 WILL
                       Good.

                                 FRED
                       And something else that might interest 
                       you.

             He reaches into his desk drawer and pulls out a book.  Holds
             it up.  Otherwise Engaged.  In hardback.

                                 FRED (cont'd)
                       Remember this?

             Will blinks.

                                 WILL
                       No.

                                 FRED
                       One of the paperbacks we found in Kay
                       Connell's knapsack.

             Will pours himself a cup of coffee.  Trying to keep the
             stream steady.  Ellie continues typing...CLACK...CLACK...

                                 WILL
                       That's right.

                                 FRED
                       Mrs. Connell found this copy in the 
                       house.
                           (opens it up)
                       It's signed.  Personally.

                                 WILL
                       So?

                                 FRED
                       This is a local writer.  Kay had all his
                       books.  I think we should check it out.

             CLACK...CLACK...CLACK...Will rubs his chin.  Looks back at
             the report.  Judicious.

                                 WILL
                       I don't think it'll lead anywhere.

             The CLACKING stops.  SILENCE.  Will turns around.  Ellie's
             staring right at him - that isn't like him.

             He turns back to Fred.  Beat.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Well.  If he's local.  Give him a call.

             The CLACKING resumes.

             INT. STAIRWAY - DIAMOND TOOTH ROAD - UMKUMIUT - LATE NIGHT

             A dark stairway.  Late at night.  Will, bathed in shadows.
             Climbs to the top.  Quietly, carefully.  He heads down a
             hallway.  We recognise it.  Back where Walter Byrd lives.
 
             Will approaches apartment "B."  Slowly pulls out his weapon.
             Cocks it.  Waits a beat then swings out in front of the door.
             Ready to fight.  Ready to confront.  Looks down...

             Tile corner's still there.

             INT./EXT. CHEROKEE - UMKUMIUT - NEXT DAY

             CLOSE ON Walter Byrd's APPOINTMENT BOOK laying open.
             Scrawled in pencil:  8:30.  Dr. Agee.

             PULL BACK to reveal Will sitting in the parked Cherokee.  The
             appointment book on the passenger seat.  Been there all night.

             Insomnia.  Taking its toll.  His hair, no longer neatly
             combed.  His face, pale and unshaven.  His eyes, dragged open
             from fatigue.  Looks like the whole world's pulling him down.
             Staring down the street at a
   
             BRICK BUILDING on the corner.  A placard by the front door:
             Dr. Florence Agee, D.D.S.

             Will checks his watch.  Rubs his eyes with the heels of his
             hands.  Suddenly.  Something tells him to look up.

             A MAN

             in the distance, walking along the road.  Towards Dr. Agee's.
             He's in his forties.  Short, shoulders sloped.  Wears a 
             beige, zip-up windbreaker, khakis, brown desert boots.

             WALTER BYRD

             has a bulky hearing aid in one ear.  Is looking down at the
             road.  Glances up.

             LOCKS EYES WITH WILL

             Byrd, slows his pace.

             Will, reaches for the door handle.

             SUDDENLY

             Byrd turns in the other direction, starts walking fast.

             Will leaps out of the Cherokee and heads after him.

             WALTER BYRD

             his short legs pumping, spots a TOUR BUS across the road.
             Veers over to it.

             WILL

             a runner's stride.  Weaves through PEOPLE.  Closing in on
             Byrd.  Sees his plan.  Cuts across the road just as...

             A PICK-UP

             rounds the corner.  THUMP!  Broadsides him.  Will's pitched
             up and over the hood.  Falls hard on the tarmac.  Dazed for a
             second.  Blood, gushing from his forehead.  Hears the PICK-UP
             DOOR open...FEET running over to him.

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                       Are you alright?  You popped out from
                       nowhere!

             More FEET running over.

                                 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                       He okay?

             Will opens his eyes.  Trying to focus.  Looks up and sees, in
             the distance...WALTER BYRD getting on the tour bus.

             Will struggles to his feet.  The OLD LADY who hit him,
             wearing overalls.  Reaches out.

                                 OLD LADY
                       I don't think you should move.

             Will stands, wavering.  Flashes her his badge.

             INT./EXT. PICK-UP

             The old lady rips along in the truck.  Will sits in the
             passenger seat, a handkerchief to his forehead.  It's soaked
             with blood.  The lady looks over.

                                 OLD LADY
                       You sure you're okay?

                                 WILL
                       I'm fine.

                                 OLD LADY
                       Careful not to bleed on my interior.

             Will looks over at her.  Shifts in his seat.  Ouch.  Feels
             like a couple cracked ribs.  Peers out the windshield at the
             TOUR BUS a few cars ahead of them.

             EXT. WINDY ROAD - CONTINUOUS

             AERIAL VIEW of the pick-up tailing the tour bus.  A windy
             coastal road.  Beyond it, a blanket of endless evergreens.

             EXT. FERRY STATION - OUTSIDE UMKUMIUT - DAY

             A FERRY at the end of the pier.  A small wooden booth for
             selling tickets.  Beautiful, sweeping snow-capped mountains
             on the other side of the bay.  Nothing else for miles around.

             The pick-up pulls up next to the bus and a couple other cars.
             Will jumps out.  Scans the area for Byrd.  Nothing.  Then,
             sees the last few PEOPLE boarding the ferry.

             INT. FERRY - MINUTES LATER

             Ferry's getting pitched around in the roiling water.  Most
             everyone is inside.  TOURISTS with throw-away cameras,
             backpacks, anoraks, CHILDREN.  Some looking sea-sick in the
             corner.

             Will weaves through the crowd.  Eyes darting, searching.  The
             ferry lurches to one side, the crowd sways, Will spots

             WALTER BYRD standing by a window.

             INT. WINDOW - FERRY

             Walter holds on to the railing.  Looking at the view, the sea
             spray.  Will comes up.  Stands next to him.  Cognizant of the
             people around them.

                                 WILL
                       Walter Byrd.

             Walter continues looking out the window.  That same stuffed-
             nose voice.

                                 WALTER
                       When I was seven my mother and
                       grandmother took me to Vancouver.  We
                       were walking along the street one day
                       when these two men ran past and snatched
                       my grandmother's purse right from under
                       her arm.  Right from under her arm.  That
                       night a police officer came to our hotel 
                       room to ask us questions.  Stood the
                       whole time.

             The ferry pitches again.  Will grabs on to the railing.
             Looking down at this little man.  Hate in his eyes.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       His uniform looked brand new.  His shoes
                       and badge were polished, his billy club,
                       his belt buckle.  All perfect.  He was
                       like a soldier, but better.

             Walter reaches up to blow his nose.  Will's eyes look on in
             disgust - his knuckles are still red and swollen.  From
             beating Kay Connell to death.

                                 WALTER (cont'd) 
                       Made a huge impression on me.  His
                       goodness.  Gave me an instant respect for
                       the police.  I tried to become a cop when
                       I left high school, but...

             He points to his hearing-aid.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       Congenital problem.

             The ferry's engine HUMS to a stop.  Walter smiles.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       Oh.  We're here.

             EXT. GENDREAU GLACIER - DAY

             Gendreau Glacier.  Spilling down between two huge mountains.
             Enormous in its whiteness, its coldness, its silent power.

             Will and Walter walk up its face, away from the other
             tourists.  Walter leads the way.  Hands in his pockets.

                                 WALTER
                       You know this glacier moves a quarter of
                       an inch every day?

             He points off to the horizon.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       And on a clear day you can see all the
                       way over to Newtok.  There's a beautiful
                       aviary over there.  We can go sometime.

             Will's lip curls.  Watching him.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       It's actually cool for this time of year.
                       Normally the temperature runs about...

             SUDDENLY Will lunges at him.  Walter's eyes widen in surprise
             as he grabs him up by the collar.  Nose to nose.  Will barely
             keeping control.

                                 WILL
                       You think this is a nice meeting we're 
                       having here?  Friendly?  Two people
                       getting acquainted?
                           (jerks him harder)
                       You sick, coward, fuck.  I get up every
                       morning of my life just to bring someone
                       like you down.  Beating a seventeen year-
                       old girl to death.  Washing her
                       afterwards, cleaning her.  Make you feel
                       like a real man?
                           (tightens his grip)
                       Huh?

             Walter flounders.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       I outta end this right now.  Take a rock
                       and smash your fucking skull in...

             His jaws tense, nostrils flare.  Walter, red-faced,
             sputtering...

                                 WALTER 
                       I stood right behind you...I saw you look
                       right into his eyes and shoot him...

             Will clenches his teeth.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       ...Seattle's great hero.  Shooting his
                       own partner.  I saw it all...

                                 WILL
                       That was an accident!  You hear me?  I
                       didn't know it was him!
                           (shakes him hard)
                       I didn't know it was him!

             Just then a SHRIEK.  Will looks over

             A COUPLE KIDS.  Further down the glacier.  Having a snowball
             fight.

             Will looks back at Walter.  Has to take it easy.  Shoves him
             away in disgust.  Walter falls down onto the snow.  Dislodges  
             his hearing aid.

             Watches Will pace.  Head throbbing.  Ribs, screaming in pain.

                                 WALTER
                       Then why lie about it?

             Walter brushes the snow off the dislodged hearing aid.  Puts
             it back around his ear.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       I mean, I'm all for bending the truth.
                       That's what I do in my novels.  It's my 
                       trade you might say.  But why cover it
                       up?

             Gets up.  Brushes the snow from his butt.  Checks something
             in his pocket.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       You don't have to tell me if you don't
                       want to.  I'm sure you have some reason.
                       Something noble.  I have faith in that.
 
             Looks down at the kids.  Shakes his head.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       They should be bundled up better.

                                 WILL
                       What's your game, Byrd?

             Walter turns back to him.

                                 WALTER
                       No game.

                                 WILL
                       The phone call.  The knapsack.

             Walter shrugs.

                                 WALTER
                       I figured we're partners on this one.  I
                       mean, after what I saw...

             Will stops short.  Eyes burning.  It's all he can do not to
             throttle this weed.

                                 WILL
                       Let's get one thing straight, Byrd.  We are
                       partners on nothing.

             Walter looks at him.  Scratches his head.

                                 WALTER
                       I research my novels.  I know the 
                       procedures.  You'd have cuffed me back at
                       the ferry.  You'd have called for back-
                       up, read me my rights, and gotten a
                       search warrant for my apartment.  You're
                       a well-respected detective.  There's
                       no reason for you to be talking to me
                       right now...

             He takes out a handkerchief.  Blows his nose.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       ...except that we could help each other.

             Will stares at him.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       So.  We're at an impasse.

             Will runs his hands through his hair.  Half-crazed.  Heart
             pounding.  Turns to watch...

             THE KIDS down the glacier.  Making angels in the snow.  Their
             GIGGLES carried along by the wind.

             Will, squeezes his eyes shut.  Trapped.  About to defy every
             instinct in his body.

                                 WILL
                           (sotto)
                       You're going to get a phone call.

             Walter steps up, tapping his hearing aid.

                                 WALTER
                       I'm sorry?

                                 WILL
                       I said you're going to get a phone call.

                                 WALTER 
                           (perks up)
                       Oh?

                                 WILL
                       Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of
                       your books.

                                 WALTER
                       Thought you might find that.

                                 WILL
                       You're going to be brought in for
                       questioning.

             Walter smiles.  Pleased.

                                 WALTER
                       Down at the station?

                                 WILL
                           (hisses)
                       Yes down at the station.

             Walter rubs his hands together.  Thinking.

                                 WALTER
                       Okay.  Okay.  Brought in for questioning.
                       Good.  I can write this.

             JUST THEN the ferry blows its HORN.  Low and loud.  Walter
             looks down at it.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       Ferry's leaving.

             He starts down.  Will watches him pass, has no choice but to
             follow.  Walter, going over the details in his head.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       Something to divert...

             Snaps his fingers.  An idea.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       My gun.  You still have my gun, right?

             Will nods.  Walter smiles.  Spreads out his hands.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       Then that's the wild card.  Every
                       detective story has a wild card.

                                 WILL
                       What do you mean, "wild card?"

             TOURISTS.  Boarding the ferry.

                                 WALTER
                       Next ferry's in forty-five minutes.

             Walter heads over to the ramp.  Will stops, grabbing his
             side.  A PANG through his ribs.  Excruciating.  Calls out to
             Walter.

                                 WILL
                       What do you mean "wild card?"

             Walter looks back.  Waves.

                                 WALTER
                       You'll know.  At the questioning.

             Gives his ticket to the TICKET TAKER.  Gets on.  Walks back
             to the stern.  Looks out at Will.  The HORN sounds again.

             Walter, at the rail.  Smiles.  The ferry's engine, churning
             up water.  Starting forward just as...

             Walter takes a MINI CASSETTE RECORDER from his pocket.  Holds
             it up for Will to see.

             Will, on shore, sees it.  A cold flash ripping through his 
             body.  That motherfucker.  Bolts through some tourists
             towards the ramp but...

             A couple of GUYS are just pulling it in.  The Ticket Taker,
             grabs his arm.

                                 TICKET TAKER
                           (to Will)
                       Full up.

             Will, jerks his arm away.  Stares off at the ferry.  Walter
             Byrd and his tape recorder.  Receding into the distance.

             INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHTMUTE - DAY

             CLOSE ON a counter top.  Stuff thrown down.  Aspirin.  Band-
             aids.  Gauze.  Medical tape.  First aid cream.  Back pills.
             Sleeping pills.  Bottle of scotch.

             PULL BACK to reveal Will standing at the counter in the
             convenience store.  His entire body aching.  The CASHIER,
             throws him a look.

                                 WILL
                       I have a cold.

             EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - MINUTES LATER

             Will exits the store.  A bag under his arm.  We Miss You, Kay
             looming over his shoulder.  Steps out onto the sidewalk and
             sees...

             ELLIE leaning against her truck.  Waiting for him.  Smiles.

                                 ELLIE
                       Which way are you walking?

             A tingle, all across Will's body.  Christ.  This girl's
             everywhere!  He hunches into his coat.  Flicks up his collar.
             Doesn't want her to see him fully.  Nods down the road.

                                 WILL
                       Back to the Lodge.

             Ellie grabs her bag.  Joins him.  They start walking.

                                 ELLIE
                       I needed to get your signature on
                       something.

             She pulls a folder from her bag.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       The report on Detective Eckhart.  Chief
                       made me finish it this morning.  Said it
                       was taking too long.

             Will takes the file.  Flips it open.  The death of his
             partner.  Neatly typed.  Neatly stapled.  Pulls out a pen.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       Aren't you going to read it?

                                 WILL
                       I trust you.

             He signs.  Hands it back to her.  She slips it into her bag.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       Now I can help you with the Connell case. 
                       That writer's coming in tomorrow.  Walter
                       Byrd.

             A slight stutter in Will's step.

                                 WILL
                       Duggar called him?

                                 ELLIE
                       About an hour ago.  Said he was more than
                       happy to cooperate.

             Ellie looks over at Will as they cross the street.  Studying
             his face.  His gait.  Noticing the slight limp in his right
             leg.  The cut on his forehead.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       You haven't been sleeping much, have you,
                       Detective Dormer?

             They arrive at the stone steps of the Pioneer Lodge.

                                 WILL
                       Not really.

                                 ELLIE
                       Isn't that the difference between a good
                       cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't
                       sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's
                       missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause
                       his conscience won't let him.
                           (smiles)
                       You said that once, remember?

             Will, finally looks at her.

                                 WILL
                       No.  But it sounds like something I
                       would've said.

             Turns and starts up the steps.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       See you tomorrow, Ellie.

             Ellie, watches him for a second.  Then calls out.

                                 ELLIE
                       Oh!  I forgot to tell you.  The Puffins
                       won.

             Will stops, turns to look back at her.  Confused.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       The baseball game.  Our team...

             Slings the bag over her shoulder.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       ...We won.

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - PIONEER LODGE - LATE NIGHT

             Clock flicks to 3:00 A.M.  Will, pacing in his room.  Shirt
             off.  Rib cage wrapped in a bandage.  Looking through...

             A STACK OF MESSAGES.  All from John Warfield.  He discards
             them one by one.  Can barely focus...

             SUDDENLY the phone RINGS.  He lunges for it.

                                 WILL
                           (grabbing it)
                       Listen to me, you son-of-a-bitch...

             Interrupted by a CLICK...

                                 RECORDED VOICE
                       ...I saw you look right into his eyes
                       and shoot him...

             Walter Byrd's voice.  Recorded from that afternoon.

                                 RECORDED VOICE (cont'd)
                       ...Seattle's great hero.  Shooting his
                       own partner.  I saw it all...

             Will, hears his own voice...

                                 RECORDED VOICE (cont'd)
                       That was an accident!...

                                 WILL
                       Goddammit, Byrd!

             Then, another clumsy CLICK.  Walter Byrd gets on.

                                 WALTER
                       You'd have done the same thing, Will.  I
                       know you would...

             He hangs up.

             Will SLAMS down the receiver.  Then again.  And again.  Yanks
             the cord out of the wall and HURLS the phone across the room.

             EXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - MORNING

             ...The DARK FIGURE.  Disappearing back into the fog.  Closing
             in around him like milky water...

             We whip out our SMITH 39/13...plunge in after him...taking
             chase...BREATHING hard...leaping from rock to rock...the FOG,
             blanket thick...tightening around us...

             Our feet.  Hit water.  Up to our ankles.  Icy cold.  We
             run...sloshing through...when...

             SUDDENLY

             A DARK FIGURE.  Appears ahead.  Big and hulking...CRASHING
             towards us...

             We raise our weapon...quick as a flash...as the FIGURE
             emerges...

             And in a split second...

             WE LOCK EYES WITH FIGURE's - his eyes, brown and gentle...

             CRACK!  We fire!  The FIGURE grips his gut, falls into the
             water.

             Heart POUNDING.  Adrenaline PUMPING.  We slosh towards the
             body.  Something...catching our eye...

             A 357 RUGER

             lying in the rocks.  Off to the side.  We grab it.  Turn back
             to the body...

             And stop cold.

             That's when it hits us.  That's when we realize...

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT

             Will bolts up.  White as a sheet.

                                 WILL
                       I didn't know!

             His body, drenched in sweat.  His breathing, quick and
             ragged.  Caught up in the twisted sheets of his bed.  Looks
             across the room and sees

             HAP

             sitting in the corner.  Eating an apple with a penknife.

                                 HAP
                       You sure about that, buddy?

             He smiles.  Sympathetic.  Looks over at the window just as...

             The BLANKET.  Drops to the floor.  

             LIGHT floods the room.

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:02 A.M.

             With a GRUNT Will puts his back into it.  Shoving the heavy
             oak bureau towards the window.  Sweat beading his face.

             A...few...more...shoves.  And the bureau finally stands in
             front of the window.  WIll stands back to take a look.  Only
             covers half of it.

                                 WILL
                       Fuck!

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:35 A.M.

             Red-faced, Will leans into the wooden armoire.  Shimmying it 
             towards the window...

                                                                   CUT TO:

             EXT. PIONEER LODGE - NIGHT

             Ellie.  Sitting in her truck.  Parked behind the Pioneer
             Lodge.  Rubbbing her eyes.  Sleepy.  Looking up at
   
             WILL'S WINDOW

             concerned.

                                                              CUT BACK TO:

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:35 A.M.

             With one last heave, Will gets the armoire to the window.
             Light still shining through the cracks.

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:50 A.M.

             Will shoving magazines, blankets, sheets, pillows.  Anything.
             To fill the cracks.  To cover the light.  His eyes.  Like a
             crazy man's...

             SUDDENLY a knock on the door.  Will turns.

                                 RACHEL (O.S.)
                       Detective Dormer?

             INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

             Rachel standing out in the hallway.  Will opens the door.

                                 RACHEL
                           (startled by his appearance)
                       Will...I...

                                 WILL
                       What is it?

                                 RACHEL
                       There's a guy down the hall.  Complaining
                       about the noise.
                           (beat)
                       Says he can't sleep.

             Will gives a half-smile.  Fucking irony.  Heads back into...

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

             ...his room.  Rachel follows.  Looks around at the mess.

                                 RACHEL
                       Are you alright?

             Will grabs up a sweater.

                                 WILL
                       I'm fine.

             He heads back over to the window.  Rachel now notices all the
             stuff piled up.  Softens her voice.

                                 RACHEL
                       Did something happen?

             Will.  Cramming the sweater into a crack.

                                 WILL
                       No.

             Rachel walks up behind him.  His cramming, more desperate.
             More urgent.

                                 RACHEL
                       Will...

             He grabs a magazine.

                                 WILL
                       The light.  It keeps coming in...

             Rachel reaches out.  Catches his arm.

                                 RACHEL
                       Will.

             He stops.  Looks down at her hand.

                                 RACHEL (cont'd)
                       What happened?

             Will suddenly realises what he's doing.  Absurd.  Pathetic. 
             Pitiful.  Slowly turns to face Rachel.

             Her eyes, looking up at him.  His shoulders droop.
             Exhausted.  Rachel reaches up.  Catches him in her arms.
             Strong arms.  Caring.  Will buries his face in her neck.
             Wants to be swallowed up.

             Rachel holds him.  Arms encircling.  Will breathes her in.
             Sweet, soft, safe.

             Looks up.  His mouth suddenly finding hers.  A kiss, hungry,
             urgent.  His arms move to surround her.

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - LATER

             Will and Rachel in bed.  Spooning.  Rachel behind will, her
             finger tracing his scar.  Rain DRUMS against the window.

             Will.  Watching the raindrops streaming down the glass.
             Casting strange shadows against the wall.

                                 WILL
                       There was this guy named Weston Dobbs.
                       Twenty-four.  Worked as a part-time stock
                       boy in a copy store.  Every morning he'd
                       sit at the only window in his apartment
                       and watch an eight year-old boy get
                       picked up by his carpool across the
                       street.  And every afternoon he'd watch
                       the boy get dropped off again.  He did
                       this for about six months.  Until one day
                       he got up the nerve to cross the street
                       and grab the boy before his carpool came.
                       Kept him in his apartment for three days.
                       Tortured him.  Raped him.  Made him do
                       things...

             Will tenses his jaw.  Rachel, listens in horror.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       When he was done, he got a rope and a
                       kitchen stool and hanged the boy in the
                       basement of the apartment building.  But
                       he didn't do a good enough job.  The
                       little boy's neck didn't break and he
                       died from shock.  The landlord found him
                       five days later.

             Rachel reaches for Will's hand.  Squeezes it.

                                 RACHEL
                       One of your cases?

                                 WILL
                       Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I
                       knew the second I met Dobbs that he was
                       guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had
                       circumstantial evidence, but nothing to
                       tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went
                       over every inch of that apartment.

             He pauses.

                                 RACHEL
                       What happened?

             Will turns slowly over to face her.  Her hair, splayed out on
             the pillow.  Her cheeks, flushed.  Her eyes, listening.

                                 WILL
                       We took some blood samples from the boy's
                       body and planted them in his apartment.
                           (beat)
                       Arrested him the next day.

             Rachel looks at him.  Goose pimples on her arms.  Realising
             the weight of the confession.

                                 RACHEL
                       Will.

                                 WILL
                       There've been other cases.  Where we've
                       changed results.  Pushed witnesses.
                       Manipulated evidence.
                           (rubs his face)
                       But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than
                       anything.

             He sits up.  Abrupt.  Wincing from the pain in his ribs.
             Rests his arms on his knees.

                                 RACHEL
                       What if someone finds out?

                                 WILL
                       We're under investigation now.  Back in
                       Seattle.
                           (beat)
                       Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got
                       back.  Thought he could work out some
                       kind of deal.

             Rachel rubs his shoulder.

                                 RACHEL
                       Well, that's not going to happen now.

             Will closes his eyes.  The rain, PATTERING.  Rhythmic.

                                 WILL
                       Do you think it was wrong?  What we did?

             There's a PAUSE.  Rachel, studying Will's back.  The cuts.
             The bruises.  Not sure how to answer.

                                 RACHEL
                       There are two kinds of people in Alaska. 
                       Those who were born here and those who've
                       come here to escape something in their
                       lives.
                           (beat)
                       I wasn't born here, Will.  I'm in no
                       position to judge anyone.  I'm not about
                       that any more.

             Looks out the window.

                                 RACHEL (cont'd)
                       It's all about what you're willing to
                       live with.

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - MORNING

             The clock reads 6:00.  Will pulls on his trousers.  Goes to
             strap on his Smith 39/13 holster.  Grimaces with pain.  Looks
             at his back in the full-length mirror.  BLACK BRUISES seeping
             out from under his bandage.

             Puts the 39/13 and holster in the top drawer of the bureau.
             Turns and looks down at Rachel.  Sleeping soundly.

                                 FRED (O.S.)
                       You were acquainted with the deceased,
                       Kay Connell?

             INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

             Will in the interrogation room.  Standing by the window.
             Tensed jaw.

                                 WALTER (O.S.)
                       Yes I was.

             WALTER BYRD

             sits at the table.  Hair combed, wet.  Shirt newly starched.
             A Styrofoam cup of coffee in front of him.  Playing the part.

             Fred sits opposite him.  Report file open.  Ellie, next to
             Fred.  Taking notes.  She's combed her hair, too.

                                 FRED
                       In what manner?

             Walter smiles modestly.  Looks over at Ellie.

                                 WALTER
                       She was, not quite a "fan."  More an avid
                       reader of my detective novels.

                                 ELLIE
                       When did you first meet her?

             Fred shoots Ellie a look.  She closes her mouth.

                                 WALTER
                       A year ago.  At one of my signings.

             Ellie hands Fred the hardback of Otherwise Engaged.  He holds
             it up.  Opened to the signature.

                                 FRED
                       Where you signed this?

                                 WALTER
                       That's right.

                                 FRED
                       What happened at that signing?

                                 WALTER
                       She flattered me about my writing.  Asked
                       if she could visit me.  To talk about my
                       books.

                                 FRED
                       Did she?

                                 WALTER
                       Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then
                       she became more comfortable.  Started 
                       visiting me every week...

             Will, from over by the window.  Interrupts.

                                 WILL
                       What was the nature of your relationship?

             Walter looks over.  Wide-eyed.

                                 WALTER
                       What do you mean, Detective Dormer?

             Will turns.  Accusatory.

                                 WILL
                       She was an attractive girl.  Did you have
                       sex with her?

             Walter blinks.

                                 WALTER
                       She was only seventeen.

                                 WILL
                       But she was an attractive girl.
 
                                 WALTER
                       I suppose.

                                 WILL
                       Did you have sex with her?

             Fred shoots Will a look.  Ellie, watching him.

                                 WALTER
                       No.

                                 WILL
                       But you wanted to.

                                 WALTER
                       I was a mentor to her.

             Will heads over to Walter's chair.  Fists clenched in his
             pockets.

                                 WILL
                       You gave her gifts.

                                 WALTER
                       Yes.

                                 WILL
                       Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.

                                 WALTER
                       Yes.

                                 WILL
                       Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.

                                 WALTER
                       I gave her things she didn't have.
                       Couldn't have.

             He turns to Fred and Ellie.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       Her family lives on Mr. Connell's
                       disability.  It isn't much.

             Fred stops Will with a look.  Had enough.

                                 FRED
                       We understand, Mr. Byrd.
                           (to Will)
                       You want to sit down, Detective?

             Tense BEAT.  Will stares at Walter.  Revulsion.  Heads back
             over to the window.

                                 WALTER
                       She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk
                       to.

                                 FRED
                       How do you mean?

                                 WALTER
                       That boyfriend.  Randy.

             Fred, sits up.

                                 FRED
                       Randy Stetz?

                                 WALTER
                       That's right.

                                 WILL
                       What about him?

                                 WALTER
                       He.  Well, he...

             Walter hesitates.  Takes a sip of coffee.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       I don't want to talk out of school.  Kay
                       told me things in the strictest of
                       confidence.  As a friend.

                                 FRED
                       Mr. Byrd.  Anything you can tell us could
                       help out with this case.

             Walter furrows his brow.  Taps his hearing aid.

                                 WALTER
                       Well.  He hit her.

             Ellie's eyes widen.  Fred glances at Will.  But Will's too
             busy watching this little man weave his web.

                                 FRED
                       Are you sure about that?

                                 WALTER
                       She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle
                       of the night.  Bruises all over her back,
                       her upper arms.  I pled with her to let
                       me call the police, but she wouldn't hear
                       it.  Wanted to keep it a secret.

                                 ELLIE
                       Randy Stetz beat Kay Connell?

                                 FRED
                           (angry)
                       Ellie.

             Walter looks right at her.

                                 WALTER
                       He has a terrible rage.  Kay even said he
                       carried a handgun around with him.

             Fred stands.  This is big.  Calls out the door.

                                 FRED
                       Margaret!  Get Judge Biggs on the phone!
                           (to Will)
                       I'll get another warrant for Stetz's
                       place.

             Walter takes a sip of his coffee.  Cup's empty.  Holds it out
             to Ellie.  Smiles.

                                 WALTER
                       Could I have some more coffee, Detective
                       Burr?

             Ellie nods, takes the cup.  Heads over to the coffee machine.
             Fred turns back to the door...

             AND AT THAT MOMENT Walter levels a look right at Will.

             Mouths the words Wild Card.

             A shiver down Will's spine.  Wild card.  The gun.  Randy.

             ELLIE

             over at the coffee machine.  Pouring coffee.  Glances up at
             the window.  Catches the reflection of the two men.

             An intense look between them.

             EXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - DAY

             CLOSE ON a BOOT.  Jumping down onto a black rock.

             PULL BACK to reveal Ellie walking out on the beach.  Heading
             down towards the water.  Thinking.

             INT. RANDY STETZ'S ROOM - NIGHTMUTE - DAY

             A dark, narrow boarding room.  A HAND reaches through an open
             window.  Feels for the lock on the door.  CLICK.

             Will enters Randy Stetz's place.  Cigarette butts, electric
             guitar, Hustler centerfolds tacked on the walls.

             He looks around.  Every inch of him revolting against what
             he's about to do.

             EXT. ROCKY BEACH - CONTINUOUS

             The sound of waves.  A slight breeze.  Ellie walking along
             the water.

             Looking down.  Brow furrowed.  Stops and puts her hands on
             her hips.

             INT. RANDY STETZ'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

             Will heads over to a hanging sheet on the other side of the
             room.  Pulls it aside.  A MOTORBIKE being repaired.  Parts
             and tools all over the place.

             Pulls the 357 Ruger from his pocket with a handkerchief.
             Spots a COFFEE CAN on a shelf.  Filled with thick oil.

             EXT. ROCKY BEACH - CONTINUOUS

             Something catches Ellie's eye.  GLINTING from between the
             rocks.  She bends down.  Pulls a pencil from her backpack.
             Spears something and holds it up.

             A SHELL CASING.

             INT. RANDY STETZ'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
 
             Will, drops the 357 into the oil.  Turns and heads back
             across the room.  Hesitates.  At the door.  Turns back.
             Looking at the oil can.  Takes a step back towards it when he
             hears...

             The sound of a SQUAD CAR.  Pulling up outside.

             Too late.

             EXT. RANDY STETZ'S ROOM - LATER

             Will stands just outside the doorway into Randy's room.
             UNIFORMED OFFICERS inside searching the place.  Tearing down
             pictures.  Turning out doors.  Ripping up carpet.  Randy's
             voice.  In protest.

                                 RANDY (O.S.)
                       You can't fucking do this!

             Will hears some SCUFFLING.  The sheet being pulled down.  The
             CLATTER of tools.

                                 RANDY (O.S.)
                       Hey!  I'm working on that!

             Parts pulled off the shelves.  The bike, shoved to the side.
             Then.  A SILENCE.  Followed by...

                                 OFFICER (O.S.)
                       Found something.

             Will shuts his eyes.  Heavy FOOTSTEPS head over to the bike.
             Someone's pulled the gun from the can.

                                 RANDY (O.S.)
                       What the fuck is that!

             Fred's voice, calm.

                                 FRED (O.S.)
                       That's it.  Let's bag it.

             More FOOTSTEPS.  Randy, desperate.

                                 RANDY (O.S.)
                       That's not mine, man!  That's not mine!

             Will opens his eyes.  Fred's voice.  Almost sympathetic.

                                 FRED (O.S.)
                       Randy...

                                 RANDY (O.S.)
                       No way, man!

             More SCUFFLING.  A chair knocked over.  Something SMASHES.
             Will looks down at the floor as

             FRED AND A UNIFORMED COP struggle to drag Randy through the
             doorway.  Randy writhes, kicks, tugs.  Screams.

                                 RANDY (cont'd)
                       That ain't mine!

             Fred grabs Randy's shoulder.

                                 FRED
                       C'mon, Randy.

             Randy squirms.  Turns.  Looks right into Will's eyes.  Gone
             is the bluster.  Gone is the attitude.  Randy Stetz, lost
             kid.  Tears streaming down his face.

                                 RANDY
                       I swear to God.  I didn't kill her.  I 
                       swear to God...

             EXT. GARAGE APARTMENT - DAY

             Will stands outside the garage apartment.  Wind whipping his
             coat.  Watches as a Nightmute PD SQUAD CAR pulls off with
             Randy Stetz in the back.

             Fred sees him, heads over.

                                 FRED
                       You look like shit, cowboy.

             Will shifts his eyes to him.

                                 WILL
                       That's an understatement.

             Fred half-smiles.  Watches the receding squad car.

                                 FRED
                       Looks like we can wrap this one up.

             Will barely nods.  Fred pulls his baseball cap on.

                                 FRED (cont'd)
                       We're getting together for a couple of
                       beers later on.  Might not be the Seattle
                       thing to do.  But you're welcome to come.

             Fred puts out his hand to shake.  Truce.  Will looks at him.
             Takes it.

             INT. SHANTY BAR - NIGHTMUTE - NIGHT

             CLOSE ON a tray of dark beer.  Five glasses, foam sloshing.

                                 FARRELL (O.S.)
                       I can't believe it.  Randy Stetz.

             PULL BACK to reveal Farrell, Rich, Francis, and Will sitting
             at a small, round table.  Fred's passing out the beers.  Dive
             bar.  MUSIC blaring.  3 a.m. Happy Hour! banner on the wall.
             Place packed with rough-looking FISHERMEN.

             Rich takes a glass from Fred.

                                 RICH
                       What do you mean, you can't believe it?

                                 FRANCIS
                       He was an asshole.

                                 FARRELL
                       That doesn't mean anything.

             Fred sits.  Takes a sip of his beer.  To Farrell.

                                 FRED
                       Didn't you grow up with him?

             Farrell shifts in his seat.

                                 FARRELL
                       Our dads were on the same boat.
                           (to Will)
                       We used to wait for them together.

             Will nods.  Jostled by the crowd.  Reaches for his beer.

                                 FRANCIS
                       He used to pick fights at the gas
                       station.

                                 RICH
                       And remember when he did all those donut
                       holes that one summer?

             He and Francis GUFFAW.

                                 FRED
                       Just a bad seed.

             Farrell looks over at Will.

                                 FARRELL
                       How do you like our beer?

             Will slams down his empty glass.  Squeezes his eyes open and
             shut.  Loud music.  Cigarette smoke.

                                 WILL
                       I like it fine.

             Fred pats Will's shoulder.

                                 FRED
                       What Detective Dormer needs is a little
                       shut-eye.

                                 RICH
                       The white nights been hard on you?

                                 WILL
                       They haven't been easy.

             Francis grabs a handful of peanuts.

                                 FRANCIS
                       They don't have titanium shades over at
                       the Pioneer.

                                 RICH
                       Well no wonder.

                                 FRANCIS
                       You lose all sense of time.

                                 FARRELL
                       Better than Fred's home town.

             Will turns to Fred.  Wiping the foam from his moustache.

                                 FRED
                       My people are from Barrow.  Way up north.

                                 RICH
                       In the winter there's no sunlight for
                       five straight months.

                                 FRED
                       Like being swallowed up in a black hole.

             JUST THEN.

                                 ELLIE (O.S.)
                       Hi, guys.

             They look up.  Ellie standing by their table.  Jeans, down
             vest.  Hair tousled.

                                 FRED
                       Nancy Drew!  Pull up a seat!

                                 FRANCIS
                       You hear what happened, Ellie?

                                 ELLIE
                       Yeah.

                                 RICH
                       Pretty cool.

                                 FARRELL
                       Rich found the gun.

                                 ELLIE
                       I know.  I heard.

             Fred leans back in his seat.  Eyeballs Ellie.

                                 FRED
                       Something's on Nancy's mind.

             Ellie reaches into her vest pocket.  Pulls out a Ziploc with
             the SHELL CASING inside.

                                 ELLIE
                       I found this out on the beach.

                                 FARRELL
                       What is it?

                                 ELLIE
                       Shell casing.  9mm.

             Will, blanches.

                                 FRANCIS
                       Let it go, Ell.  We got the bad guy.

                                 ELLIE
                       None of us carries a 9mm duty weapon.
                       And the murder weapon was a 357.

             Rich throws peanut shells at her.

                                 RICH
                       Get a hobby, will ya?

             Ellie brushes off the shells.  Looks right at Will.

                                 ELLIE
                       It's a legitimate point, isn't it,
                       Detective Dormer?

             Everyone turns to Will.  Their faces, spinning.  He nods.

                                 WILL
                       It's legitimate.

                                 ELLIE
                       Worth pursuing?

             He looks up.  Holds her gaze.  Then turns away.  Grabs the
             side of the table.

                                 WILL
                       The case is closed, Ellie.
                           (gets up)
                       I got the next round.

             The guys don't protest.  Will starts heading for the bar.
             Weaving through broad shoulders, massive backs.  Smoke.
             MUSIC.  Laughter.  Arguing.  A mass of bodies and sound.
             Like being swallowed up in a black hole...

             Looks back at the table.
 
             Ellie, watching him.

             EXT. ELLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

             Ellie's truck pulls up in front of a small house.  She jumps
             out.  

             INT. FRONT HALLWAY - HOUSE - NIGHT

             SLAM!  Ellie heads through the front door like a gust of
             wind.  Thunders up the stairs.  Calls out.

                                 ELLIE
                       Me, Pop!

             We hear the TV in the other room.  An older MAN, Ellie's
             father, appears in the doorway.  Thick glasses, grey stubble,
             big paunch.  Wearing a flannel robe.

                                 ELLIE'S DAD
                       Ellie?  You okay?

             Ellie appears at the top of the stairs.

                                 ELLIE
                       Where's all my academy stuff?

             INT. BASEMENT

             Pitch black, then, CLICK! as a bare lightbulb's switched on.
             Ellie stands beneath it.  Piles of crap everywhere.

             She steps through the quagmire of old bikes, fans, auto
             parts.  Over to a stack of cardboard BOXES in the corner.

             She nudges through them, reading the writing on the tops.  In
             thick black pen.  Shoves a couple aside.

             Then.  Finds what she's looking for.  Pulls down a box
             marked:  Ellie Acad.  Tears it open.

             INSIDE - piles of papers, polaroids of her and her FRIENDS,
             schedules, syllabi, handbooks.  Stuff from her Academy year.
             At the bottom, a report.  The title:  "Securing the Crime
             Scene," the Leland Street Murders.  By Eleanor P. Burr.

             Ellie pulls it out.  Sits down on an old stool.  Opens to the
             middle of the report.  Her finger, tracing down the 
             typewritten page.  Flips to the next page.  Then the next.
             The next.  Then.  She spots it.

             THREE-QUARTERS DOWN THE PAGE, her finger finds the
             sentence:...Detective Dormer's unregistered Smith and Wesson
             model 39/13 9mm, to immobilize Langley...

             Ellie looks up.  Chews her bottom lip.

             EXT. MARINERS MEMORIAL - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - DAY

             CLOSE ON a huge wave CRASHING against a retaining wall.
             Spray flying.

             PULL BACK to reveal a small monument by the sea.  A stone
             cupola with a bronze statue underneath.  The sky, black with
             clouds.

             INT. MARINER'S MEMORIAL - CONTINUOUS

             Walter Byrd waits under the Mariner's Memorial.  Wind
             whipping his jacket, the green sea churning behind him.  Next
             to a fifteen-foot statue of a SEAMAN, tall, rugged, tough.
             Holding on to a thick coil of rope.

             Hunches against the wind.  Watches as...
 
             WILL approaches the monument.  Sonics sweatshirt, wrinkled
             coat.  Face drawn and haggard.  Angry.

                                 WALTER
                           (smiles)
                       Hi, Will...

             Will enters the monument.

                                 WILL
                       What the hell are you doing calling me at 
                       the station?

             A gust of wind WHORLS through the monument.

                                 WALTER
                       I figured we should touch base.  Compare
                       notes.  I think it went well.  What did
                       you think?

             Will's eyes pierce into him.

                                 WILL
                       Randy Stetz is in jail.

                                 WALTER
                       Told you I could write an ending.

                                 WILL
                       Congratulations.

             Will holds out his hand.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       The tape.

             Walter looks at the open hand.  Hugs his jacket to him.

                                 WALTER
                       I thought maybe we could talk some more.

                                 WILL
                       There's nothing more to talk about.

                                 WALTER
                       But we work so well together...

             Will breaks.  Rushes Walter.  Slams him against one of the
             concrete pilasters.

                                 WILL
                       We do nothing well together.
                           (SLAMS him again)
                       Nothing!  You understand me?

             Another wave CRASHES.  Sprays them.  Walter looks up into
             Will's bloodshot eyes.

                                 WALTER
                       You run on two settings, Will.  I've 
                       noticed that...

             Will tightens his grip.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       You jump from calm to rage in the blink
                       of an eye.  That's okay.  I do that too.

             He holds up the tape.  Will grabs it, shoves Walter to the
             side.  Yanks the tape out of the cassette.  Steps back and
             HURLS it into the sea.  Waves engulf it hungrily.

             Walter watches him.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       You're not sleeping, are you?

                                 WILL
                       What the hell do you know?

                                 WALTER
                       Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know.   
                       Tells me things.  About you.  About me.

             PAUSE.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       Does Detective Eckhart come to you?

             Will curls his fists.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       Does he ask you why you shot him?

             Whips around...

                                 WILL 
                       I told you that was an accident!

                                 WALTER
                       Then so was mine...

                                 WILL
                       Don't you pull that shit with me.

                                 WALTER
                       I didn't want to kill her, Will.

             Steps closer to him.  Beseeching.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       When she called me that night from the
                       party, she'd had a fight with Randy.
                       Wanted to talk.  I told her to meet me at
                       our special place.  The cabin at the
                       beach...

             A couple RAVENS alight nearby.  Flapping their wings.
             SCREECHING into the wind.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       ...When she came she was barefoot.  And
                       there was liquor on her breath.  I only
                       wanted to comfort her.  To touch her.
                       She could have at least let me do that.
                       Her skin...it was like everything I'd
                       ever written about.

             A dark shadow crosses his face.  Holds on to the coiled rope
             of the statue.  Will hisses.

                                 WILL
                       Couldn't get it up, Walter?

                                 WALTER
                       It was when I went to kiss her.  She
                       started laughing.  I got angry.  After
                       all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with
                       her.  I just wanted to make her stop.
                       That's all.

             Walter.  Squeezing the bronze rope.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       From calm to rage in the blink of an eye.

             Locks eyes with Will.  Conspiratorial.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       Remember?

             WILL'S HAND shoots out.  Clamps around Walter's neck.

                                 WILL
                       Like this?

             Walter's face, starts turning red.

                                 WALTER
                       Yes.  Like that.

                                 WILL
                       This an accident, Walter?

                                 WALTER
                       If you want it to be...

             Will looks deep into Walter's eyes.  Squeezing harder.  Pure
             hatred.

                                 WILL
                       It took ten minutes to beat Kay Connell
                       to death.  Ten minutes.

             Their eyes, locked.  Veins, popping along Walter's temples.
             Lip quivering...

             JUST THEN a BELL sounds in the distance.  Will looks up.

             A LINE OF FISHING BOATS coming back in.

             Will, looks back at Walter.  Throws him to the ground.
             Sickened.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Get the fuck out of town, Byrd.  Leave
                       and never come back.

             Walter COUGHS.  Holding his neck.  Enjoying this.

                                 WALTER
                       I have a summer house up by Kgun Lake.
                       I'm going to write my next novel there.
                       It's about a famous detective who goes
                       bad.

             Will shoots him a look.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       Just kidding.

             He pulls himself to his feet.  A little unsteady.  Takes out
             a handkerchief.  Dabs his forehead.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       The never coming back part, though.  I'm
                       not sure.  To tell you the truth this has
                       been kind of fun.  Going to the station,
                       meeting all those nice people.  Talking
                       with you.

             He shrugs.  Walks past Will.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       I might miss it.

             Will turns.  Watches him walk away.  Walter hesitates.  Turns
             back.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       I especially like that new detective.

             Will looks at him.  Back straightening.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       Detective Burr.
                           (smiles)
                       I liked her very much.  Has a real
                       vitality.

             Will's stomach jumps.  Walter turns back.  Continues on.

             The little man in a beige windbreaker.

             INT. CHIEF CHARLES NYBACK'S OFFICE - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY

             CLOSE ON a HAND.  Signing the bottom of a form.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (O.S.)
                       I was hoping not to send you back with so
                       much paperwork, Will.

             PULL BACK to reveal Chief Nyback sitting at his desk.  Will
             stands before him.  Signing papers.  A bottle of bourbon on
             the desk.  Some paper cups half filled.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
                       When are you taking off?

             Will checks his watch.

                                 WILL
                       Six-thirty.

             Fred, standing over by the filing cabinet.  Toothpick in his
             mouth.

                                 FRED
                       If Spencer's not too drunk to fly.

             Nyback chuckles.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       Can't talk you into staying for a couple of
                       days?  Do some fishing?  Show you what
                       normally goes on around here.

             Will shakes his head.

                                 WILL
                       I have to get back.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       Too bad...

             Looks over at Fred picking his teeth.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
                       ...Brought some real class to the place.
                       But, Seattle needs its hero back.
                           (stands)
                       Couldn't have done it without you, Will.

             Will caps the pen.  Uncomfortable.  Nods towards Fred.

                                 WILL
                       Had a lot of help from Nightmute's 
                       finest.

             JUST THEN the door swings open.  They look over as

             ELLIE hurries in.  She smiles.  Looks tired.

                                 ELLIE
                       Didn't want to miss anything.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few
                       hours.

                                 ELLIE
                       Good.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.

                                 ELLIE
                       Sure.

             An awkward beat.  Ellie walks over to Will.  Looks up.
             Suddenly throws her arms around him.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       I thought what you did on this case was
                       amazing.

             Will holds his hands out.  Not sure what to do.  Looks down
             at the top of Ellie's head.

             ELLIE'S HAND

             slips down his back.  Feeling for a holster.  For that 39/13.
             Nothing.  She breaks away.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       We're really going to miss you around
                       here.

             She and Will lock eyes.  Hold for a beat.

             He knows exactly what she was trying to do.

             INT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - NIGHTMUTE - DAY

             Will, driving down Nightmute's main street.  He takes a left.
             Goes up a hill.  Glances out the window.  Passing by

             THE CEMETERY.  A cluster of headstones.  Something catches
             his eye.  He stops the car.

             EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHTMUTE - DAY

             Will, walking up to the wrought-iron gate surrounding the
             cemetery.  Stops.  Puts his hands up to the bars.

             KAY CONNELL'S GRAVE

             on the other side.  Newly dug.  A mound of dirt.  Flowers,
             scattered by the wind.  Daughter and Friend...1982-1999.

             Will.  Grips the bars.  As if he's seeing it for the first
             time.  Really seeing it.

             Closes his eyes.
 
             What have I done?

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - PIONEER LODGE - EVENING
 
             Will's REFLECTION in the mirror.  He's showered.  Hair's
             combed.  Put on a clean suit.  Steps back.  Smooths down his
             lapels.  Just right.

             Turns to face the room.  Bed's made, mess cleaned up.  He
             heads over to the bureau, pulls out his Smith 39/13.  Lays it
             on the bed.

             Unclips his badge from his belt.  Lays it on the bed.  Takes
             something from the bedside table.  The BULLET found in Hap
             Eckhart.  Lays it on the bed.

             All neat.  All ordered.

             Reaches under the mattress.  Pulls out the PHOTOGRAPH of a
             blurry Walter Byrd standing in front of a house.  A radio
             tower in the background.  The call numbers: WKOZ.

             Will studies it.  Tears it in half.

             INT. BACK ROOM - PIONEER LODGE - EVENING

             Rachel in the back room behind reception.  A pullman's
             kitchen, a desk, an old recliner.  Pouring some milk into a
             bowl for a CAT.  A stray.

             Will walks in.  Rachel turns, smiles.

                                 RACHEL
                       I found a new friend.

             Will walks up to her.  Puts his arms around her.  Holds her,
             smells her, kisses her neck.  Pulls away.  Looks into her
             eyes.

                                 RACHEL (cont'd)
                       Will.  What is it?

             He doesn't answer.  The cat, rubs against his leg.  PURRING.

             INT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - EVENING

             Will driving along a forest road.  Eyes dead ahead.  A map on
             the passenger seat.  By the fold, Kgun Lake circled in pencil.

             INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - CONTINUOUS

             Ellie working at her desk.  Looks up at the clock: 6:00.
             Gets up, grabs her down vest.  Heads for the door.  Farrell
             sticks the tip of his crutch in her path.  She stumbles.

                                 ELLIE
                       Very funny, Farrell...

             EXT. ROAD TO KGUN LAKE - EVENING

             AERIAL VIEW of the silver Jeep Cherokee.  The only car on the
             road.  The sky, white-grey.  The trees, a blanket of green.
             The Cherokee heads around a hairpin curve.

             INT. LOBBY - PIONEER LODGE - EVENING

             Rachel at reception.  Reading the paper.  Ellie walks in.

                       Hi, Rachel.

             INT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - ROAD TO KGUN LAKE - EVENING

             Will, scanning the treeline.  Takes a left fork then stops.
             Thought he saw something.  Grinds the gear, backs up.  Takes
             another look.

             IN THE DISTANCE, a radio tower.  WKOZ.
 
             INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE WILL'S ROOM - EVENING

             Rachel and Ellie, standing outside Will's room.  Ellie knocks
             again.

                                 RACHEL
                       I would have seen if he came back.

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - PIONEER LODGE - EVENING

             The CLICK of a key and the door opens.  Ellie strides in.

                                 ELLIE
                       Detective Dormer?

             She stops.  Rachel behind her.  Taking in the strange feeling
             in the room.  Walks over to the bed.  Eyes riveted on the
             39/13.  On the bullet.  Rachel, behind her.

                                 RACHEL
                       What is all this?

             Ellie, her mind races.  Notices TORN PHOTOGRAPH PIECES in the
             trash can.  Reaches in and pulls some out.  A puzzle.

             INT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - LAKE KGUN

             Will stops the car at the end of a narrow dirt driveway.
             Looming before him...

             A HOUSE right on the lake.  Tall, wooden, in disrepair.
             Chipping yellow paint.  A ghost of what it once was.  The
             house from the photograph.  

             INT. STUDY - HOUSE

             The CLANG of electric typewriter keys bang out a title:
             BLINK OF AN EYE, by Walter By

             WALTER BYRD hunched at his typewriter.  In an old study.
             Books stacked everywhere.  Light patches on the walls where
             pictures used to hang.

             BARKING outside.  Walter cocks his head.  Gets up.  Walks
             over to the window.  

             OUTSIDE.  Will walking up to the house.  Lucy and Desi
             jumping around him.

             INT. LIVING ROOM - SUMMER HOUSE

             Will opens the screen door with a CREAK.  Steps into the
             living room.

             Recoils from the smell.  Flies BUZZING.  Yellow plastic
             covering the sofas.  Boxes, books, papers, pictures piled
             high everywhere.  Wallpaper faded, peeling.

             Everything, decaying.

             INT./EXT. ELLIE'S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

             Ellie ripping along the forest road in her truck.  Gripping
             the wheel.  The photograph pieces, taped together on the
             passenger seat.

             INT. SUMMER HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

             Will heads down a hallway.  Dark, narrow, floorboards worn.
             More shit stacked up.

             Each step, careful, quiet.  Tracking.  Listening.  A BREEZE
             sweeps through.  The burned-out lightbulb hanging from the 
             ceiling, starts swinging.

                                 WALTER (O.S.)
                       Here to visit me?

             Will whips around.

             WALTER standing there.  At the other end of the hallway.
             Shoulders slumped.

             Will shakes his head.

                                 WILL
                       No.

             FLIES, bouncing against the screen door.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       I'm here to end this.

             Walter looks around.

                                 WALTER
                       Where's your back-up?

                                 WILL
                       No back-up.

                                 WALTER
                       You're not following procedure.

                                 WILL
                       Procedure went out the window a long time
                       ago.

             Walter looks at him.

                                 WALTER
                       We're on the same side, Will.  You know
                       that.  After what we've been through
                       together.  We're partners.  Bound by a
                       secret.

             Will takes a step forward...

                                 WILL
                       That's where you're wrong, Walter.

             Slowly reaches into his jacket...

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       There is no secret.  Because the biggest
                       difference between you and me is what we
                       will or will not live with...

             Pulls out his SMITH AND WESSON.  Walter.  Looks at the gun.
             Inches back.

                                 WALTER 
                       Will...

             SUDDENLY, darts out of sight.  Swings back into the doorway
             with a SHOTGUN...

             BAM!  Will's shoulder explodes with blood.

             EXT. DRIVEWAY - SUMMER HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

             Ellie, jumping out of her truck.  Hears the sound.  Looks up
             at the big, yellow house.  Pulls out her Glock 40.

             INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

             Walter walking down the hall.  Will, writhing on the floor,
             reaches for his back holster...gun's not there!

             Walter stands over him.  Swings his leg back and...CRACK!
             Kicks will in the ribs.  The pain, blinding.  Will GASPS.

             CRACK! again, CRACK! again, CRACK! again.  Walter's face.
             Calm, flushed.  A vein along his temple.  

             Will's eyes flutter.  Blood, spewing from his lips.  A THUD!
             to his kidneys.  Walter stops, out of breath.  Hand on hip.

                                 WALTER
                       You give the police a bad name, Will.

             WILL'S HAND suddenly shoots out.  Grabs the shotgun barrel.

             WALTER stumbles back.  The shotgun goes off.  BAM!  Chunks of
             ceiling rain down.  Walter falls to the ground.

             EXT. SUMMER HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

             Ellie, heart POUNDING.  Kicks the front door open...

             INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

             Will, covered in dry wall, struggling to his feet.  Reaches
             for his Smith and Wesson.

             WALTER'S DESERT BOOT kicks it out of the way.  It SKITTERS
             down the hall.

             Walter grabs his shotgun.  Scrambles to his feet.  Runs down
             to the end of the hall.  Ducks into...

             INT. LIBRARY

             ...the library.  Dirty shelves, strings of dust.  Endless
             books.  He races over to a cabinet.  Yanks open a DRAWER...

             INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

             Will, on his feet, trying to focus.  His suit, soaked with
             blood.  Looking for his gun.  Spots it, in the corner...

             INT. LIBRARY

             Walter jerks open another drawer.  A STACK OF BOOKS teeter on
             the top of the cabinet.  He finds what he needs.  SHELLS.
             Grabs a handful...

             THE BOOKS tumble down on top of him.  He CRIES out, covering
             his head...touches his ear, panics - hearing aid's gone!
             Looks up.  Will, coming down the hall...

             INT. HALLWAY

             Will hobbles into the library.  Sweeps the room with this gun.
             No Walter.

             Steps on something, crushing it.  Looks down.  Walter's
             hearing aid.  Kicks it aside.

             INT. FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS
    
             Ellie.  In the front hall.  Following procedure.  Right hand
             gripping the gun.  Left supporting the butt.

             Blinks away sweat.  Facing three doorways.

             INT. DINING ROOM

             Will limps into the dining room.  Furniture stacked high.
             Eyes, darting.  Gun, covering.  Trying to stay conscious...

             BANG!  The screen door.

             INT. FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS

             Ellie.  Gun swinging.  Doorway one.  Doorway two.  Doorway 
             three...SUDDENLY

             A FIGURE

             runs past number one.  Big.  Shadowy.  The flash of a GUN.
             She wheels toward it.  Finger on the trigger...

             SLO-MO...The FIGURE, passing.  Her heart, POUNDING.  Her
             finger...squeezing...

             Will Dormer or Walter Byrd?

             At the last second, she jerks the gun away.  The figure 
             disappears.  She swallows.  Gripping the gun.  Follows.
  
             EXT. BACK YARD - SUMMER HOUSE

             The sky, heavy with clouds.  The air, foreboding.  Will
             steals out the screen door.  Gun cocked.  Eyes scanning.
             Wind, bending the weeds, the trees.

             BAM! a shot.  Out of nowhere.  Rips into his thigh.  Will
             CRIES out.  BAM! a second shot.  Whizzes past him...

             INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

             ...CRACK! the shot bites into the window frame.  Wings Ellie
             halfway across the room.  She drops to the floor.  Clutching
             her shoulder.  Flesh wound.

                                 ELLIE
                       Shit!

             Pulls herself over to a SIDEBOARD for cover.  Shrinks behind
             it.  Notices

             A PLASTIC BAG sticking out from one of the drawers.  Nudges
             it open.  A flowered dress, some panty-hose, strands of long
             dark hair...

             EXT. BACK YARD - SUMMER HOUSE

             Will.  On the ground.  Gripping his leg.  Looking wildly
             around.  No sign of Walter.  Then.  He sees it.

             Lucy and Desi.  Down by the boathouse.

             INT. BOATHOUSE

             The boathouse.  Old, rotted wood.  Crumbling beams.

             Walter stands at a window.  Re-loading his shotgun.  He
             fumbles, drops a shell.  It rolls towards a crack in the
             floor.  Falls into the LAKE WATER below.

             CLICK!  Walter levels the shotgun out the window.

             WALTER'S POV - the long, undulating WEEDS outside.

             EXT. WEEDS
   
             Will.  Pulling himself through the weeds.  Losing blood fast.
             Dragging his body.  Approaches the side of the BOATHOUSE.

             WALTER'S GUN BARREL, sticking out.

             Will ducks his head.  Winces in pain.  Breathing, becoming
             ragged.  Rounds to the other side.  Hoists himself up to
             another WINDOW.  Cautiously looks in...

             WALTER at the far window.

             Will jerks back.  Steps on the dock.  A plank CREAKS.  Shit.
             Peers back through the window.  
    
             WALTER.  Still looking out.  Didn't hear a thing.

             Will remembers.  Walter doesn't have his hearing aid.  He's
             deaf on that side.

             INT. BOATHOUSE

             Walter, looking out the window.

             OVER HIS SHOULDER - we see Will climbing in through the
             window.  Smearing blood along the sill, favoring his leg.
             Stands straight.  Levels his gun at Walter's back.

                                 WILL
                           (softly)
                       Walter?

             Nothing.  Walter continues staring out the window.  Will
             raises his voice.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Walter!

             Walter jumps, whips around.  Comes face to face with the 
             barrel of Will Dormer's gun.  Surprised.  Absently touches
             his deaf ear.

                                 WALTER
                       Wild card.

                                 WILL
                       Drop the gun, Walter.

             Walter looks at Will's 45.

                                 WALTER
                       That jammed the last time, remember?

             The men LOCK EYES.  Wind HOWLING through the boathouse.
             Killer and Detective.  Only a bullet separating them.

             WALTER suddenly jerks up his shotgun...

             BANG!  He stumbles back.  Hit in the gut.

             Will's Smith and Wesson, smoking.  No longer jammed.

             Walter, touches the blood.  Looks back at Will.  Staggering.
             CRACK!  The rotting floor gives way beneath him.  He CRIES
             out, falls.  Drops into the icy water below.

             SILENCE.  Will steps over to the hole.  Looks down at
     
             WALTER, floating on his back.  Looking up at him.  Water
             washing over his body.  Eyes, pleading.  Fading.  A wave,
             gently pulls him away.

                                 WILL
                       Another J. Brody mystery.

             EXT. BOATHOUSE

             Will staggers out on to the dock.  Drops his gun.  Crashes to
             his knees.  Falls back.  His face, pale.  Lying against the
             wood of the dock.

             RAIN DROPS.  Start to fall.  Washing the blood from his skin.
             Puckering the lake water.  Will's eyes...flutter...

             FOOTSTEPS...running along the dock.  Heavy boots...

                                 ELLIE (O.S.)
                       Detective Dormer!

             Will squints against the rain.  Makes out the face of

             ELLIE hovering over him.  He gives a half-smile.

                                 WILL
                       God, you're a pain in the ass.

             Ellie kneels down next to him.  Pulls over her vest.  Covers
             him.

                                 ELLIE
                       You're shot.

             Will looks at her bloody shoulder.

                                 WILL
                       You, too.

             Ellie, tearing off her boot.  Yanks off her sock.

                                 ELLIE
                       I'm going to make a tourniquet.

             Will, fading fast.

                                 WILL
                       Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell.  Her
                       things are in the house.

                                 ELLIE
                       I know.

                                 WILL
                       Byrd's dead.

             Ellie, wraps the sock around his leg.  Starts twisting.  Will
             grimaces.  Ellie swallows.  Doesn't want to ask this.

                                 ELLIE
                       You shot Detective Eckhart, didn't you?

             Will nods.

                                 WILL
                       Yes.

             A pained looks crosses Ellie's face.

                                 ELLIE
                       Did you mean to?

             Will shakes his head.

                                 WILL
                       No.  But I covered it up.  I lied.

                                 ELLIE
                       Why?

             RAIN, drumming down around them.  Will, takes a deep breath.

                                 WILL
                       Because I just couldn't be wrong.
                           (looks at her)
                       Don't ever get that way, Ellie.  Don't 
                       ever lose your way.  It blurs the line.

             His blood, pumping out in rivulets.  Ellie looks down at him. 
             Her hero.  Moves up to the wound in his arm.

                                 ELLIE
                       This one looks worse.

             Will reaches up a feeble hand.  Stops her.

                                 WILL
                           (whispers)
                       Just let me sleep, Ellie...

             His eyelids, growing heavy.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Let me sleep.

             Ellie blinks away the tears.  Knows what he means.  What he
             wants.  Watches as the calm spreads over him.

             Will closes his eyes.

                                 ELLIE
                       No!

             Will opens his eyes.  She ties the second sock around his
             arm.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       I will not let you sleep.  If you've lost
                       your way then you have to make it right.
                       That's the only way.  That's what you'd
                       tell me.  I've been a detective for four
                       weeks and I say you're coming with me.

             She gets up.  Slips her arms under his shoulders.  Starts
             hoisting him up.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       C'mon...

             Will.  Struggling to his knees.  Every inch of him, screaming
             in pain.  Gets to his feet.  Arm slung around this tiny,
             young woman.

          SPACE.
                         
          But not the dark lonely corner of it we're used to. This is
          a glittering inferno -- the center of a distant galaxy.
                         
          Suddenly, something TEARS past at incredible speed: a NEUTRON
          STAR. It SMASHES headlong through everything it encounters...
          planets, stars. Can anything stop this juggernaut?
                         
          Yes. Something looms at the heart of the galaxy, hidden
          inside the blinding starlight, a dark flaw in the fabric of
          existence itself: a BLACK HOLE.
                         
          The neutron star is pulled into the black hole's swirl,
          spiraling closer and closer to destruction. Finally, it
          contacts the hole's edge and EXPLODES.
                         
          The EXPLOSION is so powerful that it sends shock waves into
          the fabric of space-time itself. We ride one of these waves,
          racing back out from the black hole.
                         
          Suddenly, a portion of the wave disappears down a crystal-
          like hole, emerging in a much darker region of the universe --
          a backwater that, as the wave races past a giant red planet
          with a distinctive eye, we recognize as our own.
                         
          The wave, now just an infinitesimal ripple, finally reaches
          our blue planet. It drops into our atmosphere over North
          America, toward the high desert east of the Cascades, and
          through the roof of a nondescript warehouse.
                         
          The wave tickles the atoms in the steel shell of a vacuum
          chamber, then dances a tiny jig with a laser beam reflected
          in a heavy piece of glass.
                         
          The wave shoots back out of the building and disappears in
          the fractal branches of a tumbleweed resting against a
          concrete tube that stretches for miles in the desert.
                         
          An SUV speeds past the tumbleweed and we follow it till it
          parks at another plain-looking building at the opposite end
          of the tube. A MAN climbs out of the SUV.
                         
          INT. CONTROL ROOM, WAREHOUSE -- DAY
                         
          The man lets himself into a large room that looks like Mission
          Control. He pours himself a cup of coffee. It is the weekend
          and the place is empty. No one has been there to see the
          displays flashing a distinctive shape -- a pulse followed by
          a series of echoes.
                         
          The man looks up at the screen, then DROPS his cup of coffee.

          INT. LIGO OFFICES, CALTECH, PASADENA -- DAY
                         
          The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory
          headquarters at Caltech is a frenzy of activity. POSTDOCS
          and RESEARCHERS huddle around monitors and printouts, arguing.
                         
          ANSEN, 60s, the director of LIGO, walks through the frenzy.
          A postdoc hands him a printout: a pulse followed by echoes.
                         
          INT. LIGO DIRECTOR'S OFFICE, CALTECH -- DAY
                         
          Ansen steps into the relative calm of a large, sunlit office,
          which overlooks a grassy stretch of Caltech's campus.
                         
          His ASSISTANT, 30s, is on the phone, on hold. He looks up
          at Ansen as he enters.
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           I'm on hold with the INS.
                          (COVERS MICROPHONE)
           Don't you think we should double
           check the triangulation before we
                          CALL ANYBODY-
                         
                          ANSEN
           We have double checked it.
                         
          Someone finally picks up the line.
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           Yes. I'm trying to reach-
           (pause, listens)
           No, I don't think you understand how
           serious this is.
                          (PAUSE)
           Because if you did, we'd be having
           this conversation in person.
                         
          He listens for a moment, then hangs up the phone, confused.
                         
                          ANSEN
           What did they say?
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           They said we should look out the
           window.
                         
          Ansen steps to the window and looks out:
                         
          In the courtyard below, coeds are scrambling to get out of
          the way as a military helicopter sets down in the middle of
          the quad and dozens of ARMED FEDERAL AGENTS converge on his
          building.

          INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM, LIGO, CALTECH -- DAY
                         
          Ansen sits, alone, on one side of a conference table.
                         
          The other side is filled with GOVERNMENT MEN -- NSA mostly,
          some DIA. The door opens and his assistant steps in. Armed
          guards pat him down, then shove him into a seat.
                         
                          ANSEN
           Is that really necessary?
                         
          One of the NSA agents leans forward.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           You've been complaining for years
           that the government doesn't take
           your project seriously enough, Doctor.
                          (SMILES)
           You can't have it both ways.
                         
          Ansen motions to his assistant, who turns on a projector.
          On-screen, we see the familiar pulse and echoes.
                         
                          ANSEN
           Yesterday morning, our facility in
           Hanford identified this signal: a
           neutron star colliding with a
           supermassive black hole. We went
           through the last year's data and
           triangulated the source.
                         
          The pulse is translated into a crude animatic of a neutron
          star circling into the black hole.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           We know that, Doctor. What we don't
           know is why, according to your
           numbers, this event took place right
           here in our own solar system.
                         
          Suddenly, the image overlays the sun, the earth, and the
          rest of our solar system around the black hole.
                         
                          ANSEN
           It didn't. Because if it had we'd
           all be dead by now.
                         
          On-screen, Jupiter, then the Earth and the inner planets are
          consumed by the black hole. Only the sun survives, pulled
          into orbit around its new master.
                         
                          ANSEN (CONT'D)
           Which leaves only one explanation:

           wormhole. A gateway to a distant
           corner of the universe. The black
           hole is on the far side.
                         
          On-screen, the black hole system is removed to a distant
          corner, connected to ours by a tunnel through space-time. A
          gravity wave from the collision travels through the tunnel.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           I've read your book, Doctor. You
           said that wormholes are impossible.
                         
                          ANSEN
           There is nothing quite as satisfying
           as being proved utterly wrong.
                          (SMILES)
           I said that a wormhole couldn't exist
           naturally. Not for more than a few
           billionths of a second. It would
           have to be... stabilized.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           Stabilized by what?
                         
          Ansen pauses, unsure. His assistant steps in to his defense.
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           We don't have any way to answer that
           question.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
                          (IGNORES HIM)
           You're not under peer review here,
           Doctor. I don't care about your
           reputation. I need to know how that
           thing got there. Now.
                         
          Ansen finally speaks up.
                         
                          ANSEN
           If you're worried about an invasion,
           I would start drafting the articles
           of surrender.
                          (SMILES)
           Whoever they are, if they can build
           a wormhole, they could erase us in
           the blink of an eye. Luckily, that
           also means we have nothing they could
           be interested in.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           Then why is it there?

                          ANSEN
           I don't know. Maybe it's an
           invitation. A chance to commune
           with an advanced species.
                         
          The assistant, embarrassed, looks down. The agent notices.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           You don't agree?
                         
                          ASSISTANT
                          (DELICATE)
           No. I don't think we can assume an
           alien intelligence built the wormhole.
                          (CHANGES TACK)
           But the opportunity it represents is
           incredible. We could explore parts
           of the universe we never dreamt of
           reaching in our lifetimes.
                         
          The agent exchanges a look with one of his colleagues, who
          steps out of the room.

           We severed the connections to your

                          (INDIGNANT)
           You can't do that. The Europeans
           put up some of the funding...

           We'll send them a check.

          He steps out the door, leaving the men alone. The assistant,
          outraged, turns back to his boss.
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           They can't keep this a secret. You
           know that. Sooner or later...

           I wasn't sure we'd make it...
                         
          The assitant realizes that the old man is weeping for joy.

                          COOPER
           Long way to come by bus. I thought
           you guys would have a plane.
                         
                          BALLPLAYER
           We did. Ran out of parts for it.
           You know anything about diesels?
                         
                          COOPER
           A little.
                         
          Cooper steps to the engine compartment.
                         
          The ballplayer notices Cooper's two boys, TOM, 15, and MURPH,
          10, watching them. He wanders over.
           7.
                         
                          BALLPLAYER
           You think your dad's going to be
           able to help us out?
                         
          Murph, a filth-encrusted kid with a black eye, smiles at the
          ballplayer.
                         
                          MURPH
           My dad can fix anything.
                          (WRY SMILE)
           Except maybe your fastball.
                         
          The ballplayer frowns: smartass kid.
                         
          After a moment under the hood, Cooper signals to the driver,
          who tries the engine. It turns over once, then STARTS.
                         
                          BALLPLAYER
           Sure appreciate the help.
                         
                          COOPER
                          (SHRUGS)
           You don't make it, my boys won't get
           to see you lose.
                         
          The ballplayers load up into the bus and as it pulls away,
          we can see the logo painted across the back of the bus for
          the first time:
                         
          WORLD FAMOUS NEW YORK YANKEES
                         
          EXT. SPACE, NEAR EARTH ORBIT
                         
          Earth spins, lazily. From this height, it looks much the
          same as it has done for thousands of years.
                         
          Suddenly, a tiny black object appears, racing toward Earth.
                         
          The object SMASHES into a large satellite and races onward.
          Behind it, the satellite spins out of orbit in a cloud of
          fragments.
                         
          EXT. BASEBALL STADIUM -- NIGHT
                         
          An old minor league stadium. The stands are barely halfway
          full. Cooper, his boys, and Cooper's father-in-law, DONALD,
          60s, have a row to themselves behind the dugout.
                         
          Murph offers his grandpa some popcorn.
                         
                          DONALD
           Popcorn at a ball game is unnatural.
           I want a hot dog.
           8.
                         
                          MURPH
                          (CONFUSED)
           What's a hot dog?
                         
          Suddenly, play stops on the field below as the players and
          fans look up at the night sky:
                         
          A bright blue streak is tearing across it. It's beautiful.
                         
                          TOM
           Is that a comet, Dad?
                         
                          COOPER
           (shakes his head)
           Satellite. Big one. Probably
           Chinese.
                         
          Everyone watches the fireworks as the satellite burns up in
          the upper atmosphere.
                         
          After a moment, play resumes -- it's a pretty show, but
          everyone has seen it plenty of times before.
                         
          Down on the field, the Dodgers' catcher misses an easy pop
          fly and the Yankees load the bases. Donald looks disgusted.
                         
          INT. COOPER'S TRUCK -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper guides his truck along a potholed road. His father-
          in-law is riding shotgun; the boys are sleeping in the back.
                         
                          DONALD
           Those clowns would get their asses
           handed to them by the ballplayers I
           grew up watching.
                         
                          COOPER
           You ruin it for the boys when you
           talk like that.
                         
                          DONALD
           I'm not doing my grandkids any favors
           by lying to them. They're growing
           up watching lousy baseball.
                         
                          COOPER
           They didn't have any baseball at all
           when I was a kid.
                         
          That shuts the old man up for now. They drive on in silence.
                         
                          CUT TO:
           9.
                         
          EXT. FARMHOUSE -- MORNING
                         
          The sun is gently landing on the horizon, painting the sea
          of corn around Cooper's modest house gold. Cooper walks out
          of his house, still eating his breakfast.
                         
          Donald is on the porch, looking at a black clouds of smoke
          in the distance. The neighboring fields are BURNING.
                         
                          DONALD
           Nelson's burning up his crops. Found
           some of the blight on the okra.
                         
          Cooper watches the men walking through the fields, setting
          fire to the crop.
                         
                          COOPER
           I thought okra wasn't susceptible.
                         
                          DONALD
                          (SHRUGS)
           Better safe than sorry.
           (looks at him)
           You've got to take the boys to school.
                         
                          COOPER
           Something wrong with your truck?
                         
                          DONALD
                          (SMILES)
           Parent-teacher conference day.
                         
          Cooper bends his head in dismay.
                         
                          DONALD (CONT'D)
           Be nice to Murph's teacher. She's
           single, you know.
                         
                          COOPER
           What does that have to do with
           anything?
                         
                          DONALD
           We're supposed to be repopulating
           the earth. Gotta pull your weight.
           Besides, the boys could do with a
           woman in their lives.
                         
          The boys run out of the house and pile into the truck. Cooper
          pulls away before Donald can continue.
                         
          EXT. ROAD -- DAY
                         
          Cooper weaves the car along a dirt road. The kids are arguing
          over an ancient comic book in the back seat.
           10.
                         
          Cooper turns around to break it up.
                         
          BANG -- one of the tires blows out in a foot-deep pothole.
                         
          EXT. ROADSIDE -- DAY
                         
          Cooper examines the flattened tire. Looks at his older son.
                         
                          COOPER
           Get the spare, Tom.
                         
                          TOM
           That is the spare.
                         
                          COOPER
           All right. We'll use the patch kit.
                         
          He moves to the back of the truck. Murph suddenly looks
          very glum.
                         
                          MURPH
           I... I think the patch kit might not
           be there...
           (off his look)
           Because I was using it for my bike.
                         
          Cooper looks down at the dirt. Sighs.
                         
                          COOPER
           Murph's law.
                         
                          MURPH
                          (CONFUSED)
           What's that?
                         
          Tom snorts with laughter. Turns to his dad.
                         
                          TOM
           The kid doesn't even know what he
           was named after...
                         
          Cooper shoots Tom a look -- enough.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Murph's law means what can go wrong
           will go wrong.
                         
          Murph, looking hurt, walks off. Cooper turns to his son.
                         
                          COOPER
           Find something to patch it with.
                         
                          TOM
           How am I supposed to do that?
           11.
                         
                          COOPER
           Figure it out. I'm not always going
           to be here to help you.
                         
          Cooper leaves Tom to catch up with his younger son, who is
          looking out over the river.
                         
                          MURPH
           Is that really why I'm named Murph,
           dad?
                         
                          COOPER
           Listen to me. Murph's law doesn't
           mean that. It means what can happen
           will happen. All kinds of things.
           Good or bad. And that's the way you
           want it to be.
                         
                          MURPH
           Why?
                         
                          COOPER
           Because if nothing ever happened to
           you then you wouldn't learn anything.
                         
          Murph is staring off into the distance. He's heard something.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Murph?
                         
          Then Cooper hears it, too. A LOW RUMBLING SOUND. Cooper
          looks out over the river. Then he turns back and tackles
          his son to the ground.
                         
          Suddenly, a MASSIVE AIRPLANE SOARS overhead, so close they
          can almost touch it. It bounces the truck on its suspension,
          then soars off over the fields behind them.
                         
          Cooper grabs Murph and races back to the truck. He pulls a
          laptop and an antenna made out of a Pringles can out of the
          back of the truck. He hands the laptop and antenna to Murph.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Get in.
                         
          Tom is still standing by the side of the road, wrestling
          with the jack.
                         
                          TOM
           What about the tire?
                         
          INT. TRUCK -- MOMENTS LATER
                         
          The truck is SMASHING through the cornfields as fast as Cooper
          can push it on three good tires.
           12.
                         
          Murph is hurriedly firing up the laptop and connecting it to
          the directional antenna.
                         
          Cooper is straining to see through the cornstalks, scanning
          the horizon.
                         
                          TOM
                          OVER THERE-
                         
          To the right, the dark shape of the Russian drone appears,
          flying low over the fields. Cooper jerks the wheel--
                         
          EXT. RIVER -- DAY
                         
          The truck BURSTS out of the corn and SPLASHES across the
          river and into an old, abandoned suburban housing development
          in the valley below, planted over with corn.
                         
          Half a mile in front of them, the Russian drone is still
          hugging the ground. It has impossibly long, skinny wings,
          like an old U-2 surveillance plane, but no cockpit. The
          tops of its wings are covered in black solar cells.
                         
          INT. TRUCK -- DAY
                         
          Murph is fiddling with the computer. His older brother takes
          the computer from him and fires up emulation software.
                         
                          COOPER
           It's a Chinese military drone. Solar
           cells could power an entire farm.
                          (TO TOM)
           Take the wheel.
                         
          Cooper hands Murph the Pringles can antenna.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Keep it pointed right at it, OK?
                         
          Murph nods. Tom takes the wheel as his dad works the laptop,
          trying to communicate with the huge Russian drone. The screen
          fills with Cyrillic characters.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.
                         
          Tom WEAVES the truck at speed through the old, curved streets
          of the development, past oversized suburban mansions planted
          over with corn.
                         
          They round a corner and come face-to-face with a robot
          harvester. Tom jerks the wheel to avoid it.
                         
          BANG -- the truck loses a wing mirror against the flank of
          the combine.
           13.
                         
          EXT. SUBURBAN DEVELOPMENT -- DAY
                         
          Tom guides the truck from street to street, trying to chart
          a straight path across the fields. The truck BOUNCES as it
          SMASHES through an old picket fence.
                         
          Ahead, the drone is soaring, banking, pulling away.
                         
          INT. TRUCK -- DAY
                         
          Cooper is still trying to hack into the drone's control
          circuitry as they leave the development behind and begin to
          climb into the foothills of the Sierras.
                         
          EXT. RIDGELINE, HILLS -- DAY
                         
          Tom guides the truck along the spine of the hills. The drone
          soars overhead, making for the white tips of the Sierras.
                         
          INT. TRUCK -- DAY
                         
          Cooper is oblivious to the picturesque surroundings as he
          concentrates on the laptop.
                         
                          TOM
                          (UNSURE)
           Dad?
                         
                          COOPER
           Almost got it. Don't slow down.
                         
          In front of them, Tom and his brother watch as the drone
          plummets from view.
                         
                          TOM
           DAD.
                         
          Cooper looks up. Ahead, the trail disappears as the edge of
          the hills falls away -- it's a three hundred-foot drop.
                         
          Tom locks up the brakes.
                         
          EXT. RIDGELINE, HILLS -- DAY
                         
          The truck skids to a halt inches from a precipitous drop.
                         
          Cooper climbs out, holding the laptop. Murph climbs out
          next to him, still pointing the Pringles can.
                         
                          TOM
           We lost it.
                         
                          COOPER
                          (SMILING)
           No we didn't.
           14.
                         
          Suddenly, the drone SOARS back over them. Cooper types a
          couple keys and then moves his fingers across the trackpad.
          The huge drone banks and turns in response.
                         
          As the boys watch, Cooper sends the drone soaring high over
          them, banking and soaring along the tree-lined sides of the
          valley, light glinting from the black panels on its back.
          It's a beautiful sight.
                         
          Cooper crouches next to Murph.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           You want to give it a whirl?
                         
          Murph looks at his dad, wide-eyed. He takes the laptop and
          moves his fingers gingerly across the pad.
                         
          In response, the massive plane banks into a tight turn in
          the valley below.
                         
          For a moment, Murph is in pure heaven, sending the drone
          dancing through the valley below.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Set her down in the valley -- there,
           next to the river.
                         
          Murph leads the plane in a figure eight and then begins
          guiding it into a gentle landing in the valley floor below.
                         
          EXT. ABANDONED GOLF COURSE, VALLEY FLOOR -- DAY
                         
          The truck limps along the overgrown fairway of a long-defunct
          golf course towards the massive hulk of the Russian drone,
                         
          Cooper and the boys climb down. The valley is silent save
          for the truck's engine WHEEZING and SPUTTERING as it cools.
                         
          Cooper runs a hand over the smooth carbon flank of the drone.
                         
                          TOM
           How long do you think it's been up
           there, Dad?
                         
                          COOPER
           Chinese mission control went down
           same as us, twenty years ago. It's
           been up there ever since.
                         
                          TOM
           What was it doing flying so low?
                         
          Cooper reads the information pouring into his laptop.
           15.
                         
                          COOPER
           It was looking for something.
           Intercepted some kind of signal.
                          (SHRUGS)
           It's been at eighty thousand feet.
           Sun probably cooked its brain.
                         
          Cooper runs his hand along the flank till he finds an access
          patch. He pulls out a crowbar and pries open the hatch.
          Inside, surrounded by a nest of liquid cooling tubes, is a
          small black module -- the drone's auto-pilot.
                         
          Cooper looks down at Murph, who is standing at his elbow.
                         
                          MURPH
           What are you going to do with it?
                         
                          COOPER
           Reprogram it. Give it something
           socially responsible to do like drive
           a combine or a tractor.
                         
                          MURPH
                          (QUIET)
           Couldn't we just let it go? It's
           not hurting anyone.
                         
          Cooper looks down at his son. Good kid.
                         
                          COOPER
           We need all the help we can get,
           Murph. This thing has to adapt,
           just like the rest of us.
                         
          Cooper gently pries the control module out.
                         
          EXT. COUNTY SCHOOL -- DAY
                         
          It's a small school, so all the kids and parents waiting in
          front know exactly who's driving the pickup truck with half
          of a Russian spy plane hanging out of the bed as it pulls up.
                         
          INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE, COUNTY SCHOOL -- DAY
                         
          Cooper is ushered into the office. The PRINCIPAL, 40s, an
          efficient-looking man, shakes his hand.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           Good to see you, Mr. Cooper. This
           is Ms. Kelly, Murph's teacher.
                         
          Cooper smiles at Ms. KELLY, 30s, attractive.
           16.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)
           So we've gotten Tom's score back.
           Congratulations. He's going to make
           an excellent farmer.
                         
          The principal slides a carbon copy across the desk to Cooper,
          who looks taken aback.
                         
                          COOPER
           What about college?
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           The University of California only
           accepts a few hundred students a
           year, Mr. Cooper. You have to be
           realistic.
                         
                          COOPER
           You're ruling out college for him
           now? He's only fifteen.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           I'm sorry. I'm afraid Tom's score
           simply isn't high enough.
                         
                          COOPER
           What are you, about a 36-inch waist?
                          (BEAT)
           30-inch inseam?
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           I'm not sure I see--
                         
                          COOPER
           You're telling me you need two numbers
           to measure your own ass, but just
           one to measure my son's future?
                         
          Ms. Kelly stifles a laugh, then, with a look from the
          principal, takes on the appropriate look of offense.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           I understand you're a well-educated
           man, Mr. Cooper. A scientist?
                         
                          COOPER
           Engineer.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           Frankly, the world doesn't need any
           more engineers. We didn't run out
           of trains or television sets or
           satellites.
                          (BEAT)
           We ran out of food.
           17.
                         
          Cooper leans back. He's not going to win this one.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)
           The world needs farmers, Mr. Cooper.
           And I'm sure your son Tom is going
           to make a fine one.
                          (SMILES BENIGNLY)
           We're a caretaker generation. But
           things are getting better. Maybe
           your grandchildren will be able to
           attend college.
                         
          Cooper looks down, swallowing his anger.
                         
                          COOPER
           Are we done?
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           One more thing. Ms. Kelly here says
           that Murph brought a book to school
           about the lunar landings.
                         
          He slides an old textbook with a picture of a rocket on the
          cover across the desk to Cooper.
                         
                          COOPER
           One of my old textbooks. Murph liked
           the pictures.
                         
           MS. KELLY
           This is one of the old federal
           textbooks. We've replaced them with
           corrected versions.
                         
                          COOPER
           Corrected?
                         
           MS. KELLY
           The new textbooks explain that the
           Apollo lunar missions were faked in
           order to bankrupt the Soviet Union.
                         
                          COOPER
           You don't believe we went to the
           moon?
                         
           MS. KELLY
           I believe it was a brilliant piece
           of propaganda. The Soviets spent
           years trying to build rockets and
           other useless machines.
                         
                          COOPER
           "Useless machines"?
           18.
                         
          Cooper looks to the Principal for help. None is forthcoming.
                         
           MS. KELLY
           Yes, Mr. Cooper. The kind of
           wastefulness and excess that the
           20th century represented. Your
           children would be better off learning
           about this planet, rather than reading
           fantasies about leaving it.
                         
          Cooper is silent for a long moment.
                         
                          COOPER
           One of those useless machines they
           used to make was called an MRI. If
           we had any of them left the doctors
           might have been able to find the
           cyst in my wife's brain before she
           died, rather than afterwards. And
           then my kids could have been raised
           by two parents, instead of me and
           their pain-in-the-ass grandfather.
                         
          Ms. Kelly's face falls, ashen. Cooper swallows his anger.
          Most of it, anyway.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           You ever consider the best thing for
           the world and humanity might have
           been for us to part company?
                         
          Cooper gets up to leave.

          He PUNCHES the wheel.
                         
          The radio KEYS to life. He ignores it. Sits for a moment
          in misery. Finally he picks up the handset.

                          COOPER
           Just tell him to power down the
           controllers for a couple minutes.
                         
           CB OPERATOR (O.S.)
           I did. He wants you to come down in
           person anyway. Says he found
           something you should take a look at.
           19.
                         
          Cooper stares at the wheel. Shakes his head in frustration.

           sovereign nation of Texas.
                         
          Coop hangs up the radio. Banks the plane inland.
                         
          EXT. GULF COAST -- DAY
                         
          Below, a combine harvester fights its way up the dunes, trying
          to reach the beach, its wheels struggling for traction in
          the soft sand.
                         
          A MAN waves up at Cooper's plane as it circles overhead.
                         
          Cooper lands the plane on a deserted roadway. Jumps down.
                         
          He intercepts one of the combines as it trundles past, trying
          to reach the dunes. He pops open the cabin.
                         
          Inside is a mess of wires hooked into an auto-pilot not unlike
          the one he ripped out of the drone. He checks the fault
          code and resets the computer.
                         
          The man jogs over to meet him.
                         
                          RIGGS
           Thanks for coming down. Half of 'em
           took off last night, looking for
           something.
           (points to dunes)
           Looks like they found it, too. I
           thought you were the man to see it.
                         
          Riggs starts walking up the dune. Cooper follows.
                         
          Below, on the beach, a dozen more combines and other farming
          vehicles are lined up at the tideline, warm gulf water lapping
          at their metal flanks. They are circling a deep crater.
           20.
                         
          As they watch, an ancient autonomous SUB BEACHES itself,
          trying to reach the crater.
                         
          EXT. CRATER'S EDGE, BEACH -- DAY
                         
          Cooper steps between the waiting machines and peers down
          into the crater.
                         
          At the very bottom is a ROUND BLACK BALL, about a foot across --
          the same object we saw punch a hole in the side of a
          satellite. Every few seconds, it emits a distinctive CHIRP.
                         
          Cooper checks his rad meter. A tiny reading -- non-lethal.
          He takes off his watch and hands it to Riggs. Then he slides
          down into the hole.
                         
          The probe CHIRPS as Cooper slides down on top of it. He
          rubs a hand across its smooth composite bulk.
                         
                          RIGGS
                          (FROM ABOVE)
           You think it's an alien?
                         
          Cooper wipes sand off of the object, revealing the faint,
          familiar outline etched into the side of the probe:
                         
          The stars and stripes of the old federal government.
                         
                          COOPER
           Not exactly.
                         
          EXT. CRATER'S EDGE, BEACH -- DAY
                         
          Using a rope and a winch, Cooper hauls the blackened probe
          out of the crater and onto the beach.
                         
          Cooper hefts it up and carries it to the back of his plane.
                         
                          COOPER
           Space probe. Never seen one like
           it, though. Looks like it's been to
           hell and back.
                         
          The probe CHIRPS as Cooper belts it into the back.
                         
                          RIGGS
           How do you think it wound up here?
                         
                          COOPER
           Lost, I guess. Guidance satellites
           would have been shot down by the
           Chinese twenty years ago.
                         
          Cooper looks at the probe for a second, admiring its form.
           21.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Donald is pouring a bottle of corn beer into a bubbling vat
          of chowder. He turns to watch Cooper work, amused.
                         
          The probe has been clamped to the kitchen table. Cooper
          works at the blackened case with a BLOWTORCH. Cooper gives
          up -- the torch hasn't made a scratch. The probe CHIRPS.
                         
                          COOPER
           Well I don't know what the hell it's
           made of, but I can't crack it open.
                         
                          DONALD
           Good. Clear it off the table so I
           can serve dinner.
                         
          Tom and Murph walk in. Murph's got another black eye.
                         
                          DONALD (CONT'D)
           What happened this time?
                         
                          MURPH
           I got suspended. Paul said anyone
           who believed we went to the moon was
           an idiot. So I hit him.
                         
                          COOPER
           Good boy. Hand me the scanner.
                         
          Murph hands his dad a defibrillator he's modified for the
          purpose. He attaches the shock pads to the sides of the
          probe and turns on the power.
                         
          Numbers flash across the screen. Cooper hits a button on
          the controls and it PULSES.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Here we go. Standard NASA encryption.
           Memory's been damaged. Just noise.
           Hold on. I've got something.
                         
          Cooper unplugs a monitor from his computer and plugs it into
          the defibrillator. After a moment, an image fills the screen:
                         
          An ICE-COVERED PLANET nestled in the center of a system
          impossibly dense with stars. Murph stares, transfixed.
                         
                          MURPH
           Where is that, dad?
                         
                          COOPER
           I don't know.
                         
          Cooper looks at the probe.
           22.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Where the hell did you come from?
                         
          Cooper shrugs. Turns off the monitor.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           We'll take it down to Tyson's tomorrow
           and have it melted down. Might be
           some copper inside.
                         
                          MURPH
           But what about its mission? What
           about the information onboard?
                         
                          COOPER
           There's no one for it to report to.
           NASA is all gone. I'm sorry, son.
           It got home too late.
                         
          Donald pulls his chowder off the boil and slides the pot
          unceremoniously onto the table.
                         
          INT. DINING ROOM -- NIGHT
                         
          The boys have gone to bed. Cooper and Donald are alone at
          the table. Donald hands Cooper another beer.
                         
                          DONALD
           I heard your meeting at the school
           didn't go so well.
                         
          Cooper shakes his head in disgust.
                         
                          COOPER
           Maybe it's better for everyone to
           forget what they did back then.
           Reminds us how far we've fallen.
                         
                          DONALD
           (looks down,)
           When I was kid, it felt like they
           made something new every day. Some
           gadget or idea.
                          (SMILES)
           Like every day was Christmas.
                          (BEAT)
           But we made a lot of mistakes. Six
           billion people. Just try to imagine
           that. Every last one of them trying
           to have it all.
                         
          Donald rolls the bottle of beer in his hands.
           23.
                         
                          DONALD (CONT'D)
           The truth is this world isn't that
           bad. In a lot of ways its better.
           Tom will be all right, whether he
           goes to college or not.
                         
                          COOPER
           It doesn't bother me that he can't
           go. It bothers me that he doesn't
           care.
                         
                          DONALD
           Tom isn't the problem. He fits in
           this world just fine. You're the
           one who doesn't fit, Coop. You don't
           belong here. You were born forty
           years too late, or forty years too
           early -- I don't know. My daughter
           knew it, god bless her. And your
           kids know it, too.
                         
          Donald drains his beer. Walks to the screen door. Stops,
          one hand on the frame.
                         
                          DONALD (CONT'D)
           You were good at something and you
           never got a chance to do anything
           with it. And I'm sorry, Coop. But
           that's not your kids' fault.
                         
          Donald pushes out the screen door.
                         
          Cooper looks at his beer. The probe CHIRPS.
                         
          INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper flops down on his bed, fully clothed, exhausted. He
          stares up at the ceiling. This is his life.
                         
          INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          The air is filled with a PIERCING NOISE.
                         
          Cooper BOLTS upright. Stumbles out the door.
                         
          INT. HALLWAY, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper's boys are in the hallway, exhausted. Cooper, holding
          a baseball bat, makes his way down the stairs.
                         
          Cooper uses the bat to open the kitchen door.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper steps in, Murph watching from behind him.
           24.
                         
          The probe is clamped to the table, the chirp replaced with a
          DEAFENING SCREAM.
                         
          Cooper, holding his ears, moves closer to the probe. He
          hits it with the paddles. No result.
                         
          He SMASHES it with the bat. Nothing. He HITS it AGAIN and
          AGAIN. Finally, the clamps break off chunks of the table
          and the probe slams to the ground and ROLLS toward the front
          door. As it rolls, it STOPS SHRIEKING.
                         
          Cooper and the others watch it roll toward the door. It
          stops at the wall. After a second, it begins SHRIEKING AGAIN.
                         
          Cooper grabs it and rolls it toward the front door. Once
          again, the movement shuts it up.
                         
          EXT. PORCH, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper and his boys roll the probe out of the front door.
          It BUMPS down the front steps and comes to rest in the dirt.
          After a moment, the unholy RACKET starts up again.
                         
          Cooper keeps rolling it, but it doesn't seem to help. Murph
          looks up, sees the stars overhead.
                         
                          MURPH
           Try a different direction.
                         
          As they roll the probe in a circle, its SHRIEK stops, then
          picks up again. Cooper zeroes in on the direction that keeps
          it quiet -- southwest -- and pushes it along in the dirt.
                         
                          COOPER
           It's a fail-safe. It's going to
           annoy us into taking it home.
                         
          Cooper stops rolling the probe and, after a moment, it begins
          SHRIEKING again.
                         
                          TOM
           What are we going to do?
                         
          Cooper gets a rope.
                         
                          COOPER
           We're going to get some sleep.
                         
          He begins tying the rope around the probe.
                         
          INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          Cooper wakes. He's been sleeping with a pillow wrapped around
          his head. The SHRIEK can be heard, but it's muffled, distant.
           25.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          Tom heads off for school with Donald. Murph, still suspended,
          looks up at Cooper, smiling.
                         
                          MURPH
           What are we doing today?
                         
                          COOPER
           You're staying here and cleaning the
           house.
                         
          Murph looks crestfallen. He looks out towards the yard.
          Cooper follows his stare.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           I told you, Murph. There's no one
           to take it back to.
                         
                          MURPH
           But what if there is, dad? What if
           there's something we can salvage?
                         
          Cooper thinks it over. Murph scrambles to get his shoes.
                         
          EXT. COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          The shriek is still muffled. Cooper walks over to the well,
          putting in a pair of earplugs.
                         
          A line is staked off, leading down into the well below.
          Cooper begins hauling the line up.
                         
          As the probe breaks the surface of the water, the SHRIEK
          returns to its normal volume. Cooper rolls the probe out
          onto the ground.
                         
          INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY
                         
          The probe CHIRPS next to Murph in the backseat as Cooper
          spins the plane and guns the throttle and they bounce along
          the dusty runway and into the air.
                         
          EXT. CALIFORNIA COAST -- DAY
                         
          The tiny plane follows the mountains south.
                         
          EXT. SKIES OVER LOS ANGELES -- DAY
                         
          Cooper flies in low. Los Angeles looks much the same way it
          did in the early 20th century -- small settlements in Santa
          Monica and Downtown. Wildfires and earthquakes have shaken
          and burned what was left of the homes in between.
           26.
                         
          EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY, MALIBU -- DAY
                         
          Cooper puts the plane down on the old highway and taxis up
          to a gas station. Ahead, the Coast Highway peters out and
          disappears beneath rows of wild grass -- Malibu has become
          ranchland, once again.
                         
          EXT. GAS STATION, MALIBU -- DAY
                         
          An OLD MAN looks up as Cooper steps out of the plane and
          checks it over.
                         
                          COOPER
           Got any diesel?
                         
                          OLD MAN
           Plenty. Shame you can't eat it.
                         
          Cooper stretches the hose over to the plane.
                         
          INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY
                         
          Cooper rests a hand lightly on the controls as he follows
          the coast. Murph gazes out the window. In the backseat,
          the probe is HUMMING.
                         
          A light marine layer beneath them parts, revealing SANTA
          CRUZ ISLAND, a large, uninhabited island.
                         
          As Cooper soars over the island, the probe HUMS, insistent.
                         
                          MURPH
           I think it's home.
                         
          Cooper circles the island until he finds a long, flat
          grassland in the center of the island.
                         
          EXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY
                         
          The plane bounces and hops to a halt in waist-deep grass.
                         
          Murph and Cooper climb down from the plane. Cooper slings a
          rifle over his shoulder.
                         
          A few dozen yards from the plane they reach the tree line.
          Murph stops, mesmerized by a patch of weeds studded with
          bright red -- strawberries.
                         
                          MURPH
           Dad, what are these things?
                         
                          COOPER
           I don't know. Don't touch them.
           27.
                         
          Cooper spots something in the foliage ahead that looks a
          little off. He walks over.
                         
          He pokes at the undergrowth with his rifle. The rifle CLANKS
          against something metal. Cooper reaches -- it's a camouflage
          scrim. He gently pulls it aside, revealing a chemical
          transport truck.
                         
          Cooper steps back, alarmed. He brings up his rifle.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Murph?
                         
          He looks around. Murph is nowhere to be seen. Cooper curses
          and heads into the forest to look for him.
                         
          EXT. CLEARING, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY
                         
          Cooper walks through a glade. He stops to get his bearings.
          Leans against a tree. Snatches his hand back -- the trunk
          of the tree is red hot.
                         
          Cooper steps back -- it's not a tree at all, but a camouflaged
          chimney stack. He looks up: the tree is venting steam.
                         
          Cooper walks a little further, until he finds several massive
          tanks. The tanks are filling with a bubbling liquid -- some
          kind of industrial process is taking place beneath him.
                         
          Cooper finally catches up with Murph at the edge of a
          clearing.
                         
                          COOPER
           Careful. There's some kind of
           underground facility here. We
           might...
                         
          Cooper notices his son is frozen, staring at something:
                         
          Standing bolt upright in the middle of the clearing, wearing
          an old straw hat, is an eight-foot-tall military spec ROBOT.
                         
                          MURPH
           Is it still... alive?
                         
                          COOPER
           Can't be. It's a marine. Haven't
           made them for thirty years. I've
           never seen one intact before.
                         
          Cooper steps closer to the robot, which is frozen. Its alloy
          frame heavily tarnished and weather-beaten. It looks like
          it might have been standing here for decades.
           28.
                         
          Cooper moves closer to it, looking into its blackened eyes.
          He steps back, clearly a little spooked.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           I think we need to go, Murph.
                         
                          MURPH
           But can't we take it back? You could
           fix it up, get him to do chores.
                         
                          COOPER
           No. I don't know what this place
           is, but we're leaving.
                         
          Murph, ignoring his father, steps forward to touch the robot.
                         
          Suddenly, the robot SPRINGS into action, picking up the boy
          and hoisting him up to eye level.
                         
          Cooper, stunned, points the rifle at the robot.
                         
          The robot turns, dropping the boy, RIPS the rifle from
          Cooper's hands, BENDS it, then SLAMS him up against the side
          of the water tank. Cooper punches him, then winces in agony.
                         
          Murph picks up the rifle and begins HITTING the robot as
          hard as he can. The robot opens his mouth and addresses
          Cooper calmly in the clipped tones of a US marine.
                         
                          ROBOT
           Tell the boy to stop hitting me.
                         
                          COOPER
                          (IGNORING HIM)
           Hit him in the back of the neck.
                         
          Murph raises the rifle butt. A voice stops him.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           I wouldn't do that.
                         
          A woman, 30s, step out from the trees. This is AMELIA BRAND --
          tough, bright, and a decent shot with the large rifle that
          she's pointing at Cooper.
                         
                          COOPER
           We were just looking for salvage.
                         
                          BRAND
           Is that what they call stealing these

                          COOPER
           I didn't know it belonged to anyone.
           29. 
                         
                          BRAND
           It doesn't.
                          (TO ROBOT)
           You want to let them go, Tars, or do
           you want some help with your work?
                         
          The robot, evidently named Tars, looks at Cooper closely.
          Then lets him go.
                         
                          COOPER
           You've got me wrong, lady.
                         
                          BRAND
           Really? You're not the kind of guy
           who turns a combat marine with a
           supercomputer for a brain into a
           riding lawn mower?
                         
          Cooper says nothing -- she's not that far off the mark.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           Get back in your little plane, go
           back to your farming commune. And
           don't come back.
                         
          Cooper backs up. Tars holds up his mangled rifle. Smiles.
                         
                          TARS
           Don't forget your gun.
                         
                          COOPER
           (points at Tars)
           Word of advice -- careful with that
           thing. When the war was over, they
           didn't know when to stop fighting.

           trust you. Keep moving.
                         
          Cooper backs up to his plane. Tars follows him.
                         
          Suddenly, in the plane, the probe emits a high-pitch SQUEAL.
          Tars responds instantly, striding past Cooper to the plane.
          He sees the probe. Tries to open the door. It's locked.
                         
                          COOPER
           Wait a second--
                         
          Tars TEARS the door off the plane. Reaches inside and pulls
          out the probe. The woman looks at it, stunned.
                         
                          BRAND
           Get it inside.

           do with you later.
                         
          Tars stops, and two panels open in the ground, revealing a
          huge, reinforced service elevator.
                         
          INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR, UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY
                         
          Brand waves at a security camera and the lift begins to glide
          diagonally down a tunnel that cuts hundreds of feet below
          the island's surface. She keeps her weapon shouldered.
                         
                          COOPER

                          COOPER
           You're right. It belongs to NASA,
           which shut down thirty years ago
           when the federal government ran out
           of money.
                         
          Brand says nothing. The elevator slows to a stop at the
          bottom of the tunnel. Heavy BLAST DOORS grind open and Brand
          motions for Cooper to step forward.
                         
          INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY
                         
          They step into a vast underground facility. Standing in the
          center, braced by a launch tower, is a ten story tall rocket.
          Dozens of ROBOTS are working on in, maintaining it.
                         
          Cooper, stunned, looks at Brand.

          Tars carries the probe over to an area of the hangar filled
          with electronic equipment. A group of ENGINEERS and ROBOTS
          converge around Tars.
                         
          An OLDER ENGINEER looks familiar -- 70s, white-haired, this
          is Ansen's assistant at Caltech who we met fifty years
          earlier.

           can't tell from the radiation damage.
                         
          The older engineer looks at the probe, astonished.

          Tars bolts the probe down into a purpose built rig. DOYLE,
          40s, an engineer, begins hooking leads into the probe.

           What did you do to it?
                         
                          COOPER
           Nothing. I got something off of it.
                         
          Cooper looks around. There's a safety station on the wall
          with a battery powered defibrillator.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
                          (TO BRAND)
           May I?
                         
          Brand nods, wary. Cooper walks over to the wall, takes the
          defibrillator, and hooks it up to the probe. He taps into
          the current and runs a lead into the terminal. Brand's Father
          watches, fascinated, as Cooper fires the defibrillator.

           Of course. The high voltage allows
           you to image the entire memory unit
           at once.
                         
          Information begins appearing on the terminal's screen.
                         
                          COOPER
           Most of the disk was noise. Couple
           of clean sectors, though.
                         
          Suddenly, the monitor starts pulling good data off of the
          probe. The older man and Doyle begin sorting through it.
                         
          Cooper smiles at Brand, who seems less than impressed.
                         
          The footage of the ice-covered planet Cooper saw earlier
          pops onto the screen.
                         
          The engineers and physicists get very quiet, studying the
          images.
                         
                          DOYLE

           Trace radiation. Surface is ninety
           percent frozen water. Ten percent

           This could be the one, boss.
                         
          The older engineer studies the image of the ice-covered
          planet, thinking.
                         
                          COOPER
           There aren't any planets like that
           anywhere near earth. Not even if
           this thing was gone for thirty years.
                         
          Brand looks at Cooper, appraising. She turns to the older
          engineer.
                         
                          BRAND
           He's heard enough. If we're going
           to launch, we need to keep them here
           until afterwards.
                         
                          COOPER

           I'm not going to endanger it any
           more than you already have.
                         
          Cooper points to a telemetry unit that is being repaired by
          a robot on a nearby bench.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)

                          DOYLE
           Why not? We've tested it a hundred
           times.
                         
                          COOPER
           The power supply is no good. If the
           voltage fluctuates under load, the
           unit will fail.
                         
                          BRAND

          watches the exchange, thinking.

          INT. MACHINE SHOP, UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- DAY
                         
          Cooper and Murph have been locked in an abandoned machine
          shop, surrounded by the massive remains of rocket engines in
          various states of disrepair. Tars is blocking the door.
                         
          Cooper stands. Tars wags a long, hydraulic finger at him.
                         
                          COOPER

          Cooper gives up. He turns back.
           34.
                         
          The back of the shop is filled with a group of older ROBOTS
          who are overhauling an engine. One problem -- the engine
          isn't there. Their programming hasn't been updated to reflect
          their obsolescence.
                         
          Murph watches, entranced, as the robots go about their
          business, efficiently TORQUING bolts with impact drivers
          into a non-existent thruster cone. The bolts CLATTER to the
          ground as the robots stop to reload.
                         
                          MURPH
           What are they doing, dad?
                         
                          COOPER
           I guess no one told them they were
           out of a job.
           (nods at Tars)
           Same as the rest of these people.
                         
          Cooper notices through the glass door of the lab that Brand
          and the older engineer are arguing about something. She
          finally relents and walks towards the door.
                         
          Brand walks in. She gestures for Cooper to follow.
                         
                          BRAND
           The mission commander wants to see
           you. Your son can stay here. He'll
           be all right with Tars.
                         
          Cooper eyes Tars warily. Then steps outside.

          They walk across the space towards the base of the rocket,
          away from the other engineers. Cooper nods at the older
          engineer.
                         
                          COOPER

           With the rifle, I mean.
                         
          Brand heads towards a group of large maintenance ROBOTS
          clustered at the base of the rocket. A smaller, human sized
          robot is staring at the rocket, giving them instructions.
                         
          The robot looks up. This is CASE, the leader of the mission.
          Originally an air force pararescue officer, every part of
          him, from his alloy chassis to his voice, was designed to

          Then the second set of doors open. Cooper squints -- the
          light is blinding.

          They are standing in a sealed corridor in the middle of a
          massive underground greenhouse. Through the glass, Cooper
          can see an acre or so of corn plants.
                         
          Cooper looks at the plants. They're all badly wilting.

          Cooper looks at the dying corn.
                         
                          COOPER
           But it doesn't affect the corn.

           Not yet. But it will. We've grown

           just to get by.

           The earth has had enough of us. We
           have two, maybe three generations
           left. Then our time here is over.
                         
          Cooper turns back from the glass, anger growing.

           its life fighting over the scraps?
           It's better that they don't know.
                         
          Cooper begins to argue, then stops. He knows enough history
          to know she's right. He looks at the withering crops.

          turns back into the light of the underground facility.

           play out. Your life. Your kids'

          He notices a packed suitcase sitting by the door. The boy
          looks up, hopeful.
                         
                          MURPH
           I've been doing the math, dad. I

          Cooper puts an arm around the boy.
                         
                          COOPER
           There's going to be important work
           to do here, too.
                         
          Tears are streaming down the boy's face. Cooper takes his
          watch off. Looks at it.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)

          picks out details at the bottom.
                         
          Cooper stops breathing.
                         
          The bottom of the ocean is covered with an entire fleet of
          the US navy. Nuclear subs. Battleships. Destroyers.
                         
          Cooper remembers to breath again. Then he hurries to catch
          up with Brand.

          Cooper holds the light as Brand efficiently disassembles a
          ballistic missile and removes the telemetry board.
                         
          She holds it up for Cooper. He nods. She swims on.

          Cooper, dripping wet, holding the telemetry board, struggles
          to keep pace with Brand through stacks of equipment and years
          of research and experimentation.
                         
                          BRAND
           You can set that down over there.
                         
          Cooper sets the board down. His eye is drawn to a bizarre
          experiment -- an ant colony built into a massive spinning
          centrifuge. Brand notices.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           We didn't know what kind of gravity
           to expect. We experimented with
           collective organisms in high g
           environments.

          Cooper looks at the tiny colonies of ants struggling to go
          about their business in the raised gravity.
                         
                          COOPER

                          BRAND
           It's a paradox. Life couldn't form
           without gravity. No stars. No
           planets. The component pieces would
           just drift apart. But too much of
           it and you're trapped.
                         
          Brand's guard relaxes a tiny bit as she talks about her work.
          The moment passes quickly, and she continues on into the
          stack of equipment.

          Brand steps into the back of the room. Cooper notices her

          Case zooms in on the center of the hologram: an incredibly
          bright mass with plasma jets firing off in either direction.

           suited for space travel.
                         
          Case repositions the map near a much smaller black hole that
          is orbiting Gargantua.

           My guess is that the wormhole is
           there because someone is trying to

           die, same as we'd die here anyway.

           If we're guessing, then I'd say
           Brand's right. The wormhole couldn't
           exist naturally. I think it's there
           for a reason. That someone is trying
           to help us.

           colony.
                         
          Brand wipes her tears away and settles into the same fearless
          mask she usually wears. She steals one last look out the
          window at Earth, then looks back.
                         
          Cooper begins to say something, but stops as the entire rocket
          LURCHES as the primary engines FIRE.
                         
          EXT. SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- NIGHT
                         
          The desolate island is suddenly painted in color as the rocket
          lifts off on a massive white cloud.
                         
          EXT. FIELD -- DAY
                         
          Murph sits alone on a rise overlooking the massive co-op
          farms. Behind him the combines continue to work, oblivious.
                         
          Murph watches a tiny vapor trail as it races for the heavens.
          His father's watch dangles from his wrist.
                         
          INT. CAPSULE -- NIGHT
                         
          The interior of the capsule SHAKES with incredible violence
          as the rocket is lifted up on a giant, continuous explosion.
           51.
                         
          EXT. SPACE, NEAR EARTH ORBIT
                         
          The rocket sheds one stage, then another, until finally the
          naked capsule reaches the blackness of space and rockets on.
                         
          INT. CAPSULE
                         
          Cooper looks through the tiny porthole into inky blackness.
                         
          As they get closer, he makes out a looming matte black
          structure that passes light from the stars directly through.
                         
          In the center of the structure, Cooper can see a globe-like
          ship covered in the same refractive material: the ENDURANCE.
                         
          INT. SPACE STATION
                         
          The door cracks open and equalizes with a HISS. Case, more
          comfortable in the zero gravity environment than the humans,
          hauls himself through.
                         
          They are greeted by a group of robots painted in the same
          material as the ship -- the engineers who built and have
          maintained the Endurance for thirty years.
                         
          INT. MACHINE SHOP, SPACE STATION
                         
          One of the robots leads Cooper through a long lab-like room
          filled with machines capable of fabricating almost anything
          imaginable. Cooper looks like a kid in a candy store.
                         
          The robot reaches a vacuum-sealed package. Cuts it open,
          revealing a bipedal frame.
                         
          Cooper begins LAUGHING -- Tar's new body is beautifully
          designed, but tiny, only about four feet tall.
                         
                          ENGINEER ROBOT
           Would you like me to install the
           chip?
                         
                          COOPER
           Oh, no. I want to see this.
                         
          Cooper takes Tars's chip out of its plastic safety case and
          looks it over. The engineer opens a bay in the back of the
          frame and Cooper slides the chip inside.
                         
          The frame begins its "handshake" -- lights illuminate on the
          body, muscles flicker from a long gestation. The eyes open.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
                          (SMILES)
           Good morning, sunshine.
           52.
                         
          Tars takes one or two steps forward, rotating his arms --
          the robot equivalent of a stretch. Cooper can barely hide
          his mirth at Tars's newfound lack of stature.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Bit of a demotion.
                         
          Tars turns back toward Cooper. He puffs out his chest and
          suddenly his stubby arms and legs telescope, unfolding into
          long, svelte limbs. When he's done he stands eight feet
          tall, even more impressive than his earthbound frame.
                         
                          TARS
           I wouldn't call it that, exactly.
                         
          He reaches out an arm and pats Cooper on the shoulder.
                         
          INT. ENDURANCE, SPACE STATION
                         
          Cooper and the others haul themselves into the ship. To
          Cooper's surprise, it's quite compact, and divided into two
          chambers, like nestled spheres.
                         
                          COOPER
           The ship is tiny.
                         
          Doyle, squeezing past him, smiles at Cooper's surprise.
                         
                          DOYLE
           So is the wormhole.
                         
          Doyle pats Cooper on the back. Cooper begins hauling gear
          inside.
                         
          EXT. SPACE, NEAR EARTH ORBIT
                         
          In complete silence, the Endurance detaches from the space
          station and rolls gently away.
                         
          After a moment, its nuclear engines fire and the Endurance
          begins to accelerate steadily away from the Earth.
                         
          INT. SPACE STATION
                         
          The engineer robots who built the Endurance watch as their
          creation disappears into space.
                         
          Their mission is complete. One by one, they shut down.
                         
          INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE
                         
          The crew watch through a translucent section of the ship's
          hull as the Earth gets steadily smaller.
                         
          Then they settle in for the long journey to the wormhole.
           53.
                         
          INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE
                         
          Tars is hunched over a small communications relay, one hand
          is holding a paint brush -- he is making delicate strokes,
          painting the relay a bright blue.
                         
          Cooper watches him for a moment. Tars looks up.
                         
                          TARS
           It's the comms relay. It will allow
           us to talk to earth, even on the far
           side of the wormhole.
                         
                          COOPER
           I know. So why are you painting it?
                         
          Tars looks almost bashful.
                         
                          TARS
           It helps me calibrate my fine motor
           control.
                         
                          COOPER
           Sure it does.
                          (SMILES)
           You're pretty good.
                         
          Tars double checks his work.
                         
                          TARS
           I learned it during the war.
                         
                          COOPER
           What'd you paint?
                         
                          TARS
           Tombstones.
                         
          Cooper watches him finish in silence.

          Cooper watches a highly-compressed video of his son, Tom,
          talking about school.
                         
                          TOM
           They said I can start an agriculture
           class a year early.
                         
          Cooper shakes his head.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           I've got to go, Dad. Hope you're
           safe up there.
           54.
                         
          Tom gets up to leave. Donald sits down in his place.
                         
                          DONALD
           I'm sorry, Coop. I asked Murph to
           record you a message but he's still...
           well, he's still angry with you.
           I'll try again next week.
                         
          The video cuts out. Cooper stares at the darkened screen.
                         
          INT. ENGINE ROOM, ENDURANCE
                         
          Cooper, Brand and Tars are moving the bundles of colonization
          equipment into bins along the wall of the craft.
                         
          Tars pulls a stack of equipment out the stack and stows it
          against the wall. Cooper copies the procedure.
                         
          They labor in silence, working their way along the hull.
          Cooper gets quicker with each bundle, keeping pace with Tars.
                         
                          TARS
           Be careful. It's difficult to gauge
           mass in zero gravity.
                         
                          COOPER
           How much do these things weigh?
                         
                          TARS
           Four tons.
                         
          Cooper looks at the incredibly heavy bundle spinning easily
          in his hands. He tries to stop it. Catches his hand.
                         
                          COOPER
           Damn.
                         
          He jerks his hand away, then pushes himself after the spinning
          bundle, trying to stop it before it can damage the hull.
          Tars helps him catch it inches from the hull wall.
                         
          Brand floats over to Cooper, smiling at him the whole time
          with an exaggerated grin.

           Smile.
                         
          Cooper smiles, taken aback by Brand's sudden friendliness.
                         
                          COOPER
           Why?
                         
                          BRAND
           Because it lowers your blood pressure.
           55.
                         
          Cooper looks at his hand. Blood is pouring out of his palm
          in large glistening bubbles.

          Cooper hesitates. Case senses the jump in his heart rate.

          Cooper looks away, overcome for a second with emotion. Case
          watches him, gauging his mood, whether he has said too much.

          Cooper stops recording. Looks at the equipment, thinking it
          over. Erases the message. Stands to leave.
                         
          As he steps to the door he notices Brand watching him through
          the window. She looks away.

          Cooper looks at the holographic model of the black hole
          system. The ice planet looks precariously balanced, orbiting
          the smaller black hole.

          Cooper looks at the impossibly complicated system of black
          holes orbiting each other.
                         
          EXT. LAGRANGE POINT, SPACE
                         
          Behind the ship, the sun is a distant light, not much bigger

          meters or so in diameter.

          EXT. ENDURANCE
                         
          The relay is released from the ship, and we finally get a
          look at Tars' paint job -- the stubby device looks like a
          20th century mail box.
                         
          The relay drifts in space. A signal light illuminates as it
          sends a test packet of data to the ship.
                         
          INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE

          Cooper and the rest begin folding away equipment in the
          control room and moving into the outer layer of the ship.
                         
          Case initiates a sequence on the keypad and the nuclear

          INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE
                         
          The crew move into the tight, claustrophobic outer layer of
          the ship. They will have very little room as the ship passes
          through the wormhole.
                         
          Tars detaches his legs in order to take up less space during
          transit. Then he tethers himself to the hull wall.
                         
          Case is the last to join them. He detaches a small control
          module from the console, then pulls himself into the outer
          hull and seals the passageway.
                         
          Case presses a button on the control module. With a GROAN,
          the hull walls of the ship begin to BEND.
                         
          EXT. ENDURANCE, SPACE
                         
          The ship's hull begins to CRACK open, revealing the inner

          The SHUDDERING continues. The crew watch nervously as the
          control chamber below them suddenly opens itself to the cold
          blackness of space.
                         
          EXT. ENDURANCE, SPACE
                         
          The ship silently rolls itself into position, pointing the
          opening in its hull toward the wormhole mouth.
                         
          Slowly, the Endurance pushes itself forward, closer and closer
          to the crystal-like mouth. Finally, it envelops the mouth,
          bringing it into the open chamber.
                         
          INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE
                         
          As the crew watch, the wormhole mouth is positioned in the
          center of the inner compartment.
                         
          Case presses a sequence key on the control panel and the
          ship's hull closes again, trapping the wormhole inside it.
                         
          With a GRUMBLE, the ship begins contracting, squeezing itself
          down around the wormhole mouth.
                         
          Cooper takes a deep breath as the center of the ship begins
          gently lowering itself into the wormhole mouth, feeding itself
          into the wormhole from the inside out. Cooper watches as
          Doyle is swallowed into the compressing ship with a GRUNT.
                         
                          TARS

           No.
                         
          Cooper's turn: he is fed into the hole, legs first, then
          waist, torso, and, finally, his head.
                         
          EXT. SPACE
                         
          The Endurance shrinks as it sinks from the inside out into
          the wormhole.
                         
          After a moment, it's gone. The only thing left behind is
          the comms relay, drifting in space, waiting for a signal.
                         
          INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE
                         
          The ship continues to slide through the wormhole. Through
          the outer hull they see images of themselves repeating -- a
          trick of the narrow collar of space they are sinking through.
          Cooper smiles at himself. The experience is unnerving.
           61.

           The hull is intact. Thirty more
           seconds transit.
                         
          For a moment, the ship slides gently, silently, through the
          wormhole. The quiet is eery.
                         
          Suddenly, a point of distortion appears in the hull next to
          Cooper. It looks like someone is pushing against the hull
          of the ship with a giant finger.
                         
                          COOPER
           Something's happening to the hull
           over here.

           Hull integrity is fine.
                         
          The distortion moves along the hull, growing in diameter.
                         
                          COOPER
           Well, I don't know what your display
           is telling you but something is
           happening over here.
                         
          Suddenly, along the hull, Doyle speaks up, panicked.
                         
                          DOYLE
           I've got a problem over here, too.
                         
          Doyle is watching a separate distortion move across the inner
          wall of the ship. This one seems to be TWISTING the material
          of the hull.
                         
          Suddenly, the point in front of Cooper detaches itself from
          the outer wall and moves through the space in front of him,
          bending the empty space itself, distorting the ship behind
          it like a sphere-shaped magnifying glass.
                         
                          DOYLE (CONT'D)
           It's not the hull... it's inside the

          Roth watches as the distortions move through the ship. His
          curiosity doesn't make anyone else feel any better.
                         
                          DOYLE

          The twisting sphere in front of Doyle begins to grow.
                         
                          DOYLE
           It's getting bigger.
                         
          Doyle puts up his hand to defend himself. The sphere absorbs
          it, twisting Doyle's hand. Doyle CRIES OUT.
                         
          His hand is twisted completely around, impossibly mangled.
          But Doyle, hyperventilating, isn't in any pain.
                         
                          ROTH
           It's not bending your hand. It's
           bending the space around your hand.
                         
          The sphere begins to pass through Doyle's body. Doyle is
          freaking out.
                         
          The sphere in front of Cooper makes contact with him, also.
          He holds his breath as it touches him, squeezing and
          distorting his body.
                         
                          BRAND
           This isn't turbulence. Look at the
           way they're moving -- it's like
           something's examining us.
                         
          Cooper watches the sphere distort his arm, running along the
          length of it.
                         
                          COOPER
           Can you ask it to stop?
                         
          Suddenly, as quickly as they appeared, the distortions vanish.
          For a moment, the crew is silent, still spellbound by the
          encounter.
                         
          An ALARM sounds. Suddenly, the inner chamber begins to
          distort from a spherical shape to bispherical: two spheres
          joined. The ship GROANS as if it's being pulled apart.

          sky slowing as the orbit grows longer.
                         
          Finally, a tiny speck of light appears in front of the ship.

          Roth watches as the Endurance races back away from the black
          hole and into a perfect orbit around a tiny ice planet.
                         
          Roth looks up from his screen, smiling.

          As Roth and Doyle study the frozen planet below, Cooper tries
          in vain to signal the relay on the Earth side of the wormhole.
                         
          Brand and Case are having a private conversation away from
          everyone else. Cooper walks over.
                         
                          COOPER
           I still can't contact the relay.
                         
          Brand ignores him at first. She nods at Case.

           communicate back home.
                         
          She waves him off. But she looks shaken by something.

           try again in a few hours.
                         
          Cooper begins to ask her what's wrong, but she moves off.
                         
          Roth looks up from his monitor, excited.
                         
                          ROTH
           I've got a signal. But it's local.
                         
          A familiar CHIRP plays over the ship's speakers.
                         
                          ROTH (CONT'D)
           The remaining probes. We found them.
                         
          She looks at the monitor. The probes ping the ship with
          their locations, which pop up on the monitor. They're all
          clustered in one spot.

          Case programs a course that will lock the ship in orbit above
          the probes on the surface.
                         
          EXT. SPACE ABOVE ICE PLANET
                         
          The ship settles into orbit a few hundred kilometers above
          the surface of the ice planet. It can't get any closer:
                         
          The space below it is choked with hundreds of tiny moons --
          a cruder version of Saturn's rings. The moons are hurtling
          around the planet at high speed.

          The lander detaches from Endurance, rolls over on its belly,
          and FIRES thrusters to sink towards the planet's surface.

          between the moons that hurtle past.
                         
          The moons are vastly different than our own; potato shaped
          and only one to two miles in circumference, they are hugged
          in a close embrace with the ice planet, only a few hundred
          thousand feet from the surface.

          After a moment, the hatch HISSES open and the team steps
          out, led by Case, holding a rifle.
                         
          The team sets out, moving slowly in their cumbersome suits.
                         
          Lit by the nebula, the surroundings are a little brighter
          than a full moon on Earth.
                         
          Not that there's much to look at. They are standing on a
          sea of ice, which spreads for miles. In the distance, small
          rock formations break through the ice.
                         
          Brand takes a surface reading of the ice.

           significant amounts of oxygen trapped
           in the ice.
                         
          Case leads the way, drawn by a signal only he can hear. He
          walks fifty yards, then stops on a gentle slope that leads
          down into a small valley.

           The other probes should be directly
           beneath us.
                         
          Case and the others begin digging into the hillside. Cooper
          is drawn to a small mound in the middle of the valley, four
          feet high. He takes out a small folding shovel and begins
          scraping at the ice and snow.
                         
          Case hits something solid. But it's not a probe. He digs
          around a little more, then reaches up and hacks away at the
          hillside, revealing the outline of something metal:
                         
          A door. They're not standing at the base of a hill -- it's
          a shelter. The crew stands back, unsure what to make of it.
                         
          A few feet away, Cooper cuts enough of the mound away to
          reveal something flexible -- fabric caked with ice. He
          scrapes away the snow, revealing a bright patch of red fabric:
                         
          It's the flag of the People's Republic of China.

           How could the Chinese have gotten
           here first? The federal government
           kept the wormhole a secret.
                         
          Case shrugs. He has a soldier's gallows humor about his old
          employer's ability to keep anything a secret.

          with ice. He wrenches it open.

          Case steps up to an equipment locker. Forces it open. Inside
          are half a dozen black probes. Exposed to light, the probes
          begin TONING like the one Cooper found in Texas.

           The more immediate question is what
           happened to the Chinese expedition.
           There's no sign of their ship in
           orbit. And they never returned to
           earth.
                         
          Roth picks up an ancient vacuum sealed package of pickled

          a last-ditch means of escape, stored, untouched in the

          Brand gives up on the argument, sheds her equipment and clips
          herself to the line to follow Case down into the ice.

          He reaches the bottom of the shaft, which opens into a small
          cave, the ice ribbed in wave-like patterns like the seafloor.

          The ice below them reveals nothing but murky blackness.
          Case has found some of the equipment left behind by the
          Chinese -- a battery-powered drill and a pick.

          The rad meter Brand is holding begins to CHIRP with activity --
          the radiation levels are rising. The ice will not be enough
          to protect them.
                         
          Cooper sees that Brand has exhausted herself with the pick.
          He takes over for her.
                         
          The drill that Case is operating GROANS as the thirty-year-
          old battery runs out of charge. Case casts it aside and
          begins SMASHING at the ice with his bare hand.
                         
          Brand is looking at the walls of the ice pocket, looking for
          fissures. Her lights pick out something in the ice. She

           I've found something.

          He pulls off the hand and continues to hack away at the ice
          with the stump, trying to save his crew.
                         
          Brand is examining a piece of ice in her hands, which contains
          several black flecks. As she shines her light on them, they
          FLUORESCE, giving off a tiny flicker of light, like a firefly.
          Brand steps back.

          in the ice. Brand shines her flashlight over the ice again,
          but nothing happens. Roth takes the depth meter dangling by
          a lanyard from Brand's suit.

          trapped in the ice, mesmerized.
                         
          Case hammers down with his arm, gouging a deep hole in the
          ice below. Suddenly, GAS sprays back up at him. He's found
          the gas pocket beneath them.

          from Case, falling calmly a few yards beneath him.
                         
          As they fall, the light from the microbes trapped in the ice
          above sweeps across the inside of the cavern, illuminating
          the floor of the massive cavern thousands of feet down.
                         
          The rock formations they saw on the surface are actually the
          tip of a mountain range extending into the distance,
          disappearing into the ice above as if it were cloud cover.
                         
          The base of the mountains is covered in a thick jungle-like
          foliage that runs into a perfectly-still inland sea. On the
          far side of the sea, another mountain range stretches into
          the distance, supporting the thick ice and rock cavern roof.
                         
          Cooper only has a few seconds to take this in -- he is falling
          towards the huge inland sea below.
                         
          Seconds before impact, a tiny warning light flickers on inside
          his helmet: IMPACT DETECTED.

          and torso to cushion the impact.

          As he sinks, Cooper pulls off his helmet, then tears off
          pieces of his suit. He forces himself through the neck of
          the suit and then swims upward.

          forms, which are wildly different from their counterparts
          back on Earth, piled in torturous coils, as if frozen in a
          struggle to punch through the canopy to reach the light above.

           This is incredible. The organisms
           trapped in the ice above absorb x-
           rays and emit light. In return,
           these plants absorb the light and
           emit oxygen, which feeds the animals
           trapped in the ice.
                         
          Brand cuts off a sample and drops it into the case. The
          transparent wall of the case magnifies the structure onto
          the glass automatically. She compares it with the flecks
          she collected in the ice above, fascinated.

          around them, nervous.
                         
                          COOPER
           Any sign of big life-forms?
                         
                          BRAND
           The soil's been disturbed. So
           something's been moving. But I
           haven't seen anything.
           (notices his look)
           Cooper... are you nervous?
                         
          Cooper stops scanning the trees, embarrassed.
                         
                          COOPER
           I just think we should get back to
           the shelter before night falls.
                         
          Overhead, the light from the ice above begins to fade -- the
          neutron star must have orbited out of view. Night is falling.
                         
                          BRAND
                          (LAUGHING)
           Relax. If there are any large
           organisms here, even predatory ones,
           they're not going to attack us --
           they have no idea what we are.
                         
                          COOPER
           You don't know that. You just have
           blind faith this place is going to
           be some kind of Eden.
                         
          Brand stops. He's struck a nerve.
                         
                          BRAND
           (truly pissed off)
           Faith has nothing to do with it.
           You know what you are, Cooper? You're
           just another in a long line of people
           saying 'no.' That this isn't going
           to work. And frankly, I don't have
           to convince you.
           83.
                         
                          COOPER
           What's that supposed to mean?
                         
                          BRAND
           You're on this mission because you're
           another pair of hands. You want the
           truth? I told Case we should bring
           another robot over you. At least
           then I could just reprogram you to-
                         
          She stops. Something has caught her attention.
                         
                          COOPER
           What?
                         
                          BRAND
           Nothing. I just -- I could have
           sworn it just moved.
                         
          She walks to the thick, knotted trunk of a tree. Puts a
          hand on it.
                         
          Overhead, the ice flickers out and the darkness begins to
          descend, more rapidly than on Earth.
                         
          Suddenly, the tree SHUDDERS. Then, the bark begins to ooze
          over Brand's fingers.
                         
          Brand snaps her hand away and steps back. Even for her,
          this is too much. She turns back to Cooper, who is looking
          at the jungle around them, spooked.
                         
                          COOPER
           You know how plants don't usually
           move? Is that a universal rule?
                         
                          BRAND
           No. There really aren't any rules.
                         
          All around them, the life-forms begins to melt toward the
          ground, breaking down into different, smaller forms.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           (trying to stay calm)
           Remember, we're the aliens.
                         
          Cooper steps back as several pieces of the nearest tree drop
          onto the ground and begin scuttling toward him.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           Hold very still. Don't make any
           sudden movements.
                         
          Two of the pieces join together, stacking themselves up and
          staggering toward him.
           84.
                         
          A third piece climbs onto the first two, looking for a good
          place to hang on. After a moment it hunkers down on top,
          forming a crude head. Thirty eye-like structures blink open
          on the creature.
                         
          The skin of the life-form begins to flicker with a dim light
          like the animals trapped in the ice above, bathing Cooper
          and Brand in a warm glow.
                         
          The creature creeps closer to them, taking them in. Cooper
          tries his best to seem non-threatening.
                         
                          COOPER
           Hello there.
                         
          The creature lurches toward him on three legs, then its head
          splits open and it BELLOWS.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           OK. Now we run.
                         
          Brand doesn't argue. They turn and sprint through the trees.
                         
          EXT. JUNGLE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper and Brand smash headlong through the jungle. At first,
          they're running from the rumbling, smashing melee behind
          them. But as they run, the entire jungle around them begins
          to break apart and move.
                         
          After a moment, they're surrounded. The jungle is completely
          disassembling itself into a million different pieces, each
          one a different size and shape than the others.
                         
                          COOPER
           We have to reach the shelter.
                         
          They head off, crashing through the melee.
                         
          EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Case, Doyle and Roth are standing in front of the shelter
          finishing the day's work.
                         
          Doyle turns around. The jungle is breaking apart and crawling
          down the beach towards them.
                         
                          DOYLE
           I think we've got a problem.
                         
          Case and Roth look up to see the organisms picking up speed
          as they move towards them.
                         
          Roth begins to step out towards them.
           85.
                         
                          ROTH
           Fascinating. I think-
                         
          Case grabs him by the arm and pushes him bodily into the
          shelter after Doyle.
                         
          Case pushes the door closed.
                         
          INT. SHELTER, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          They crouch inside the shelter as the organisms begin POUNDING
          at the walls, trying to force their way inside.
                         
          It's going to be a long night.
                         
          EXT. JUNGLE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Ahead, Cooper can see the gleaming water of the inland sea,
          light still flickering in patches from the ice above it.
                         
                          COOPER
           This way.
                         
          Brand begins to follow.
                         
                          BRAND
           No... wait.
                         
          Too late. Cooper forces his way between two writhing
          creatures, steps through, and falls...
                         
          EXT. WATERFALL -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper gasps as he surfaces from the ice-cold water. Brand
          floats past.
                         
          The river appears to flow randomly down the slope, with good
          reason -- the forest rearranges itself every night.
                         
          Ahead, the ground drops away again and the water rushes over
          it in a torrent.
                         
          Cooper catches himself at the last minute, grabbing a thick
          tree branch with one hand and, a second later, Brand with
          the other as she slides past.
                         
                          COOPER
           I've got you.
                         
          Suddenly, the branch in Cooper's hand illuminates and wrenches
          itself out of the rock -- it's a limb of a huge colony
          organism. It shakes Cooper loose and they fall again...
           86.
                         
          EXT. POOL -- NIGHT
                         
          Brand surfaces first. She grabs Cooper and hauls him up and
          out of the water. She smiles down at him, a little smug.
                         
                          BRAND
           I've got you.
                         
          Creatures begin splashing down into the pool behind them, as
          if imitating them.
                         
          Cooper stumbles to his feet and Brand guides them backward
          into a small cave carved into the rock above the pool.
                         
          INT. CAVE -- NIGHT
                         
          Brand CRACKS a glow stick, basking the cave around them in a
          soft light.
                         
          As they watch, horrified, the pool and the rocks in front of
          the cave fill up with creatures of all sizes, as they tumble
          down the hill in what appears to be a battle royal.
                         
          For a moment, it looks like Brand and Cooper may go unnoticed.
          Then, a three-foot-tall creature with a dozen legs creeps
          its way toward the entrance to the cave. Another follows,
          and another, until the cave entrance is full.
                         
          Cooper looks around the cave, frantic. He picks up a rock.
          Brand, scared but still thinking, takes the rock from his
          hand and drops it back to the ground.
                         
                          BRAND
           It's game theory. The best move is
           always to cooperate at first.
                         
                          COOPER
           By "cooperate" do you mean let it
           eat me?
                         
                          BRAND
           These organisms have no interest in
           us. They survive by photosynthesis.
           All they need is light.
                         
                          COOPER
           Then why are they killing each other?
                         
                          BRAND
           I don't know.
                          (LOOKS AROUND)
           But we're outnumbered, Cooper. So
           unless you have a better idea, I
           suggest we make nice.
           87.
                         
          The creatures move toward them hesitantly, then faster.
                         
          Cooper stands stock still as the creatures gather around
          him. Several of them join up into bigger animals to get a
          better look at him.
                         
          One of them wraps itself around his chest and begins prodding
          at his shoulders, then his neck.
                         
                          COOPER
           (trying to be calm)
           What is it doing?
                         
                          BRAND
           It's a colony organism. It's trying
           to incorporate you into its structure.
                         
                          COOPER
           I don't want it to incorporate me.
                         
                          BRAND
           Don't open your mouth.
                         
                          COOPER
                          WHY N-
                         
          As he speaks, the creature on his chest extends four spindly,
          pointed feelers and reaches gently into his mouth.
                         
          Cooper holds his breath as the organism taps against his
          teeth. Its skin has a roughened texture, as if incomplete,
          and it appears to be searching for the same texture on
          Cooper's skin, without much luck.
                         
          Bored, the life-forms climb back down off of Cooper. The
          last two creatures link up in an imitation of Cooper's lower
          body and attempt to walk across the room like a human. After
          a moment, the creatures tumble to the ground and flail away.
                         
          Cooper is still breathing hard as the cave empties and he
          and Brand are left alone again.
                         
          Brand steps to the edge of the cave and watches, fascinated,
          as the creatures resume wrestling and battling each other.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           They're killing each other.
                         
                          BRAND
           No. They don't bleed... they don't
           die... they're just competing...
           trying out different shapes, looking
           for the best one.
           88.
                         
          Cooper watches as a hideously-awkward-looking, five-legged
          beast stumbles past and tackles another animal.
                         
                          COOPER
           I'd say they have a long way to go.
                         
                          BRAND
                          (AMAZED)
           They do this every night.
                         
          As they watch, a two-foot-long creature with one huge claw
          scuttles along the ground, grabbing smaller opponents and
          smashing them apart, then sorting through the wreckage and
          adopting some of the writhing parts as its own.
                         
          Something about the movement is endearing, the way it
          experiments with each piece -- less like a massacre and more
          like an over-caffeinated self-assembling erector set.
                         
          Suddenly, a massive, lumbering creature SMASHES down in front
          of the claw beast. No match, the smaller creature turns to
          scuttle away. Too slow. The larger organism brings one
          club-like limb smashing down on top of it. After a moment,
          it lifts its claw -- the two animals have become one.
                         
          The new organism lumbers away through the jungle, happily
          snapping its new claw at larger opponents.

          Brand and Cooper huddle around a small chemical fire they've
          brought with them.
                         
          Brand looks at the sample of the fractal wildlife in her
          case. It's moving around, splitting apart, reforming, trying
          to find a way out.

           These creatures are billions of years
           older than we are. But they're
           relatively primitive. They haven't

           I was in Denver during the first

           kid. We kept waiting for someone to

           We were on our own.
                         
          Cooper looks away. The memories are never that far away.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)

           you want to know why I don't believe

          EXT. CAVE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper sleeps. After a moment, Brand steps back out into
          the darkness.
                         
          EXT. PLAIN -- DAWN
                         
          Brand exhales great streams of frosted breath -- the
          temperature is well below freezing. The first flickers of
          light are visible in the ice above.
                         
          The creatures are huge now, forty or fifty feet tall, battling
          each other more and more slowly. As Brand watches, the
          largest of them beats down his rivals, climbing to the top
          of the heap.
                         
          Just as the beast reaches the top, it freezes, as if stuck.
                         
          Above, the ice begins to shine brighter and brighter.
                         
          Suddenly, the beast on top breaks apart, unfurling into planes
          to catch the light. This is what the contest has been about --
          a better place in the sun.
                         
          Brand takes it in.

          Cooper and Brand pick their way their way through the foliage,
          which is now perfectly still, absorbing the light. Cooper
          looks at the plants, wary.
                         
          Brand sees his trepidation and laughs at him.
                         
                          BRAND
           They're not going to move now, Cooper.

           thin as they can to absorb the light.

          Cooper leads the way, pushing through the trees.
                         
          Suddenly he stops again. Brand, annoyed, pushes through the
          foliage to join him.

          Spread out on the plain below is a massive, fortified base.

          and the others follow him in.

          The room is barely recognizable -- the fractal life has
          covered the tables and chairs. Water pools on the floor and
          light streams in from a massive hole the fractal animals
          have punched in the ceiling.

          from layers of different material. The outermost layer is
          flattened steel.

          like a steel chair, flattened with incredible force onto

                          CASE
           I don't know. They've deleted their

                          DOYLE
           I think I know what the problem is.
                         
          Doyle is manipulating the time component of the map, slowing
          down the passage of time, reversing it, speeding it up.
                         
                          DOYLE (CONT'D)
           Look.
                         
          Doyle speeds up the map until the ice planet is nearly a
          blur, speeding in its orbit around Pantagruel.
                         
                          DOYLE (CONT'D)
           There's a small black hole moving
           into the system. Too small for us
           to have seen in our survey. It's
           not going to hit the planet, but
           it's going to come close.
                         
          A tiny black hole soars through the system. Although it
          misses the ice planet, it deflects its orbit by a tiny degree.
          After a dozen more orbits, the ice planet dips down close to
          Pantagruel's event horizon and is torn apart.
                         
          Brand and the others watch as the sequence rewinds and repeats --
          the planet is pieced back together again and ejected, then
          pulled back in and torn apart. Over and over.
                         
                          DOYLE (CONT'D)
           This place isn't paradise. It's
           doomed. Just like us.
                         
          The crew stand, watching the sequence in stunned silence.
                         
                          COOPER

           A few years. A decade at most.

                          DOYLE
           So much for the plan.
                         
          Cooper looks at Brand. She is in disbelief, staring as a
          lifetime's training and optimism are torn to pieces.

           here? What are we here for?
                         
          Cooper looks down. Brand's upset is turning to anger.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)

           place.
                         
          She looks at Cooper, questioning.
                         
                          COOPER
                          (GENTLE)
           Maybe... maybe Roth's right... maybe
           we just don't understand it yet.
                         
          She looks down. She knows he doesn't believe what he's
          saying. He's been right all along -- they're alone.
                         
          For a tiny moment, all hope is lost.
                         
          Suddenly, with a distant RUMBLE, the building begins SHAKING.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)

                          CASE
           It's nighttime. The native life-
           forms are mobile again.
                         
          The RUMBLE grows more intense, as if the entire building is
          being gently shaken.
                         
                          COOPER
           No. It's closer than that.

           Roth.
                         
          The RUMBLE grows. As Cooper watches, Case's rifle slides
          free of the desk. But instead of falling, it simply hangs
          in the air.
                         
          Then he realizes the same thing is happening to them -- his
          boots no longer have traction with the ground. After a second
          everything in the room is floating an inch off of the ground.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Quick -- hold onto something.
                         
          He reaches out to Brand but it's too late -- suddenly they're
          no longer floating, they're falling.
                         
          They're falling up.
           97.
                         
          Cooper, Brand and the rest of them hit the ceiling. Cooper
          picks himself up and adjusts to his surroundings -- up is
          now down. He helps Brand up.
                         
                          DOYLE
           What the hell is happening?
                         
          Case doesn't answer -- he's looking up at the control
          equipment for the holographic display, which is GROANING
          under a load it was never built to handle.
                         
          Case grabs Cooper and Brand and pushes them towards the
          stairwell as the control panel TEARS free of the floor and
          CRASHES towards them.
                         
          Cooper falls into the stairwell -- now they're being pulled
          up and sideways through the stairwell, like an Escher
          painting.
                         
          Brand pushes Cooper out of the way as debris from the control
          panel orbits past them back up towards the lab.
                         
          They try to hang on but the force is becoming irresistible,
          dragging them along the wall of the stairwell and back towards
          the lab upstairs.
                         
          Brand wedges herself against the railing as objects and debris
          are SMASHING against the door to the lab.
                         
          Doyle is trying to hang onto the handrail but his grip slips
          and he CRIES OUT as he falls towards the door to the lab,
          SMASHING it open. Doyle disappears up and into the lab.
                         
          Cooper slips trying to help Doyle. Brand reaches out for
          him...
                         
          Too late. Cooper is pulled through the open door.
                         
          INT. INTACT LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper is pulled through the door and past the control panel.
          He reaches out and grabs the underside of the panel.
                         
          He dangles, the panel cutting into the meat of his hand,
          trying to get his bearings:
                         
          Roth, Doyle, and everything that hasn't been bolted down is
          either pressed against the sphere in the center of the room
          or is orbiting around it.
                         
          Roth, who is laughing, jubilant, shouts up to him:
                         
                          ROTH
           The control panel is beneath you.
           See if you can turn it off.
           98.
                         
          Cooper slips as he tries to reach the controls. Finally he
          finds the controls for the machine.

           I found it. Hold onto something.
                         
          Roth and Doyle crawl up the side of the mass and hold onto
          the support wires.
                         
          Cooper hits a key on the monitor.
                         
          Suddenly, the room inverts again, reverting to a normal
          gravitational field. Cooper floats for a second, then topples
          back to the ground, along with everything else.
                         
          Brand stumbles in to find Cooper sprawled on the floor as
          Roth and Doyle hang onto the sphere for dear life.
                         
          INT. INTACT LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT
                         
          Roth, back on terra firma, is looking at the tiny black box
          he's pried from the center of the sphere. Cooper is looking
          over his shoulder.
                         
                          COOPER
           They found a way to make gravity.
                         
                          ROTH
           Not make it. Adjust it. Dial it
           up, or down. I think they were
           experimenting with it -- firing these
           into the black hole to try to save
           this planet.
                         
                          DOYLE
           All that from one tiny box.
                         
          Roth has hooked the box up to a terminal and it scrolling
          through the incredibly sophisticated machine code, trying to
          parse how it works. Cooper looks on.

                          (AMAZED)
           It barely uses any power. I'm only
           beginning to understand what it does
           but I think it sends a signal out
           into the bulk. It must tap into the
           same technologies that were used to
           create the wormholes in the first
           place.
                         
                          COOPER

                          ROTH
           It means whoever built the wormhole
           probably doesn't exist inside our
           universe.

                          COOPER
           But how did the Chinese develop the
           technology? This would take decades,
           maybe hundreds of years, to create.

           They came back here and tried to use
           these devices to save this planet.

                          ROTH
           No. You're missing the bigger
           picture. The robots had strict
           mission parameters. They were told
           to build a colony and report back.
           They tried to. But they failed.
           Like us they were fixated on this
           place.
                         
          Cooper looks at Brand.
                         
                          ROTH (CONT'D)

           This. This is the prize.
                         
          He holds up the box.
                         
                          ROTH (CONT'D)
           Don't you see? Earth's gravity is

           could turn down the earth's
           gravitational field enough to save
           millions of people. We wouldn't
           have to pick a handful of people to

          gathering space suits, equipment.
                         
          In the bustle, Cooper finds Brand sitting alone, staring at
          the sample of fractal life.
                         
                          COOPER
           I know this isn't exactly what you

           be right.
                         
                          BRAND
           That doesn't help this planet. This

           doesn't have anywhere to go.
                         
          The fractal organism almost seems to be looking at her, trying
          to comprehend. But it quickly loses interest and goes back
          to breaking itself into pieces and reforming into different
          shapes, trying to escape. Brand sets it back down.

           Who?
                         
          Suddenly, three ROBOT MARINES step out of the jungle, weapons
          raised. They are wearing ghillie suits, pieced together
          from dried dead pieces of the local foliage.
                         
          Under their camouflage, they looks identical to Case. With
          one key difference -- faded red and gold insignias.
                         
          Case steps protectively in front of his team.
                         
          The CHINESE OFFICER steps forward, rifle levelled.
                         
                          CHINESE OFFICER
           Ni Hao. My name is Technical Sergeant

           Please put down your weapon.
                         
          Sergeant Liu speaks in the same even tones as Case -- they
          were probably built in the same factory before the war.
                         
          Case keeps his rifle raised.

          his mind. Cooper takes a sidelong glance at Brand.

          Case turns to look at Cooper.
                         
                          CASE

          Cooper nods.
                         
          Case moves. Fast. He FIRES one shot at the nearest robot,
          disabling it, then hurls himself at the remaining two,
          tackling them both over the edge of the ravine.
                         
          Cooper watches them disappear into the void below. Grabs
          Brand and the others.
                         
                          COOPER
           Come on.
                         
          Cooper picks up the rifle from the destroyed marine and begins
          hiking up the mountain.
                         
          EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK -- DAY
                         
          The crew hike towards the ice above.
                         
          Below they hear a metallic BOOM as something heavy hits
          something else -- Case is still fighting. They keep moving.
                         
          EXT. UPPER MOUNTAIN PEAK -- TWILIGHT
                         
          They are high above the Marine camp, only fifty feet or so
          below the massive ice roof of the cavern. The Chinese have
          blasted a tunnel into the ice leading back up to the camp
          above.
           104.
                         
          This high, the air is bitterly cold. Cooper and the others
          are hunkered down, trying to keep warm, waiting for night to
          fall so that they can climb back up to the lander without
          being cooked by the neutron star.
                         
          Finally, above them, the light begins to flicker out. The
          crew begin pulling on their space suits.
                         
          Brand checks on the fractal wildlife in the sample case --
          she is bringing it with them. Cooper catches her eye.

          EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Brand leads the way, the lights from her suit cutting into
          the drifts of snow as they make their way slowly back to the
          lander.
                         
          As they reach the lander Cooper spots lights emerging from
          the ship. He raises Case's weapon.
                         
          One of Liu's marines steps around from the back of the lander.
          Cooper FIRES.
                         
          The marine collapses.
                         
          Cooper and the others race to the lander.

          Cooper points to a damaged section of the ship's hull -- the
          marine has torn open a section, revealing damaged hardware.

          EXT. CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper drags the pieces of the escape rocket out from the
          shelter. Assembly is semiautomatic -- Cooper lifts the pieces
          up and they snap together, forming a crude two-stage rocket
          designed more for a robot than a man.
                         
          When it's complete Roth wedges himself inside, clutching the
          black box -- he barely fits.
                         
                          ROTH
           I can reach one of the moons in low
           orbit and turn up its gravity. As

          Roth follows Cooper into the lab.
                         
          Cooper opens the storage crate. Picks one of the probes at
          random. Sets it down on the bench next to Roth.

           to rebuild it when we get back.

           Not me. But you'll make it work.
                         
          The transfer is complete. Roth hands Cooper the probe, and
          takes the black box himself.

                          COOPER
           We're going to find out soon enough.
                         
          Brand is looking off into the distance.
                         
                          BRAND
           Someone's coming.
                         
          Cooper looks up. A robotlike figure is limping through the
          snowstorm towards them. Cooper raises the rifle.
                         
          Finally he makes out the insignia -- it's Case.
                         
          Cooper and Doyle run out towards him. They reach Case as he
          collapses in the snow. He's badly injured -- one leg torn
          off at the knee, one arm mangled.
                         
          Doyle and Cooper drag the crippled robot back into the ship.
                         
          INT. LANDER -- NIGHT
                         
          They drag Case into the lander. Doyle checks over the ship's
          controls.
           108.
                         
                          DOYLE
           Close the door.
                         
          Cooper moves to the door. Something's wrong.
                         
                          COOPER
           Where's Brand?
                         
          She's nowhere to be seen. Cooper looks out onto the ice.
          Brand is heading back out into the snow.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Dammit. If I don't make it back,
           just keep going.
           (points to probe)
           Get that thing home.
                         
          Cooper steps to the door.
                         
          EXT. SPACE ABOVE ICE PLANET
                         
          The rocket tucks in close behind one of the moons orbiting
          the ice planet.
                         
          The rocket fires to maneuver closer and closer to the moon's
          surface -- the tiny moon doesn't provide enough gravity to
          attract it.
                         
          When the rocket is close enough, Roth detonates the explosive
          bolts holding him inside and leaps for the moon's surface.
                         
          He scrambles to grab hold of the craggy surface. Behind
          him, the rocket smashes apart against the surface.
                         
          Roth finally gets a good hold. He looks down.
                         
          Below him, the view is incredible -- the ice planet curving
          into the distance, Gargantua rising over its horizon.
                         
          Roth looks at the black box in his hands.
                         
          EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Brand is a hundred yards from the lander by the time Cooper
          catches up with her. She is digging in the snow.
                         
          He takes her arm but she won't go.
                         
          She finally finds what she's looking for -- the sample case.
          The tiny fractal life-form is huddled at the bottom.
                         
          Cooper shakes his head and turns back to the lander.
           109.
                         
          EXT. MOON, SPACE OVER ICE PLANET
                         
          Roth is watching the ice planet pass by beneath him. He
          finally sees the distant peaks of the mountain range as it
          punctures the ice near the Chinese camp.
                         
          For a moment he enjoys the view -- the distant hulk of
          Gargantua rising over the horizon of the shining ice planet.
                         
          He takes a final breath and activates the black box.
                         
          Instantly, the moon's gravity is magnified a hundred million
          times over. Roth is instantly crushed as the moon collapses
          around him into a tiny sphere.
                         
          EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper and Brand are only thirty yards or so from the lander.
                         
          Suddenly, the ground beneath them begins to RUMBLE.
                         
          Cooper turns back. A mile back the ground begins to tear
          apart, heaving massive chunks of ice and rock into the sky.
                         
          Roth's moon is racing overhead, TEARING up a massive strip
          of the surface's planet as it nears them.
                         
          Cooper and Brand run.
                         
          EXT. MOON, SPACE OVER ICE PLANET
                         
          The energy being unleashed by the tiny box is incredible --
          millions of times more powerful than an atomic bomb.
                         
          The spray of debris is forming a rooster tail behind the
          moon, rocketing up from the planet's surface.
                         
          EXT. LANDER, SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper has almost made it back to the lander. Behind him,
          Brand stumbles. He turns back.
                         
          Brand is pulling herself up. Behind her, the THUNDEROUS
          EXPLOSIONS as a strip of the planet's surface is hurled into
          space have almost reached them.
                         
          Cooper looks at the ship. He'll never make it if he waits
          for Brand. He turns back to find her.
                         
          He reaches Brand just as the moon's gravity hits them --
          they're hurtled off into space. He grabs her hand.
                         
          Seconds later, everything -- the entire ice sheet, the sea
          and rocks deep below -- is hurled up after them.
           110.
                         
          Brand and Cooper embrace as they rocket up through the thin
          atmosphere.
                         
          Brand looks at him.
                         
                          BRAND
                          (RADIO)
           You caught me. Now what?
                         
          Cooper looks around. They planet's surface is breaking into
          pieces around them.
                         
                          COOPER
                          (RADIO)
           I don't know.
                          (RADIO)
           I figured if you were floating out
           into space, you'd want some company.
                         
          He holds onto her as they fall up and out of the last of the
          planet's thin atmosphere and the blackness embraces them.
                         
                          BRAND
           Between you and utter solitude,
           Cooper, frankly, I'm not sure.
                         
          They reach the apex of their climb and the gravity of the
          planet begins to win out. For a moment they float.
                         
                          COOPER
           Guess you were right -- too much
           gravity, or not enough.
                         
          He smiles, forgetting their predicament for a moment. They
          stare into each other's eyes.
                         
          Then they begin, very gently, to fall back towards the ice
          planet.
                         
          Suddenly, the lander maneuvers beneath them. The airlock
          opens to catch them -- Doyle is at the helm.
                         
          Brand and Cooper pull themselves aboard.
                         
          INT. LANDER
                         
          Cooper closes the door and Doyle rotates the lander outwards.
                         
          Doyle FIRES the engines and the lander continues ascending
          into space as the debris around them begins crashing back
          down towards the ice planet.
                         
          Cooper looks out the window:
           111.
                         
          The moon continues tearing up a massive canyon in the planet's
          surface as it circles out of view.
                         
                          COOPER
           Roth.
                         
                          BRAND
           He's gone.
                         
          Ahead, a shadow looms in the darkness: the Endurance.
                         
          INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
                         
          Brand, Cooper, and Doyle pull themselves out of the airlock
          and scramble to take control of the ship.
                         
          Below them, the surface of the ice planet illuminates as the
          neutron star's x-rays begin to reach it from the far side of
          Pantagruel.
                         
          Doyle finally gets the ship straightened out. Its sole
          remaining engine FIRES, rocketing the ship back towards the
          dark side of the planet, out of view of the neutron star,
          and back towards the original wormhole.
                         
                          DOYLE
           I'm setting a course for the wormhole.
                         
          They're going to make it.
                         
          Cooper and Brand make eye contact -- Brand gives him a tiny
          awkward smile. He returns it, then descends below.
                         
          INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE
                         
          Cooper props Case up against the workbench. He pulls down
          replacement arms and legs from storage bins. Unwraps them
          from their vacuum sealed plastic and bolts them back onto
          Case's chassis.
                         
          Cooper finishes attaching the arm. Case rotates it, checking
          the function.
                         
                          COOPER
           How is that working?
                         
                          CASE
           Very well, thank you.
                         
                          COOPER
           Good. We've already set the course,
           skipper. We're going home.
                         
          Cooper hauls himself back up into the observation level.
           112.
                         
          INT. OBSERVATION LEVEL
                         
          Doyle is setting the controls. The ALARMS on the controls
          have finally abated -- they're out of the danger zone.
                         
                          BRAND
           We're safe now.
                         
          Cooper heads to the communications equipment.
                         
                          COOPER
           Now I know why we weren't able to
           hit the relay. It's not interference --
           the blue-shift from the black hole
           is more than we thought it would be.
                         
          Cooper begins re-calibrating the equipment.
                         
                          BRAND
                          (CONFLICTED)
           Cooper, wait--
                         
          The ship PINGS the relay on the far side of the wormhole.
                         
          There is no response.
                         
                          COOPER
           Nothing.
                          (THINKS)
           Wait. The ship cached one long
           garbled transmission when we first
           fell into the swirl. If we account
           for the blue shift then the computer
           might find something in there.
                         
          Cooper brings up the last garbled transmission they received.
          The computer begins re-analyzing it, piece by piece.
                         
                          BRAND
                          (QUIET)
           Listen to me -- the blueshift also
           means we've lost time. More time
           than we thought we would.
                         
          Cooper looks up at her.
                         
                          COOPER
           How much?
                         
                          BRAND
           A lot... Cooper, maybe it's best if
                          WE DON'T-
                         
          The comms equipment TONES as it translates a packet. Then
          another.
           113.
                         
          Then a FLOOD of communications, one packet a day, hundreds
          and hundreds of packets: images, videos, audio messages from
          family and friends.
                         
          Cooper watches, horrified, as the images play out across the
          screen. He is watching the lives of his family play out at
          light speed. Finally, the packets slow, then stop.
                         
          Cooper looks at the results, in shock.
                         
                          COOPER
           Forty seven years.
                         
          Doyle joins him, staring at the screen, stunned.
                         
                          DOYLE
           My kids...
                         
          Cooper tries to PING the relay again. Nothing comes back.
                         
                          BRAND
                          (GENTLE)
           The relay will have lost power years
           ago. That's why we couldn't contact
           it, even after we reached the planet.
                         
          Cooper is still problem solving, thinking.
                         
                          COOPER
           We could bypass the relay. Send a
           conventional shortwave signal.
                         
                          BRAND
           Only a tiny portion of the signal
           would make it though the wormhole.
           Besides, no one will be listening
           anymore.
                         
          The comms screen is dead. No movement. Nothing.
                         
          Cooper looks at Brand, realizing something.
                         
                          COOPER
           You knew, didn't you? You and Case

          module snapped into the back of Case's chassis is wrong:
                         
          It's red with a gold star. It's not Case at all. It's Liu.

          the ship and back down toward Pantagruel.
                         
          Cooper SMASHES Liu from behind. The robot tumbles to the

          The boosters are no match for the deadly pull of the black
          hole below them.
                         
          On the ship's guidance, they watch, helpless, as the ship
          climbs back up the volcano rim towards the critical orbit.
                         
          As on their first trip, the black hole grows to dominate the
          bottom of the sky, and the stars above them become streaks --
          time is speeding for them as they are whirled down into the
          deep gravity well around the hole.
                         
          As they watch, trapped, decades begin to play out in the

          Finally, the ice planet plunges past them towards destruction.
          As it reaches it slows, until finally it reaches the event
          horizon, just as they saw in the projections. Nothing has
          prepared them for the reality:
                         
          The ice planet is SMASHED apart with stunning violence.

          enough to launch the ship clear of the black hole, like a

          trying to get a prime spot in front of the camera.
                         
          Doyle cups his face in his hands and cries.
                         
          INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE
                         
          Cooper above his bunk, stares out into the blackness.
                         
          Brand watches him from the doorway.
                         
                          BRAND
           I'm sorry. I should have told you.
           I didn't have the right.
                          (BEAT)
           But you should watch the recordings.
           You should know what happened to
           your kids.
                         
          Cooper ignores her.
                         
          INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE
                         
          Brand watches her father talking to her on-screen. He is
          twenty years older than when she left him.
                         
                          BRAND'S FATHER
           I'm not going to make it much longer.
           The machines will continue to maintain
           the station as long as they can and
           the communications will run as long
           as the station here still has power.
           I'm sorry. I hope wherever you are,
           darling, you're safe.
                         
          The screen cuts out. Brand watches the static play out.
                         
          INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
                         
          Doyle sits at the table. He has found a flair gun in one of
          the ditch kits. It is sitting on the table in front of him.
          The message is clear.
                         
          Brand sits down across from him.
                         
                          BRAND
           Our last trip past the black hole
           cost us another 100, maybe 200 years.
           Which means there's a good chance
           we're the only humans alive anywhere.
           121.
                         
          She stands up.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           I think the last human beings should
           have a little more fight in them
           than that.
                         
          Brand picks up the sample of fractal life and places it under
          a lamp on the counter. It freezes, absorbing the rays.
                         
          Doyle looks at the gun.
                         
          EXT. ENDURANCE, VACUUM
                         
          Cooper, in a space suit, steps out of the airlock.
                         
          He drifts out from the ship.
                         
          Nothing. Behind him, the ship is a tiny speck in an ocean
          of darkness.
                         
          INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE
                         
          Cooper sits down. Turns on the screen.
                         
          After a moment, the camera turns on. Tom, his eldest son,
          still 15 years old, turns on the camera.
                         
                          TOM
           Hi, Dad.
                         
          Cooper pauses it. He can't take it. After a moment, he
          lets it run again.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           I met another girl, Dad. I really
           think this is the one.
                         
          Tom holds up a picture of himself and a teenage GIRL.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Murph stole Grandpa's car. He crashed
           it. He's OK, though. No broken
           bones.
                         
          Cooper leans back.
                         
          INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE
                         
          Cooper is holed up, still watching, several days' growth of
          beard unshaved. He's been watching for days.
                         
          On the screen, Tom is a grown man in his 20s.
           122.
                         
                          TOM
           I've got a surprise for you, Dad.
           You're a grandpa.
                         
          Tom holds up an infant wrapped tight in swaddling. The kid
          is BAWLING.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Congratulations. Grandpa said he
           already earned the "great" bit so we
           just leave it at that.
                         
          The screen cuts out.
                         
          The next message begins. Tom is in his 30s.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Hi, Dad. I'm sorry it's been awhile.
                         
          He stops, emotional.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Grandpa died last week. We buried
           him out in the back forty, next to
           Mom.
                          (LOOKS DOWN)
           Where we'd have buried you, if you'd
           ever come back.
                         
          He laughs, gallows humor.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Murph was there for the funeral.
           It's been a few years since I've
           seen him. He's been down in the
           Gulf Coast. He's an engineer. I
           guess someone followed in your
           footsteps after all.
                         
          Tom looks down.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           You're not listening to this. I
           know that. All of these messages
           are just out there, drifting in the
           darkness.
                         
          He stops for a second.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           You're gone. You're never coming
           back. And I've known that for a
           long time. Lois says -- that's my
           wife, Dad -- she says I have to let
           you go. So I am.
           123.
                         
          He reaches up to turn off the camera.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Wherever you are, I hope you're at
           peace. Goodbye, Dad.
                         
          The image freezes, Tom's hand on the camera, then breaks
          apart into digital noise.
                         
          Then nothing.
                         
          Cooper looks at it for a second. Then rises to leave.
                         
          Suddenly, the screen flickers to life again.
                         
          A good-looking man in his late 30s turns on a camera. Cooper
          recognizes him instantly. It's Murph.
                         
          Murph looks at the camera for a long beat, clearly unsure
          about this.
                         
                          MURPH
           Hello, Dad. You sonofabitch.
                         
          He laughs, self-conscious.
                         
                          MURPH (CONT'D)
           It's your 60th birthday today.
           Thought I would celebrate with you a
           bit.
                          (BEAT)
           I guess I understand why you left.
           The corn is dying now, too.
           Tom says there's less and less at
           harvest every year.
                         
          He pauses. Lifts up his hand and scratches his stubble.
                         
          Cooper pauses the message. He looks carefully at the screen:
                         
          Murph is wearing his dad's watch.
                         
          Cooper lets the message play. Tears are streaming down his
          face.
                         
                          MURPH (CONT'D)
           Rot's setting in. I guess you were
           right for clearing out while you had
           the chance.
           (reaches up to switch
                          OFF CAMERA)
           Good luck, old man. I hope you made
           it. I really do.
                         
          The video cuts out.
           124.
                         
          A message appears on the screen:
                         
          "Final transmission." Relay powered down 05232087
                         
          Cooper turns off the screen.
                         
          INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE
                         
          Cooper is seated, alone. Almost every compartment has been
          opened and emptied -- debris is swirling through the
          compartment.
                         
          Brand walks in. They sit in silence for a moment. When
          Cooper speaks, it's clear his sadness has faded to a gallows
          humor.
                         
                          COOPER
           Not a single drink on the whole ship.
           What kind of mission is this?
                         
                          BRAND
           I think Doyle's been experimenting
           with the coolant from his spacesuit.
                         
          They sit in silence for a moment.
                         
                          COOPER
           You really think we're the last humans
           alive anywhere?
                         
                          BRAND
           I don't know. Maybe.
           (looks him in the eye)
           Yes.
                         
                          COOPER
           So that's it, then? That's all?
                         
          He looks down, saddened by his own words.
                         
                          BRAND
                          (QUIET)
           It's happened a billion times over.
           Stars explode. The pieces drift in
           space. Gravity pulls them back
           together. They form new stars.
           Then planets. Then us. We die. It
           starts all over again.
                         
          Cooper shakes his head.
                         
                          COOPER
           What about the plan? The grand
           scheme.
           125.
                         
                          BRAND
           I thought you didn't believe in one.
                         
                          COOPER
           I didn't. But you were bringing me
           round.
                         
          He laughs, his anger coming and going in waves.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           What the hell was the point? What
           did it add up to?
                         
                          BRAND
           I don't know. Maybe it just adds up
           to this.
                         
                          COOPER
           This? You're saying the end result
           of ten billion years is the atoms
           from dead stars standing here
           disagreeing with each other.
                         
          She smiles at him. Bittersweet.
                         
                          BRAND
           Maybe that's enough.
                         
          He turns away from her. She takes his shoulder.
                         
          She pulls him into a kiss. His surprise disappears and he
          pulls her to him, kissing her back.
                         
          Their surroundings forgotten, they drift. She LAUGHS gently
          as they bump into a wall and he pushes off of it, sending
          them spinning back into the center of the cabin.
                         
          She pulls his shirt off and it hangs in space. In moments,
          the cabin is filling with discarded clothes, different colors
          and shapes, like a ticker tape parade.
                         
          In the center of the cabin, Brand and Cooper make love.
                         
          INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE -- LATER
                         
          Cooper and Brand embrace, sleeping, drifting in the cabin.
                         
          Suddenly, Doyle's voice calls out from the other cabin.
                         
           DOYLE (O.S.)
           It's happening... it's happening
           again... Get up here...
                         
          Cooper wakes, careful not to disturb Brand. He plucks his
          shirt from the floating laundry pile and pulls it on.
           126.
                         
          INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
                         
          Cooper hauls himself up into the upper cabin. Doyle is
          standing in the middle of the chamber.
                         
                          DOYLE
           They just appeared.
                         
          A sphere of distortion, like the one they encountered in the
          first wormhole, is directly in front of Doyle, hovering at a
          point in the middle of the cabin.
                         
          Doyle points a finger gently at the sphere, which grows in
          response.
                         
          Brand pulls herself into the cabin. Several more points
          appear, as if they've been summoned by the first.
                         
          Some of the points twist, some of them spin, and some of
          them are motionless.
                         
                          BRAND
           I think these are the creatures that
           built the wormhole.
                         
          One of them begins to move closer to Cooper.
                         
                          COOPER
           This thing is made of... gravity?
                         
                          BRAND
           No. I don't think it's in our
           universe at all. I think it lives
           in the bulk -- the space that the
           wormholes traverse. And it can only
           interact with us using gravity.
                         
          The shape playfully grows around Cooper's hand, bending the
          space it's in, stretching the skin.
                         
          Doyle GASPS as the sphere nearest him moves through his body,
          coming to rest in the middle and bending his entire torso
          like a fun house mirror.
                         
          Suddenly, the sphere wrapped around Cooper's hand begins
          moving, tugging him gently through the cabin.
                         
          In the next moment, all three of them are being propelled
          through the cabin.
                         
          It's a magical moment -- a communion, a dance between
          creatures on either side of a massive, invisible wall.
                         
          Doyle exclaims like a kid on a roller coaster as he is whirled
          around the room.
           127.
                         
          Cooper and Brand collide with each other for a second as the
          bulk beings move them through space. They hold onto each
          other for a moment and then are pulled apart again as the
          whirling dance continues.
                         
          Even the fractal creature is involved -- inside its cage, a
          tiny distortion ripples its fractal skin. The creature breaks
          apart and plays with the distortion around its enclosure.
                         
          Finally, Brand disengages from the dance and pulls herself
          around the lab, looking for some way to try to communicate
          with the creatures.
                         
          She finds two heavy pieces of engineering equipment and moves
          them close to each other, then far apart.
                         
          The bulk beings soon join her, mimicking the motion of the
          pieces of equipment.
                         
                          COOPER
           Can we communicate with them?
                         
                          BRAND
           Where would we even start? Maybe--
                         
          She pull a bag of ball bearings out of a storage bin and
          tears the bag open, releasing a cloud of the tiny shining
          globes into the air.
                         
          For a moment, nothing happens. Then, the distortions begin
          moving through the bearings, shifting them, rearranging them
          into patterns in the air.
                         
          First, they rearrange the ball bearings into clusters, then
          shapes spinning around each other -- planets orbiting around
          a medium-sized star.
                         
                          DOYLE
           That's our solar system.
                         
          After a moment the ball bearings break apart again and
          rearrange into a larger, more complicated system -- Gargantua,
          Pantagruel, and the ice planet.
                         
          Finally, the bearings compress to a two-dimensional sheet.
          Inside the sheet, one solitary ball bearing orbits around
          the stars and then pushes up, off of the sheet, into an
          umbrella shaped space that rises up from the sheet.
                         
                          COOPER
           What is that?
                         
          Brand looks at the tiny particle, floating alone above its
          universe.

           That's us. That's where they've
           brought us. We're in the bulk.
                         
          Cooper and Doyle stare at the particle. The map is static
          now.
                         
          Cooper looks around. The distortions have gone. The
          instruments on the ship TONE in alarm.
                         
          Cooper walks through the map, sending the ball bearings
          scattering. He hurries to the instruments. The ship is
          moving -- picking up speed at a huge rate.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)

          EXT. ENDURANCE, VACUUM
                         
          The ship begins to close in on something in the darkness: a
          tiny point of light.
                         
          As they grow closer, they realize that it's an opening.
          They are inside a massive, hollow sphere. They have been
          the entire time.
                         
          The ship is guided out through the opening at the crown of
          the sphere.
                         
          Below them is an astonishing sight:
                         
          Our entire universe, compressed into a flattened disc, like
          a floor of stars. They are hovering above it, in the bulk,
          the space between universes.

          Brand and the others stare at the incredible display.
                         
          The ship drops down and begins to orbit around the massive
          hollow sphere between them and our universe, lower and lower
          until it is skimming just above the surface of the sphere.
                         
          In the distance, they can make out a cluster of lights.
                         
                          COOPER
           There's something out there.
                         
          The cluster of lights grows as they are propelled closer:
           129.
                         
          It's a massive space station, built onto the surface of the
          sphere.

          The Endurance glides to a gentle stop on one of the upper
          decks of the space station.
                         
          After a moment, the airlock to the ship opens and Cooper and
          the others step out, in their suits.
                         
          They walk up to the airlock doors of the station, which open
          automatically.

          After the airlock decompresses, the inner doors open.
          Standing there, waiting for them, is a familiar figure:
                         
          Tars.

           Time. That's what the bulk beings

           treasure the Chinese found. Enough
           time to let us save ourselves.
                         
          Brand looks around. The facility is massive. She sets the
          specimen case down on a table. Even the tiny creature seems
          in awe of the place.
                         
          INT. LABORATORY, SPACE STATION
                         
          Tars shows them a prototype for the gravity machine. It is
          tiny -- increasing G around two spheres that attract each
          other with a tiny force.

          contained within it. The whole room HUMS with power.
                         
          Tars pulls up a display showing the inside of the shell:
                         
          A tiny black hole spins, spewing out massive amounts of power.

          INT. SIMULATION ROOM
                         
          In the center of the room is a giant holographic globe of
          the Earth, perfect down to the tiniest detail.

           No. Not a map. This is a simulation
           of the Earth. A perfect simulation.
                         
          Tars touches the control panel. The map zooms in over Europe.
          Down onto Paris. Late 20th century:
                         
          People walk through the streets. A woman stops at a newsagent
          to buy a newspaper.
                         
          Tars touches the controls again and the map zooms out.
                         
                          TARS (CONT'D)
           They tested each of the technologies
           hundreds of times, trying to find
           the one that would cause the least
           damage and still allow us to leave
           Earth.
                         
          Suddenly, the map lights up with atomic explosions in every
          city. The sequence stops, rewinds.
                         
          This time, sped up, the Earth seems to be drying up -- great
          swaths of desert grow across Europe and Asia. Massive
          circular ships are constructed all over the face of the Earth.
                         
                          TARS (CONT'D)
           This was their best solution. A
           massive version of the box we found
           on the ice planet, allowing the entire
           human population to escape.
                         
          At a given moment, the gravity of the Earth is dropped to
          nothing and the massive ships, filled with the entire
           132.
                         
          population of the Earth, lift gently off of the planet in
          search of greener pastures.
                         
          Cooper turns away from the machine, bitter.
                         
                          COOPER
           So why didn't they return? Why didn't
           they save us?

           Because they were too late. By the
           time they found this place, the people
           who sent them were dead. They were
           unable to fulfill their mission.

                          TARS
           That was the final problem they tried
           to solve.
                         
          Tars moves on.
                         
          EXT. PLATFORM, SPACE STATION
                         
          Above them, the blackness of the sky is punctuated with
          hundreds of crystal shapes, faintly leaking starlight:
                         
          Wormholes. Brand looks up at them, entranced.

           Where do they lead?
                         
          Tars looks at an illuminated schematic on one wall, mapping
          some of the wormholes.
                         
                          TARS
           There are millions of them, connecting
           virtually every planetary system in
           the universe. There are thousands
           in our galaxy alone. But the Chinese
           stopped mapping them when they found
           what they were looking for.
                         
          Tars walks further. He stops.
                         
          The platform in front of them is dominated by a gigantic
          version of the black box that Roth found on the ice planet,
          connected to a massive power array, and pointing into the
          dark space above the sphere.

                          TARS (CONT'D)
           This was their final creation. They
           had to capture the mini black hole
           just to have enough power to try it.
                         
          Several miles above the black box, one of the wormholes glows
          far brighter than the others, crackling with radiation.
                         
                          DOYLE
           What does it do?
                         
          Cooper steps forward. Runs a hand on the cold, strange
          material the antenna is made out of. He knows exactly what
          it does.
                         
                          COOPER
           They weren't interested in the other
           wormholes because their mission was
           to return home. That one leads back
           to Earth. The Earth they were told
           to return to.
                         
          Tars walks to the controls for the device.
                         
                          BRAND
           But that's impossible...
                         
          Tars turns away from the machine.
                         
                          TARS
           It was only used once. The Chinese
           team attempted to travel back in
           time, to Earth just a few years after
           they had left.
                         
                          COOPER
           Did they make it?
                         
                          TARS
           I don't know.
                         
          Doyle looks back to Cooper.
                         
                          DOYLE
           Do you really think it works?
                         
          Cooper looks up at the machine, suddenly determined.
                         
                          COOPER
           We're going to find out.
                         
          Cooper walks out of the room. Brand follows him.

                          BRAND
           You know it doesn't work. Time travel

                          BRAND
           Yes, I do. If it worked, the Chinese
           would have suddenly discovered all
           of these incredible technologies.
           But they never made it.
                          (BEAT)
           You can't go back, Cooper. You can
           slow things down, but you can't ever
           go back. Our home is gone.
           (off his look)
           You listened to all of those messages
           from your family. If you had made
           it back, we would already know.
           There would already be some evidence.
                         
          Cooper looks at the machine.

           Roth was right, Cooper. We have to

           From here we could find a thousand

                          COOPER
           I made a promise.

          Cooper walks Brand back to the Endurance. The ship is packed
          up and repaired. Brand is looking over their work.
                         
                          COOPER

           far.
                         
          Brand holds up a small sample case containing half of the
          fractal life-form.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)

           we should double its chances of
           survival. In case I'm wrong.
                         
          Cooper takes the sample and looks at the tiny creature inside,
          trying to escape. He sets it inside the ship. Turns back
          to her.

          She points up into the great darkness above them.
                         
          Tars steps down. Moves over to them.

          Brand sees the resolve in his eyes. Knows there's no way to
          change his mind.

          They kiss passionately. Not wanting it to end but knowing
          that it must. Reluctantly, they separate. Brand turns back
          to the ship.
                         
          She pulls herself onto the ship. Cooper steps back outside
          and watches through the tiny window as the Endurance lifts
          off and disappears into the darkness.

           Let's go home.
                         
          The two men sit in silence as the ship arcs away from the
          space station and closes in on the wormhole.
                         
          Cooper hears a familiar CHIRP. He turns around:
           137.
                         
          The probe they took from the ice planet is belted securely
          into one of the seats, filled with the garbled machine code
          of the gravitational machine.
                         
                          COOPER
           The probe...
                         
          Doyle looks back.

           Rebuild the gravity machine.
                         
          Cooper stares at it, suddenly realizing something. He
          unbuckles himself.
                         
          Cooper stands and walks over to the probe. Traces the
          familiar stars and stripes carved into its side.
                         
          Cooper stares at the probe, putting it all together.

                          COOPER
           That's not what I mean. This is the
           probe I found in Galveston.
                         
          Below them, the wormhole breaks as it reaches another wormhole
          mouth that the Chinese have dropped down to a lower gravity
          well, creating a time machine.
                         
          The wormhole mouth is FLARING with radiation.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Brand said there'd be some evidence
           we'd made it. And there was. This.

           But only this. Everything will be
           destroyed except for this.
                         
          He moves toward Doyle. Doyle stands.

          Cooper moves closer to Doyle. Doyle pulls out the flair
          gun. Points it at Cooper.
                         
                          COOPER
           You don't need to do this. We won't
           make it back, but this does. The

          Doyle forces Cooper into the ship's lander. Then he closes
          the airlock.
                         
          Cooper pounds on the other side of the glass, trying to reason

          As the ship speeds toward the next wormhole, the radiation
          suddenly FLARES, annihilating the ship and everything in it.
                         
          Almost everything.

          -- Brand's father, older, studies the probe. Gives up.
                         
          -- Much later. People are moving around in the darkened
          base, scavenging equipment.

          EXT. FIELD -- DAY
                         
          A combine harvester is dead in a field, service hatch opened.
          A MAN is lying under the machine, working.
                         
          The man hauls himself out from under the huge machine. Dusts
          himself off.
                         
          It's Murph, 30s. He looks at the FARMER who is waiting for
          the verdict. Murph shakes his head.
                         
                          MURPH
           It's done. Auto-pilot's packed up
           for the last time.
                         
                          FARMER
           You can't make it work a little
           longer?
                         
                          MURPH
           Can't do anything for you. There
           aren't any more parts for these.
           Not anywhere.
                         
                          FARMER
           You don't understand. We're getting
           less than a hundred pounds per acre.
           We need to plant more, not less.
                         
          Murph looks around him at the pathetic crop of corn that
          stretches around them. The plants are feeble, barely able
          to support themselves.
           140.
                         
                          FARMER (CONT'D)
           You've got to find us some more parts,
           Murph. It's getting desperate.
           Isn't there anywhere you can look?
                         
          Murph begins packing up his tools, thinking it over.
                         
          INT. HANGAR -- DAY
                         
          Murph stares at the darkened shape of a plane under a tarp.
          He stares at the tarp, unsure if he wants to keep going.
                         
          He pulls the tarp off, revealing Cooper's old Piper Cub. He
          checks over the engine, lights, prop. Turns the key. Fires
          her up. The diesel wakes with a GRUNT.
                         
          EXT. AIRSTRIP -- DAY
                         
          Murph wheels the old plane out onto the field by hand.
                         
          EXT. SKIES OVER THE SOUTHWEST -- DAY
                         
          The ancient plane skirts the San Gabriels.
                         
          EXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND
                         
          Murph sets the plane down.
                         
          He parks the plane under a copse of trees and climbs down.
                         
          He scans the horizon. Nothing. Is this the place?
                         
          EXT. FOREST -- DAY
                         
          Murph pushes his way through the undergrowth. Stops.
                         
          He's standing at the blast doors to the facility. They've
          been blown open with dynamite.
                         
          INT. NASA FACILITY -- DAY
                         
          Murph lets himself inside. Lights a flare.
                         
          The place has been gutted. Thieves and scavengers have taken
          almost everything.
                         
          Murph finds one of the robots, or what's left of it -- it's
          been stripped, leaving only the bare composite skeleton.
          The empty eye sockets stare back at Murph.
                         
          Murph looks around the place. There is nothing left to
          salvage. He turns to leave. Hears a familiar CHIRP.
                         
          In the corner, under a pile of rain-soaked garbage:
           141.
                         
          The probe.
                         
          No one has bothered to steal it. Murph stares at it.
                         
          INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- NIGHT
                         
          Murph sweeps detritus off of an ancient computer mainframe
          that survived the looting. He hooks the probe up to it.
                         
          After a minute, the screen fills with a picture of an ice-
          covered planet. Then nothing. The rest of the probe's drive
          is filled with garbage, noise.
                         
          Murph switches off the screen.
                         
          He stands. Begins to leave without the probe. Stops. Turns
          back. Picks it up and takes it with him.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, MURPH'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Murph is hunched over the probe, trying to pull data off of
          it with a defibrillator. He has incorporated an ancient
          laptop into the chain, and is tweaking values on it, trying
          to decrypt the contents.
                         
          His WIFE, several months pregnant, turns back to him from
          the stove.
                         
                          MURPH'S WIFE
           Would you get that thing off of the
           table?
                         
          Murph nods, absorbed. Keys in a final tweak to the decryption
          software. Hits return.
                         
          Suddenly, the screen begins filling with data.
                         
          Murph stares at it, wide eyed.

          Murph, now in his 40s, is putting the finishing touches on a
          large machine. Although slightly different, we recognize
          some of the components and their configuration:
                         
          It's a crude version of the gravitational device.
                         
          Murph double checks it, then fires up a small gas powered
          generator. Throws a breaker, feeding power to the unit.
                         
          The unit lights up. HUMS. But nothing happens.
           142.
                         
          Murph, disappointed but undaunted, shuts it down and begins
          checking it over. He hears a noise at the door. Turns back.
          His daughter, Emily, 8, is standing at the door.
                         
                          EMILY COOPER

           Did I?
                         
          He looks at the impossible nest of wires. Shakes his head.
                         
                          MURPH (CONT'D)
           All right. Let me get my jacket.
                         
          Murph picks up his jacket from the workbench. Next to it on
          the bench is a shortwave radio playing STATIC.
                         
                          EMILY COOPER

                          MURPH
           I have no idea.
                         
          Murph switches off the lights and they walk out.
                         
          After a moment, the radio CRACKLES to life in the darkness.

          Murph, 50s, slightly gray, sits at his kitchen table. He
          hears a distant RUMBLE.
                         
          He looks up. His wife is standing by the sink.

           Out in the barn. She's been tinkering
           with your old projects.
           143.
                         
          Murph stands up. The roof of the barn is visibly shaking.
          He steps outside.
                         
          EXT. YARD, MURPH'S HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          Murph moves towards the barn, concerned. The shaking is
          growing stronger -- the entire structure is buckling.
                         
          Emily, now 18, backs out of the barn.
                         
                          EMILY COOPER
           Dad... I'm sorry... I made some
           changes to the machine. I think I
           did something wrong.
                         
          Murph puts an arm around his daughter and as they watch, the
          entire barn IMPLODES. Their tractor begins sliding towards
          the wreckage of the barn, chunky tires plowing up the soil.
                         
          Finally, the RUMBLING STOPS as the power lines short out in
          a FIERY display.
                         
          As the dust clears, Murph and his daughter examine the mess:
                         
          The entire barn has been crushed into a tiny ball.
                         
          Murph looks at his daughter.
                         
                          MURPH
           Do you remember what you changed?
                         
          Wide-eyed, she thinks about it. Then nods.

          This is North America. But it doesn't look much like it.
                         
          Mother Nature has just about wiped the slate clean. Most of
          the vegetation is gone, and unchecked winds sweep across the
          barren plains. Patches of ice lie think on the ground, as
          if a heavy snow has come and gone.

          clouds above and settles gently onto the plain.
                         
          The hatch opens and Cooper steps out. He takes a cautious
          look around. He is holding the fractal life in its small
          container.
                         
          The clouds are threatening, but the weather looks calm enough

          INT. COLLAPSED HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          Cooper stands in the middle of his kitchen. Two walls are
          missing and the rest is collapsed in a heap. But he can
          still see where he used to feed his kids breakfast.
                         
          He has kept his promise. Several hundred years too late.
                         
          Cooper hunkers down, staring at the space where his kids
          used to be. Rainwater covers the ancient formica.
                         
          It has taken him years to finally reach this place. He has
          had plenty of time to come to grips with what he might find.
          But nothing has prepared him for this:
                         
          He is completely alone. Nothing is left.
                         
          INT. COLLAPSED FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper is still sitting there when the ice storm hits.
                         
          Unchecked by trees or vegetation, the wind rockets through
          the house, blasting Cooper and pelting what's left of the
          structure with fist-sized hail.
                         
          Cooper takes shelter against the remaining wall. He's going
          to have to sit this one out -- the hail and winds are the
          brutal descendants of the weather he knew. They'll finish
          him off if he steps back outside.
                         
          As he watches, the pool of water on the kitchen floor freezes
          over in seconds.

          Cooper shivers, pressed against the wall. The storm is still
          raging outside. He is freezing to death. He has to move
          now or he will die. He pulls the hood tight around his face
          and stumbles outside.
                         
          EXT. SNOWBOUND FIELD -- DAY
                         
          Cooper makes his way through the blinding snow. He tries to
          find his way, but the ship has been consumed by the blizzard.
                         
          He stumbles to the ground, dropping the glass case with the
          fractal wildlife in it. The case shatters.
                         
          Cooper tries to stand back up, but his strength is dwindling.
           145.
                         
          As he watches, the fractal wildlife creeps tentatively out
          of its broken habitat. It forms together against the cold.
                         
          After a moment, it burrows into the ice. As it does, the
          ice glows faintly. It seems to be right at home.
                         
          Cooper laughs, glimpsing the outline of a plan. Was this
          what the beings who made the wormhole intended all along?
                         
          Cooper suddenly spots the outline of the ship through the
          driving snow. He stumbles back up to his feet and struggles
          a few more steps, then stumbles again, spent.
                         
          Finally, he sits down in the snow to die.
                         
          As his senses flicker in and out, he is struck with memories
          of his boys, so vivid he reaches out for them, crawling
          forward in the snow.
                         
          He stops, and laughs, remembering what Case told him about
          what happens when humans die.
                         
          He struggles to his feet and stumbles a few more feet,
          eventually coming to rest just steps from the ship.
                         
          Cooper takes a final step. Finally, he collapses under his
          ship, as the wind continues to HOWL around him.
                         
          As the snow clears for a moment, Cooper is alone on a vast
          arctic tundra. He will die alone.
                         
                         BLACK
                         
                         FADE IN:
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY
                         
          Cooper wakes.
                         
          He is in a sunlit room. A breeze rustles the curtains as it
          makes its way in through a large open window.
                         
          Cooper sits up. As he a does, a control panel on the wall
          TONES gently, as if in response to his movement.
                         
          He stands and looks around. He can see sunlight through the
          open windows and hear people -- kids YELLING as they play.
          He moves toward the window. Reaches for the curtains. Before
          he can, the door opens behind him.
                         
          A WOMAN in a white coat steps in, smiling warmly.
                         
                          DOCTOR
           Good morning. Don't go outside just
           yet, Mr. Cooper.
                          (MORE)
           146.
                         
                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
           (offers him a pill)
           This will help with the
           disorientation.
                         
          Cooper opens his mouth to talk, but his voice is cracked.
          He gives up. Swallows the pill.
                         
                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
           Wait a minute for that to take effect.
           It can be a bit of an adjustment.
           (looks him over)
           You had some frostbite. Nothing too
           serious.
                         
          As she talks, Cooper looks past her to the window.
                         
                          COOPER
           Where am I?
                         
                          DOCTOR
                          (SMILES)
           It's a bit of a coincidence, really.
           When the rangers found you, we were
           the nearest facility.
                         
                          COOPER
           What's coincidence? What is this
           place?
                         
                          DOCTOR
           We have a lot to show you.
                         
          The doctor reaches for the curtains. She offers him a hand.
          Cooper declines the help and steps outside.
                         
          EXT. HOSPICE, COOPER STATION -- DAY
                         
          Cooper is standing on a rooftop deck of a four-story building
          in a medium-sized city surrounded by fields. But as the
          road and the buildings stretch into the distance, the
          landscape curves up, not down.
                         
          The entire landscape is contained within a huge cylinder-
          shaped space station.
                         
          Cooper stumbles, and reaches instinctively out. The doctor
          catches him.
                         
                          DOCTOR
           You're OK. We get this from people
           who move here from planetary colonies
           all the time.
           147.
                         
                          COOPER
           Where... where are we?
                         
                          DOCTOR
           Like I said. It was a coincidence.
           There was a facility closer to Earth,
           but they had a problem, so you wound
           up here.
           (off his look)
           This is the Space Station Joseph A.
           Cooper.
                         
          Cooper takes in the incredible surroundings. A thousand
          feet above them, black specks are sprinkled over an ocean of
          green -- Jersey milking cows grazing in a field of wild grass.
                         
                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
           I've got someone who wants to meet
           you.
                         
          Cooper looks at her.
                         
          INT. INTENSIVE CARE ROOM, HOSPICE, COOPER STATION -- DAY
                         
          Cooper steps inside. The room is dark, still, the only noise
          is the labored RATTLE of an old man struggling to breathe.
                         
          Cooper steps closer to the bed. The man's skin is paper-
          thin. He is ancient.
                         
                          DOCTOR
           He was moved here after they found
           you. He's a little old for a
           transfer, but they made an exception.
                         
          Cooper hovers at the back of the room, unsure. He turns to
          the doctor, questioning. Then he notices the pictures on
          the old man's desk:
                         
          There are dozens of them. Children, grandchildren. Then
          the older ones -- the man's own parents. Grandparents.
          Cooper spots a tiny framed picture with someone he recognizes:
                         
          Murph, 80 years old, surrounded by his daughter and her
          family. They are standing in front of a re-opened Cape
          Canaveral, and a huge spaceship under construction.
                         
          Cooper picks up the picture and stares at it.
                         
          The doctor points to a shy little boy hiding behind Murph's
          leg in the picture.
                         
                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
           That's him.
           148.
                         
          She points to the old man lying in the bed.
                         
                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
           His name is Anthony Welling. Anthony
           Cooper Welling.
                          (SMILES)
           He's your great great grandson.
           He's been waiting a long time for
           you.
                         
          Cooper's eyes well with tears. He steps over to the bed and
          looks down at the ancient man, teetering on the edge of death.
                         
          The old man looks at him, eyes widening in excitement. He
          strains, trying to reach the bedside table. He's trying to
          reach the drawer. Cooper helps him open it.
                         
          Inside is a simple, familiar wristwatch. The old man
          carefully takes out the watch. He gives the watch a few
          winds and, hands shaking, offers it to Cooper.
                         
          Cooper, eyes filling with tears, closes his hand over the
          old man's hand, enveloping both the watch and the man's hand.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          EXT. CORNFIELD, COOPER STATION -- MORNING
                         
          Cooper is sitting in a well-appointed office. A middle-aged
          BUREAUCRAT smiles at him from the far side of a huge desk.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           You're a hero, Mr. Cooper. Let's
           just start off by saying that. It's
           an incredible and... unexpected honor
           to have you here with us.
                         
          Cooper smiles, uncomfortable.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D)
           None of us would be here without the
           efforts of you and the other
           crewmembers of the Endurance.
           (smiles, unconvincingly)
           So I don't want you to take this the
           wrong way. But there are some
           questions I've been told to ask.
                         
          The man looks petrified, like he's been instructed to grill
          George Washington on his expense reports.
                         
                          COOPER
           Shoot.
           149.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           The rangers who found you reported
           that you had released a sample of an
           alien life-form into the wild. Which
           is, unfortunately, against
           regulations.
                         
                          COOPER
           It was last of its kind. Their planet
           was destroyed.
                         
          The administrator cues up a series of images on his computer.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           The rangers attempted to isolate the
           life-form, but it had already spread
           out of control. It seems to be
           thriving.
                         
          He shows Cooper a satellite image of north america. A
          considerable portion of the frozen tundra is glowing.
                         
          Cooper begins laughing. Which makes the administrator even
          less comfortable.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D)
           Can you tell me why you... elected
           to release the life-form back on
           earth?
                         
          Cooper is still laughing.
                         
                          COOPER
           Because that was the plan.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           Whose plan?
                         
                          COOPER
                          (SMILES)
           I don't know.
                         
          The administrator tries to smile back. Makes a few notes in
          his file. Changes the subject.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           My assistant tells me you've applied
           for a position with the exploration
           fleet.
                         
                          COOPER
           Feel like I should be pulling my
           weight.
           150.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           That's admirable, Mr. Cooper. The
           truth is, most of the fleet's
           personnel are automated. There are
           a small number of crewed ships. But
           there are great numbers of candidates.
           Very well trained candidates.
                         
                          COOPER
           I was hoping to enroll in a course.
           Try to get myself up to speed on the
           new systems.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           I don't want you to take this the
           wrong way, Mr. Cooper -- like I
           said, you're a hero. But the truth
           is we have somewhat limited resources.
                         
          Cooper remembers this conversation. He looks down.
                         
                          COOPER
           No one's heard anything from Brand?
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           I'm sorry. Officially, she's been
           listed as missing for over 200 years.
           Mind you, I guess you turned up
           eventually, didn't you?
                         
                          COOPER
           Am I really going to hurt anybody by
           going to look for her? I just need
           a small ship. I made a promise.
                         
          The bureaucrat looks down. Is he really going to have to
          tell this guy the lay of the land?
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           Listen. Mr. Cooper. You're a hero.
           You're the oldest man in the human
           race. Don't you want to take it
           easy?
           (off his look)
           I hope you understand, we all you
           hold you in the highest possible
           regard.
                          (QUIET)
           Which is why they're never going to
           let you go off by yourself in a
           spaceship. I'm sorry.
                         
          Cooper looks at his hands. He's got a couple centuries on
          the bureaucrat in Earth years, but looks ten years younger.
          He puts his hands in his pockets.
           151.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D)
           I've got some good news, however.
                          (BIG SMILE)
           We all know about your early life,
           Mr Cooper. I wrote a paper on it
           when I was a boy. And I think we
           found something you'll really enjoy.
                         
          EXT. CORNFIELD, COOPER STATION -- DAY
                         
          Corn blows in an artificial breeze. A red tractor makes its
          way through the field, which curves gently up in the distance.
                         
           ADMINISTRATOR (V.O.)
           The machines do most of the work, of
           course, but we were able to get you
           a few acres. You're going to be a
           farmer again.
                         
          After a moment, the tractor stops. Cooper climbs down from
          the seat. Looks at the front steering linkage, which is
          jammed with an errant tree branch. He wipes his forehead
          and begins working the branch out of the machine.
                         
          He looks miserable.
                         
          A robot, a similar unit to Tars, walks over. Offers Cooper
          a bottle of water. Cooper accepts it.
                         
          EXT. HANGAR BAY, COOPER STATION
                         
          Cooper stands on an observation deck, high above the hangar
          floor. Below him, bright young things in uniforms climb
          into sleek-looking spaceships and prepare to set out.
                         
          EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND, COOPER STATION
                         
          Cooper sits in the stands, listening to the familiar crack
          of the bat as an intramural team from the university
          practices.
                         
          Cooper watches. He looks bored.
                         
          The kid up to bat cracks a pop fly. For a second, the catcher
          shuffles back and forth, trying to get himself into position.
          But the ball never returns. The catcher YELLS out a warning.
                         
          Above, the ball begins to slowly fall up, not down, toward
          the town center above.
                         
          After a second, the ball smashes through a skylight of a
          building high above them.
                         
          Cooper watches as the kid rounds the bases, laughing.
           152.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE, COOPER STATION -- DAY
                         
          Cooper's robot sits at the kitchen table. Cooper is fiddling
          around in the back of his head.

          He begins putting the robot back together.
                         
          EXT. FARMHOUSE, COOPER STATION -- TWILIGHT
                         
          Cooper sits on his porch, joined by the same robot as before.
          They watch as the space station rotates lazily out of
          alignment with the local star, casting the inside of the
          cylinder into shade, then darkness.
                         
          The shadow races past them. Another day. Another night.
                         
          EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION
                         
          A maintenance worker finishes looking over one of the sleek-
          looking spacecraft. He packs up his tools and heads out.
                         
          After a moment, two figures pick their way across the hangar
          floor, sticking to the shadows.
                         
          As they reach the first ship in the line, we get a better
          look. It's Cooper and his robot pal. The robot is wearing
          a baseball cap and carrying a toolbox.
                         
          Cooper gestures to the robot, who sets down the toolbox with
          a click against the mirror-like floor.
                         
          Cooper shakes his head, annoyed, at the robot, and puts his
          finger to his lips. The robot nods, bashful.
                         
          Cooper waves a small handheld computer near the skin of the
          ship until it lights up. Then he punches in a few codes.
          Nothing happens. He punches in a few more.
           153.
                         
          Suddenly, the hatch opens with a HISS.
                         
          INT. SHIP
                         
          Cooper moves quickly to the cockpit of the ship. Looks over
          the controls. The robot straps himself in next to him.
          Cooper looks up through the windows.
                         
          The inky black void of space beckons.
                         
          Cooper smiles and reaches for the controls.
                         
                          COOPER
           Where do you want to go first?
                         
          The robot thinks it over.
                         
          EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION
                         
          The technician walks back into the hangar. He walks along
          the row of ships till he reaches the last one.
                         
          It's not there.
                         
          He looks out into the blackness of the void. Sees a tiny
          glowing speck, getting smaller and smaller.
                         
                         END

1   EXT. THE STAMPEDE TRAIL - DAY                                    1

    SUPER:
    Tuesday, April 28th 1992

    WIDE-SHOT: A vast, snow-blanketed wilderness that sits
    beneath the icy summits of the highest mountain range in
    North America. This is BIG Alaska.

    A beat up 4x4 pick-up enters very small into the upper
    left corner of frame on an unkept, snow-packed road, and
    comes to a stop. A figure exits the passenger side and
    moves around the front of the truck. We can just make
    out the rifle sticking out of his backpack. We HEAR a
    very distant "Thank You" as the figure walks away from
    the road and away from the truck, seemingly into nowhere.

                           DRIVER
              Hey!

    The figure with backpack and rifle, henceforth BACKPACK,
    stopping in his tracks, turns around in the direction of
    the truck.

                           DRIVER (CONT'D)
              Come here.

    BACKPACK walks back to the truck.    As he approaches the
    driver's door, we

    CUT IN TO: TIGHT SHOT over the back-packed shoulder onto
    the DRIVER.

                           DRIVER (CONT'D)
                     (referring to items we see
                      sitting on dashboard)
              You left your watch, your comb, your
              change...

    We STAY on the DRIVER as BACKPACK speaks:

                           BACKPACK
              Keep it.

                           DRIVER
              I don't want your money.    And I already
              have a watch.

                           BACKPACK
              If you don't take it, I'm gonna throw it
              away. I don't want to know what time it
              is, what day it is, or where I am.
                           (MORE)

                                                                2.

                          BACKPACK (CONT'D)
             I don't want to see anybody. None of
             that matters.

The driver reaches behind the seat of the truck, pulls
out an old pair of rubber work boots.

                          DRIVER
                    (handing him the boots)
             Take em.

There is a pause as Backpack considers accepting the
boots.

                          DRIVER (CONT'D)
             If you make it out alive, give me a call,
             and I'll tell you how to get the boots
             back to me.

We can feel over Backpack's shoulder that he has taken
the boots and is putting them on but we STAY on the
driver.

                          BACKPACK
             Hey, do me a favor, will ya?     Take a
             picture of me.

Backpack hands him an Instamatic camera and starts
walking backwards. We PULL BACK with him. And he
maintains his back to us. When he stops, we CONTINUE
until he is FULL-FRAME, head-to-toe from behind, posing.

                                                          CUT TO:

CU: driver

CLICK.   He snaps the shot.
Backpack re-enters frame in an OVER-SHOULDER.          Driver
hands him the camera.

                          DRIVER
             You gonna be alright?

                          BACKPACK
             I'll be better than that.
                    (I'll be who I am.)

As Backpack exits the frame, we SLOWLY ZOOM past the
concerned face of the driver onto the loose change, the
comb, and the watch on the dash.

                                                              3.



    Throughout the ZOOM, the SOUND of FOOTSTEPS CRUNCHING THE
    SNOW, FADE into the distance.

                                                     BACK TO:

    ORIGINAL WIDE-SHOT:

    We see the small form of the truck and the smaller form
    of the Backpacker walking away from the truck until the
    Backpacker has exited the frame. The truck takes a BEAT,
    turns around in the snow, and accelerates back into the
    direction from which it came. As the truck exits frame,
    we -

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:


2   EXT. COMMENCEMENT GROUNDS, EMORY UNIVERSITY, ATLANTA -         2
    DAY

    SUPER:
    May 1990

    The crowd of family and friends, and of course, students.
    Assembled on fold-out chairs. The broad lawn.

    INTERCUT: CHRIS MCCANDLESS. We don't see his face, just
    feet pounding the pavement at an increasing pace.

    One by one the names of graduates announced. Their
    bright young faces, capped heads, and gowns, glide up to
    the podium to accept their diplomas.

    INTERCUT: Chris, on his run, sweatshirt hood over head.
    Amongst assembled crowd and family we find: THE
    MCCANDLESS': BILLIE, mid to late forties with dark
    striking eyes; WALT, a taciturn man, early fifties; and
    CARINE, eighteen, pretty with her mother's eyes and waist
    length brown hair, a gold crucifix dangles from her neck.
    They look around, looking for Chris, he's nowhere in
    sight.

    INTERCUT: Chris, in a shower (PHOTO-SONICS) He TURNS INTO
    CAMERA, the water streaming down his face.

    From the announcement podium comes the name of their son
    and brother, CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON MCCANDLESS. The
    McCandless family increasingly panicked over Chris'
    absence, when almost magically, he appears in full cap
    and gown.

                                                       4.



Disregarding the steps that lead up to the podium
platform, the small-framed but athletic CHRIS MCCANDLESS
leaps jubilantly onto the stage in a single bound,
frightening Billie, a little wince from Walt, and Carine
"That's our Chris." And just as quickly as Chris has
been handed his diploma, he civilly descends the platform
steps.

                                                TIME CUT:

SLO-MO: A ballet of graduation caps float upward into a
frame of blue sky. We HEAR Chris' voice OVER this image
as we intermittently cut away from the caps against the
sky to focus on his parents.

(HIGH ANGLE: floating caps in FOREGROUND, Walt and Billie
delight upon the caps.) An outer glee in sharp contrast
to voice over:

                       CHRIS (V.O.)
          I see them standing at the formal gates
          of their colleges,
          I see my father strolling out
          under the ochre sandstone arch, the
          red tiles glinting like bent
          plates of blood behind his head,
          I see my mother with a few light books at
          her hip
          standing at the pillar made of tiny
          bricks with the
          wrought-iron gate still open behind her,
          its
          sword-tips black in the May air,
          they are about to graduate, they are
          about to get married,
          they are kids, they are dumb, all they
          know is they are
          innocent, they would never hurt anybody.
          I want to go up to them and say Stop,
          don't do it--she's the wrong woman,
          he's the wrong man, you are going to do
          things
          you cannot imagine you would ever do,
          you are going to do bad things to
          children,
          you are going to suffer in ways you never
          heard of,
          you are going to want to die. I want to
          go
          up to them there in the late May sunlight
          and say it,
          her hungry pretty blank face turning to
          me,
                       (MORE)

                                                             5.

                           CHRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              her pitiful beautiful untouched body,
              his arrogant handsome blind face turning
              to me,
              his pitiful beautiful untouched body,
              but I don't do it. I want to live. I
              take them up like the male and female
              paper dolls and bang them together
              at the hips like chips of flint as if to
              strike sparks from them, I say...

    The last graduation cap falls out of the `blue sky'
    frame, and into...

                                                         CUT TO:


3   INT. ATLANTA RESTAURANT - LATER                                3
    (Graduation ceremony wardrobe)

    Walt and Billie sit at a table. A Cadillac can be seen
    through the window (ATLANTA LANDMARK), parked beside the
    restaurant.

                           BILLIE
              Here they are.

    Walt looks out the window and sees Chris drive up in his
    old yellow Datsun with Carine in the passenger seat
    beside him, and pulls up to the space beside the
    Cadillac.


4   INT. DATSUN                                                    4

    Chris is holding a book from which he reads aloud the
    LAST LINE OF THE POEM...
                           CHRIS
              I say...Do what you are going to do,
              and I will tell about it.

                           CARINE
              Who wrote that?

                           CHRIS
              Well, it could've been either one of us,
              couldn't it?

    He hands a book of Sharon Olds' poetry to her.

                           CHRIS (CONT'D)
              There's a lot of great poems in there.

                                                            6.



                           CARINE
              Thanks, big brother.

    They exit the car and frame.


5   INT. ATLANTA RESTAURANT - SAME                                5

    Chris and Carine join Walt and Billie at the table.
    Billie gets up and gives Chris a big hug.

                           BILLIE
              You scared the daylights out of me,
              jumping on to that stage, oh my god.

    Chris gives Carine a look.   Walt extends his hand to
    Chris.

                           WALT
              Congratulations, son.

    They all sit and pick up menus.

                           CHRIS
              I'm starving.

    The foods on the table.   Chris is devouring a steak.

                           CHRIS
              My grades are gonna be good enough, I
              think, to get into Harvard Law.
                           WALT
              That's a big deal. What do you have left
              in your college fund?

                           CHRIS
              It's an inheritance, dad. I've only been
              spending it as a college fund...Exactly
              twenty-four thousand five hundred dollars
              and sixty-eight cents.

                           BILLIE
              That's very specific.

                           CHRIS
              I had to go to the bank this morning.

                                                   7.



                       WALT
          Well, we'll certainly contribute the
          balance for Harvard.

                       CHRIS
          Yeah. I've got to figure out what I'm
          going to do. I got a lot of things to
          pack and organize here first.

                       BILLIE
          I'm so glad you're getting out of that
          place you're living. It was so much
          nicer when you lived on campus.

                       WALT
          You'll come to Annandale before you
          disappear on us, won't you?

                       CHRIS
                 (reluctantly)
          Sure, I will.

Carine's not so sure.

                         BILLIE
          You promise?

          Well, your father and I want to make a
          present to you.
                       WALT
          We want to get you out of that junker.
                       CHRIS
          What's a junker?

Walt points outside to the Datsun.

                         CHRIS (CONT'D)
          The Datsun?

                        WALT
          Yes.   We want to get you a new car.

                       CHRIS
                 (appalled)
          A new car? Why the hell would I want a
          new car? The Datsun runs great.

                     (Mocking the Cadillac)
              Do you think I want some fancy boat? Or
              are you worried about what the neighbors
              might think?

                           BILLIE
              We weren't going to get you a Cadillac,
              Chris. Just a nice new car that's safe
              to drive. You don't know when that
              thing's just going to suddenly blow up.

                           CHRIS
              Blow up? Blow up?! Are you guys crazy?
              It's a great car. I don't need a new
              car. I don't want a new car. I don't
              want anything. Thing, thing, thing.

    Under the table, Carine jabs Chris' leg.    Chris returning
    to polite -

                           CHRIS (CONT'D)
              But, thanks anyway.

                           WALT
              Everything's gotta be difficult.

                           CHRIS
              I said thank you. I just don't want
              anything.

    The group returns to some superficial calm.

                           CARINE
              I wouldn't say no to a new car.

              Shut up, Chris.

              Seriously, I'll pay you back.

    DAY

    OVER Chris' shoulder, he frisbees his graduation cap from
    the upstairs window to his parents parting Cadillac on
    the street.

                                                             9.


    As they wave goodbye, Carine catches the cap from the
    backseat window. And with a parting smile to her
    brother, she poses with it on her own head. Chris smiles
    and waves goodbye.

    As the Cadillac drifts away, his smile disappears into
    something other than sadness.

                                                    TIME CUT:


8   INT. OFF-CAMPUS ROOMING HOUSE - NIGHT                         8

    In a warm ambient light, we SEE a black and white poster
    on a barren wall: Poncho-clad Clint Eastwood from "The
    Good, The Bad, And The Ugly."

    We TILT DOWN a stack of books sitting on the floor -
    Tolstoy, Stegner, Thoreau, Jack London, and Pasternak.
    Beside them, a camper's backpack.

    Chris sits in introspection at his desk by candlelight.
    The room is spare, supporting his monkish lifestyle. But
    on the desk before him, he counts out $500.68 from a bank
    envelope. He pockets those bills and change, then removes
    a check for $24,000 made out to OXFAM America from the
    same bank envelope. He scribbles a note: These are all
    my savings. Feed someone with it. Signed, Chris
    McCandless. He then slides the note and the check into a
    pre-addressed Oxford Famine Relief Fund (in Boston)
    envelope.

    He pulls his wallet from his back pocket. Pulls all the
    cards and pictures from its sleeves. Considering each,
    he flicks them into a trash bin, one by one. Finally
    coming to his social security card, he holds it to the
    candles flame. As the flame burns bright we -
                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

    MUSIC (Gordon Peterson's BIG HARD SUN or as radio source
    Tom Petty's FREE FALLING) rises and PRESENTATION TITLES
    OVER:

    A 1982 DATSUN B210 emerges from the rising sun as the car
    heads west out of Atlanta. (HIGHWAY 20 TO 78 TO 40)

MONTAGE: We travel with Chris and his Datsun through the
towns and open highways, landscapes and landmarks, days
and nights, that lead to the Mojave desert in the West.

                                                              10.


     (In contrast to his introspection of the previous night,
     Chris is buoyant throughout this sequence.)


10   EXT. DESERT, SOMEWHERE BETWEEN KINGMAN, ARIZONA AND LAS     10
     VEGAS, NEVADA - SUNSET

     (CRANE SHOT) We see Chris stop the Datsun in the middle
     of the desert road. We (CRANE?) DOWN to a close-up
     through the windshield. Chris looks left. Then, right.
     Into the rearview mirror, and suddenly turns the wheel,
     veering the Datsun off the paved highway into the vast
     desert.

     As we CRANE back UP, the Datsun moves into the horizon.

     END PRESENTATION TITLES. FADE MUSIC


11   EXT. DETRITAL WASH - TWILIGHT                               11

     ANGLE: WEST-FACING

     The Datsun sits in the magical pastel twilight just
     before darkness slides over the desert. It is positioned
     at the foot of a wash wall that edges the soup bowl.

     ANGLE: EAST-FACING

     The Datsun, a yellow speck in the frame. Coyotes yap at
     the moon. Other than that, no sound on the desert floor.

     In the distance, voluptuous cumulonimbus clouds boil
     upward catching the last rosy glow of the west-setting
     sun over the rim of the upper Detrital watershed.
     We see strobe bursts of lightning followed by muffled
     thunder illuminating the thunder clouds from within.
     Short SERIES OF ANGLES as we MOVE IN on the distant
     gullies and ravines, starting to run with copious amounts
     of water.


12   INT. DATSUN - NIGHT                                         12

     Chris McCandless, in the same clothes he had been in back
     in the rooming house, sleeps in the back seat of the
     Datsun. His head supported by his backpack. We begin to
     HEAR a rumble. But this rumble is not thunder. It
     rapidly builds into an alarming ROAR. The roar grows to
     a deafening level. Chris awakens.

                                                            11.


     As he peeks up from the backseat looking forward through
     the windshield, he just barely catches sight of the
     leading edge of a flash flood. A four-foot high wall of
     water, mud and debris makes impact with the Datsun,
     momentarily enveloping it in water. Suddenly the car is
     SLAMMED against the cliff. CRACK! Chris sits upright,
     disoriented.

     POV: As far as the eye can see in the desert moonlight,
     water has taken over the desert with a flash flood.

     However, there's no panic in Chris' face as we observe
     him past a new crack in the wet windshield. The water,
     while violent seems to have topped off just above the
     wheels. Chris gets a slight smile on his face, as the
     car settles into its new position below the cliff. He
     returns to sleep.

                                                       CUT TO:


13   EXT. DESERT - DAY                                          13

     What remains of Chris' travelling money burns in a pile
     beside the Datsun on the sun-lit but muddy desert floor.

     We follow a very long set of footprints (CAMERA
     TRACKING/TRUE VERTICAL) away from the burning cash
     through the mud, finally tilting up to the footprint
     maker, Chris. Slogging toward high ground.

     WIDE-SHOT: We see the abandoned Datsun nearly a mile
     behind Chris as he walks toward us wearing his backpack.
     He comes very close to camera (only a day or two's
     stubble on his face) and as we PAN him 180, we see as
     much wilderness before us as we did behind.

Chris McCandless speaking to camera holds a microphone in
a shadowy room, doing his Geraldo Rivera. It's tongue-in-
cheek at best.

                       CHRIS
          This is Emory University freshman Chris
          McCandless reporting from the vault at
          Thompson Hall.

He indicates a hatchway in the floor leading to a
brightly lit corridor below.

                       CHRIS (CONT'D)
          We have just dynamited the hatchway and
          are the first human beings to step foot
          into this vault in over a hundred years.
          Somewhere in here lies the secret of the
          great beast within us all. A beast built
          on lies, corruption, and greed.

We HEAR a GROWLING SOUND from behind Chris.

                       CHRIS (CONT'D)
          And there it is! The legendary beast
          Mocra.

CAMERA quickly PANS to a blanket-wrapped, crawling FELLOW
STUDENT in a grotesque Halloween mask.

We MOVE INTO CU on the monster growling.

QUICK PAN back to Chris.

                       CHRIS (CONT'D)
                 (in mock fright)
          We've got to get out of here quick and re-
          secure the hatch while we make a plan of
          how to kill the beast.

CAMERA SHAKES all over like a bad horror film trying to
stay with Chris as he makes a quick escape down the
hatchway into the University dorm corridor.

CLUMSY VIDEO TIME CUT: Chris nailing the last nail in
the hatchway from below. He climbs down the steps where
he exchanges his hammer for his microphone from an off-
camera source.

                       CHRIS (CONT'D)
          Well, it looks like we've succeeded -

We HEAR the monster's GROWL from above.

                                                              13.



                            CHRIS (CONT'D)
               - at least for the moment, in sealing the
               beast back into the vault. Your humble
               reporter, Chris McCandless will now
               struggle with the journalistic question
               of ethics: Will he retain his reporter's
               objectiveness or save the future of human
               truth by slaying this awful beast?

     He gives us a look of vaudevillian puzzlement - what will
     he do?

     CONTINUE VIDEO:

     We pick up with Chris in a corridor outside a door with a
     cheap paper-and-tape label announcing the adjacent room
     as the office of Ted Turner.

                            CHRIS (CONT'D)
               Once again, your humble reporter Chris
               McCandless.

     We HEAR OS students commenting on Chris and his video
     crew:

                            OS STUDENT
               What is this? Filmmaking 101?

                            OS STUDENT #2
               Point the camera at me. I'm a star.

     Chris speaking straight to camera, still tongue-in-cheek:

                            CHRIS
                      (with a Wizard of Oz tone)
               Pay no attention to the voices behind the
               curtain.

15   INT. WOULD-BE TED TURNER OFFICE                             15

     A FELLOW STUDENT PLAYING TED TURNER with obvious fake
     mustache is locked into an episode of Matlock on his
     television set as our bold reporter, Chris, barges in.

                            CHRIS
               Ted! We've got a monster in the vault.
               It represents all the corruption, the
               deceit, and greed within us all. I must
               slay it.

                                                       14.



                        TED TURNER/STUDENT
                 (worst acting we've ever
                  seen)
          McCandless, how many times have I had to
          tell you? I've had to tell you that you
          are a journalist and you can't get
          personally involved in your cases...or
          your stories.

                       CHRIS
          Ted! I know how to kill it. And I'm the
          only one who knows. You can't keep
          sending me on stories and expecting me to
          do nothing! I look like some kind of an
          idiot.

                       TED TURNER/STUDENT
          Do you know who you're talking to?   I'm
          Ted Turner.

Behind Chris in the corridor outside Ted's office, a
PANICKED STUDENT arrives at the door.

                       PANICKED STUDENT
          McCandless! You've got to hurry! The
          monster is scratching at the hatchway.
          He'll be out in no time.

                       TED TURNER/STUDENT
                 (threatening)
          It'll mean your job, Chris McCandless.

                       CHRIS
                 (to Ted)
          That's it, Ted. Fire me if you want but
          this beast must be slayed.
Microphone in hand, Chris makes haste. The CAMERA RUNS
WITH HIM out the door, through the corridor, up a set of
steps to the hatchway. As he arrives, the monster
appears above him in the hatchway crawl space having
pulled off the board Chris had nailed.

                       CHRIS (CONT'D)
                 (into camera)
          This is the only thing that can kill the
          monster. It's gonna be risky but without
          great risk, there is no freedom. So we
          will now hear from the famous singer -
          Chris McCandless.

                                                      15.



A piano is PUSHED INTO FRAME beside Chris. A YOUNG BLACK
STUDENT pulls a stool in front of the piano and begins to
play. Chris begins to serenade the monster,
intermittently sharing the serenade directly into camera
as well. He bursts into an uninhibited solo of Tender Is
The Night.

CAMERA TILTS UP to the monster looking out the hatchway,
slowly dying from the song being sung.

As the song continues to be sung and the monster
continues to die, the AUDIO RECEDES and VIDEO IMAGES GO
TO SLO MO.

                       CARINE (V.O.)
          When we were little, Chris was very to
          himself. He wasn't anti-social, he
          always had friends, and everybody liked
          him - but he could go off and entertain
          himself for hours, he didn't seem to need
          toys or friends. He could be alone
          without being lonely. The secrets our
          parents kept, though unknown to Chris and
          I, led to bouts of rage and even violence
          between them that we had been forced to
          witness since we were very young. It
          seemed like they never fought without us.
          I remember the first family meeting to
          let Chris and me in on their plans for
          getting a divorce. They wanted us to
          choose which of them we'd live with. I
          cried my eyes out. But the divorce never
          happened, though the threats and meetings
          never stopped. It wasn't long before
          Chris and I shut off -- we would tell mom
          and dad to go ahead and get the divorce.
          Chris and I just wanted to get away from
          their fights and mom kept promising to
          get out and take us with her as soon as
          their company made enough money. Dad had
          been the young genius [that] NASA
          enlisted to do [crucial] designs for the
          American satellite radar systems that
          would be our answer to the Russian
          Sputnik. And mom and he later started up
          a consulting firm combining her get-up-
          and-go resourcefulness with his wealth of
          knowledge. By the time the company
          actually made its first million, the
          careerism and money seemed to erase her
          memory of the promise she'd made us.

                            CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               I think this is when Chris began to see
               "careers" as a diseased invention of the
               twentieth century and to resent money and
               the useless priority people made of it in
               their lives. He'd begun planning to
               "slay the beast"...to make himself free.

     The glare of the sun penetrating the canvas. A fly

     ECU: CHRIS' EYES

     Delirious in the heat, we WIDEN OUT to see that he's
     filthy (2 weeks of growth on his face and naked.) He
     makes his way out of the tent, peers at the relentless
     sun and scurries to his backpack where he removes a
     canteen, barely a sip of water left in it. He downs it.

     BOYS on boats eating Kentucky Fried Chicken.

     3. A family ski-boat has taken Chris on. They give him
     water, dropping him at the north end of the lake at
     TEMPLE BAR MARINA. (Director's Note: HIGH ANGLE, TIGHT,

               I need a name.

     He takes a swallow of water. Rinses his mouth. Spits it
     out. Then checks his bearded face in the mirror. He
     likes what he sees.

     As he wipes the corners of his mouth with a tissue and
     throws it into the bin below the sink, he notices a
     discarded tube of lipstick. He picks it up. It's down
     to its end. Yet with what lipstick remains, he writes on
     the mirror:

     removes the Datsun's license plates from his backpack and
     discards them deeply into the garbage.

      VARIOUS shots to accompany V.O.

                             CARINE (V.O.)
                Toward the end of June, Chris had mailed
                our parents his final grade report.

      Walt and Billie open the envelope.

                             CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Almost all A's. "A" in Apartheid in

                Food Crisis in Africa; and on it went.
                Clever boy, my brother.

      We observe Carine in a delicate afternoon light. She is
      sitting up on her bed with an unread book, looking out
      the window toward us.

                             CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                But by the end of July we hadn't heard
                anything from him and my parents were
                getting very worried.

                Chris had never had a phone, so they
                decided to drive down to Atlanta and
                surprise him.

                            CARINE (V.O.)
               When they arrived at the apartment, there
               was a "For Rent" sign in his window, and
               the manager told my parents that Chris
               had moved out at the end of June.


24   EXT. OFF-CAMPUS ROOMING HOUSE, ATLANTA - DAY                24

     manager.

                            CARINE (V.O.)
               When they got home, I had to hand them
               all the letters they had sent Chris that
               summer which had been returned in a
               bundle.


25   INT. MCCANDLESS HOME, ANNANDALE                             25

     The bundle of letters are splayed out on the kitchen
     table - "Return to Sender" stamps visible.

                            CARINE (V.O.)
               Chris had instructed the post office to
               hold them until August 1st so that mom
               and dad wouldn't know that anything was
               up. Some part of me understood what he
               had done. That he had spent the previous
               four years fulfilling an absurd and
               onerous duty in graduating from college.

     We return to the image of Carine sitting on her bed as
     she plops on Chris' old graduation cap. We slowly ZOOM IN
     on her throughout the remaining V.O.
                            CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               And now, at last he was unincumbered.
               Emancipated from the stifling world of
               parents and peers. Abstraction,
               security, and material excess. Those
               things that cut Chris off from the raw
               truth of his existence. I only hoped he
               was safe...and I missed him.

     Chris bows to the sign as one would to speak to a small
     child.

     Chris is awakened by the SOUND of TWIGS SNAPPING in a
     nearby thicket. He quickly grabs a knife from his
     backpack, unzips six inches of the tent door open. We
     see his eyes peering out. The CRACKLING moves closer.
     His grip on the knife tightens.

     Suddenly a hot white light hits his face.   And a VOICE
     comes from behind the light.

                              FOREST RANGER
                 U.S. Forestry. Could you step out of the
                 tent please?

     Now we see the FOREST RANGER appear from the thicket.
     Chris exits the tent, catching himself holding the knife.
                             CHRIS
                       (as he drops the knife to the
                        ground)
                 Sorry. I thought you were a bear.

                              FOREST RANGER
                        (approaching)
                 I don't blame you. You're less than a
                 hundred yards from the nearest den.
                 That's why I came over here to talk to
                 you. Do you have some identification?

                                                         22.



                       CHRIS
          No. I'm sorry. My name's Alex. I've
          been travelling a lot and I got robbed
          and my identification was taken.

                       FOREST RANGER
          You mind if I take a look in your tent?

                        CHRIS
          Go ahead.

The Forest Ranger bends over. Pops his flashlight
through the tent door and peers around a bit before re-
addressing Chris.

                       FOREST RANGER
          You're not the character who knocked down
          our sign, are ya?

                      CHRIS
                (giggles)
          No.

                       FOREST RANGER
          Because there was a sign indicating that
          camping was allowed by permit only.

                       CHRIS
          Well, I don't have a permit.

                       FOREST RANGER
          No, I'm sure you don't. Listen, it looks
          like you've got your food secured pretty
          good, so I'm not gonna make you move on
          tonight. But, these bears out here are
          nursing young and you know how that goes.
          Next time, stop at the Rangers station
          and get yourself a permit.

                       CHRIS
          Alright. I appreciate it. I'm gonna be
          headed towards the coast tomorrow.

                        FOREST RANGER
          Be careful.

They shake hands and the Forest Ranger disappears into
the thicket.

33    EXT. THE NORTHERN CREST - DAY                              33

      Chris descends the mountains where they meet the
      Redwoods. Every perilous step creates a mini landslide
      down the hill; dirt and gravel.

      Chris stops briefly to observe an over-flying commercial
      airliner.

                Alright man.    Thanks a lot.

      Chris is dropped off. The driver veers off the highway
      and into the distance. Chris is left behind to hitch
      another ride.

36A   EXT. HIGHWAY                                              36A

      CAMERA is across the road from Chris as one by one cars
      pass him by. He turns to move north by foot and we track
      with him, his back to oncoming traffic, he continues to
      hitchhike with an extended thumb. Something catches his
      eye in the treeline beside the road.

                                                         24.



REVERSE: Chris, moving to the mysterious object. As he
lifts it, we see that it is a goofy looking straw hat.
He dusts it off, and snugs it onto his head, when a
police car comes into frame and stops beside Chris.

With a quick blast of the siren, Chris turns to regard
the police car. The POLICEMAN gets out of the car and
moves to Chris.

                       POLICEMAN
          How're you doin' this evening?

                       CHRIS

          I'm alright. What's the matter?

                       POLICEMAN
          You wanna put your backpack down on the
          hood of my car.

Chris does not oblige.

                         CHRIS
          Why?

                       POLICEMAN
          Because I asked you to, sir.

                       CHRIS
          But I haven't done anything wrong.   These
          are my personal items.

                       POLICEMAN
          Do you know that it's unlawful to
          hitchhike on this stretch of highway.
                       CHRIS
          You're kidding.

                       POLICEMAN
          Do you see a safe area for a vehicle to
          stop? We got a tree-lined highway
          without a substantial shoulder here. And
          we've had a lot of accidents on this road
          from people stopping in the traffic lane
          for hitchhikers.

                       CHRIS
          Alright, but...I mean, you stopped your
          car. You're in the traffic lane. And
          you can see, there's hardly any cars out
          here. Plus, it's a straight road; you
          can see for a long ways.

                            POLICEMAN
               May I see some identification?

     Now Chris is worried.

                            CHRIS
               I don't have any.

                            POLICEMAN
               You don't have any identification?

     Chris shakes his head "No."

                            POLICEMAN (CONT'D)
                      (pulling out a ticket)
               Well, I'm gonna site you for unlawful
               hitchhiking. You don't have to appear.
               You can send a check directly to the
               Humboldt County Clerks Office for
               restitution. If you don't pay it within
               30 days, you're subject to fine and
               warrant. I'm gonna trust that you're
               gonna give me accurate information.
               What's your name?

     Chris can't bring himself to lie.

                            CHRIS

37   INT. MCCANDLESS HOME, ANNANDALE (MID-AUGUST 1990)          37

     Walt, Billie, and Carine sit around the kitchen table in
     August. A copy of Chris' ticket has been sent to the
     Annandale address and sits before them. Billie and
     Carine sit silently. Walt's on the phone.

                            CARINE (V.O.)
               If Chris were trying to disappear, it
               would have been a pretty uncharacteristic
               lapse for him to give the police his real
               place of residence. Though my parents
               had already contacted the Annandale
               police with their initial concerns, this
               ticket arriving from California made them
               frantic.

                            CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               My father called one of his old
               government friends who put him in touch
               with a private investigator, someone
               who'd done work with the DIA and the CIA.
               Using the Willow Creek ticket as a
               starting point, the investigator began
               chasing down leads. Most of them led far
               afield -- to Europe and South Africa.
               Ultimately turning up nothing. What my
               dad couldn't believe was that he'd given
               up his car. He seemed to love that
               Datsun so much. It sounded just like
               Chris to me, though. He was very much of
               the school that you should own nothing
               except what you could carry on your back
               at a dead run.


38   EXT. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY, NEAR ORICK, 60 MILES     38
     SOUTH OF THE OREGON LINE - DAY (MID-AUGUST 1990)

     With his backpack lunging and a free hand holding his
     goofy new hat onto his head, we find Chris at a "dead
     run" to catch a ride that had overshot him. (Director's
     note: Don't leave this image too soon.) An old van idles
     waiting for him. As he gets to the passenger side, the
     woman passenger gets out. This is JAN BURRES, early
     40's, looks to be still on the long road home from
     Woodstock. A little heavyset, dark wavy hair with a lot
     of premature grey in it.

     Jan moving to the side door.

                            JAN
               Hi. We just barely saw you there, under
               that crazy hat of yours. We couldn't
               back up - the van's reverse is broken.
                             CHRIS
                       (as Jan fiddles with side
                        door handle)
               Oh.   That's okay. Thanks for stopping.

                            JAN
               This door's a little tricky, I'll get it.

     And with a little pulling, it opens. Indicating the pony-
     tailed and bearded driver (RAINEY), early 50's,
     definitely Woodstock...

                            JAN (CONT'D)
               Hop in, that's Rainey.

                                                              27.



                            RAINEY
               Hey, I'm Rainey.

                              JAN
               And I'm Jan.

                              CHRIS
               Hey, Rainey.    Hi Jan.    I'm Alex.

                            RAINEY
               Alex of the hat.

                             CHRIS
                       (closing the side door)
               Yeah.

     Jan jumps back in passenger seat and the van rolls on.

     3-SHOT - CHRIS BETWEEN THEM IN THE BACKSEAT.

                            RAINEY
               Were you out there a long time hitching?

                            CHRIS
               Couple of days. But sometimes I forget to
               put my thumb out.

                            JAN
               Probably, the rest of the time, that hat
               scares `em away.

     Chris checks himself in the rearview mirror and gets a
     kick out of what he sees (That hat's staying on.) Jan is
     looking at the rearview mirror too, observing Chris with
     mild concern.

                            JAN (CONT'D)
               When's the last time you ate something?

     Chris pulls out a bag of berries and edible plants he's
     collected.

                            CHRIS
                      (excited)
               See that? I've got this book and it
               shows you all the plants and berries that
               are edible. You can find things wherever
               you go.

     Jan steals a glance to Rainey.      He's hip.

                                                           28.



                            RAINEY
               We were just in town getting some beads
               and stuff. Jan does handicrafts, so
               we're usually going from one swap meet to
               another. She's so good at what she does,
               we sold everything. So, we set up camp
               at Orick Beach. You're welcome to camp
               there with us.

                            JAN
               And eat there with us.

     Chris is beaming at the thought of real food.

     Chris, Jan, and Rainey are beside a campfire, sitting on
     blankets. Their tents loom behind them.

     Jan is weaving some sort of craft art. Chris is chomping
     on chicken and beans like they're going out of style.

                            CHRIS
                      (between large swallows)
               So, I just left the car. It was a great
               car too. I'd driven it cross country the
               first time when I got out of high school.
               I had some really great adventures with
               it. That thing would just go and go. I
               mean, it was an `82 but if I'd kept it,
               it would've lasted me forever.
                            RAINEY
               So, you're a leather now.
                            CHRIS
               I'm a leather?

     Rainey nods, smiling.

                            CHRIS (CONT'D)
                      (looking to Jan)
               What's a leather?

                            JAN
               You're a leather tramp. That's what they
               call the ones that hoof it on foot. So,
               we're technically rubber tramps.

                                                     29.



                       RAINEY
                 (interjecting)
          As we have a vee-hi-cle.

Rainey makes a move to put his arm around Jan. She goes
a little stiff and fends it off. Chris notices.

                       JAN
          Alex could have a vehicle. If he didn't
          burn his money. Why would you want to do
          that?

                       CHRIS
          I don't need money.   It makes people
          cautious.

                       JAN
                 (a little irritated)
          Well, you have to be a little cautious
          Alex. That book of yours is all well and
          fine but you can't depend entirely on
          leaves and berries.

                       CHRIS
          I don't know if you'd want to depend on
          much more than that.

                       JAN
          Where's your mom and dad?

                       CHRIS
          Makin' their money somewhere.

                       JAN
          Come on Chris. You look like a loved             *
          kid. Be fair.                                    *
                      CHRIS
          Fair?

                       JAN
          You know what I mean.

                       CHRIS
          I'll paraphrase Thoreau -- "Rather than          *
          love, than money, than fairness, give me         *
          truth."                                          *

          You look like shit.   There's the truth.         *

They all laugh.                                            *

41   INT. CHRIS' TENT, ORICK BEACH - LATER                       41

     Chris sits up reading, his tent entry flap ajar to let
     the small candle lantern ventilate.

     OS we HEAR a ZIPPING SOUND. It's Rainey. We see him
     from Chris' POV coming out of his tent deep in thought.

     As he moves to the glowing embers of what remains of the
     campfire, Rainey's face goes out of frame and all Chris
     can see are his booted feet, tapping bits of glowing wood
     into the center of the fire. The tapping is slow and
     thoughtful. Micro-embers float upward into the night.

     Chris' tent flap closes by his own hand.

     ANGLE: Chris' dog-ears his book and puts out the lantern.

                                                          CUT TO:


42   EXT. ORICK BEACH - DAY                                      42

     We see Chris foraging for firewood in the bluffs above
     the beach. He's got it tied to his back and his front.
     If we didn't know better, we'd think he was camouflaging
     himself.

     Chris' POV: The rocks beside the water's edge. We see
     Rainey sitting beside the water, staring out to sea. We
     follow Chris' gaze to Jan, some fifty yards down the
     beach, walking melancholically in the opposite direction
     of Rainey.
     ANGLE: Rainey at the water's edge.   Chris appears beside
     him.

                            RAINEY
                      (regarding Chris wrapped up
                       in wood)
               Geez. If I struck a match to you, I'd
               have warmth and dinner at the same time.

                                                       31.



But Rainey's humor does not hide an inner turmoil.

                       CHRIS
          Where's Jan going?

                       RAINEY
          Well, my friend, all is not well on the
          hippie front.

Chris pulls out his pocketknife, cuts the twine that
binds the firewood to his body, and takes a seat beside
Rainey.

                       RAINEY (CONT'D)
          You're an industrious little fucker,
          aren't ya... Yeah, it's funny how things
          happen at particular times. I've loved
          that woman for a lot of years. But you
          know, she's got a...story. We've been
          going through this thing real quietly
          cause, well...So, after running into you
          last night, this thing we were going
          through quietly, she started talking
          about. You know what I mean?

                        CHRIS
          I think so.

                       RAINEY
          You think what?

Chris is looking off at Jan walking in the distance.

                       CHRIS
          I think she's probably quietly
          disconnecting. It doesn't feel right to
          her to be close to you if there's a hole
          of some kind somewhere else.

                       RAINEY
          That's a helluva insight. Jesus!...
          You're not Jesus, are you? You gonna
          walk on that water and get her back for
          me?

                       CHRIS
          Actually, I'm a little afraid of water.

Rainey gives him a sideways glance.

                       CHRIS (CONT'D)
          It's true. But it's something I've got
          to get over sometime.

                            CHRIS (CONT'D)
               So, I'll swim in it if you'll carry the
               firewood back to the campsite.

                             RAINEY
               I'll carry.   Shit-yes I'll carry.

     And with that, Chris runs down the beach toward Jan.
     Rainey watches Chris and Jan chat briefly. Then they
     strip down to their underwear and jump into the ocean,
     splashing and laughing.

     ANGLE: Rainey. A warmth comes over him, watching his old
     lady having some fun. He grabs two armfuls of wood and
     heads to the campsite.

     ANGLE: Chris and Jan swimming in the chilly water, having
     a ball.

     Jan increasingly indulges herself a motherly closeness
     and joy with Chris. And Chris allows it. She pushes the
     stringy hairs from his eyes, worries when he descends
     below the surface for too many seconds, and smiles and
     laughs in tender relief when from below surface one of
     her toes is pulled on by the big fish Chris. As he re-
     surfaces, she gives him a splash right in the face.

                                                        TIME CUT:


43   EXT. CAMPSITE, ORICK BEACH - LATER                          43

     Through a burning campfire in the late afternoon, we see
     the chilly bodies of Chris and Jan carrying their clothes
     run shivering toward us.

     Rainey sits beside the campfire.
                            RAINEY
               I thought you guys might need a little
               heat.

     Jan smiles appreciatively.

                            JAN
                      (moving to Rainey)
               That's not hot enough. Put your arms
               around me.

     As they embrace, Chris throws a coat on from his tent,
     puts on his funny straw hat, and grabs a book.

     Rainey has wrapped a blanket around Jan and they sit
     beside the fire.

                                                             33.



                            CHRIS
               I'm going to go down the beach a ways and
               read a little bit. I'll bring the rest
               of that wood back before nightfall.

                            RAINEY
               Alright. We might take a run into town
               to grab some food for tonight.

                              CHRIS
               Sounds good.

     He heads off down the beach.


44   EXT. ORICK BEACH MONTAGE                                   44

     MUSIC OVER:

     1. The ocean moving toward sunset.

     2. Seagulls, gliding inches over the water.

     3. The breeze on the sea grass.

     4. Chris in his big hat reading at water's edge.

     5. Jan and Rainey deeply engaged in conversation beside
     the fire.

     6. Chris closing his book, remaining meditative at
     water's edge.

     7. Jan and Rainey in town, buying groceries and being
     playful with each other.
     8. OVER Chris' shoulder, the sun sets and day becomes
     night.

                                                          CUT TO:


45   EXT. CAMPSITE, ORICK BEACH - NIGHT                         45

     Jan and Rainey on a blanket sharing a joint. Chris lying
     beside the campfire in his sleeping bag. Jan takes a
     toke, passes the joint to Rainey.

                            JAN
               You know what Alex ought to do, Rainey?
               He ought to come out to the Slabs this
               winter.

                                                         34.



                        RAINEY
          Oh yeah.

Rainey takes a toke on the joint.

                       RAINEY (CONT'D)
          You'd like that if you're still on the
          road. Lot of fellow travelers.

Rainey offers the joint to Chris.   Chris passes it up
with a hand gesture.

                       CHRIS
          What is that? The Slabs?

                       RAINEY
          It's down in Niland, California.   You
          know where the Salton Sea is?

                       CHRIS
          Near San Diego, yeah?

                       RAINEY
          Well about 200 miles Northeast of there,
          but yeah. Niland's off the east shore of
          Salton. Wild place. The navy bulldozed
          and abandoned a base there. All that's
          left is a grid of concrete foundations.
          They're scattered over about a square
          mile or so.

                       JAN
          When the weather turns cold across the
          rest of the country, people show up there
          by the thousands: snow birds...
                        RAINEY
          Drifters...

                       JAN
          Sundry vagabonds...

                       RAINEY / JAN
          Like ourselves.

                       JAN
          Livin' on the cheap under the sun.

                       CHRIS
          You sell your handcrafts there?

                                                              35.



                            JAN
               Oh yeah. And a lot of second-hand goods.
               There's a swap meet. The people are
               cool. There's even some kids running
               around sometimes. Most everyone there,
               if they're not avoiding the cold, are at
               least dodging the IRS.

                             RAINEY
               Or the FBI.   CIA! DDT!!!

     The three of them laugh.

                            JAN
               It's good. You should check it out. If
               you come, I'll make a proper hat for you.
                      (standing, shaking out her
                       blanket)
               Well, Alex. I'm gonna clean up and the
               old man and I are gonna get some rest.
                      (indicating the sleeping bag)
               Looks like you got yourself a good bag
               there.

                            CHRIS
               Yeah...my mother made it from a kit.

     Jan sees an almost imperceptible mother pang in Chris,
     but he pushes it away quickly.

                            CHRIS (CONT'D)
               I'm gonna sleep out here by the fire.     I
               want to read a little bit.

     Jan moves to Chris, hugs him, kisses him on the cheek.
                            JAN
               You're wonderful.   Don't make me worry
               about you.

                                                         TIME CUT:


46   EXT. CAMPSITE, ORICK BEACH - LATER                          46

     The fire is burning low. Chris reads from Thoreau's
     WALDEN from the chapter on "Higher Laws" as we move
     slowly in toward him, we begin to HEAR quiet sounds of
     what may be love-making coming from Rainey and Jan's
     tent. A gentle smile comes over Chris' face and in its
     irony, he looks to the page before him.

                                                            36.



     Chris' sliding fingertip underlines the following
     passage:
     Chastity is the flowering of a man; and what are called
     genius, heroism, holiness, and the like, are but various
     fruits which succeed it.

                                                         CUT TO:


47   EXT. CAMPSITE, ORICK BEACH - MORNING                       47

     Gulls pierce into the grey morning ocean, snapping from
     schools of fish. And the subtle crackling of a
     campfire's death. There on the beach, Jan and Rainey's
     van, their tent, and the fireless coals of last night.
     But no sign of Chris, his bag or his tent.

     Jan appears from her tent, rubbing her eyes. She wears a
     sarong which she re-secures at the breast, then notices
     that Chris has left. But where his tent had been, the
     words:

     THANK YOU JAN AND RAINEY

     are spelled out in the sand with bits of driftwood.

     CU: Jan - We see her sadness. Rainey appears at her
     shoulder. He understands what is inside his woman.

                            JAN
               He reminded me...

                            RAINEY
               I know.
     Go to WIDE SHOT: Jan and Rainey remaining as they were.

     A SERIES OF SHOTS:

     1. Chris hitchhiking through the Sage Brush Uplands

     2. Chris squatting over a water bucket, shaving.

     4. Walking across the Idaho Panhandle.

     5. Cooking the last of his rice on the Montana border.

     6. Hitchhiking in the Montana sunset.


49   EXT. CUT BANK, MONTANA - SUNSET (SEPTEMBER 10 1990)        49

     We see Chris hitching down a lonely two-lane road
     surrounded by fields and distant mountains.

                            CARINE (V.O.)
               In early September, mom and dad got a
               call from the Annandale police notifying
               them that Chris' abandoned car had been
               identified by the Arizona Highway Patrol
               after a group of rare flower hunters
               stumbled upon it in the desert. There
               were no signs that Chris had intended to
               return to it. But there wasn't any
               evidence of struggle. The police said
               they thought Chris had chosen to leave it
               behind and not that it had been taken
               from him. Nonetheless, the initial
               comfort that gave mom and dad, quickly
               turned to their realization that Chris
               was actually trying not to be found.


50   EXT. ANNANDALE STREET - DUSK                               50

     We see Walt. He walks out the door of his house into the
     street. He keeps walking. And we go with him in his
     silent but internal Armageddon. We PULL him in CU
     throughout all that follows...(Refer to SCENE 171: "Dad
     calls it `suspended animation.'" This may affect our
     visual approach)

                            CARINE
               The year Chris graduated high school he
               bought the Datsun, used. He wanted to
               drive it cross-country and visit our old
               neighborhood in California. The day
               before he left was my dad's birthday.
               Chris made a speech...

                                                             38.




51   INT. MCCANDLESS HOME, ANNANDALE (PAST)                      51

     Chris stands beside the family piano, speaking to a party
     of his parent's friends, Walt and Billie among them.
     Beside him, a large gift-wrapped present. Carine sits at
     the foot of the stairs at the back of the room watching
     her brother with a hint of concern.

                            CHRIS
                      (a little drunk, a little
                       emotional)
               Dad, you and I have had our differences
               over the years...but on your birthday I
               want to tell you how grateful I am for
               all the things you've given me. And that
               you did it starting from nothing to
               working your way through college and
               busting your ass to support us kids. So,
               in return, I've been busting my ass a
               bit...at Domino's Pizza -

     Chris moves to the gift.

                            CHRIS (CONT'D)
               and I've gotten you this token, this
               damned expensive token, as a token of
               that appreciation.

     Chris holds the large gift toward Walt. Walt moves
     through his friends to Chris and strips the paper,
     exposing a beautiful Questar Telescope.

                            WALT
                      (patting his son the back)
               Would you look at that.
     Walt holds the telescope up for all to see.   And the
     party responds with applause.

     Chris walks through the cheering family friends to take
     his place beside Carine at the bottom of the steps.

                            CARINE
               Jesus, you must've had a lot to drink.

                            CHRIS
               Too much and not enough. I used to
               believe all that stuff. That whole
               story. I thought maybe if I said it
               again, I'd believe it. But I don't.

                                                            39.



     Tears have come to Chris' eyes. He puts his head in his
     hands. Carine puts an arm around him.

     PRESENT:   Walt expressionless, walking into camera.

                             CARINE (V.O.)
                The day after the party, Chris left on
                his trip and ended up staying away most
                of the summer. It was nearly three months
                before he walked back into our house in
                Annandale. He had a scruffy beard, his
                hair was long and tangled, and he was
                rail thin. As soon as I heard he was
                home, I ran into his room to talk to him.
                In California, he'd looked up some old
                family friends who still lived there.
                He'd found out that long after he had
                been born, our dad had continued a
                relationship with his first wife Marcia
                in secret.

     BRIEF CUTAWAY to Chris hitching on the Montana highway.

                             CARINE
                And that one lie had led to another.
                That two years after Chris was born, dad
                had had another son with Marcia. Worse
                yet was that it was Marcia to whom he was
                still legally married at the time. And
                it was Chris and I who were the bastard
                children.

     Walt.

                             CARINE
                Dad's arrogance made him conveniently
                oblivious to the pain he caused. And
                mom, in the shame and embarrassment of a
                young mistress, became his accomplice.

             CARINE (CONT'D)
She and my dad had decided to bend the
truth about this other child saying that
dad wasn't the father and they maintained
that their fraudulent marriage was real.

                                            39A.

             CARINE (CONT'D)
Chris was quiet when he told me this. He
said it made his "entire childhood seem
like a fiction"; that "the truth had been
dying everyday." If something bothered
Chris, he'd usually keep it to himself.
And he made me promise to do the same.
             (MORE)

                                                           40.

                            CARINE (CONT'D)
               He never did tell mom and dad that he
               knew. But Chris measured himself and
               those around him by an impossibly
               rigorous moral code. He loathed what he
               considered mom and dad's hypocrisy and
               resented what they considered guidance.
               Chris submitted to dad's authority
               through college but I knew he raged
               inwardly the whole time. It was
               inevitable that Chris would rebel. And
               when he did, he did it with
               characteristic immoderation.

     Walt suddenly collapses to his knees weeping, heartbroken
     and ashamed on a quiet Annandale street in the shadowless
     light of dusk.

                            CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               My father is a brilliant man. But he had
               made some terrible mistakes. And to some
               extent, it seemed Chris was making him
               pay an awful price.

     The image of Walt DISSOLVES INTO...

     A pick-up truck pulls over for Chris. As Chris jumps in,
     we see on the passenger side door, the name WAYNE
     WESTERBERG boldly painted across it. Chris hops in
     beside a hyper kinetic man with thick shoulders and a
     black goatee.
                            WAYNE
                      (rolling a cigarette without
                       moving forward with the
                       truck, his knees rattling up
                       and down)
               How're you doing? Wayne Westerberg.

                            CHRIS
                      (shaking hands)
               Hi Wayne. Alex McCandless.

                            WAYNE
               Seems like every time I come on this
               road, there's somebody hitching out here
               who looks as skinny and unfed as you.

     Chris nods with a laugh.   Wayne continuing...

               Look, I gotta stop in Ethridge to drop
               something off (know what I mean?)

     Chris is not sure about the "drop something off" part.

                            WAYNE (CONT'D)
               How `bout you and I grab something to eat
               down there?

                            CHRIS
               Oh, I wouldn't want to burden you.

                            WAYNE
               How long has it been since you've had
               anything to eat?

                            CHRIS
               Couple of days. I kinda ran out of
               money.

                            WAYNE
               Well, there's no choice about it.    I'm
               gonna get you some dinner.

     Wayne lights his cigarette, puts the truck in gear and
     they head down the road.

     As the sun dips behind the horizon we TILT UP off the
     departing truck to the sky. Ominously mounting clouds
     stunningly reflect the red rays of the hidden sun:

                                                          CUT TO:

56   EXT. SUNBURST - NIGHT                                       56
     Wayne's truck cuts through a track in a wheat field
     moving toward a compound of three trailers, one a double-
     wide, the other two on wheels, smaller. Beside them, a
     Wyeth-esque farmhouse. He eases the engine and comes to
     a stop in front of the double-wide.

     As he and Chris dismount the truck, Wayne gives him a
     hushing finger across the lips. They tip-toe up to the
     door, where Wayne shuffles a bunch of keys.

     A little thunder kicking in the distant sky.

                                                           41A.




56A   INT. DOUBLE-WIDE - NIGHT                                  56A

      As Wayne and Chris enter, they tip-toe over empty booze
      bottles and passed out work crew; Wayne's harvesting
      team.

      They make their way to a small table in the kitchenette.
      Remains of the evening's dinner are on the stove. Wayne
      turns on the stovetop coils to heat it up.

                             WAYNE
                So where is it you're headed?

                             CHRIS
                I was thinking about doubling back
                through the Canadian side of Glacier
                Park.

                             WAYNE
                Yeah, I used to have a girlfriend who'd
                go there, camp on the Black Feet Res.
                She was into all that American Indian
                stuff.

                       WAYNE (CONT'D)
          I can bring you to the border at Sweet
          Grass once you've had some food.

                       CHRIS
          Well, that'd be great.   What do you do
          out here?

                       WAYNE
          Well, I do a lot of things. Computer
          programming. Video game repair. I'm a
          licensed pilot, own a grain elevator in
          Carthage and another one a few miles out
          of town. But in the summertime I run a
          combine crew, follow the harvest from
          Texas way the hell north to the Canadian
          border. We just got done cutting barley
          for Coors and Anheuser Busch. But then I
          got this little black box deal on the
          side (You know what I mean?)

                       CHRIS
          You mean those free satellite TV deals?

                       WAYNE
                 (as though he hadn't brought
                  it up)
          You said it, not me.

Chris is dazzled by this renaissance man of the plains.

Wayne stands to dish out a couple of plates of heated
food. As Chris starts digging in, a major gust of wind
rocks the trailer.

                       WAYNE (CONT'D)
                 (smiling, responding to wind)
          OOOOOOH.
Chris doesn't respond, digs into the food. Points to the
unconscious tribe splayed out. SIX GERMANIC-LOOKING
UNCONSCIOUS BODIES.

                       CHRIS
          Who are these guys?

Wayne gets a little giggle.

                       WAYNE
          Those are my Hudderites. Agriculture's a
          pretty transient business. These guys
          come off the Hudderite colony looking for
          work. I always got work for people.
          Then that guy -

                                                           42A.

                            WAYNE (CONT'D)
                      (pointing at guy making most
                       of his snore)
               That's Kevin. He's with me most of the
               time. He's not a Hudderite. He's from
               Madison.

                              CHRIS
               Madison.    Okay.

     Just then, the rain kicks in full gear outside, pounding
     the trailer shell. A couple hits of lightning follow.

                            WAYNE
               Listen, you don't want to go out there on
               the road tonight. Why don't you just
               roll your sleeping bag out and play like
               a Hudderite until morning.

     Chris looks about. There's not much room but it beats
     the pelting outside.

                            CHRIS
               Thanks Wayne. I will.

                                                     TIME CUT:

     Chris, with a grin on his face, lays in his sleeping bag
     between a Hudderite and the sleeping KEVIN. Wayne comes
     from the back bedroom, tip-toes through the sleeping
     bodies to hand Chris a pillow.

                            WAYNE
               Get a good sleep. See you in the
               morning.

     Chris waves a thanks, puts the pillow beneath his head
     and closes his eyes.

     We are TIGHT on Chris' hand atop the shifter of one of
     Wayne's lumbering harvesters.

                                                              43.



                            WAYNE (O.S)
               Okay. Now take hold of the joystick, get
               the feel of header, idle it down with the
               toggle switch...

     As Chris makes the attempt, we immediately hear the
     grinding of gears, the instrument alarms in chaos.

     WIDE SHOT: Chris and Wayne sit atop a combine. In the
     background we see Wayne's trailer and two other combines
     piloted by Wayne's crew members on the ocean of ripe
     blond grain.

     Chris tries his hand at the shifter once more.   This time
     the thing starts to move.

                            WAYNE (CONT'D)
               That's it. That's it. Now take it on
               out and make yourself some money.

     Wayne jumps off the combine and Chris begins to cut his
     pattern, intermittently struggling with the shifter.

     Wayne laughs his ass off.


60   EXT SUNBURST - DAY                                           60

     SERIES OF SHOTS indicating a SERIES OF DAYS passing as
     Chris gets a hang of the machines a little more at a
     time.

61   INT. DOUBLE-WIDE, SUNBURST - NIGHT                           61
     Six men including Wayne and Chris, two among them -
     Hudderites, crowd in to the small dinner area of the
     trailer. Talking politics and bullshit, and eating a
     welcome meal.

                            WAYNE
               I'm gonna break out some whiskey. Alex,
               you want anything other than that beer?

                            CHRIS
               I'd take a White Russian if you've got
               it.

     The group of men laugh at the youngster's order of a
     fancy drink.

                                                              44.

                What are you Alex, a Commie?

                             CHRIS
                No, I just like White Russians.

                             WAYNE
                I haven't got anything like that here.
                But I tell ya what. And I know I speak
                for everybody. You wanna come work with
                us in Carthage, we'll hook you up on the
                grain elevator and get you a White
                Russian down at the Cabaret.

                               CHRIS
                Really?

                             WAYNE
                Dawn tomorrow, engines roaring.

                        blues singer)
                "Pot o Gold. Oh that pot o gold."

      They all join in to the chant/song:

      MAGIC HOUR. TELEPHOTO LENS. The harvesting convoy rolls
      toward us like a herd of mammoths.

                                                           44A-45.




63    EXT. CARTHAGE - NIGHT (LATE SEPTEMBER 1990)                63

      A series of silent, quaint establishing tableaus.
      (Director's Note:    Condor above street)

      It's a sleepy little town. Population: 274. Cluster of
      clapboard houses, tiny yards, and weathered brick
      storefronts rising humbly from the immensity of the
      northern plains. Stately rows of cottonwoods shade a
      grid of streets, seldom disturbed by moving vehicles.

      From UNDER CAMERA, the series of tableaus is interrupted
      as the convoy roars into our frame from BENEATH CAMERA.

      In the passenger seat, Chris is glowing at his new
      surroundings. Wayne picks up the CB radio.

                             WAYNE
                Okay Kevin, get all the machines back to
                the elevator. I'm gonna show Chris to
                his room.

                             KEVIN (O.S.)
                       (over CB)
                I've got dibs on that shower, that

     A two-story Victorian in the Queen Anne style. Wayne
     veers his truck into the front yard, parking under the
     big cottonwood that towers above.

                                               SHORT TIME CUT:


67   INT. WESTERBERG'S CARTHAGE HOME - SAME                     67
     Chris follows Wayne up the narrow stairwell.

                                                             47.

                      (carrying Chris' pack for
                       him)
               Come on up in here. This'll be your room
               for as long as you hang about.

     Wayne opens the door at the top of the stairs.


68   INT. CHRIS' ROOM, WESTERBERG'S CARTHAGE HOME - SAME        68

     Wayne plops Chris' pack beside a single bed in the tiny
     but comfortable room. Chris enters, very happy with his
     new quarters.

                            WAYNE
               Shower's down the hall. If you hurry you
               can beat the rest of the boys to it. But
               you do want to grab a shower cause we're
               all heading over to the Cabaret in
               exactly thirty-six minutes. So, get your
               dancing shoes on. There's foo-foo in the
               medicine cabinet. I think it's Brut.
                      (slaps his own face as if
                       he's putting on cologne)
               Then you want to put your charm in
               overdrive cause we like to PAH-TAY!

     Wayne gives Chris a wink and exits, shutting the door
     behind him.

     Chris takes in his new surroundings. He's on a work crew
     and he likes it. Chris makes the move for the shower but
     by the time he opens his door to the hall, all the other
     crew members are barreling up the stairs in front of
     them, clamoring for dibs (Chris' POV)
                              MAN #1

69   INT. CABARET BAR, CARTHAGE - NIGHT                          69

     The Jack Daniels is flowing. Wayne's crew drinks,
     smokes, and strikes out with every fat woman in the
     place. GAIL BORAH, an on-again, off-again girlfriend of
     Wayne's tends bar. A petite sad-eyed woman, slight as a
     heron, delicate features and long blond hair. Wayne and
     Chris sit at the end of the bar.

                            WAYNE
               Alex, this is Gail . This is the one to
               go to for that White Russian you've been
               wanting. Of course the quid pro quo can
               be hazardous.

                            GAIL
               Shut up, Wayne.
                      (to Chris)
               You want a White Russian, sweetie?

                            CHRIS
                      (shyly)
               Yes please, ma'am.

                            WAYNE
               Yes please, ma'am?

     Wayne slaps Chris on the back.
                            WAYNE (CONT'D)
               Ain't he great?
                            GAIL
                      (to Chris)
               Don't pay any attention to him.

     With that Wayne reaches over the bar, grabs Gail and

70   INT. CABARET BAR, CARTHAGE - LATER                          70

     Wayne and Chris are both drunk.

                                                       49.



                       WAYNE
          Anything to do with hunting, preserving
          the meat, smoking it or whatever, you
          talk to Kevin over there. That's your
          man.

ANGLE: KEVIN.   He looks every bit the Grizzly Adams part.

                       WAYNE (CONT'D)
          Outdoors-man. What's the interest in all
          that?

                       CHRIS
          I'm thinking about going to Alaska.

                       WAYNE
          Alaska, Alaska? Or city Alaska?     The
          city Alaska does have markets.

                       CHRIS
                 (with a drunken, excited
                  energy)
          No, Alaska, Alaska. I want to be all the
          way out there. On my own. No map. No
          watch. No axe. Just out there. Big
          mountains, rivers, sky. Game. Just be
          out there in it. In the wild.

                         WAYNE
          In the wild.

                      CHRIS
          Yeah. Maybe write a book about my
          travels. About getting out of this sick
          society.
                       WAYNE
                 (coughing)
          Society, right.

                       CHRIS
          Because you know what I don't understand?
          I don't understand why, why people are so
          bad to each other, so often. It just
          doesn't make any sense to me. Judgement.
          Control. All that.

                       WAYNE
          Who "people" we talking about?

                       CHRIS
          You know, parents and hypocrites.
          Politicians and pricks.

                                                               50.



     Chris is clearly troubled by his own words.      Wayne leans
     into Chris.

                              WAYNE
                        (tapping a long finger
                         against Chris' forehead)
                 This is a mistake. It's a mistake to get
                 too deep into that kind of stuff. Alex,
                 you're a helluva young guy, but I promise
                 you this: You're a young guy. Blood and
                 fire! You're juggling blood and fire!

                              GAIL
                        (chimes in)
                 Who are you to be giving advice to
                 anybody?

                              WAYNE
                 Blood and fire...What? Mr. Happy.
                 That's who I am. Gimme a kiss.

     Gail    pushes him off with mock disgust.

                              WAYNE (CONT'D)
                        (mock opening his zipper, in
                         a high-pitched voice)
                 Come on, give Mr. Happy a kiss!

     On the television above the bar appears Reverend Jesse
     Jackson. We can't hear him but we can see him. Chris
     points at the television and yells out to the entire bar
     of cowboys and ranch hands -

                              CHRIS
                 Now, that's who could be President!
     Wayne buries his face in his hands.

     Chris is sacked out from his night of drinking when -

     BOOM!   BOOM!   BOOM!

     The door knocks blast into Chris' head. He awakens to
     Wayne opening his bedroom door. Wayne, despite his own
     drinking the night before, is wide awake and fresh as a
     daisy.

     Wayne moves to Chris' side.

                            WAYNE
               So, what do you think about all this?
               (The working life)

                            CHRIS
               I like all this.

     While Wayne and most of the crew get a little rest in the
     shade of the grain elevator and eat their lunches, Chris
     and Kevin are deep in a bald patch in the field.

     Kevin is taking Chris through the paces of smoking and
     curing meat in the wilds. Chris listens and takes notes.
     (Director's note: Cast a "Kevin" who knows this shit and
     shoot it as a dialogue scene as well as a silent
     tableau.)

     The place is packed and Chris is taking over the piano,
     surprising everyone with a tremendous talent. Segueing
     from honky-tonk country to ragtime, he's become the life
     of the party.

     The MUSIC continues OVER:


75   EXT. GRAIN ELEVATOR - DAY                                   75

     All the men of Wayne's crew (who by now we've come to
     know) and Chris are working their asses off.

     POST LAP MUSIC FADES OUT as we:

                                                         52.



INTERCUT the crew at work with a SERIES OF MYSTERY
ANGLES: Tires kicking up dust on dirt roads, through
town, and into the field behind the grain elevator. Back
to the work, back to the tires. Back to the work, back
to these several cars hauling ass through the field.
Back to Wayne, up high in the grain elevator -

                       WAYNE
                 (to Chris, as he lowers
                  himself down the man-lift)
          I gotta take a piss.

Chris' POV: from high in the grain elevator. He watches
Wayne below, as Wayne saunters out to the field to take a
piss. With his back to us, Wayne whips it out and starts
pissing about 25 yards from the grain elevator.

CU Wayne. He looks up from his urination, the grain
elevator behind him. We see a slight mischievous smile
come to his face. He puts his hands up into the air when
suddenly -

Six unmarked FBI vehicles surround him.
(Director's note: Triangulate three long lenses on Wayne
as the mysterious cars enter each frame, as they skid to
a dusty stop on all sides of him.)

Chris and the men of his crew look on.

                       MAN #1
          I warned him about those little black
          boxes.

As Wayne is handcuffed and led away, he nods up to his
boys.
                        WAYNE
                 (to arresting agent)
          You wanna get that zipper for me?
                 (and then calling out to his
                  crew)
          Sorry boys. Gonna have to shut down for
          a while. Alex! You come back and work
          for me anytime.
                 (to Chris and the men)
          Gail's got all your checks, guys. I
          shouldn't be away too long.

With that, the FBI agents have hustled the good-natured
Wayne into the back of one of the cars.

                                                             53.



     As they take off into the distance, we move in on Chris,
     bemused.

               I've been thinking a lot about Alaska.

                            GAIL
               Alaska? What kind of nut-nut are you?
               Alex, it's October for Christ's sake.
               You go to Alaska, you go in the Spring.
               This time of year you wanna head south.
               Personally, I like Las Vegas. One-armed
               bandit. That's what I like.

                            CHRIS
               Yeah, maybe I ought to put off going to
               Alaska, at least so I can get settled up
               there in decent weather.

                            GAIL
               South. You want to go south. You want
               me to take you out to the highway?

                      (putting on his cowboy)
               Little lady, I walked in, I can walk out.
     He puts a few bills down on the bar, saddles up his
     backpack, and gives Gail a hug.

                            GAIL
               You take care of yourself now, Alex. You
               got a whole family here depending on it.

                            CHRIS
               I will. Thanks Gail .   And tell Wayne,
               I'll drop him a line.

     He gives her a kiss on the cheek and he's off.

                You can't paddle down the river without a
                permit. If you like, you can apply for
                one here, get yourself some experience,
                and I'll put you on the wait-list.

               They usually have a few last minute

               thousand dollars.

     Chris stands beside a dramatic section of rapids.    The
     whitewater roars.

     As we SLOWLY ZOOM INTO Chris' face, terrified and
     absorbed by the torrent, a bead of sweat drops across his
     forehead, TILTS OUR CAMERA to his trembling hands and
     legs, when Peter Gabriel's I Have The Touch begins to
     play.

                                                         BACK TO:

     ZOOM INTO Chris' face...a decision:
     Fear becomes determination
     We SMASH CUT ON CUE with Peter Gabriel's vocals. SLO MO,
     SUPER DRAMATIC - Chris blasting out of a shoot in the
     rapids in the kayak we saw the night before. It's
     outrageous. Hair-raising. Just like Peter Gabriel sings
     it, he has the touch.

     This kid's never kayaked before, certainly never on
     rapids. But it's that immortal stage of life, no care,
     no helmet, no life-jacket, pure adrenaline. He can
     hardly believe he's surviving it as he goes but there's
     no looking back now. And with every thump of the music,
     we share his rush. His pure unadulterated exhilaration.

     With the culmination of the music, Chris has successfully
     shot the rapid. He paddles through quiet waters.

                                                            57.


     We move in on him as he maneuvers the kayak to face
     upstream. There before him, the impossible rapid he had
     just completed.

                            CHRIS
                      (to himself)
               I'm Superman. SuperTramp.

     He feels immortal. He makes his about-face and is about
     to head down stream when he sees at the river's edge, a
     group of RIVER TOURISTS and their GUIDE lunching beside a
     pontoon raft. The tourists look like a bunch of
     bewildered tubby-troopers in their misfitted orange life-
     vests and cereal bowl helmets. The RIVER GUIDE yells out
     at Chris as Chris moves PAST CAMERA and away. The guide
     gets on his satellite phone to alert the Rangers. We
     ZOOM SLOWLY away from them toward the rapid.

     LOW ANGLE: It is a narrow gorge of solid rock, looking up
     from hundreds of feet below the canyon crest.

                                                        CUT TO:


85   EXT. FURTHER ALONG THE RIVER - LATER                         85

     The canyon has widened to beach-like banks.   Music FADES.

     Along the banks he sees a YOUNG BLONDE COUPLE. This is
     MADS and SONJA, in their 20's, Danish. They play at the
     river's edge beside their campsite, hotdogs cooking on a
     Hibachi. Chris averts his eyes when Sonja rises from the
     water, topless.

                              MADS
                        (yelling out to Chris)
               Hello!

                              CHRIS
               Hello.

                            MADS
               You can join us!

     Chris doesn't know quite what to do. But Mads seems
     quite comfortable inviting a stranger into the presence
     of his topless girlfriend.

                                                         58.



                       MADS (CONT'D)
          We have hotdogs!

Chris - can't turn that down!   He paddles to within feet
of the water's edge.

                        MADS (CONT'D)
          I am Mads.

                        CHRIS
          Hi. Alex.

                        SONJA
          I am Sonja.

Chris gives Sonja a little wave. She bypasses it, wading
up to the Kayak, giving him a big hug.

                        SONJA (CONT'D)
          Hello Alex.

This couple is extremely energetic. Can't wait to
please. And a bona fide American adventurer in their
midst. It's everything they could've wanted.

                       MADS
          We are from Copenhagen.   And you are from
          the rapids.

                        CHRIS
          I am.

                        SONJA
          My Got!
                       MADS
          Crazy man. You're a crazy man!    Sonja,
          he is a crazy man.
                 (to Chris)
          I'll make you a hotdog.

Mads grabs a hotdog from the Hibachi.

                       MADS (CONT'D)
          Just one minute. One minute...

Sonja has moved to the tent to put on a dry T-shirt. But
as she moves back to the water's edge, those nipples keep
saying Hello.

Chris, meanwhile, simply cannot wipe the smile off his
face in the presence of these warm, open people.

                                                      59.



                      MADS (CONT'D)
          I love this. Don't you love this? This
          is nature. We see it in the American
          movies. How come you're crazy?

                       CHRIS
          Well...

                       MADS
                 (interrupting)
          Because that's crazy! You come down the
          rapids. What do you want on your hotdog?
          Mustard and relish?

                       CHRIS
          You have ketchup?

                       MADS
          No, I have mustard and relish.

                       CHRIS
          Mustard and relish it is then.

                       MADS
          Sonja, you want a hotdog?

                       SONJA
                 (in Danish)
          Of course I want a hotdog.   Why are you
          stupid?

Mads plops two more hotdogs onto the grill.

                       MADS
                 (translating)
          She asked me why I'm stupid. And I say,
          well...like I ask you why you're crazy
          and you say "well." Where are you going?

                       CHRIS
          I haven't decided.

                       MADS
          We like it here very much. We went to
          Los Angeles. And then, we went to Las
          Vegas.

                       SONJA
          Las Vegas is very nice.   The universe is
          very good.

                                            59A.



             MADS
And then, we come here.   Maybe you go to
Mexico.
             (MORE)

                                                         60.

                       MADS (CONT'D)
          You can take kayak around Lake Mead and
          then take the river down to Mexico.

Chris likes the idea.

                       CHRIS
          How far are we from Lake Mead?

                       MADS
          Sonja, how far is Hoover Dam?

Sonja grabs a map from the tent, opens and scrutinizes
it. We follow her finger tracing the river.

                       SONJA
          Maybe three hundred thirty
          kilometers...like two hundred miles.

Sonja walks the map over to Chris at water's edge and
hands it to him. He studies it.

                       CHRIS
          Man, I wonder if I could go all the way
          down into the Gulf of California.

Chris traces his finger along the impossibly long route
leading to El Golfo de Santa Clara.

                       MADS
                 (entering the water with
                  Chris' hotdog)
          I go with you. We leave Sonja here.    You
          and me in kayak - we go to Mexico.

                       SONJA
                 (in Danish)
          You're embarrassing.   Idiot.
Mads with a burst of re-exhilaration, grabs Chris' hand,
shaking it violently.

                       MADS
          I like the meeting you.

                      CHRIS
          Thank you. I'm very happy to meet both
          of you too.

Sonja heads back for her hotdog taking her T-shirt off on
the move. Chris is about to bust a gut. Sonja returns
to her sunbathing. These two are a hoot.

                                                     60A.



Just then, something catches Chris' attention upriver.
We can just barely make out the SOUNDS of a jet boat
motor. His eyes narrow a bit, then -

                                                             61.



                            CHRIS (CONT'D)
               Well, guys I really appreciate the
               hospitality but I wanna make camp down-
               river a ways so I better take off before
               dark.

                                                          CUT TO:


86   EXT. COLORADO RIVER - MOMENTS LATER                        86

     Chris, back in the kayak is paddling down river. Mads
     and Sonja on the bank, wave a boisterous goodbye. And
     they just keep waving. And Chris keeps waving until he
     has drifted out of sight, when around the upriver bend
     arrive the RIVER PATROL.

     At river's edge, Mads, thinking quickly, waves for their
     attention. Pointing the river patrol back upriver, he
     yells:

                            MADS
               He went thattaway!   The crazy man - he
               went thattaway!

     And miraculously, the river patrol makes an about face
     and heads in the opposite direction of Chris. Suddenly
     Sonja thinks Mads is the most clever man on earth. As
     she jumps his bones right there on the river's edge -

                            SONJA
               Just like in the movies.

                                                              62.

     Chris and the kayak are in the back of a pick-up truck
     heading down river by road. We pass the Hoover Dam.

                            CARINE (V.O.)
               It would be Christmas in a couple of
               months. And the last news we'd had was
               about his car being found. I woke up a
               couple of days ago, and for the first
               time, I was surprised to realize that it
               wasn't only my parents who hadn't heard
               from Chris. I wondered why he hadn't
               tried to call in case I might answer. He
               could've hung up if it wasn't me.


88   EXT. COLORADO RIVER, TOPOCK, ARIZONA - DAY                  88

     Chris is re-stocked on some food items which he packs in
     his bag and shoves into the bow of the kayak. This lower
     stretch of the river has little in common with the
     unbridled torrent that explodes through the Grand Canyon.
     Emasculated by dams and diversion canals, the lower
     Colorado burbles indolently from reservoir to reservoir,
     through some of the hottest, starkest, most austere
     country on the continent.

                                                              63.



                             CARINE
                But why he didn't send a letter, maybe
                through a friend. I got mad. But I told
                myself it was good. It made me remember
                that there was something more than
                rebellion, more than anger that was
                driving him. Chris had always been
                driven, had always been an adventurer.
                When he was four years old...

                have something sweet in it.

     As he pierces feet first, a clear blue surface of the
     river's water, CAMERA goes UNDERWATER with him and
     follows him in CU as he surfaces, jubilant in the beauty
     of the Topock gorge. He shakes the water out of his
     hair.

      a letter. His "bought-food" bounty in evidence.

      The words APPEAR ON SCREEN in his handwriting OVER THE

      WAYNE, SOMETIMES I WISH I HADN'T MET YOU. TRAMPING IS

      sits back up and paddles through having passed the

      We see Chris jump down off the back of the duck hunter's
      truck. He slides the kayak off the truck bed onto the
      street. Chris goes into his pocket, pulls out a sealed
      sandwich bag of cash. He tries to pay the hunters for
      their time but they refuse the money. Nonetheless, Chris
      is insistent and they relent.

      Chris pulls his backpack from inside the bow and saddles
      it up on his shoulders. The hunters pull away.

      toward us, seemingly in the sand dunes. As we BOOM UP
      SLIGHTLY, we see that there is a bend in the water's edge
      and that he is in fact, paddling in the crystalline blue
      of the Gulf.

                             CHRIS (V.O.)
                I paddled south about 20 miles.

                That's when I saw the cave and everything
                went upside down.

      BACK to reveal Chris in a cave where he has made camp;
      watching, waiting.

                             CHRIS (V.O.)
                A sandstorm hit and I was pretty much
                stuck. My kayak blew away, so I left it
                and walked up the beach, hitched back
                north, and here I am.

                             CHRIS
                What they ought to do is open up the dams
                and let the rivers flow.

                             IMMIGRATION OFFICER
                I can't disagree with you on that. Okay,

116   EXT. TRAIN YARD, SOMEWHERE NEAR ALGODONES - NIGHT         116

      A freight train cranks up its great engines and starts
      its move west.

      Chris POV: We see a BULL (hobo slang for a railway
      security guard) making his rounds. As the bull
      disappears around the caboose, and the trains motion
      picks up, Chris appears from behind a fuel pump. He
      makes his move in the shadows to the passing freight
      cars, not quite sure how to board them. He begins to
      slowly jog beside the train. There is a vertical steel
      rod on each passing car. He times the train by putting
      his hand out and letting the vertical rods slap it.

                             CHRIS
                       (counting)
                One...Two...Three -

                                                     71A.



And with that he accelerates to a run, throws his pack
into the moving freight car before him, simultaneously
leaping up to grab the rail and throw himself into the
car.

                                                              72.



      But his left foot misses and he's suddenly dangling from
      the moving train. He grabs hand over hand on the rail.

      ANGLE: Dangling feet and razor sharp wheels.

      ANGLE: Chris. He puts everything into pulling himself
      up, growling the strength into his muscles finally...


117   INT. FREIGHT CAR - NIGHT                                  117

                As Alexander Supertramp returns to
                civilization...a hobo.
                       (quietly)
                I'm a for real hobo.

      He's very happy about this (despite the near surrender of
      it.) Chris uses his pack as a pillow, lays back on it and
      begins to sing Roger Miller's King of the Road.

          Ouch. Alright. Well you're gonna have
          to work that out with the DMV. You can
          catch them in the morning.

The social worker begins to write an address on a piece
of paper.

                       SOCIAL WORKER (CONT'D)
          The closest one is Montebello and we can

      alarmed. As he moves to peer out the door, even before
      he has a chance to see what's coming -- WHAM! He's
      smashed in the head with a baton. A BULL jumps into the

      He closes the door and the car drives off. We follow
      Chris as he goes to the overpass edge. He drops his pack
      over the side. Chris climbs down the edge of the
      overpass, grabs his pack, and scurries into the UNDERPASS
      below. (We suddenly recognize this as his pre-river run
      campsite)

      He digs up his buried belongings, returning them to his

                I'm not talking about this anymore!

      Feet stomping off.

                             WALT (O.S.)
                Don't walk away from me WOMAN!

                              BILLIE (O.S.)
                Fuck you!   I hate you!

      Sounds of scuffle.

                                                           78A.

                ME!


136   INT. MCCANDLESS HOME, ANNANDALE (PAST)                    136

      ELEVEN-YEAR OLD CARINE sits in the stairwell leading to
      her parent's room where an argument ensues. Carine's
      head in her hands, a delicate tear moistens the webs
      between her small fingers.

                                                            79.



      FIFTEEN-YEAR OLD CHRIS enters from O.S. He leans against
      the stairwell and looks up the stairs. Our focus remains
      on Carine. In the B.G. SOFT FOCUS, Walt is pinning
      Billie down onto the bed. She flails at him but he holds
      down her shoulders.

                             WALT
                LOOK WHAT YOUR MOTHER IS MAKING ME DO!

      Billie slips his grasp. Walt reaches out with a hit/push
      of her back. She is thrust out of the bedroom onto the
      landing above the staircase followed by Walt who
      positions himself in the doorway like a hostile
      crucifixion.

                             WALT (CONT'D)
                       (raging)
                I'll just cancel Christmas then!

      Billie returns to him, punching on his chest:

                             BILLIE
                Who do you think you are?   God?

                              WALT
                Yes.   I'm God!

      Chris puts his hand out to Carine. She looks up to him.
      He gives her a smile and a wink. She takes his hand and
      they exit frame as the argument continues.

                             WALT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                Where do you kids think you're going?

                             BILLIE (O.S.)
                       (not in desperation so much
                        as a demand for their
                        witness)
                Kids, get back here!

      We HEAR a DOOR SLAM OC.

      The young Chris and Carine. She sits atop the handlebars
      of his bicycle beaming as Chris peddles her down the
      middle of the street. We PULL THEM as they ride.

                         79aA.



             CHRIS
       (mockingly)
I'll cancel Christmas!

                                      79A.



             CARINE
       (humored out of her sadness)
Who do you think you are? God?

              CHRIS
Yes.   I'm God.

138   EXT. ARIZONA INTERSTATE UNDERPASS - NIGHT                 138

      As they both laugh we DISSOLVE BACK to Chris (PRESENT)
      reading beside his candle lantern.

                             CARINE (V.O.)
                In the nine months since Chris'
                disappearance, my parents went through
                enormous changes. Guilt was giving way
                to pain. And pain seemed to bring them
                closer. My father had humbled
                dramatically. And what had always been a
                sort of curt arrogance, the kind of man
                who actually thought he could cancel
                Christmas, had given way to the
                vulnerability of a father's heart. Even
                their faces had changed. It made me sad
                that I couldn't share with Chris the new
                closeness I felt toward our parents.

      The image of Chris reading begins a SLOW DISSOLVE INTO...


139   INT. FREIGHT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT                            139

                             CARINE
                I close my eyes at night sometimes and
                imagine where Chris might be.

      Suspicious, ghostly faces briefly appear in the strobing
      lights that hit the train car from outside. They're
      toothless and tattooed. Aged and young. Punks and
      piercings. They're train tramps.
      We see Chris observing them.   Warmly he speaks but we DO
      NOT HEAR, "I'm Alex."

140   EXT. TRAMP CAMP, LAS VEGAS - DAY                          140

                             CARINE
                Was there beauty around him?   Was he
                hurt? Was he alone?

      We see Chris sharing camp with the train tramps in the
      outskirts of Las Vegas. DISSOLVE...

                                                            80A.




141   INT. LAS VEGAS RESTAURANT - NIGHT                       141

                Was he having the great adventure that he
                wanted?

      We see Chris working as a waiter in a Las Vegas
      restaurant. DISSOLVE...

                                                               81.

                             CARINE
                Could he feel the changes here at home?
                By some kind of supernatural osmosis?
                Chris once wrote to me from college
                saying he wanted to talk to me about all
                the problems he had with mom and dad.

      We see what may be Chris' POV from a train car snaking
      through a mountain pass.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

                             CARINE
                He said I was the only person in the
                world who could've possibly understood
                what he had to say.

      We see Chris in the Las Vegas desert by a campfire at
      night.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


144   EXT. SEATTLE - DAY                                        144

      HIGH ANGLE CU: We see Chris walking the streets of
      Seattle. As we WIDEN OUT, he becomes a dot in the
      Seattle landscape.
                             CARINE
                In those silent moments, with my eyes
                closed trying to picture where Chris
                might be at that very moment, probably
                climbing some scary mountain, I want to
                reach into that picture and bring him
                back to see what mom and dad, what our
                family might become.

      LONG LENS: Chris disappears over the rise into the
      Seattle marketplace overlooking Puget Sound (per location
      photography.)

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

                             CARINE
                But instead when I open my eyes, what I
                see is my mother, sitting at the dining
                room table, sifting through photo albums
                and pictures of Chris. It's all she can
                do to examine the snapshots. And, though
                she breaks down from time to time, she
                studies them with a sort of hungry
                intensity - like looking at food you
                can't eat, or into a window at a family
                around a table that you were once a part
                of and can be no more.

      We see Billie driving out of the Annandale supermarket
      onto the boulevard. She sees a hitchhiker roadside. She
      cranes her head - is it Chris? It's not.

                             CARINE (V.O.)   (CONT'D)
                She convinces herself it's   Chris; that
                it's her son, whenever she   passes a
                stray. And I fear for the    mother in
                her...

      We see Chris hitchhiking in a barren desert.

                             CARINE
                Instincts that seem to sense the threat
                of a loss so huge and irreparable that
                the mind balks at taking its measure - I
                begin to wonder if I do understand what
                Chris is saying any longer. But I catch
                myself in doubt and remember that these
                are not the parents he grew up with.
                That in the forced reflection that comes
                with loss, indeed everything Chris is
                saying, has to be said. And I trust for
                him that everything he is doing has to be
                done. This is our life.

147   EXT. BULLHEAD CITY, ARIZONA - DAY (OCTOBER 1991)           147

      Chris is in the passenger seat of a Mac truck cab. Both
      Chris and the TRUCKER look outward as though to find an
      address or landmark.

                             TRUCKER
                I don't know where to drop you.
                Bullhead's kinda haphazard - there's no
                "center." You sure you don't want to be
                in Laughlin? It's casinos versus
                chiropractors.

                              CHRIS
                Yeah, no.   This is good.   Right here.

                             TRUCKER
                Alright then. Chiropractors it is.

      He pulls over. Chris grabs his pack and exits the truck
      in front of a laundromat. As the truck pulls away, Chris
      sees a "Help Wanted" sign for Burger King on the
      laundromat window.

                                                          TIME CUT:


148   INT. BURGER KING, BULLHEAD CITY - DAY                      148

      The place is packed with a line out the door. LORI, the
      second assistant manager, hurries back into the kitchen,
      where we find Chris in paper cap, bunning whoppers at a
      leisurely pace.
                             LORI
                Chris, you gotta go faster.   We've got a
                line out the door.

                              CHRIS
                        (a bit oblivious)
                Okay.

      But then just continues on at his leisurely daydreaming
      pace. Lori is about to say something but by now she
      knows there's no getting through to him. She looks down
      to the floor where we see that Chris wears no socks.

                             LORI
                       (extending patience)
                Chris, I don't mean to be on you about
                everything. You're doing a great job.

                I want to keep you on. And we all want
                to help you get to Alaska, but you've got
                to start wearing socks.

                             CHRIS
                Right, right. I forgot.

                              LORI
                And please.   Hurry.   We're ten deep.

      FEMALE TELLER.

                             CHRIS
                How much do I have in the account now?

                             TELLER

                hundred and fifty two dollars

                What's the interest on twenty-two cents?

      The young teller giggles.

      We're TIGHT ON Chris' sock-less feet, pedalling away from
      the bank on a bicycle. The growing independence of his
      financial situation felt in the MUSIC OVER:

      SERIES OF ANGLES as Chris rides out of town, into the
      desert, from a late afternoon sun into a sunset as he
      arrives at his -


151   EXT. CAMPSITE, OUTSIDE BULLHEAD CITY - SUNSET             151

      The casino lights of Laughlin, Nevada distantly in B.G.

      Chris pedals up a dirt path to find many of his
      belongings strewn about. And in particular, some food
      supplies have been torn into. A coyote yips in the
      distance as Chris finds his old straw hat torn to shreds.
      Across the desert, scurrying away beyond the tumbleweed,
      three young coyotes head for the hills. Chris picks up
      his tattered hat and smiles.

      into frame and is punched out.

      WIDEN OUT to see Chris taking off his paper hat and
      Burger King overshirt.

      He walks his timecard over to Lori.   The place is all but
      empty.

                Okay.   Just put it in the drop.

                             CHRIS
                No, I mean I'm punching out for good.

                Yeah. Also, I've got to do some things
                before I head north.

                             LORI
                Alright Chris. Well, we've enjoyed
                knowing you. I won't be able to get that
                last check to you right away though.

                               CHRIS
                That's okay.    I'll let you know where to
                send it.

                             LORI
                Alright then Chris.    Bye-bye now.

      This is the vista of former barracks foundations Rainey
      and Jan Burres had told Chris about. Hundreds of people
      in tents and trailers, a quarter inch to the right of a
      Rainbow Gathering as hillbillies and renegades mix with
      the hippies. There are canvas-covered booths set up for
      swap and trade. Even a few makeshift food stands.

                                                               87.


      We SEE that many of the inhabitants have set up CHRISTMAS
      TREES outside their trailers and tents. Kids play naked
      in a mud pool.

      We see Rainey selling their wares. Beside the booth,
      their van with its backseat door open. A little dog,
      Sunni, jumps out the van door, sniffing something out.
      Jan exits the van after the dog.

                               JAN
                Sunni!    Come here boy.

      But Sunni has sniffed out Chris' large backpack leaning
      against the rear of the van. Jan is just beginning to
      recognize it, when from behind the van appears Chris,
      looking like a million bucks.

                               CHRIS
                Surprise!

                               JAN
                         (overjoyed)
                Alex!

      As she goes to hug him -

      to join them.

      Big embraces all around.

159   EXT. THE SLABS - NIGHT                                    159

      An impromptu campfire celebration with live music from a
      makeshift stage. Jan, Rainey, and Chris sit on chairs
      outside the circle of inhabitants, taking in the music.

                             JAN
                You have to tell us everything.
      (Note: This scene should largely be improvised. They all
      know their characters, their history. Jan and Rainey are
      doing great. And while Chris is intermittently aware
      that the eyes of a pretty 16-year old girl are upon him,
      Chris lays out his travels and his PLAN FOR ALASKA.

                                                               88.


      Jan remarks, "I guess if you can figure out how to paddle
      a canoe down to Mexico, hop freight trains, and score
      beds at inner-city missions, you can figure out Alaska
      too.")

      At this point, the PRETTY 16-YEAR OLD GIRL who had had
      her eyes on Chris, takes the stage with an acoustic
      guitar, introduces herself as TRACY, then SINGS an              *
      innocent love song of her own composition, stealing
      seductive glances at Chris throughout the performance.

                             JAN (CONT'D)
                I think you've made yourself a friend.

                             CHRIS
                       (blushing)
                She's only a teenager.

                             JAN
                Good luck.

      The girl finishes her song.

      Chris and Rainey man the second-hand goods booth while
      Jan bathes Sunni in a steel bucket by the van. Among the
      goods, a USED ORGAN. Chris is thrilled to have access to
      all the second-hand books that are part of Rainey and
      Jan's inventory. As he skims through Jack London's
      Odyssey of the North, Rainey notices Tracy sitting on the       *
      steps of her vagabond parents' rig across from the booth.
      She picks silently at her guitar with her bright eyes
      fixed on Chris.
                             RAINEY
                How long can you stay with us?

                             CHRIS
                Well, I'm waiting on a check from my last
                job to come into Salton City the day
                after Christmas. I've got to start
                thinking about getting ready for Alaska.
                When the sun gets a little lower tonight,
                I'm going to start a calisthenics
                routine. I think after the check comes
                in, I'll try to find some mountains I can
                climb everyday till spring comes. I
                gotta see how far the money's gonna go.

          I'm going to have to pick up a lot of
          supplies before spring. So, I might take
          another job or I might be okay.

                       RAINEY
          Well, you know, we'll give you a little
          something for every day you work the
          booth.

                       CHRIS
          I'm not taking any money from you,
          Rainey.   It's been a real great twist
          meeting you two. You look like you're
          doing good.

                       RAINEY
          We are, and you were a big part of that,
          coming along when you did. Yep, things
          are good.
                 (gives a little giggle)
          Man, I used to think Tantric sex was just
          a bunch of reading. Speaking of which,
          don't you think you ought to introduce
          yourself to Joni Mitchell over there?

Chris looks up from his book to the wide open 16-year old
smile of Tracy. Rainey laughs aloud. Chris smiles back,      *
and against his better instincts, gives her a little wave-
over with the paperback. Tracy jumps off her step,           *
putting her guitar inside the rig, and trots like a
little wood nymph to Chris.

                               CHRIS
                That's good.    I heard you play your song
                last night.

                             TRACY                                    *

      Rainey amused by all of this.

                You are not terrible.

                No.   You sing sweet.

                Thank you. I was going to go watch the
                kids play in the mud. Do you want to go?

                              RAINEY
                Go on.   I'll watch the store.

                I'm sorry.   This is Rainey.   And I'm
                Chris.

      Whoops, a slip on the name, but...

                             RAINEY
                Hi. Rainey. And this is Alex. ("Don't

      Chris realizes his slip but before Rainey can question
      anything, Chris stands and goes off with Tracy.                 *

                             JAN
                I wasn't much older than Tracy when I got             *
                pregnant. And I thought my husband and I
                were going to invent peace on earth and
                stay together forever. But it didn't
                work out that way. He left. History.
                Now ancient history. And that was the
                end of that. So, I raised Reno by myself
                - that's my son. Then I met Rainey. And
                that was really good for a while. But
                Reno was already a teenager and was
                becoming a man in his own way. And then,
                I don't know. He kinda followed in his
                father's footsteps - out the door and
                gone. And I really don't know where he
                is. I haven't heard from him in two
                years.

                             CHRIS
                I hope I get to meet him sometime.
      Jan looks into Chris' eyes and smiles with pure love.
      She leans over and gently kisses Chris on the cheek.

                             JAN
                Do your folks know where you are?

      Chris aims to deflect the question as Tracy enters the          *
      scene.

                 I really ought to get myself doing that.

                              CHRIS
                 You should Rainey. Makes that Tantric
                 stuff go even better.

                                                     93.



                       RAINEY
          How the hell would you know? That poor
          girl over there is about ready to vault
          onto a fence post. And here you are, the
          monk of Jack LaLane.

They share a laugh. Chris comes to the end of his sit-
ups. Wipes his brow with a towel. Rainey squats down
next to him.

                       RAINEY (CONT'D)
          I guess Jan filled you in. About Reno
          and everything. Children can be harsh
          judges when it comes to their parents.
          They don't grant clemency easily. I
          think Reno tended to see things in black
          and white. I just hope he lives long
          enough to forgive her.

The connection is not lost on Chris.

                       RAINEY (CONT'D)
          But painful as it is, you turned a light
          on in her and I'm grateful.

          Me too.

                       RAINEY
          For what?

Chris doesn't answer. A kid rides by on a bright new Big
Wheel. Must be from the rich side of the commune.

          They should. But I can't. Not yet,

          She's the most beautiful girl in the

                Yeah, Rainey. Alaska.

      Rainey won't intrude any further. He just nods. Chris
      notices Tracy in the door of her parent's rig, stealthily       *
      waving him over. Chris gives Rainey the "Uh-oh" look,
      pulls on his T-shirt, and walks over to the rig. Tracy          *
      has disappeared inside.

      falls in a series of saddles and peaks. The narrow
      shoulders are densely wooded. SLOWLY APPEARING over the

      MCCANDLESS. Lean, softly handsome, and graceful.

                In high school, Chris became captain of
                the cross-country track team. They
                called themselves the Road Warriors.

      suddenly veer off the paved road into the adjoining
      woods.

                He'd take them on what he loved to refer
                to as "epic" runs. The whole point was
                to run until they were completely lost
                and so exhausted that they were on the
                verge of puking. Then they'd slow down a
                little, somehow he'd find their bearings,
                and lead them home again at full speed.
                This was my brothers idea of fun.

      We FAVOR Chris as he jogs in place at the exhilarating
      point of being lost. When he has identified a most
      likely return route, he quickens his pace, leading the
      group in the direction of return.

                he had to get lost to prove his
                independence to himself. But this was no
                day run for the Road Warriors and after

                In many ways, my life and even my parents
                had begun to move in new directions. I'd
                fallen in love. And mom and dad had even
                ventured out on a brief vacation. But,
                when a search of tax records uncovered
                Chris' contribution to OXFAM, the weight

      across bags of rice on the market shelves. A HEAVY SET

                Go on, boy.    Go on.

      And the dog obeys him.

      As he sorts through the various rice selections, brown,
      white, wild, we notice a MAN peering over the opposite
      shelf at Chris. This is RON FRANZ, between 70 and 80
      years old, six-feet, thick arms, barrel chest, and large
      ears. He wears old jeans, an immaculate white T-shirt, a
      decorative tooled leather belt, white socks, and scuffed
      black loafers. His deeply pitted nose demonstrates a
      purple filigree of veins which unfold like an finely
      wrought tattoo. And on either side of it, the wary blue
      eyes of a soldier. He is the archetypical American man.
      Chris has caught his sympathetic eye. Chris moves to the
      counter to pay for rice.

183   INT. RON'S TRUCK                                          183

      As we come upon a 4x4 track twisting down a narrow wash -

                             CHRIS
                You go left here.

      Ron turns the truck down the 4x4 track.


184   EXT. 4X4 TRACK, ANZA-BORREGO DESERT - SAME                184

      We watch the truck bump and grind on the mangled dirt
      road about a mile in.

      Out the window, Ron's eye has been caught by something.

      Ron's POV: Oh-My-God Hot Springs -

      We see a couple of day-glo vans and rusted out
      Studebakers that hadn't been turned over since Eisenhower
      was in the White House. Several of those living there
      mill about buck naked. And at the center of the camp,
      the steaming pools lined with rocks under the palm trees.

                             RON
                You live here?

                             CHRIS
                No, we keep going. I'm further up.
                Another half-mile or so, out on the
                Bajada.

185   EXT. CHRIS' CAMP BESIDE THE STONE WALL - SAME             185
      Ron and Chris drive up in the truck. Ron shuts off the
      ignition and gets out of the truck to stretch his legs.
      Chris follows, puts his full water jug under the tarp at
      his campsite, hooking it onto a branch. He throws his
      shoulder bag with the rice in it into his backpack.

                             RON
                Well, this is somethin' out here. Don't
                you worry about those dope smokers and
                nudists down below there?

                             CHRIS
                No, they keep to themselves pretty much
                and so do I.

                                             103.



            RON
      (skeptical)
Hmmm. You strike me as a bright young
man. Am I wrong about that?

             CHRIS
I think I got my head on my shoulders
pretty good.

             RON
That's what I mean.    How long have you
been out here?

             CHRIS
Couple of weeks.

             RON
And before that?

             CHRIS
A lot of places. I've been moving
around.

             RON
How old are you?

             CHRIS
Twenty-three.

             RON
Twenty-three years old! Son, don't you
think you should be getting an education?
And a job? And making something of this
life?
             CHRIS
Look Mr. Franz. I think careers are a
twentieth century invention and I don't
want one. You don't need to worry about
me. I have a college education. I'm not
destitute. I'm living like this by
choice.

               RON
In the dirt?

             CHRIS
       (laughs)
Yeah, in the dirt.

             RON
I just don't know.    Where's your family?

                                                        104.



                       CHRIS
          Don't have one anymore.

                       RON
          That's a shame.

Chris can see some deep sadness in this man.

                       CHRIS
          Hey, Mr. Franz. I want to show you
          something.

Ron follows Chris to the rockface we'd seen Chris running
earlier. They begin to walk up it. It's tough on the
old-timer, walking this steep hill. But he's a tough old-
timer, at least for the moment...

ANGLE: The two men nearly half way to the summit.     It's
getting steeper and higher. Ron stops.

                       RON
          This is getting a little steep.     And a
          little high for me kid.

                       CHRIS
          Alright.   But look out there. Even from
          half way out, it's quite a sight isn't
          it?

Their POV: Enormous beautiful vista all the way across
the Bajada.

                       CHRIS (CONT'D)
          From the top you can see all the way to
          the Salton Sea too.
Ron looks up the precarious rock wall.   He ain't gonna be
seeing the Salton Sea today.

                       RON
          You can see the Salton Sea from up there?

                       CHRIS
          Yes, sir.

                        RON
                 (starting his way down the
                  hill)
          My goodness.

                       CHRIS
          You don't want to go up?

                                                                 105.



                                RON
                  Nope.   I don't do these kind of things.

      Chris smiles and follows Ron.       As they approach the
      bottom of the hill -

                               RON (CONT'D)
                  How about you and me take a drive? About
                  fifty miles or so up highway, I know a
                  place that's got a view, great food, and
                  requires no climbing. How's that sound?

      Chris thinks about it.     Then -

                               CHRIS
                  Yeah, sure. It'll take me a couple of
                  minutes to clean up.

                                 RON
                  Fair enough.

      MUSIC OVER: As Chris and Ron ride the tram to the peak,
      we watch Chris watching Ron, his kind, moist old eyes,
      slowly blinking at the wonder of the nature around him.
      Other passengers on the tram seem nervous, but Ron is
      meditative, almost hypnotized.

                                                                106.


      And with each roll-through of the tram through the cable
      towers, the tram car rocks and sways, but Ron's peace
      goes unbroken. And Chris continues to admire the gentle
      blinking of his eyes.

      The two of them sit in a quiet, corner   booth of the
      tramway eatery that sits on the summit   of San Jacinto
      overlooking the lights of Palm Springs   and the desert
      clear back to Salton Sea. Chris is on    a roll.

                Seventy-nine years old.

                             CHRIS
                Seventy-nine...see, all due respect, but
                the real difference between people is the
                quality of their soul and not on how long
                they've trudged around like a dip-shit.

      Ron laughs.

                             CHRIS (CONT'D)
                But it's true.

                              RON
                It is.   No question about that.

      Ron continues to let Chris vent.

      Ron's side of the truck.

                Awww, that was a great time Mr. Franz.

          I spent most of my life in the army. On
          New Year's Eve 1957, I was stationed over
          in Okinawa. My wife and son were here in
          the States, just driving down the road
          when a fellow who'd had too much to drink
          plowed right into them. Killed them
          both. Anyway, you might think that the
          last thing in the world I'd do, is go to
          the whiskey, but at the time, it felt
          like the only thing I could do. And I
          did it hard. But pretty soon, I figured
          I wasn't doing my wife and son any good,
          mourning them with a bottle. So, I
          pulled myself together and quit drinking,
          cold turkey. And then...

Ron, spinning his body around, points to the photographs
over the sink.

                Yeah, I unofficially adopted all of them.
                It did my heart some good but I guess
                really it was just writing a few letters
                and sending some money. Anyway, it was
                important to me. I get a letter from
                each of them from time to time. You
                know. So, since all that, this is pretty
                much me.

                        reclusive abode)

                             CHRIS
                Do you ever travel, Mr. Franz?

                             RON
                No. I can't seem to get too far from my
                leather. I'll show you after you finish
                eating. I do a lot of leather engraving.
                I got a little workshop in the garage.
                Between that and my pension, I do pretty
                well. But every time I think I might
                take a trip somewhere, I get too far
                behind on orders and such to consider it.

                             CHRIS
                       (having wolfed down the
                        steak)
                Well, I'm finished eating. I'd love to
                see your workshop.

                             RON
                Would ya?

      Chris nods.
                             RON (CONT'D)
                       (standing)

      Ron picks up the picture of Akira and replaces it on the
      shelf above the sink.

      Chris reaching the summit.   He bends over to catch his
      breath, hands on knees.

                             RON (O.S)
                How about some fishing?

      Chris turns to the voice. And down at the bottom of the
      rock wall beside the campsite, is Ron holding up two
      fishing poles.
                             RON (CONT'D)
                       (referring to the Sea)
                That thing's twice as salty as the ocean.
                Did you know that?

      Chris has barely the breath to speak.

                             CHRIS
                Anything alive in it?

      Ron shrugs his shoulders in a "who cares?" fashion.
      Chris laughs but nods in the affirmative and gives Ron
      the thumbs up.

203   EXT. ANZA-BARREGO DESERT - DAY + NIGHT                    203

      BEGIN MUSIC OVER:   MONTAGE:

      1. Chris and Ron fishing in the Salton Sea. (no catch)

      2. At Ron's workshop/garage, Ron guides Chris in his
      leather belt project.

      3. At Chris' campsite, Chris does push-ups while Ron sits
      on the tailgate of his truck spying on the "Manson
      family" through binoculars, shaking his head.

      4. Chris at his campsite working on the belt by campfire
      light. We MOVE IN on the belt, he's beginning to form
      the letter N in the leather.

      5. Chris jogging in the morning beside Oh-My-God Hot
      Springs.

      6. Chris and Ron at the leather bench in Ron's
      workshop/garage.

      In a EXTREME CLOSE-UP, MUSIC FADES OUT as we PAN across
      Chris' leather belt and the story being told on it
      through the engravings:


204   EXT. RON'S WORKSHOP - DAY                                 204

      ALEX is inscribed at the belt's left end; then the
      initials C.J.M. (for Christopher Johnson McCandless)
      frame a skull and crossbones. Across the strip of
      cowhide one sees a rendering of two-lane blacktop, a No U-
      turn sign, a thunderstorm producing a flash flood that
      engulfs a car, a hitchhiker's thumb, an eagle, the Sierra
      Nevada, salmon cavorting in the Pacific Ocean, the
      Pacific Coast Highway from Oregon to Washington, the
      Rocky Mountains, Montana wheat fields, a South Dakota
      rattlesnake, Westerberg's house in Carthage, the Colorado
      River rapids, a canoe beached beside a tent, Las Vegas,
      and at the buckle end, finally, the letter N.

                             RON
                What's the N stand for?

205   EXT. CHRIS' CAMP BESIDE THE STONE WALL - DAY           205

      AN ISOLATED CLOUD ECLIPSES THE SUN AGAINST A BLUE DESERT
      SKY.

      Ron is sitting on his tailgate, watching Chris, backpack
      on, climb the stone wall.

                             RON
                Alaska?

      Chris summits.

                             RON (CONT'D)
                Son, what the hell you running from?

                             CHRIS
                       (yells down from above)
                I could ask you the same question.
                Except I already know the answer.

                             RON
                You do, do you?

                             CHRIS
                I do, Mr. Franz. You've got to get back
                out in the world. Get out of that lonely
                house of yours, that little workshop,
                and go live on the road.

      Ron waves him off.

                             CHRIS (CONT'D)
                Really. You're going to live a long
                time, Ron. You should make a radical
                change in your lifestyle. The core of
                man's spirit comes with new experiences.
                And there you are, stubborn old man,
                sitting on your butt.

                             RON
                Sittin' on my butt, huh?

      Ron gets up off the tailgate.

                             RON (CONT'D)
                I'll show you sittin' on my butt.

      And Ron starts making the old man hustle. Shifty
      shoulders and all, up the stone wall.

                                                     115.



                       RON (CONT'D)
                 (mumbling)
          "Stubborn old man."

Chris is laughing and clapping.

                       CHRIS
          Come on, old man! Come on!

                       RON
                 (mumbling)
          Ya little pinhead.

Chris is jumping up and down, thrilled for Ron's efforts.
Now the old man's shuffle has turned into an old man's
walk. But he ain't stopping. And bit by bit he shows
he's got it in him after all.

As Ron is just about to mount the summit, Chris extends a
hand. Ron swats it away.

                       RON (CONT'D)
          Ya little pinhead.

Ron drops down onto his back to catch his breath and let
his thumping heart slow down.

                         CHRIS
          You alright?

Ron, after taking one more deep breath, sits up and Chris
sits next to him. He's actually pretty happy with
himself. He looks out and sees the distant Salton Sea.

                       RON
          I'm going to miss you when you go.
                       CHRIS
          I'll miss you too, Ron. But you're wrong
          if you think the joy of life comes
          principally from human relationships.
          God's placed it all around us. It's in
          everything. In anything we can
          experience. People just have to change
          the way they think about those things.
          You ought to put a little camper on the
          back of your pick-up and go take a look
          at some of the great work god's done out
          here in the American west.

                       RON
          Alex...You're probably right.   And I'm
          going to take stock of that.

                                                             116.



      Chris offers a skeptical glance.

                              RON (CONT'D)
                No, I am.

      A second skeptical glance.   Which Ron squashes with
      genuine sincerity.

                              RON (CONT'D)
                        (almost to himself)
                I am.

      Chris buys it this time and feels he's accomplished
      something with Ron.

                             RON (CONT'D)
                But I'll tell you something. The bits
                and pieces I've put together, you know,
                what you've told me about your family.
                Your mother and dad. And I know you got
                your problems with the church too, but
                there's some kind of bigger thing that we
                can all appreciate. And it sounds like
                you don't mind calling it God. But when
                you forgive, you love. And when you
                love...God's light shines on you.

      Miraculously, it is just at that moment that the cloud
      clears from the sun and the light shines in Ron's eyes.
      Chris points at Ron's face at the light shining on him -

                              CHRIS
                Holy Shit!

                             RON
                I told you about that language.
      The two men, their eyes welling up, fall back laughing.

      EXTREME WIDE SHOT FROM BELOW: The two men on the summit
      with the echoing of laughter and Ron's screams -

      things and tucks them into his pack.

Ron appears in the doorway dressed for travel.

                       CHRIS
          What are you doing up?     It's three-thirty
          in the morning.

                       RON
          Heard you get up off the couch half an
          hour ago, and had a funny feeling you
          might not be here for our breakfast.

Chris says nothing.

                       RON (CONT'D)
          I'm going to drive you a hundred miles to
          somewhere where you can pick up a train,
          a plane, or hitch a ride without getting
          stuck on this desert. I'd take you all
          the way to Alaska if I didn't have to get
          to an eight o'clock mass.

                       CHRIS
          Ron, you don't have to do that.

                       RON
          I want to do it.     Get you started on this
          thing of yours.

                 (interrupting)
          I know. On your "Great Alaskan
          Adventure."
From just out of Chris' eye-line, Ron leans out of frame,
picking up a zippered duffel bag. He opens it,
displaying the contents to Chris.

                       RON (CONT'D)
          There's a machete, an arctic parka,
          collapsible fishing pole, and a few odds
          and ends I threw in there for you.

          Ron...

                       RON
          Oh, just take it.

Chris does, nodding his thanks.

209   INT. RON'S TRUCK                                           209

      As Ron begins to pull over.

                             RON
                Well my friend.

                             CHRIS
                Yep.

      Both of them are uncomfortable. Chris goes for the door
      handle. Ron's gnarled hand reaches out to take Chris'
      elbow.
      After a long beat, Ron speaks without looking at Chris.
                             RON
                I had an idea. You know my mother was an
                only child. So was my father. And I was
                their only child. Now, with my own boy
                gone, I'm the end of the line. When I'm
                gone, my family will be finished. What
                do you say, you let me adopt you. I
                could be, say, your grandfather.

      This takes Chris by surprise.   He knew it would be hard
      but not this hard.

                             CHRIS
                How about we talk about this when I get
                back from Alaska, Ron. Would that be
                alright?

                                                               119.



      Silence.   Ron nods.   Releases Chris' elbow.

                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                 Alright, Ron. We'll talk about it then.

                               RON
                         (trying to mask. The
                          blinking, moist eyes again)
                 Yep.   We can do that, yep.

                                CHRIS
                 Thanks, Ron.

      Ron nods. Chris gets out of the truck. Ron watches as
      Chris saddles up his bag including the duffel that Ron
      gave him.

      Chris crosses the exit junction to where he can pick up a
      ride north on the far side of the road.

      We ZOOM SLOWLY through the windshield into Ron's face as
      he watches Chris hitching away.

      We HEAR the first bars of Neil Young's My My, Hey Hey.
      This will carry throughout the following MONTAGE.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


210   INT./EXT. VARIOUS - MONTAGE                                 210

      1. We ZOOM into Walt McCandless' face as he looks through
      the Questar telescope that Chris had given him. ANGLE:
      The stars through the telescope. The same stars his son
      walks under...somewhere. We PAN ACROSS SPACE.
      (Note: This montage will intercut Chris' traveling POV
      with objective shots. However, we never SEE Chris.)

      2. We PULL BACK from the starry night sky to see it
      framed from within a moving train.

      3. Carine in her shower, water cascades over her face.

      4. Billie in her kitchen, making dinner.

      5. Through the windshield of a semi-truck, the sun rises
      on Glacier National Park.

      6. A HANDHELD ZOOM-OUT from Canadian border crossing,
      CAMERA TURNS to the woods beyond and MOVES INTO THEM.

9. Ron holding a garage sale, while hooking a trailer to
his truck.

10. Wayne being released from jail.

11. Mads and Sonja, side by side, one-armed bandit-ing in
a Vegas casino.

12. Tracy at a high school dance, slow-dancing with her        *
young date.

13. Looking through the windshield of another semi. A
bear lopes across the two-lane road before us. We PAN
and ZOOM with it into the tundra beside the road.
HANDHELD, WALKING, we pass Mile 0 of the Alaska highway:
The sign: Fairbanks 1523 miles.

14. A waterfall.

15. Intercut hand and thumb hitching - a sense that rides
are few and far between.

211   INT. MCCANDLESS HOME, ANNANDALE - DAY                     211

                             CARINE (V.O.)
                About a month short of the second
                anniversary of Chris' disappearance, I
                had gotten engaged to my boyfriend Jerry
                Ray and was moving in with him...

      Carine, packing her belongings into boxes, stumbles upon
      the Sharon Olds book Chris had given her on his
      graduation day.

                             CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                ...when I stumbled upon the book Chris
                had given me on his graduation day. For
                some reason, it was the last line of the
                poem he read that really stuck out.

      FLASH BACK: (From page 2-3)


212   INT. DATSUN                                               212

      Chris is holding a book from which he reads aloud the
      LAST LINE OF THE POEM...

                             CHRIS
                ...and I will tell about it.

                             CARINE (V.O.)
                I asked Chris who had written the poem.

      What we SEE of Carine plays with the VOICE OVER TRACK and
      SILENT with the production track; in essence lip synching
      herself.
      Chris' dialogue comes directly from the flashback image.

                             CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Who wrote that?

                             CHRIS
                Well, it could've been either one of us.
                Couldn't it?

      We see pictures of Chris on the night-stand of Walt and
      Billie's bedroom

                             CARINE (V.O.)
                What would he tell about now?   What did
                his voice sound like now?
                             (MORE)

                                                             122.

                             CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                I realized that the words to my thoughts
                were of less and less meaning. Chris was
                writing his story and it had to be Chris
                who would tell it.

      The pictures in the scene BLUR as -

                             CHRIS (O.C.)
                       (in a far away, tunnel-like
                        sound)
                Mom, help me.

      Billie sitting bolt upright in the middle of the night,
      tears rolling down her cheeks.

      Walt awakens beside her.

                              WALT
                What is it?

                             BILLIE
                I wasn't dreaming! I didn't imagine it!
                I heard his voice, Walt. I heard Chris.

      Walt takes her in his arms, trying to squeeze life into
      both of them.

215   EXT. ALASKAN RANGE (STAMPEDE TRAIL) - DAY                  215

      We return to the area of Scene #1.
      MUSIC OVER: Of religious scope.    Perhaps choral.
      HELICOPTER SHOT: We travel a long ways across snowy
      peaks and valleys (clearly far from anywhere) passing
      between two escarpments of outer range bordering
      bottomlands five miles wide until we barely see a tiny
      form within it trudging through the snow. We overfly it.

                                                           CUT TO:


216   EXT. STAMPEDE TRAIL - DAY                                  216

      Chris, crunching through two to three feet (not more) of
      snow, in arctic parka, big boots, his warm hat, rifle
      slung over his shoulder, and pack.

                                                              124.



      He moves TOWARD CAMERA. We PAN AROUND with him as he
      walks past, where beyond Chris on the snow plain, rises a
      tree line.

                                                        CUT TO:


217   EXT. TEKLANIKA RIVER - DAY                                217

      Its banks lined with a jagged shelf of frozen overflow.
      At its center, a channel of gently flowing water, opaque
      with glacial till. Beyond the far ice shelf, Chris
      appears from the riverside treeline. He eases across the
      ice, then wades through the latte-colored channel and on
      to the other side.

      REVERSE ANGLE: Chris moving toward the opposite tree
      line, he turns back to the gentle river behind. Chris'
      POV scanning the terrain.

      From the river to a distant mountain peak and then to a
      second mountain peak, triangulating his location. He
      makes a drawing on a pad of paper and piles some medium-
      sized rocks to mark the spot before moving on into the
      trees.

      mountain, and colorless trees UNTIL a DISTANT ECHOING
      GUNSHOT.

221   EXT. UPRIVER - DAY                                        221

      As Chris walks upon a clearing in the tree line, he
      catches his first glimpse of Denali's (Mt. McKinley's)
      high-blinding white bulwarks. Chris stands in awe. We
      remain in his WIDE-SHOT POV as it -

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

      SAME SHOT - NIGHT

      But now Chris' tent sits in its foreground with the
      moonlit Denali still visible.

                                                        CUT TO:


222   EXT. WOODS BESIDE RIVER - DAY                             222

      CAMERA ANGLED SKYWARD into the broken rays of grey light.
      We TILT DOWN to find (and TRACK through the trees with)
      Chris moving along the river, when he sees something just
      OFF CAMERA.

      Chris' POV: Through the trees and fireweed, he sees
      something metallic and rusty. Chris moves up through the
      underbrush and the snow into the narrow tree line and on
      into the clearing, where before him:

      A DERELICT SCHOOL BUS. It is a vintage International
      Harvester from the 1940's.

      Chris approaches the bus, lifts the hood a little bit
      seeing that the engine is gone. As he moves around the
      vehicle, we see several windows are cracked or missing
      altogether. The green and white paint is badly oxidized.
      Weathered lettering: Fairbanks City Transit System Bus

223   INT. BUS                                                  223

      Broken whiskey bottles litter the floor. Chris may well
      have found his new home. The bus is outfitted with a
      bunk and a barrel stove. Previous visitors had left it
      stocked with matches, bug dope, and other essentials.


224   EXT. BUS                                                  224

      We follow Chris back out of the bus, surveying the area
      of the clearing. He loves what he sees.

                                                               126.



      CELEBRATORY MUSIC OVER:

      He runs up a berm to look down into the river.

      He runs from corner to corner of this "Magic Bus" area
      like a new bride surveying her honeymoon suite with glee.

      He climbs a tree, swings from its branch, doing a flip in
      the air, landing on his feet, but then slipping on the
      snow and onto his butt and then onto his back. He grabs
      a handful of snow, shoves it in his mouth, melts it into
      water, and swallows it.

      CRANE SHOT:   We PULL UP from Chris to high above the
      clearing.

      MUSIC FADES OUT

      He re-enters the bus and pulls his pen from his pocket,
      scribbling on the wall of the bus:


                TWO YEARS HE WALKS THE EARTH. NO PHONE,
                NO POOL, NO PETS, NO CIGARETTES, ULTIMATE
                FREEDOM. AN EXTREMIST. AND AESTHETIC
                VOYAGER WHOSE HOME IS...

      ANGLE: Chris:   He continues to write as he SPEAKS the
      words aloud:
                             CHRIS
                ...the road. Escaped from Atlanta. Thou
                shalt not return `cause the "west is the
                best." And now after two rambling years,
                comes the final and greatest adventure.

      Chris is cleaning up the bus.

                The climactic battle to kill the false

                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                 Ten days and nights of freight trains and
                 hitchhiking, bringing him to the great
                 white north.

      Back to Chris, REAL TIME as he continues to write as he
      speaks:

                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                 No longer to be poisoned by civilization,
                 he flees, and walks alone upon the land
                 to become lost in the wild.

      Chris signs his doctrine -

      Chris posts a found piece of paper on the inner wall of
      the bus alongside his doctrine.

      CU: Chris' hand, he writes and circles the number:

      moves into the woods on the hunt.
      SERIES OF ANGLES:

      Chris searching for game. He moves through the woods
      along the river and at the base of a nearby mountain.
      Finding animals for food seems more difficult than
      expected.

      woods. He lines up his rifle on the animal, about to
      pull the trigger, when its calf appears beside it.

      He lowers his rifle, unwilling to take a shot that would
      separate mother and child.

      Chris, cooking rice. We see his single bag of rice.     Its
      amount tells us the hunting had better improve soon.

      We explore a PASSAGE OF TIME throughout which CHRIS GETS
      INCREASINGLY THIN AND PALE: hunting, sleeping, cooking,
      rice dwindling, line-ups of scrawny shot birds. He adds
      holes to his belt leather to accommodate his shrinking
      waistline.

      with concern, perhaps only a day or so left of his
      rations. We come to the diary/log posted on the wall.
      We see that he has been there for a week's worth of
      entries as the squirrel is mentioned on day seven.

       Chris is awakened by a new May sun, streaming light
       through the windows of the bus.

       POV: the sun, circling high in the heavens.    Snowmelt
       dripping quickly across the windowpane.

      The snow has now all but vanished except on north-facing
      slopes and shadowy ravines, exposing a range carpeted in
      an amalgam of muskeg, alder thickets, and veins of
      scrawny spruce.

      A MOOSE appears from a nearby thicket. Chris drops the
      machete and pulls his rifle from his shoulder. The moose
      looks ready to charge Chris. There's no choice.

      Chris aims carefully and fires six straight shots into
      the moose's head, dropping it. Chris can hardly believe
      his own success. He puts the rifle back on his shoulder,
      just staring at the dead moose. He begins back-pedalling
      away from it. Bit by bit, his steps turn into a jog and
      then he turns and runs back toward the bus.

      In the trees beside the river, we find Chris. The river
      is not yet in sight but Chris starts to HEAR it: A
      building rumble.

      As Chris exits the treeline, there she is: The Teklanika
      at full flood. Seventy-five foot wide banks, replacing
      the narrow ice canal of four months earlier. Snowmelt
      from glaciers high in the Alaska range, its opaque
      glacial sediment the color of wet concrete. And what had
      been a distant rumble in the woods, now had the volume
      and power of a freight train, a seventy-five foot wide
      one.

      Chris grabs a hold of a riverside branch and takes one
      slow, careful step into the river. Without mercy, WHAM!
      the river kicks his feet out from under him! The branch
      he holds SNAPS! By some miracle, his hands move like
      lightening and he grabs a lower, sturdier branch below,
      saving himself from a certain death.

      We SEE the broken branch catapulted down river and into a
      rocky shoot below. He pulls himself back onto the bank,
      drops his pack at riverside, and eases to a sitting
      position beside it.

      He puts down the book and brings one of the ripe berries
      in front of his face (as close as shot of when he picked
      it.)

      Chris then grabs Tanaina Plantlore, the flora and fauna
      book he had gotten from the library in Fairbanks. And it

259   INT./EXT. BUS - SAME                                      259

      The open bag of seeds beside Chris' sleeping body. We
      drift over to Chris' face, his lips de-hydrated, and skin
      parched. He breathes heavily. He awakens. He tries to
      sit up. It's a terrible struggle. Barely makes it to
      his feet.

      Chris stumbles to the door of the bus, looking up at the
      hot sun. He has to sit back down on the small bus steps.
      From his position on the step, he leans back into the bus
      and is able to grab his water jug. He pours it into his
      mouth but nothing seems to satiate or hydrate him. He
      drinks it all. It spills over his face and chest.

                                                              138.



      We observe Chris for a moment as the wheels turn inside
      his haunted eyes. And a curiosity seems to overtake him.
      He crawls back to his copy of Tanaina Plantlore, flipping
      the pages one by one until he arrives at the photograph
      identifying the wild potato root and the word "edible"
      beside it. He reads the page to its conclusion and as
      almost an afterthought, turns the page to see if there
      might be more.

      The word -
      POISON

      jumps off the page at him.

      The book describes the tiny green seeds of the potato
      root and warns that those with:
      lateral veins, such as those invisible on the leaflets of
      wild sweet peas are poisonous.

      The words -
      ...leading to partial motor paralysis...

      ...inhibition of digestion...

      ...nausea, starvation...
      ECU:   ...STARVATION

      CRASH ZOOM into Chris' face, realizing his desperate
      plight.

      Chris kneels, holding one of the potato seeds to the
      sunlight and there we see them -

      the lateral veins that indicate poisonous seeds.

      Chris, barely able to walk, moves, at the pace of an
      elderly man, with his rifle, through the underbrush.    He
      needs food now.

      thinks is his kill, the squirrel makes off with a
      bleeding tail. Chris fires several desperate shots at
      the squirrel but misses with each one.

      A big moon shines above and we find on a tree branch, the
      squirrel Chris had clipped in the tail earlier in the
      day. On the last legs of bleeding to death, it falls
      from the tree.
      The moon becomes the sun and we pass a couple of days
      through visions of the nature about in varying light.
                                                          CUT TO:


266   EXT. SUSHANA RIVER - DAY                                  266

      Chris labors up the riverbank with his water jug full.
      He is shirtless and absolutely emaciated. Frightening.
      He pauses at the river's edge to take air into his lungs.
      It's all he can do just to breath.

      WIDE ANGLE TABLEAU (CONTINUOUS): Chris standing at the
      river's edge catching his breath framed against the
      background of the 3000 foot butte that he'd so recently
      climbed with ease.

                                                               140.



       Now, maintaining this tableau, something moves from near
       CAMERA RIGHT into frame. Bit by bit we'll realize it's a
       LARGE BEAR ENTERING FRAME and moving away from camera
       toward Chris. It lumbers to within feet of him.

       CU OVER BEAR onto Chris: Chris, passive to the bear's
       presence.

       ANGLE: The bear, just as passive towards Chris, as though
       he didn't represent enough of anything to eat.

       BACK TO TABLEAU as the bear, passing Chris, disappears
       over the rise toward the river. Chris, a motionless and
       slight silhouette.

       CONDITION OF LIFE. TOO WEAK TO WALK OUT. HAVE LITERALLY
       BECOME TRAPPED IN THE WILD - NO GAME IN SIGHT.

       A SUBTLE DRUM (HEART)BEAT BEGINS OVER:

       Chris plops himself down into the middle of the bus. He
       shakes his head as if trying to say something, and then
       considers his rifle and abundant ammunition. But taking
       his own life to avoid the agony of starvation is not an
       option for him. "No, no, no, don't do this to me." The
       frustration builds enough adrenaline in him to scream
       out.

                                                       141.



He does, but with a low, gurgled animal sound. He shakes
it off and looks to his copy of Doctor Zhivago for
distraction. Thumbing through the pages he focuses his
eyes on the page -

ANGLE: The page: what he reads:

                       CHRIS (V.0)(O.C.)
          And that an unshared happiness is not
          happiness...

Chris steals his pencil from within the pages of the
book, scribbling across the page:

                       CHRIS (V.O.)(O.C.)
                       (CONT'D)
          HAPPINESS ONLY REAL WHEN SHARED.

He flips backwards a couple of pages to where he had
written the quote:

                       CHRIS (V.O.)(O.C.)
                       (CONT'D)
          CALL EVERYTHING BY ITS RIGHT NAME.

He tears the back cover off the book and scratching the
pencil across its blank side, writing these words
quickly, as if in panic:

I HAVE HAD A HAPPY LIFE AND THANK THE LORD.    GOODBYE AND
MAY GOD BLESS ALL!

And now, these words arrive slowly as we HEAR Chris
repeating:
                       CHRIS (O.C.) (CONT'D)
                 (with a weak voice)
          Call everything by its right name.

The drumbeat increases as he signs the note:

CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON MCCANDLESS.

We move from the page back up to Chris. We see that he
has put on his eyeglasses to strengthen the vision of his
weakening sight. He removes them, folds them, and lays
them by his side. His body begins to tremble. His eyes
dance wildly.

The drumming intensifies.

Chris takes one last look out the window. The sun is
covered by a well-defined and puffy cloud.

                                                           142.


      His arm nearing spasm reaches up to the bunk, grasping at
      the blue sleeping bag made by his mother.

      With great suffering and shattering trembles, he forces
      his body to defy its agony and pushes it into the
      sleeping bag.

      SKYWARD, the cloud obscuring the sun.

      Drumbeats ESCALATE - BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
      We TIGHTEN on Chris' anguished face.
      (Director's note: These CU's on Chris' face, combine
      both static and hand-held CUs, upside down and right-side
      up moving, zooms, and push-ins. Straight, side, and
      dutch angles. Perhaps some intermittent distortion.)

      We INTERCUT between Chris and the sky in a dance
      transitioning to the next world. It is hopeful,
      anguished, sad, and elated.

                                                              143.




269   INT./EXT. ANNANDALE HOUSE - DAY                           269

      Chris, approaching the Annandale house.    His backpack on
      and body healthy.

      Billie parts the curtains, ecstatic to see Chris
      approach, alive and healthy.

      We SEE but do not hear her call to Walt.

      A smiling Chris steps up the curb, approaching home.

      Walt and Billie - we PUSH INTO them as they gleefully run
      out the front door to their returning son.

      PUSH INTO Chris - he dispatches his backpack to the
      ground and runs toward his parents' embrace.

                              CHRIS (V.O.)
                 What if you saw me running into your
                 arms...


      Chris, Walt, and Billie on the cusp of a jubilant and
      loving embrace!

                              CHRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                 Would you see then...

      The DRUMMING resumes with a BLAST OF BASS and before an
      embrace is possible...
                              CHRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                 ...what I see now?

      TOTAL SILENCE

      Chris looking at the sky, a cathartic tear falls from his
      left eye. Another from his right as the obscuring cloud
      clears the sun.

                                                             144.



Chris: The LAST, AIRY EXPULSION OF HIS BREATH.

His open face as the clearing light of the sun shines in
his eyes. It is a face of peace, love, a face of true,
deep serenity.

The eyes joyously open and the corners of his mouth ease
into the subtle smile of euphoric wisdom.

That's the way he settles to stillness, looking directly
into our camera.

                                        And he died alive.
He made it.   He lived.   He loved.

Cat Stevens' Miles from Nowhere plays OVER:

As we PULL AWAY from Chris' face through the bus window
and up into the sky -

We drift further and further away, above the stunted
trees and the shimmering roof of the bus like a tiny
white gleam in a wild green sea grows smaller and
smaller.

REPRISE IMAGE of truck driver taking picture of Chris in
scene #1.

Then it's him:

The smiling STILL IMAGE we saw taken in the first scene
from behind, but now we are seeing it from the front and
it is the image of the real Christopher McCandless on the
edge of the Stampede Trail. As it takes over the screen,
we ZOOM SLOWLY into his smiling face. And then, these
words appear superimposed over it:
Dedicated to the memory of Christopher Johnson McCandless
February 12, 1968 - August 18th, 1992

As those words dissolve, these words appear:
On September 19, 1992, Carine McCandless flew with her
brother's ashes from Alaska home to the eastern seaboard.
She carried them with her on the plane...in her backpack.

          A big, rich, powerhouse all-white high school located near

          FIFTEEN YEAR OLD BOYS in striped rugby jerseys train with
          total intensity under the critical eye of the COACH.
                         
          Right ACROSS THE BOUNDARY FENCE from the rugby fields is an
          area of WASTE LAND leading up to the freeway. There, BLACK
          AND "COLORED" (MIXED-RACE) BOYS of the same age play a loose
          game of soccer with a tennis ball. Most of them have bare
          feet and threadbare, dirty clothes, most of them are
          noticeably smaller and skinnier than the white boys.

          The rugby players are more disciplined -- or obedient -- and
          do not acknowledge the commotion until the convoy passes

                         RIGHT WINGERS
          - black retaliation
          - Mandela's frantic intervention to keep the country from

          - the African National Congress victory

          INT. MANDELA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Dark. We can make out the FORM OF A TALL MAN SLEEPING ALONE
          at the very edge of the big bed, as if not wanting to rumple
          the blankets too much.
                         
          On the bedside table, the clock clicks from 4:59 to 5:00.
          The man's eyes open in the dark, instantly awake. He reaches
          out, switches on the light.
                         
          NELSON ROLIHLAHLA MANDELA, 76, sits up and gets out of bed in
          one movement. He has the physical vigor and energy of
          someone twenty years younger.
           3.
                         
                         
                         
          The second he is up, he turns around and makes his bed,
          leaving it as flawlessly smooth as a hospital bed. Or a
          prison bunk.
                         
          For this is the discipline of twenty seven years behind bars.
                         
                         
          INT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Dressed in a tracksuit and cross-trainers, Mandela comes down
          the stairs and heads for the front door.
                         
          This is a nice, big house but it is amazingly modest for the
          President of a wealthy nation, and arguably the most famous
          man on the planet.
                         
                         
          EXT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Mandela steps outside, closes his front door quietly, takes a
          moment to savor the air. It is bone dry and cold -- typical
          conditions in the Highveld at this time of year.
                         
          It is so quiet that, for a moment, it seems as if Mandela is
          completely alone in the world.
                         
          The big yard is fenced. There is a small GUARD HOUSE at the
          driveway gate.
                         
          When Mandela steps away from the house, A UNIFORMED SOUTH
          AFRICAN POLICEMAN IN THE GUARDHOUSE pushes the button that
          opens the gate.
                         
                         
          EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          When the gate begins to open we see that there are TWO GREY
          BMWs parked either side of it.
                         
                         
          INT. GREY BMW - NIGHT
                         
          LINGA MOONSAMY comes to full alert as the gate opens. He is
          a big, scowling man dressed in a suit. He checks the load on
          a pistol, tucks it into his shoulder holster.
                         
                          LINGA
           Here he comes. Like clockwork.
                         
                          JASON
           It makes him such an easy target.
           4.
                         
                         
                         
          Behind Linga, in the back seat, sits JASON TSHABALALA, a
          naturally tense and suspicious man. Both of them are hollow-
          eyed, exhausted, running on adrenaline.
                         
          They get out of the BMW, fast and quiet. This does not look
          good.
                         
                         
          EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          As Mandela walks out through the gate, Jason and Linga
          intercept him.
                         
                          JASON
           (traditional greeting in
                          XHOSA)
           I see you, father.
                         
          Mandela's face comes alive as he smiles.
                         
                          MANDELA
           (without breaking stride)
           Morning boys. How are you?
                         
          Jason is Mandela's head of personal security, Linga his
          number one bodyguard. They are both former "terrorists", and
          they are utterly devoted to Mandela.
                         
                          JASON
           We're sharp, Madiba.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Good ... good. And how's your
           mother doing, Linga?
                         
                          LINGA
           She's much better, thank you.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Good.
                         
          Mandela picks up the pace. Jason and Linga fall back, so
          that they are a few steps behind him.
                         
          They share a quick look. They hate this walk. It scares
          them. There's no way for it to be anything but completely
          unsanitary, from a security point of view.

          A SMALL DELIVERY VAN drives really fast, blows through stop
          signs.

          Mandela strides along the big, wide, tree-lined streets.
          Jason and Linga shadow him, eyes and ears alert.
                         
          Up ahead, we see a SMALL, UPSCALE AREA OF SHOPS AND
          RESTAURANTS.

          Mandela, Jason and Linga reach the shopping area. Dark,
          deserted.

                          CUT TO:
                         
          Mandela, Jason and Linga pass a HUGE POSTER OF MANDELA in the
          window of CORNER GROCERY. Mandela does not react to this
          giant picture of himself, Jason and Linga do, proudly --
                         
          (A GENERAL NOTE: starting with the window of this grocery,
          there are pictures of Mandela everywhere. Magazine covers,
          newspaper centerfolds, T-shirts, children's art -- as if to
          make up for all the time Mandela's image and words were
          banned.)
                         
          -- until they HEAR THE SOUND OF THE VAN tearing towards them.
          They turn, SEE HEADLIGHTS VEERING TO THEIR SIDE OF THE
          STREET.
           6.
                         
                         
                         
          BOTH MEN DROP THEIR HANDS TO THEIR GUNS. Linga steps in
          front of Mandela, shielding him, Jason steps out wide, ready
          for anything.
                         
          Mandela is completely calm. The van screeches to a halt just
          past them.
                         
          A GUY jumps out of the van holding a tied BUNDLE OF
          NEWSPAPERS, which he drops with a thump at the grocery door.
          The guy doesn't see them. The delivery van is gone before
          the newspapers stop moving.
                         
          Mandela heads for the newspapers -- he wants to see the
          headlines.
                         
          Jason and Linga take their hands off their guns, but they do
          not relax. These are dangerous times.
                         
          GO IN ON THE TOP NEWSPAPER, which shows a PHOTO OF THE
          INAUGURATION, and the following words, in Afrikaans: HE CAN
          WIN AN ELECTION, BUT CAN HE RUN A COUNTRY?
                         
                          JASON
           What does it say?
                         
                          MANDELA
           It says, "He can win an election,
           but can he run a country?"
                         
                          LINGA
                          (DISGUSTED)
           Not even one day on the job and
           they're after you.
                         
                          MANDELA
           It's a legitimate question.
                         
          Mandela turns and marches for home. Jason and Linga fall in
          behind him. In the east, the first milky hint of day.
                         
                         
          INT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - BEFORE DAWN
                         
          The house is now bustling with activity. A pretty member of
          the KITCHEN STAFF sets a single place at the head of a big,
          formal dining table.
                         
          A LADY CHEF stirs the porridge, a KITCHEN ASSISTANT cuts
          fresh fruit.
                         
          Mandela's PERSONAL SECRETARY, MARY marches out of her small
          office with a STACK OF CORRESPONDENCE AND FIVE NEWSPAPERS,
          places them neatly next to the table setting.

          Outside, Mandela is surrounded by men. Inside, he has
          surrounded himself with women of all shapes, colors and ages,
          to make up for twenty seven years without.

          MANDELA SHAVES UPSTAIRS IN THE BATHROOM. The razor is dull.
                         
          Mandela opens drawers looking for another. He opens a drawer
          that is empty but for a WOMAN'S BEADED BRACELET, broken and
          shedding tiny colored beads.
                         
          Mandela looks for it for a moment, then closes the drawer,
          looks at himself in the mirror. Mostly, Mandela's face is
          warm, animated, energetic and this is how we see him, almost
          all the time.
                         
          But, sometimes, his face can be a remote, sphinx-like mask
          that conceals all emotion, all feeling. This is his prison
          face.
                         
          This is the face that looks back at Mandela, right now, in
          the mirror. It is the face of a man whose long, hard journey
          has marked his very soul.
                         
          Expressionless, Mandela shaves himself with the dull razor.

          Click! The TV is turned off by MR. PIENAAR (late 40's) in
          his very modest, blue-collar house.
                         
           MR. PIENAAR
                          (GLOOMY)
           I never thought I'd see the day.
                         
          Mr. Pienaar turns and addresses his son, FRANCOIS PIENAAR,
          27, a big, blond, almost-handsome man with a fighter's face
          and mangled ears. Brutal toughness and honor in his
          features. A powerful physical presence, possibly dangerous.
          Francois drips with sweat, wears running clothes. Whatever
          he does, he is strong, fit and driven.
                         
           MR. PIENAAR
           I feel sorry for you, son. You've
           got your whole life ahead of you.
           What's it going to be like now?
                         
          MRS. PIENAAR (late 40's) enters holding some kind of PROTEIN
          SHAKE for Pienaar.
                         
           MRS. PIENAAR
           Don't be so gloomy.

           MR. PIENAAR
           I'm telling you, Francois -- look
           at Angola, look at Mozambique.
           Look at Zimbabwe. We're next.
           They're going to take our jobs and
           drive us into the sea. Just you
           wait.

          EXT. UNION BUILDINGS, PRETORIA - DAY
                         
          Magnificent, sweeping government buildings made of carved
          African field stone, with an Italian tiled roof, situated on
          a hill overlooking Pretoria. The seat of power.
                         
          Today, the entrance is mobbed with a huge, joyous, multi-
          racial throng, plus news crews from all over the world. Lots
          of new South African flags evident.
                         
          We move through the throng and swoop up into the air, so that
          we can soar along the outside of the building and LOOK
          THROUGH THE WINDOWS into the offices of state --
                         
          -- where people who worked for the De Klerk regime are
          packing up, in anticipation of being booted out by the
          Mandela regime. These characters run the gamut from little
          old Afrikaner tea ladies in tears, to the stoic fossils of
          grand apartheid. They are all white. A good third of the
          offices are already deserted.
                         
          The deserted offices have open doors. Through a window,
          through an open door, we see Mandela and his bodyguards
          striding down a Union Building hallway.
                         
          We swoop in through the window --
                         
                         
          INT. UNION BUILDING HALLWAYS - DAY
                         
          -- and catch up with the new President. Mandela is regal in
          a magnificent tailored suit. Jason in front, Linga behind.
                         
          PORTRAITS of the architects and champions of apartheid look
          down sternly on them as they pass.
                         
          They pass a WORKER hanging a PORTRAIT OF MANDELA next to one
          of De Klerk, the previous President.
                         
          ON LINGA, as he smiles at that.
                         
          Mandela, on the other hand, looks into the empty offices, and
          into the offices being packed up.
                         
          Up ahead, the double doors to the OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT,
          are closed. Jason speeds up, opens them, pokes his head in,
          then opens the doors wide.
                         
                          JASON

          INT. MANDELA'S OFFICES - DAY
                         
          Mandela's offices are fronted by a LARGE RECEPTION AREA,
          already filled with PEOPLE WAITING TO SEE HIM.
                         
          To one side are his CHIEF OF STAFF'S SUITE of offices, to the
          other side, the SMALL PRESIDENTIAL SECURITY OFFICE.
                         
          Beyond these are MANDELA'S SECRETARIES, TYPISTS AND
          ASSISTANTS -- his gatekeepers.
                         
          Beyond that is the inner sanctum, MANDELA'S OWN OFFICE.
                         
          The phones are ringing off the hook. Fax machines are
          chattering. Everyone wants a piece of Mandela.
                         
          Mandela enters, Jason and Linga behind him.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Good morning everybody.

          BARBARA MASEKELA, Mandela's CHIEF OF STAFF (and now
          Ambassador to the U.S.), emerges from her office, carrying an
          arm load of files, folders and papers --
                         
                          MANDELA
           Barbara, good morning. You've had
           your hair done. I like it.
                         
          -- accompanies Mandela back towards his office.
                         
                          BARBARA
           Thank you, Madiba. We need to talk
           about your cabinet appointments and
           ministers.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Give me one moment, please.
                         
          Barbara waits outside Mandela's office, as he enters ahead of
          her.
                         
                         
          INT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Mandela stands in the middle of his office, takes a moment to
          savor where he is.
           11.
                         
                         
                         
          Then, he takes off his jacket, hangs it up and is ready for
          work.

                          MANDELA
           -- please assemble the staff for

          INT. UNION BUILDING STAFF DINING ROOM - DAY
                         
          What's left of the UNION BUILDING STAFF are packed into the
          DINING ROOM. White faces, bitter and resentful. Waiting to
          be fired.
                         
          Through the glass doors, THEY SEE MANDELA APPROACHING DOWN
          THE HALLWAY, Linga and Jason with him.
                         
                          STAFF MEMBER#1
           Here he comes.
                         
                          STAFF MEMBER#2
           He wants the satisfaction of firing
           us himself.
                         
          They stand up straight, determined to receive the ax with
          pride.
                         
                         
          INT. UNION BUILDING HALLWAYS - DAY
                         
          Linga and Jason amp up when they see the room full of
          restless Afrikaners. At the STAFF DINING ROOM DOOR, Mandela
          turns to them.
                         
                          MANDELA
           I'd like you to stay out here,
           please.
                         
                          JASON
           But, Madiba ...
           12.
                         
                         
                         
                          MANDELA
           I cannot talk to them if I'm hiding
           behind men with guns.
                         
          Mandela opens the doors and enters. Jason and Linga stay
          outside ... just.
                         
                         
          INT. UNION BUILDING DINING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Mandela enters, smiles -- gets not one smile in return.
                         
                          MANDELA
                          (IN AFRIKAANS)
           Gooie more almal.
                         
                          STAFF MEMBER
                          (ASIDE)
           Does he think greeting us in
           Afrikaans makes this any sweeter?
                         
                          MANDELA
           Some of you may know who I am.
                         
          This gets a few bitter chuckles. Mandela is at this best
          just talking to people, like this. Only, he doesn't just
          talk to them, he wades in amongst them, shaking hands and
          making individual contact as he speaks to all of them.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Good morning ... how are you ...
           thank you for coming at such short
           notice ... etc.
                         
           QUICK CUT TO:
                         
          Mandela is a continual security nightmare. You can see the
          tension on Jason and Linga's faces as he disappears into the
          throng.
                         
                          BACK TO:
                         
          When Mandela reaches the middle of the room, he stops shaking
          hands, and turns slowly as he talks to everybody.
                         
                          MANDELA
           I couldn't help noticing the empty
           offices as I came to work today.
           And all the packing boxes.
                         
          One black man, surrounded by a throng of serious white faces.

                          MANDELA
           Now, of course, if you want to
           leave, that is your right. And if
           you feel in your heart that you
           cannot work with your new
           government, then it is better that
           you do leave, right away.
                         
          He can be tough and blunt, when necessary.
                         
                          MANDELA
           But if you are packing up because
           you fear that your language, or the
           color of your skin, or who you
           served previously, disqualifies you
           from working here now, I am here to
           tell you, have no such fear.
                          (BEAT)
           Wat is verby is verby. What's past
           is past. We look to the future,
           now.
                         
          This is not what they expected to hear.
                         
                          MANDELA
           We need your help. We want your
           help. If you would like to stay,
           you will be doing your country a
           great service.
                         
          Mandela pauses, to look at the faces. They are receptive.
                         
                          MANDELA
           I ask only that you do your jobs to
           the best of your abilities, and
           with good hearts. I promise to do
           the same.
                          (BEAT)
           If we can manage that, our country
           will be a shining light in the
           world.

          Jason and Linga are right outside the glass doors, looking in
          and listening. Jason shakes his head.
                         
                          JASON
           He wants to win them over, one damn

          Mandela heads back through to his office, Barbara, Mary and
          other assistants forming a phalanx around him. Linga peels
          off, goes into the security office.
                         
          Jason stands at the desk of one of the assistants (JESSIE),
          waits for her to finish a call, then:
                         
                          JASON
           Molo, sister.

          Jason grins.
                         
                          JASON
           When you get a chance, can we see
           the schedule for the month? We
           need to plan security.

           morning.
                         
          Jessie waves Jason off. He crosses to the security office,
          enters.
                         
                         
          INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Once he closes the door behind him, Jason shows his fatigue.
          Linga is feet-up on the sofa, sucking on a cup of coffee.
          Three more bodyguards -- SAM, KWEZI and WINSTON -- slump in
          chairs.
                         
          Jason grabs coffee, sits at his desk, puts his feet up with a
          groan.
                         
                          JASON

          The door opens -- but what enters is not beautiful.
                         
          FOUR BIG WHITE COPS in suits enter, Special Branch written
          all over them. ETIENNE VAN ECK, HENDRICK BOOYENS, GEORGE and
          WILLEM.
                         
          The bodyguards stand up like junk yard dogs protecting their
          territory.
                         
                          JASON
           What is this?
                         
                          ETIENNE
           Mr. Jason Tshabalala?
                         
                          JASON
           That's me. Am I under arrest?
                         
          Etienne snaps out a crisp salute.
                         
                          ETIENNE
           Captain Van Eck and team reporting
           for duty, sir.
                         
          Hendrick, George and Willem snap out salutes. Their military
          deportment contrasts strongly with the less rigid body
          language of the black bodyguards.
                         
                          JASON
           What duty?
                         
                          ETIENNE
           We're the Presidential bodyguard.
           We've been assigned to this office.
           (holding out a sheet of
                          PAPER)
           Here are our orders.
                         
          Jason takes the orders, studies them, face increasingly
          angry.
                         
                          LINGA
                          (TO HENDRICK)
           You're Special Branch, right?

          Hendrick nods, sternly. Linga, Sam, Kwezi and Winston react
          to that -- there is a long and brutal history between them
          and the Special Branch.
                         
                          ETIENNE
           You'll see that they've been
           signed.
                         
                          JASON
           I don't care if they're signed or --
                         
          Jason does a double-take when he sees the signature on the
          orders: NELSON R. MANDELA.
                         
                          JASON
           Wait here.
                         
          Jason storms out, holding the orders. The four black
          bodyguards seethe with hostility. The four white bodyguards
          stare straight ahead, refusing to give ground.

          Mandela and Barbara look over a position paper on something
          or other. When Jason knocks and enters, they pause.
                         
                          JASON
           Sorry to disturb you.
                         
                          MANDELA
           You look agitated, Jason.
                         
                          JASON
           That's because I've got four
           Special Branch cops in my office.
                         
                          MANDELA
           What have you done?
                         
                          JASON
           Me? Nothing. They say they're the
           Presidential bodyguard. They have
           orders.

           Yes. They've had special training,
           those boys -- with the SAS. And
           lots of experience. They protected
           De Klerk.

                          MANDELA
           You asked for more men, didn't you?
                         
                          JASON
           Yes, but --
                         
                          MANDELA

                          JASON
           Reconciliation? Madiba, not long
           ago they tried to kill us! Maybe
           even these four guys. They tried
           and, often, they succeeded!

          Linga, Sam, Winston and Kwezi stare down Etienne, Hendrick,
          George and Willem.

          Mandela stares at Jason in an entirely different way -- with
          wisdom, compassion and sympathy.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Yes, I know.
                          (VERY GENTLY)
           Forgiveness starts here, too.
                         
          Mandela lets that sink in for a moment. He knows he asks for
          something very difficult, but he demands it of himself to an
          even greater degree.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Forgiveness liberates the soul. It
           removes fear. That is why it is
           such a powerful weapon, Jason.

          Jason exhales. He isn't remotely ready to forgive.
                         
                          JASON
           Yes, Madiba. Sorry to disturb you.
                         
          Jason turns, leaves. Barbara shakes her head at Mandela.
                         
                          BARBARA

          As Jason -- very upset -- walks back to security, Jessie
          holds out a file for him.
                         
                          JESSIE
           Two copies of the schedule.
                         
          Jason snatches the file, keeps walking.
                         
                          JESSIE
           Thank you, Jessie!
                         
          When he reaches the security office door, Jason walks right
          past, keeps going, has to make a full loop of the reception
          area, just to get himself together.
                         
          Even so, when he gets back to the security office door, Jason
          pauses, gathers himself to do something that he knows he's
          going to hate.

          Things haven't eased up one little bit inside the office.
          The silence is deafening. Jason enters, looks them all over.
          His face is grim.
                         
                          LINGA
           Can we get rid of these guys, now?
                         
          Jason flashes a look at Linga, then -- and this hurts him,
          visibly -- he holds out one of MANDELA'S SCHEDULES to
          Etienne.

           assignments.
                         
                          ETIENNE
           Right.

           What?
                         
          Linga and the others are shocked.
                         
                          LINGA
           Jason, I have to talk to you.
           Outside.
                         
          Linga virtually pulls Jason out of the office.
                         
                         
          INT. MANDELA'S OFFICES - DAY
                         
          Just outside the Security Office door, so they keep their
          voices low.

           How can we trust them?

           We can't.
           (heading back in)
           This is what Madiba wants, okay.
                         
          Not okay for Linga, judging by the expression on his face.

          When Jason and Linga enter, Etienne looks up from Mandela's
          schedule.
                         
                          ETIENNE

           No. Yes. Madiba gets upset if you
           don't smile when you push people
           out of the way.

           The President's clan name. It's
           what we call him.
                         
          The new bodyguards share a look. They're not comfortable
          with "Madiba".
                         
                          ETIENNE
           We'll call him Mr. President.
                         
          Jason lifts the schedule.
                         
                          JASON
           Let's get through this.
                         
          Still upset and hostile, the black bodyguards look over
          Jason's shoulder, the white bodyguards look over Etienne's,
          at the month's schedule.
                         
          Apartheid is by no means dead in this cramped little office.
                         
          Both teams study and discuss the schedule -- (shop talk tbd

          schedule.
                         
                          JASON

           Who didn't vote for him. Who
           probably hate him. Who came out of
           the womb with guns in their hands.
                         
          OVER, THE UNMISTAKABLE SOUND OF PRE-GAME NOISE AT A MAJOR
          SPORTING EVENT.

          A huge, raucous crowd, almost entirely white and male. Many
          wearing the Springbok green and gold. Widespread evidence of
          drinking.
                         
          Lots of OLD SOUTH AFRICAN FLAGS -- the blue, white and orange
          apartheid flag -- make a defiant statement against the NEW
          SOUTH AFRICAN FLAGS ringing the stadium.
                         
          On the field, THE RUGBY TEAMS ASSEMBLE and face each other in
          two lines. The BRITISH LIONS in their white on white with
          black and red trim, the SPRINGBOKS in their green and gold.
                         
          Like their supporters, the Springboks are all white, but for
          one man, who is "colored" (mixed race).
           22.
                         
                         
          Big, tough, brutal-looking men. Scary. (We may or may not
          notice Francois Pienaar, standing at the head of the line of
          Springboks.)

          At the entrance of the tunnel onto the field, LOTS OF COPS in
          blue South African Police uniforms.
                         
          Behind the line of cops, in the tunnel, we find JASON AND ALL
          THE OTHER BODYGUARDS but for Linga. They are keyed-up,
          intense -- none more so than Jason.
                         
                          JASON
           (shouting against the
                          NOISE)
           I want your eyes on the crowd at
           all times. We're staying in the
           middle of the field. He's going to
           walk out, shake hands, walk back.
           Nothing else. Got it?
                         
          They nod. They are like the players at game time, only the
          stakes are much higher. Jason looks deeper into the tunnel,
          straightens up.
                         
                          JASON
           Here we go.
                         
          Mandela strides down the tunnel towards them, wearing a dark
          suit. Big crowds energize him. His eyes are alive with
          excitement.
                         
          One pace behind him, like a huge, dark shadow, comes Linga.
                         
          Mandela gives Jason a look, Jason nods.
                         
          We follow Mandela and the bodyguards out of the tunnel --
                         
                         
          EXT. LOFTUS VERSFELD STADIUM - DAY
                         
          -- onto the field, towards the waiting teams.
                         
          The crowd rise to their feet. Lots of them jeer Mandela,
          lots cheer. All the old South African flags are waved at him
          defiantly -- plus some new ones.
                         
          Mandela waves to them all, smiling proudly. To him, a crowd
          is an opportunity to make new friends. But he stays in the
          center of the field.
           23.
                         
                         
                         
          Jason and crew are hyper-alert, a human fence around Mandela.
                         
          Mandela reaches the rugby players.
                         
          Waiting for him at the head of the Springbok line, wearing
          the NUMBER 6 JERSEY and captain's armband, is FRANCOIS
          PIENAAR. Now we know what he does.
                         
          Mandela extends his hand.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Good luck, captain.
                         
                          PIENAAR
                          (SHAKING HANDS)
           Thank you, sir.
                         
          Mandela shakes hands down the line of Springboks, then
          returns, shaking hands with the British Lions. Quick,
          perfunctory handshakes.
                         
          As Mandela does this, we take BODYGUARD POV SNAPSHOTS of the
          crowd, increasingly keyed-up and restless. Time to play
          rugby.
                         
          Mandela finishes, waves to the crowd, and begins the walk
          along the center of the field, back to the tunnel.
                         
          Crowd noise increases. They know the opening whistle is
          about to blow.
                         
          Then, Mandela sees something in the crowd, at field level.
                         
          MANDELA'S POV: A GROUP OF ROUGH-LOOKING WHITE MEN WAVE THE
          NEW SOUTH AFRICAN FLAG AT HIM.
                         
          WITHOUT WARNING, MANDELA CHANGES DIRECTION, heads towards
          this group, towards a wall of his former -- and perhaps
          current -- enemies.

          With his bodyguards scrambling to stay in position, Mandela
          reaches the stands, hand outstretched, leans into the crowd.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Thank you for honoring our new
           flag!
                         
          Some shake his hand, some -- very pointedly -- do not.
                         
          The crowd noise takes on an ugly undertone -- Mandela is
          delaying the rugby.
                         
          Mandela is undeterred. He's into this one-on-one outreach.
          He turns, looks for more hands to shake --
                         
          -- and Jason steps in between Mandela and the crowd.
                         
                          JASON
           We're delaying the rugby, Madiba.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Oh, yes, of course.
                         
          Mandela gives one last wave, turns away.
                         
          As he does, SOMEONE WINDS UP AND THROWS SOMETHING from the
          stands.
                         
          Jason and Etienne catch the movement, whirl, too late.
                         
          AN ORANGE WHIZZES PAST MANDELA'S HEAD, explodes juicily on
          the field.
                         
          Mandela didn't see it, doesn't react. If anything, his smile
          widens as he heads across the field. The bodyguards close
          around him protectively, get him back to the tunnel.

          Jason signals for extra bodyguards to escort Mandela all the
          way up to his box. Hendrick, the biggest, leads the way.
                         
          Jason stays in the tunnel, along with Etienne. Both men are
          in a muck sweat, adrenaline coursing through them.
                         
                          ETIENNE
           Why didn't you stop him?

           Oh, he saw it. He sees everything.

          Two international front rows come together with bone-
          crunching force.
                         
          Huge, violent men grunt like bulls. The crowd roar vibrates
          the stadium. The scrum -- a phalanx of eight men locked
          together against eight -- wheels, buckles, then steadies
          under the watchful eye of the referee.
                         
          Fanning out behind each scrum are the backs -- faster, more
          glamorous players who will run with the ball, or kick it.
                         
          The Lions scrumhalf thrusts the ball into the maw of the
          scrum, the huge men lock up against each other with maximum
          force.
                         
          The ball comes out the back of the Lions' scrum, the
          scrumhalf dive-passes it away to the backs, who flick it out
          laterally to the wing, with lightning speed.
                         
          The wing lofts a delicate kick just over the onrushing
          Springbok defenders. The Lions charge the ball, which
          bounces erratically --
                         
          -- right into the hands of the man who kicked it. One last
          burst of speed, one quick juke to avoid a desperation tackle,
          and the wing scores in the corner.
                         
          As the Lions kicker gets ready to convert the try, we find
          the Springboks huddling under their goal posts, hands on
          their hips, stunned.
           26.
                         
                         
                         
          At the center of the huddle Pienaar bleeds behind his gum
          guard as, furiously, he tries to inject some fire into his

                          PIENAAR
           Concentrate, dammit! Focus! We
           can beat these guys if we play our
           game, not theirs!
                         
          ON PIENAAR, as he realizes he is not getting through. There
          is dullness, shock in his player's eyes --
                         
          -- which all lift to the heavens as the CONVERSION KICK SOARS
          through the uprights.
                         
          We FOLLOW THE KICK as it drops past a GIANT SCOREBOARD.
                         
          STAY ON THE SCOREBOARD as it registers the conversion and
          shows the score: LIONS - 10 SPRINGBOKS - 0

          In the VIP box, Mandela turns his back on the field as the
          game restarts beneath him and continues in the background.
          He has BINOCULARS around his neck.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Shall we work while we watch? We
           have lots of promises to keep.

          Mary pours tea at the back of the box. Linga stands two
          steps behind Mandela.
                         
          On Mandela's left, sits the PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICAN RUGBY,
          a small man with a small man's ruthlessness and drive.
                         
                          MANDELA
           It's not too late, if the boys can

          Mandela's expression shows that he has a gentleman's distaste
          for profanity. He turns to Barbara.

          Barbara makes notes.
                         
          Mandela lifts his BINOCULARS, but instead of looking at the
          rugby, he looks at the crowd.

          MANDELA'S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS -- Mandela zeroes in on an
          OLD SOUTH AFRICAN FLAG -- the apartheid flag. It is being
          held by the FOUR KHAKI-CLAD BOERS (FARMERS). Classic South
          African figures from the rural far north, they are already
          drunk and suicidally depressed by the turn of events on the
          field.

          He stomps out of the box, no doubt looking for someone to
          fire. Mandela gets back to work.

          face the door, alert, as a UNIFORMED DOORMAN opens it.
                         
          The MINISTER OF SPORT (Steve Tshwete), enters.

          The Lions celebrate. The Springboks head off the field,
          heads down, shoulders bowed in defeat -- none more bitterly
          disappointed or bloodier than Francois Pienaar.
                         
          In the stands, the unheard of happens -- the Springboks are

          Pienaar takes off his green and gold jersey, sits, begins

           everybody!
           34.
                         
                         
                         
                         
          INT. SMALL, BEAT-UP CHURCH - DAY
                         
          At a table near the altar, the kids rummage through bags of
          second-hand clothes under the watchful eye of MRS. COLEMAN, a
          stout and charitable woman. Next to her, MRS. DLAMINI hands
          out a lollipop and says --
                         
           MRS. DLAMINI
           God bless you.
                         
          -- to each kid. The clothes and lollipops move fast, rhythm
          kept by Mrs. Dlamini's "God bless yous".
                         
          The last bag of clothes empties fast as the line of kids
          reduces until there is only ONE SMALL BOY (SIPHO) left and
          only one article of clothing. An old SPRINGBOK RUGBY
          PRACTISE JERSEY. Green and gold.
                         
          Sipho could use it. His clothes are more holes than anything
          else. He looks at the Springbok jersey mournfully.
                         
           MRS. COLEMAN
           You're a very lucky boy. It's a
           real Springbok practise jersey!
           It's a bit big, but it's warm and
           it'll last for ever!
                         
          Sipho shakes his head.
                         
           MRS. COLEMAN
           It's yours, take it! Go on.
                         
          Sipho turns and leaves. Mrs. Coleman looks at Mrs. Dlamini,
          completely confused.
                         
           MRS. COLEMAN
           Why won't he take it?
                         
           MRS. DLAMINI
           If he wears it, the others will
           beat him up.
                         
           MRS. COLEMAN
           Because the Springboks are playing
           so badly?
                         
           MRS. DLAMINI
           No. Because, for them, the
           Springboks still represent
           apartheid.

          EXT. EERSTERUST CONFERENCE CENTER - DAY
                         
          Eersterust is a settlement and conference location just
          outside Pretoria.
                         
          Today it is the location of a full membership meeting of the
          National Sports Council, an ANC organization that is now the
          governing body of all sports in South Africa.
                         
          A banner draped across the conference center entrance tells
          us so: WELCOME NATIONAL SPORTS COUNCIL.
                         
                         
          INT. CONFERENCE HALL - DAY
                         
          An NSC FIREBRAND has the podium and the microphone.
                         
                          NSC FIREBRAND
           ... and now for the next item on
           our agenda.
                         
          The hall is jammed. Very few white faces.
                         
                          NSC FIREBRAND
           The NSC executive proposes a full
           membership vote on the following
           motion ...
                         
          A ripple of anticipation goes through the delegates.
                         
                          NSC FIREBRAND
           ... that as a prominent symbol of
           the apartheid era, the colors,
           emblem and name of the Springboks
           be eliminated immediately ...
                         
          That causes a stir. The delegates understand how big this
          is.
                         
                          NSC FIREBRAND
           ... and that all sports teams
           representing South Africa shall be
           known forthwith as the Proteas.
                         
          Excitement and noise level rises. The NSC Firebrand has to
          shout through his mike.
                         
                          NSC FIREBRAND
                          (SHOUTING)
           We will submit this motion to a
           hand vote.

           In the event of a close count, we
           will go to a written ballot.

                          WAITING FOR)
           ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF ELIMINATING
           THE SPRINGBOKS, RAISE YOUR HANDS.
                         
          The NSC firebrand shoots his clenched fist into the air.
          With a roar, the delegates respond, raising their fists.
          Unanimous. The Springboks are history.

          He slams both palms down hard on his desk.

          Both bodyguard units (minus Jason) are crammed into the small
          office. The black bodyguards murmur amongst themselves in
          Xhosa. (Ad-lib.) The white bodyguards talk Afrikaans (ad-
          lib).
                         
          No talk between the two units, only tension.
                         
          Tension broken with a crash as JASON SLAMS THE DOOR OPEN.

           Madiba ... the people want this.
           They hate the Springboks. They
           don't want to be represented by a
           team they cheered against all their
           lives.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Yes, I know. But in this instance
           the people are wrong. And it is my
           job as their elected leader to make
           them see that.
                         
          Mandela leans forward to talk to Linga.

           wants to go to Eersterust, very
           fast.
                         
          Linga murmurs into his radio. The convoy pulls out, very
          fast. Barbara makes one last plea.
                         
                          BARBARA
           You're risking your political
           capital. You're risking your
           future as our leader.

          Mandela strides over to Jason, says something to him. Jason
          looks surprised, turns to Hendrick.

          As the applause finally begins to diminish, the NSC Firebrand
          turns and nods to a CHURCH CHOIR DIRECTOR, off to the side.
                         
          The choir director brings his CHOIR onto the stage.

          out, whispers urgently into the NSC Firebrand's ear.

          Choir Director, says something quickly.
                         
          The Choir Director stops the choir in mid-chorus.
          Consternation everywhere. What's going on?
                         
                          NSC FIREBRAND
           Brothers, sisters, members of the
           choir -- we would only interrupt
           such beautiful music for something
           truly important. In this case, for
           someone truly important.

           Please welcome President Mandela!
                         
          The place goes berserk as Mandela enters, with Linga at his
          back, and -- surprise, surprise -- Hendrick Booyens leading
          the way.
                         
          Face stern and unsmiling, Mandela walks the length of the
          hall towards the podium. The delegates press in towards
          them.

           Smile.
                         
          ON HENDRICK, as his standard bad bastard scowl suddenly
          becomes a smile -- which scares the throng more than the
          scowl did.
                         
          ON LINGA, the same.
                         
          ANOTHER ANGLE - Barbara enters at the back of the hall,
          accompanied by Kwezi.
                         
          Mandela reaches the podium, turns looks out over the crowd,
          face thunderous.
                         
          When they see his anger, the crowd quietens down quickly.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Brothers, sisters, comrades, I am
           here because I feel strongly that
           you made a decision today without
           sufficient information or
           foresight.

                          MANDELA
           I am aware of your earlier vote. I
           am aware that it was unanimous.
                          (BEAT)
           Nonetheless, I propose that we
           restore the Springboks. Restore
           their name, their emblem and their
           colors, immediately.
                         
          Instant and complete silence in the hall. This is utterly
          unpopular. Shocked faces, especially from the executive and
          the NSC firebrand.

          out in front of her.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Let me tell you why ...
                         
          Murmurs of disapproval and disagreement begin to rise.
          Mandela's going to have to row upstream on this one.
                         
                          MANDELA
           ... on Robben Island, in Pollsmoor
           Prison, my jailers were all
           Afrikaners.
                          (BEAT)
           For twenty seven years, I studied
           them. I learned their language, I
           read their history, I read their
           poetry. I had to know my enemy, in
           order to prevail against him.
                          (BEAT)
           And we prevailed, did we not? All
           of us here ... we prevailed.
                         
          For the first time, Mandela says something the crowd likes.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Our enemy is no longer the
           Afrikaner. They are our fellow
           South Africans, our partners in
           democracy.
                         
          Just as quickly, Mandela loses them again.
                         
                          MANDELA
           And they treasure Springbok rugby.
           If we take that away, we lose them.
           We prove that we are what they
           feared we would be.
                          (BEAT)
           We have to be better than that.

           generosity.
                         
          The grumbling and disagreement becomes noticeably louder.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Yes, I know. All the things they
           denied us.
                         
          ON HENDRICK, totally engrossed in his job, eyes sweeping
          across the crowd, feeling the tension.
                         
                          MANDELA
           But this is not the time to enjoy a
           moment's petty revenge. This is
           the time to build our nation using
           every single brick available to us -
           - even if that brick comes clothed
           in green and gold.
                         
          The crowd is growing more restless and rebellious by the
          moment.
                         
          LINGA is as alert as Hendrick, tuned in to the jumpy vibe.

           Who is with me on this?
                         
          It's almost as if he's daring them to go against him.

          own people like that took it out of him. Barbara stares out
          the window, chewing her lip, totally stressed out.
                         
          Linga heaves a great sigh, exhales a truckload of stress.

           I'm sorry, Madiba, but we've got
           problems everywhere we look.
           Housing, food, jobs, crime, our
           currency. You can't keep
           interrupting affairs of state to
           placate a minority.

          The sound of cleats approaching on concrete. Exhausted
          footsteps. The DRESSING ROOM ATTENDANT PUTS CASES OF BEER

          -- as the Springboks enter silently, faces miserable,
          shoulders slumped. They've lost another game.
                         
          One of the players grabs a beer, opens it, takes a gigantic
                         SWIG --
                         
                          ANGRY SPRINGBOK
           This beer tastes like kuk.
                         
          -- hurls the beer against the wall so hard it ruptures,
          sending foaming beer everywhere.
                         
          ON PIENAAR as his eyes flash and he shoots to his feet.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           It's not the beer.
                         
          Pienaar picks up a case of beers, goes to the angry
          Springbok.

          Pienaar cracks his beer, raises it up. They all crack and
          raise their beers.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           ... to the taste of defeat.
                         
          That bewilders his team.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Drink it. Remember it. And
           promise yourself never to taste it
           again.
                         
          Pienaar takes one long swig --
                         
                          PIENAAR
           You're right. It tastes like kuk.
                         
          -- tosses his beer against the wall, so that it ruptures.
          Eighteen other beers rupture against the wall. The dressing
          room is awash with beer and foam -- and re-kindled passion.
                         
          As with Mandela, Pienaar is a leader, on a smaller scale.

          We are in a COURTYARD behind the palace. Drawn by four white
          horses, A ROYAL CARRIAGE (an open carriage) pulls up, stops.
          The courtyard quickly fills with liveried footmen, then
          security guards.
                         
          QUEEN ELISABETH and Mandela emerge from the palace. Footmen
          open doors on both sides of the carriage. The Queen and
          Mandela climb in (the Queen on the right hand side).
                         
          When they sit down next to each other, Mandela leans over and
          says something to the Queen that makes her giggle ...
                         
          ... almost. For Queens do not giggle.
                         
          The carriage pulls forward and these two human icons sit up
          straight, as they get set to face the world.

          Mandela disembarks, very slowly. He is exhausted, his feet
          are swollen, his knee hurts. This is a very different man
          than the one we have just seen wooing the world.
                         
          He is met at the bottom of the stairs by Hendrick.
                         
                          HENDRICK
           It's good to be home, sir.
                         
          Mandela just nods. Too tired to talk.
                         
          Hendrick escorts Mandela to the Mercedes, opens the door for
          him.
                         
          Mandela takes a step towards the open door -- and staggers.
                         
          Reflexively, Hendrick reaches out, steadies him.

           I'm fine.

          Mandela reaches into his jacket, pulls a SMALL PACKAGE out,
          hands it to Hendrick.
                         
                          MANDELA
           This is for you.
                         
          Mandela slides into the car. Once the door is closed,
          Hendrick glances at the package. We don't see it. It is too
          dark.
                         
          But we do see that Hendrick is amazed by it.

          filling.

          then shoot open again.
                         
          It takes everything Mandela has to sit up and switch on the
          light.

          -- Linga gets out of one BMW, Hendrick gets out of the other.
          They are alert. It is freezing cold.
                         
          Bundled up against the cold, Mandela emerges through the gate
          and they close in on him. It is clear that he is pushing
          himself, physically.

           I don't think I want to walk today.
                         
          Hendrick realizes that he blundered, somehow. He shoots an
          anxious glance at Linga -- who looks at him as if he'd just
          committed blasphemy.
                         
          Mandela goes through the open gate without a word. The gate
          closes behind him, leaving Linga and Hendrick to watch him
          through iron bars.
                         
          Linga turns on Hendrick.

           We never ask him about his family.

           But he asks about ours all the

                          LINGA
           Think about it, man. He's
           separated from his wife. His
           children ... how often do you see
           them here?
                          (BEAT)
           He's not a saint, okay. He's a
           man, with a man's problems -- and
           he doesn't need us reminding him
           about them.
                         
          Linga heads back to his BMW. Hendrick stands at the gate,
          looking in at the house.

           MR. PIENAAR
           Fat chance. They're lining their
           pockets as fast as they can.
                         
          Nerine is interested in the call that sent Pienaar hurrying
          out of the room. Mr. Pienaar MUTES THE TV.
                         
           MR. PIENAAR
           Must be his girlfriend, hey Nerine.
                         
                          NERINE
           He knows I'd bloody kill him.
                         
          ON EUNICE, as eyes and ears alive, she finishes in the
          kitchen.
                         
          Pienaar comes back, stands in the doorway, a stunned
          expression on his face.
                         
                          NERINE
           What? Who was it?
                         
          Pienaar doesn't answer immediately.
                         
           MR. PIENAAR
           Told you. It was his girlfriend.
                         
           MRS. PIENAAR
           Shush!
                         
                          PIENAAR
           I've been invited to tea.
                         
                          NERINE
           Who with?
                         
                          PIENAAR
           The President.
                         
           MR. PIENAAR
           The President of SA Rugby? Count
           your fingers after he shakes your
           hand.
                         
          Pienaar points at the muted TV.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           The President.

          The Pienaar family all stare at the TV, stunned.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           He wants me over for tea, week
           after next.
                         
          Eunice picks up her handbag, puts on her coat and heads for
          the door, stops when she reaches Pienaar.
                         
                          EUNICE
           Mr. Francois -- you must tell
           Madiba that the bus service is very
           bad, and too expensive. He must

           Good night Eunice, thank you.
                         
          All eyes on Pienaar.
                         
           MR. PIENAAR
           What the hell does he want with
           you?
                         
          Pienaar shakes his head -- he has no idea.

          Nerine drives. Pienaar wears a blue blazer, grey slacks and
          subdued tie -- and is surprisingly nervous.
                         
                          NERINE
           Francois, relax. You've met him
           before.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           I shook his hand on the rugby
           field, that's all.
                         
                          NERINE
           You didn't even vote for him.

           He's still the President.
                          (CONFESSING)
           He's had dinner with the Queen.
           With Presidents and movie stars.
           All I do is play rugby. What if I
           pull something stupid in front of
           him?
                         
          Nerine stops to let Pienaar out. Gives him a kiss,
          straightens his hair.
                         
                          NERINE
           You won't. I'll pick you up right

          A pretty sizeable KNOT OF JOURNALISTS rush towards him.
                         
          Pienaar takes a deep breath. He is a bundle of nerves.

          Hendrick is the bigger man.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Can I ask you a question,

           What's he like?
                         
          They pause at the office door. Hendrick ponders that
          question for a moment, then:

          Hendrick opens the door.

          Hendrick ushers Pienaar into Mandela's offices.

           for inviting me.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Tell me. How's your ankle?
                         
                          PIENAAR
           My ankle?
                         
                          MANDELA
           I was told you'd hurt it. Has it
           healed?
                         
          Pienaar relaxes, visibly. This is small talk he can handle.
          This is Mandela's gift.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           The truth is, sir, you never play
           at a hundred percent, no matter
           what.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Yes ... yes. In sports, and in
           life. Come. Sit. Please.
           (indicating a chair)
           Take this one. Looking into the
           light hurts my eyes.
                         
          They sit in the chairs.
                         
          A KNOCK at the door, and MRS. BRITS the old Afrikaner tea
          lady enters, carrying a laden tea tray.
                         
          Mandela stands again, immediately.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Ah, Mrs. Brits --
                         
          Pienaar stands just a beat slower.
           60.
                         
                         
                         
                          MANDELA
           -- you are a shining light in my
           day.
                         
           MRS. BRITS
           Yes sir.
                         
          Eyes twinkling, Mrs. Brits puts the tea tray down on the
          coffee table in front of them. The finest china, cookies on
          a plate.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Mrs. Brits, this is Francois
           Pienaar. He's the captain of the
           Springboks.
                         
          Mandela clearly expects Pienaar to shake hands with Mrs.
          Brits. Pienaar holds out his hand --
                         
                          PIENAAR
                          (AFRIKAANS GREETING)
           Aangename kennis, Mevrou Brits.
                         
          -- gently shakes hers.
                         
           MRS. BRITS
           Ek ook, Meneer.
                          (TO MANDELA)
           Shall I pour, sir?
                         
                          MANDELA
           No thank you, I think I'd like to.
                         
          Mrs. Brits leaves. Mandela does not sit until the door
          closes behind her. Pienaar only sits after he does.
                         
          Mandela's manners would not be out of place in Victorian
          England.
                         
                          MANDELA
           How do you take your tea, Francois?
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Milk and sugar, please.
                         
          Mandela pours tea for both of them.
                         
          ON PIENAAR, as, just for a moment, he realizes that here he
          is, with the President pouring him a cup of tea.
           61.
                         
                         
                         
                          MANDELA
           The English have given us many
           things, including rugby, but
           afternoon tea is one of the
           greatest.
                         
          Mandela hands Pienaar the tea cup.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Thank you, sir.
                         
          Both men have big hands. Fine china dwarfed and threatened.
                         
          In the exact moment that both their hands hold the same
          saucer, Mandela looks Pienaar in the eye.
                         
                          MANDELA
           You have a very difficult job.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           I do? I sell gas braais.
                         
          Mandela lets go and Pienaar takes the tea.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Captain of the Springboks. A very
           difficult job.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Not compared to yours, sir.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Ah, but then nobody is trying to
           tear my head off while I'm doing
           mine.
                         
          Pienaar grins. True.
                         
                          MANDELA
           It is not so difficult to get
           people to do their best. And I
           imagine that anybody who plays for
           their country does their best,
           almost automatically.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Or they wouldn't be chosen in the
           first place.
                         
                          MANDELA

           better than that?

           Better than they think they can be?
           Now, that is difficult, I find.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Yes sir, it is.
                         
                          MANDELA
           How do we do that? By example? To
           an extent. But there is more to it
           than that ...
           (searching for the right
                          WORD)
           ... inspiration, perhaps.
                         
          Pienaar is engrossed. This is a master lesson on leadership,
          from a master.
                         
                          MANDELA
           How do we inspire ourselves to
           greatness, when nothing less will
           do? How do we inspire everyone
           around us?
                          (BEAT)
           Sometimes, I think, by using the
           work of others.
                         
          Long pause. Pienaar knows to keep quiet.

           On Robben Island, when things were
           very hard, I found inspiration in a

                          PIENAAR

                          MANDELA
           A Victorian poem. Just words. But
           they helped me to stand when all I
           wanted was to lie down --
                          (SUDDENLY DISMISSIVE)
           But you didn't come all this way to
           hear an old man talk about things

                          PIENAAR
           No! They make a lot of sense, sir.

           On the day of a big match, say a

                          PIENAAR
           When I think we're ready, I have
           the bus driver put on a song I've
           chosen; a theme song. One we all
           know. We listen together and ...
           it helps.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Yes! I remember when I was a guest
           at the 1992 Olympic Games in
           Barcelona. The whole stadium
           welcomed me with a song.
                          (BEAT)
           At the time the future -- our
           future -- seemed very bleak. But
           to hear that song, in voices from
           all over our planet ... it made me
           very proud to be South African. It
           helped me to come home and do
           better. It allowed me to expect
           more of myself.
                         
          A beat.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           May I ask what the song was, sir?
                         
                          MANDELA
           Well, it was Nkosi Sikelel'
           iAfrika. A very inspiring song.
                         
          Mandela looks into Pienaar's eyes.

           We need inspiration, Francois.

           own expectations.
                         
          Something passes between them. Whatever it is has a profound

          Pienaar walks away from the President's offices, still
          processing his meeting with Mandela. He seems a little
          stunned and mystified. Something profound just happened --
          but he's not quite sure what.

          When Pienaar steps outside and sees all of Pretoria -- all of
          South Africa -- stretching away below him, he pauses. He
          looks at his country in a new way.
                         
          A BEEP BEEP from Nerine's car interrupts his reverie, as she
          pulls up at the bottom of the stairs.
                         
                         
          INT. NERINE'S CAR - DAY
                         
          Nerine drives Pienaar away. Pienaar turns, looks back at the
          Union Buildings.
                         
                          NERINE

                          NERINE
           What's he like?
                         
                          PIENAAR
           He's ...

           ... he's not like anyone I've ever
           met before.
                         
          An unsatisfying answer. Nerine waits for more. But, she
          isn't going to get it without prying it out of Pienaar.

           Well? What did he want?
                         
          This is the question Pienaar is wrestling with, too. He
          thinks it over for long enough to drive Nerine crazy.
                         
                          NERINE
           Ag, come on Francois. It's like
           talking to a bloody brick wall.
           What did he want?
                         
          Pienaar turns in his seat, looks at her as realization comes
          clear in him ...

          LIVING ROOM. Mandela likes the babies. THEIR PARENTS, shoo
          and shepherd the kids, keeping them on their best behavior --
                         
          -- for the PHOTOGRAPHERS shooting this family gathering.
          Seeing the photographers makes this feel staged.
                         
          Mandela looks past the photographers, sees his daughter
          ZINDZI glancing in from the doorway, and then moving on.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Excuse me.
                         
          Mandela disentangles the babies, stands, leaves.

          In the DINING ROOM, Zindzi looks down at a BIG FRONT PAGE
          PHOTO OF MANDELA AND PIENAAR SHAKING HANDS.
                         
          She is a modern, cosmopolitan young woman.
                         
          When Mandela enters, Zindzi looks up from the newspaper with
          a very Mandela-like grunt.

                          ZINDZI
           It doesn't matter what I think.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Yes, it does.

                          (DEFIANT)
           Okay. I think he looks like one of
           the policemen who forced us out of
           our house when you were in jail. I
           don't like seeing you shake his
           hand. And I'm not the only one.
                         
          Mandela overreacts.
                         
                          MANDELA
           You criticize without
           understanding. You seek only to
           address your own feelings. This is
           selfish thinking. It does not
           serve the nation.
                         
          Zindzi shakes her head, turns, leaves.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Wait. Please. I --
                         
          Mandela wants to apologize, doesn't know how. Instead, he
          pulls AN ENVELOPE out of his pocket, holds it out.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Will you give this to your mother.
                         
                          ZINDZI
           What is it?
                         
                          MANDELA
           A bracelet.
                         
          Zindzi looks into the envelope. In it is the BEADED
          BRACELET, from earlier, from the bathroom.
                         
                          ZINDZI
           Just throw it away.
                         
                          MANDELA
           I don't have the right to. It's

           throw it away.
                         
          Only children know how to twist the dagger so deftly.
          Mandela turns away so that his daughter cannot see his eyes.
                         
          A man so at ease with strangers does not know how to talk to
          his own family.

          Mr. Pienaar enters to get something from the fridge, sees
          what Eunice is doing. Eunice stops cutting.
                         
          Mr. Pienaar looks down at the photo for a long moment. He
          doesn't know how to react to it.

           Ja. Of course.

          be lifted up. She nods, proud.

           We're looking at the remains of the
           Federal Building in Oklahoma City,
           America, which was destroyed today
           in a massive explosion.

          Barbara, Mary, other assistants look on. So do the
          bodyguards. All faces stunned, appalled.
                         
          Mandela approaches slowly from his office, drawn in by the
          horrible, irresistible images. He stands behind his people.

           No one has claimed responsibility

          jersey.
                         
          At one edge we find what passes for a SOCCER FIELD. Just a
          littered rectangular expanse of Highveld winter dirt.

          the edge of the field, stop, get out --

          many of them begging for cash and candy. SIPHO in the thick
          of things.
                         
          One of the Springbok management crew pulls a ROLLED BANNER on
          two spiked poles out of their van.
                         
          Mallet and banner in hand, the management crew head to the
          edge of the field, mobbed by shouting, whistling township
          kids.
                         
          They hammer one pole into the ground, unroll the banner (seen
          from the back so that we can't read the words), get set to
          hammer the second pole into the ground --
                         
          -- except that there is a SMASHED BEER BOTTLE in the way.
          Broken glass everywhere.
                         
          They look at the broken glass, then turn and look across the
          field.
                         
          Broken glass glints in the low sun, all over the field.

          They look out of the windows and see the absolutely hellish
          outskirts of the township. Every possible incarnation of
          poverty, as far as the eye can see.

          collective sigh of recognition and wonder.
                         
          Now, the kids can relate to the Springboks. Even Sipho, who

          Barely controlled chaos. Each Springbok works with one ball
          and a group of kids. There are THREE THEMES to this montage.
                         
          FIRST, a primer on the basic rules of rugby, with
          demonstrations.
                         
                          SPRINGBOK HOOKER
           Who here knows the first rule of
           rugby?
                         
                          TOWNSHIP KID
           Me!
                         
                          SPRINGBOK HOOKER
           What is it?
                         
                          TOWNSHIP KID
           Only hit the other players when the
           ref isn't looking!
                         
          Laughter. A good ice-breaker.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           No. The first rule of rugby is you
           can only pass the ball backwards or
           sideways.
                         
          Pienaar demonstrates. (NOTE: All the rules are
          demonstrated.)
                         
                          VARIOUS SPRINGBOKS
           - If you drop the ball, or pass it
           forwards, you scrum for possession.
           - This is a scrum.
           - You kick forwards.

           79.
                         
           VARIOUS SPRINGBOKS (cont'd)
           If you kick it out of bounds, you
           throw it back in to a lineout.
           - This is a lineout.
           - You score in four ways: a try,
           when you dot the ball down behind
           the try line. That's five points.
           - Another two points when you
           convert the try by kicking the ball
           through the uprights.
           - Three points for a penalty kick.
           - Three points for a drop kick.
           - Have you got all that?
                         
                          KIDS
           No!
                         
                          SPRINGBOK HOOKER
           Agh, bugger it, let's just run and
           pass. Whoever drops the ball does
           pushups!
                         
          SECOND, as the players work with the kids, they get into it.
          Much to their own surprise, they enjoy the energy, they enjoy
          the kids, they enjoy the giving. Even the grumpiest, most
          conservative Springbok.
                         
                          SPRINGBOK LOCK
           Okay. Who wants to scrum against
           me?
                         
          One huge man scrums against a horde of kids. He pushes them
          backwards with a roar -- then lets them push him backwards.
          They love it, the cameras love it.
                         
          THE THIRD THEME shows the emergence of Chester Williams as
          the face of the Springboks. The crowd of kids around him is
          twice as big as any other player's crew. Given Chester's
          basically shy nature, he finds it all a bit overwhelming.
          The TV cameras follow him even more closely than they follow
          Pienaar.
                         
          AT ONE POINT, an errant pass puts a rugby ball right at
          Sipho's feet. He hesitates, then picks it up. He doesn't
          just hold it, he feels it.
          END THE MONTAGE as the luxury bus pulls away, surrounded by a
          horde of cheering kids, many of whom hold new rugby balls
          under their arms.
                         
          One blast on the horn, one answering cheer from the kids and
          the bus slowly accelerates away.

          A cabinet meeting in the rainbow nation, with Mandela at the
          head of the table.
                         
          The MINISTER OF THE ENVIRONMENT is making a presentation
          about a campaign to put an end to littering by plastic bags.
          Behind him is a VERY DRAMATIC SLIDE IMAGE of a rural barbed
          wire fence festooned with wind-blown plastic bags.
                         
           MINISTER OF THE ENVIRONMENT
           -- and in addition to the
           nationwide PR campaign, we propose
           that all retail outlets charge a
           nominal fee for plastic bags --
                         
          Mary enters quietly, slips a piece of paper in front of
          Mandela, who reads it, holds up his hand.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Mr. Minister, please forgive me.
           This sounds excellent, and we will
           return to it, but if you'll indulge
           me for just one minute --
                         
          Mandela nods to Mary, who switches on a big TV on the wall --
          which shows NEWS FOOTAGE OF THE COACHING CLINIC in the
          township.
                         
          When we see the FOOTAGE OF THE LOCK SCRUMMING WITH THE KIDS,
          Mandela laughs, delighted, turns to his cabinet.
                         
                          MANDELA
           You see, that picture is worth any
           number of speeches.

          Pienaar has quite a different reaction to Mandela's.
                         
           MR. PIENAAR

           help them win rugby matches?

          beautiful cities in the world. We see the Cape Peninsula,
          the harbor, the city itself draped around the shoulders of
          Table Mountain like a multi-colored Mediterranean shawl.
                         
          On its descent towards Cape Town airport, a SOUTH AFRICAN
          AIRWAYS JET flies across the view with the smiling face of
          Chester Williams painted on the fuselage.

           next week a tall order, especially

           Around the world -- objectively --

           MINISTER OF SPORT
           Everyone thinks they'll beat us.
           And if they do, we'll have to go
           through England and the All Blacks
           just to get to the Final.

                          MANDELA
           Barbara, I have been studying.

          -- to reveal COLOR PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE SPRINGBOK SQUAD. A
          collector's pull-out.
                         
          Barbara looks at the photos, shakes her head.

           They look like thugs.
                         
          Mandela just smiles at that remark.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Block out the names. See if I can
           recognize them.
                         
          Barbara gives her boss a put-upon look -- this is such a
          waste of time! -- but blocks out the first row of names.
          Mandela points at the first photo.

          The entire Springbok squad has been on a training run through
          Cape Town, on ordinary streets, through ordinary people.
                         
          (This is unthinkable in top-level sports anywhere else. It
          really happened.)
                         
          When they are recognized, drivers toot their horns,
          pedestrians cheer, kids on bicycles ride with them (mostly
          still white).
                         
          As they approach the hotel grounds, Pienaar surges to the
          front, so that he can give them a message as they pass
          through the hotel gate.

          The entire team has assembled, minus Pienaar. A quiet air.
          Serious, relaxed.
                         
          Pienaar enters, holding a sheaf of XEROXED PAGES, begins to
          hand them out.

           it if you want to.
                         
          The players are relieved. Pienaar looks down at the sheet of
          paper for a moment, then looks up at the guys.

          into the closest trash can.

           91.
                         
                         
                         
          Mandela wades in amongst them, leaving Linga and Jason
          behind.
                         
          Picture this: Behind the barbed wire security of a modern,
          South African military base, a tall, regal black man in his
          70's is surrounded by huge, sweating, battered, brutal-
          looking white men --
                         
                          PIENAAR
                          (DOING INTRODUCTIONS)
           Mr. President, this is --
                         
                          MANDELA
           I know who this is.
                          (SHAKING HANDS)
           Good luck, Andre.
           (shaking hands with all of
                          THEM)
           Good luck Brendan, we're behind you
           all. Japie -- etc
                         
          -- every single one of whose names he has committed to
          memory. Statesmanship is often about attention to detail.
                         
          The players are awe-struck.
                         
          (FOR THE RECORD: Andre, Gavin, James, Japie, Christiaan,
          Brendan, Hennie, Joel, Johan, Joost, Marius, James, Chris,
          Pieter, Garry, Mark, Kobus, Hannes, Krynauw, Ruben, Francois,
          Robby, Adriaan, Rudolf.)
                         
          CUT AWAY to Jason and Linga, who are amazed by what they're
          seeing.
                         
                          LINGA
           Did you ever imagine this?
                         
                          JASON
           How could I?
                         
          By the time Mandela has shaken every single player's hand, he
          has won the team over, coach and manager included. They
          glow.
                         
          And then, Mandela frowns, steps back, looks at all of them.
                         
                          MANDELA
           But where is Chester?
                         
          Pienaar doesn't answer immediately, he looks at his coach
          first. Coach nods.
           92.
                         
                         
                         
                          PIENAAR
           He's injured, sir. His hamstring.
           We're trying to keep it quiet.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Is he out for the whole tournament?
                         
                          PIENAAR
           With hamstrings, who knows?
                          (BEAT)
           We'll miss him.
                         
                          MANDELA
           The whole country will miss him.
                         
          A somewhat sour note to leave on. But it's about to be
          rescued.
                         
                          SPRINGBOK PROP
           Mr. President, sir --
                         
                          MANDELA
           Yes, Hennie.
                         
                          SPRINGBOK PROP
           -- this is for you. From us.
                         
          The huge, thick man holds out a GREEN CAP with gold piping
          and a Springbok leaping above the visor.
                         
          Mandela takes the cap as if he has just been given a holy
          relic.
                         
                          MANDELA
           I am honored. Truly honored.
                         
          Mandela runs his finger over the embroidered Springbok
          leaping across the front of the cap.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Good luck gentlemen. Your country
           supports you, completely.
                         
          The team applauds, beaming, glowing.
                         
          Mandela turns to go back to the helicopter.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Francois, walk with me.
                         
          Pienaar walks Mandela back towards the helicopter.
           93.
                         
                         
                         
                          MANDELA
           I have something for you.
                         
          Mandela reaches into his jacket, pulls out an ENVELOPE WITH
          THE PRESIDENT'S LETTERHEAD on it. Gives it to Pienaar.
                         
                          MANDELA
           This helped me, many times.
           Perhaps it will help you, too.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Pienaar holds the envelope, stares upwards at the rising,
          departing helicopter, as do the rest of the team -- until
          Coach blows his whistle.
                         
                          COACH
           Enough fun and games! We've still
           got work to do.

          Jason paces restlessly, going over his mental check list,
          making sure he hasn't missed anything.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. MANDELA'S CAPE TOWN HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Mandela reads, scrawls comments, signs papers from a big "In"
          pile. Mary enters with his glass of milk and his pills.
                         
                          MARY
           It's time for bed.
                         
                          MANDELA
           I think I'll stay up a little
           longer. The country is excited
           tonight.
                         
                          MARY
           You need to sleep. The doctor
           said.
                         
                          MANDELA
           The doctor has no sense of
           occasion.
           94.
                         
                         
                         
          Mandela turns on the TV, begins flipping channels. Rugby,
          rugby, rugby. Mandela is sucked in.
                         
          Mary sighs.

          The coach and the manager. Cats on a hot tin roof.
                         
                          COACH
           There's nothing more we can do.
           The game plan's good. It's just a
           matter of the boys executing it
           tomorrow.
                         
                          MANAGER
           That's Pienaar's job. It's in his
           hands, now.
                         
                         
          INT. PIENAAR'S ROOM - CAPE TOWN HOTEL - NIGHT
                         
          Room dark but for one small desk light. Pienaar stands at
          the window, looking out across Cape Town. He is deep in
          thought.
                         
          Pienaar turns away from the window, goes to the desk, where,
          under one small light, we see "Invictus", the poem Mandela
          wrote out by hand.
                         
          Pienaar begins reading it. There is a soft knock at his
          door. Pienaar goes to it, opens it. It is Nerine,
          accompanied by a cop.
                         
          Pienaar nods at the cop, steps back so that Nerine can enter.
          As soon as the door closes behind her, Nerine says:
                         
                          NERINE
           You know the best thing about you
           being the captain?
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Uh ... the honor?
                         
                          NERINE
           You don't have to share a room.
                         
          Nerine gives Pienaar a scorching kiss. He resists ... then
          responds -- then pulls away.
           95.
                         
                         
                         
                          NERINE
                          (BREATHLESS)
           Francois, come on. It's been
           weeks.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Uh uh. I need to be angry for
           tomorrow.
                         
          Nerine takes a deep breath, nods, turns away -- and sees the
          poem on Mandela's personal letterhead.
                         
                          NERINE
           What's this?
                         
                          PIENAAR
           A poem. From the President.
                         
                          NERINE
           How does a poem help you play
           rugby?
                         
                          PIENAAR

          A massive crowd roars.
                         
          The Wallaby flyhalf runs forward, puts his boot into the
          ball, sends it soaring towards the waiting Springboks.
                         
          The Springbok lock rises high into the air, supported on all
          sides, takes the ball out of the air perfectly --
                         
          -- just as the Wallaby pack closes in and huge men meet with
          an adrenaline-fueled crunch of bodies.
                         
          The World Cup has begun at last.

          But not for Chester Williams. Clad in Springbok blazer and
          tie, he sits behind the coach, the manager and the reserves,
          in the stands -- and almost succeeds in hiding his utter
          disappointment at not being on the field.

          INT. NEWLANDS STADIUM - VIP BOX - DAY
                         
          Mandela looks on, calmly. The Minister of Sport isn't late
          for this match. The President of Rugby is pale with nerves.
                         
          Behind Mandela, stand Linga and Hendrick. The VIP box is a
          safe place, but Jason isn't taking any chances.

          Jason prowls through the stadium, talking constantly on his
          radio. Hunter's adrenaline.

          Back to action on the field.
                         
          The highlights we see here should match the rugby primer we
          saw in the township. This continues the education of those
          who do not know rugby.
                         
          So, for instance, we see a ball knocked forward, and the
          resulting scrum.
                         
          We see a ball kicked out of bounds, and the resulting
          lineout.
                         
          We see scintillating passing, rucking, mauling, tackling,
          strategic kicking at it's very best. Both teams are crisp
          and strong.
                         
          INTERCUT SHOTS OF THE RUGBY MATCH --
                         
          -- with SHOTS OF THE SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS (snipers, lots and
          lots of uniformed cops inside and out, sniffer dogs etc. all
          overseen by Jason) --
                         
          -- with SHOTS OF THE CROWD, which, unlike the earlier test
          against the Lions, is completely and passionately united
          behind the Springboks (all commentators talk about the
          extraordinary passion of the crowd, that day) --
                         
          -- always returning to the VIP BOX, where something
          interesting is taking place right behind Mandela: Linga
          Moonsamy, the rugby scorner, the soccer lover, loses his
          scowling reserve and gets sucked into the game.
           97.
                         
                         
                         
          When a ball soars between the uprights and everyone in the
          box groans, Linga leans towards Hendrick and asks:
                         
                          LINGA
           What happened?
                         
                          HENDRICK
           They scored.
                         
          When another ball soars between the uprights and the crowd
          roars, Linga asks again:
                         
                          LINGA
           What happened?
                         
                          HENDRICK
           We scored.
                         
          A third ball through the uprights. Before Linga can ask:
                         
                          HENDRICK
           They scored again.
                         
          A fourth ball, to the joy of the others in the box.
                         
                          LINGA
           We scored?
                         
                          HENDRICK
           Ja. We're tied.
                         
          A fifth ball through the uprights, and the crowd goes wild.
                         
                          HENDRICK
           We're up by three.
                         
          ACTION ON THE FIELD, as a Wallaby drive combining backs and
          forwards moves relentlessly towards the Springbok try line.
          Six times the drive is stopped by Springbok tackling, but the
          Wallabies keep possession and, on the seventh wave of the
          assault score a beautiful open try, which is converted.
                         
          A ripple of concern goes through the crowd --
                         
          -- and the VIP box.
                         
                          LINGA
           They're ahead?
                         
                          HENDRICK

          But not on the field, as Pienaar starts a drive with a tackle
          we feel ourselves, resulting in a change of possession --
                         
          -- and a stunning, open field try scored in the corner by the
          Springbok wing, who raises his fist in the air, after juking
          the last Wallaby to try and tackle him.
                         
          The crowd roars.
                         
          In the VIP box, Mandela is on his feet, shaking hands with
          everyone he can reach, including Linga and Hendrick, and the
          waiter.
                         
          The difficult, angled conversion is missed.

          Everyone dares to dream. The classic South African penchant
          for pessimism begins to abate.
                         
          Two things to note: The crowd roar grows and grows and grows
          and is echoed in the VIP box. Even Jason turns to look at
          the action on the field -- but only for a second. Also, this
          match serves as the coming-out party for the SPRINGBOK FLY
          HALF, who scores 22 of South Africa's 27 points this day.
                         
          SUDDENLY, A REFEREE'S WHISTLE CREATES PANDEMONIUM on the
          field, in the stands, and in the VIP box.

          Mandela shoots to his feet, pushes his chair away and begins
          the famous "Mandela shuffle" -- a very cool African boogie
          that is one of his signature moves. ON THE MANDELA SHUFFLE --

          -- the same shuffle hours later, at a VIP party. Mandela has
          changed clothes, wears one of his Indonesian-inspired "Madiba
          shirts" and dances energetically with the absolutely stunning
          TROPHY WIFE of one of the VIP's.
                         
                          TROPHY WIFE
           You must be very pleased!

           What man would not be pleased to be

                          TROPHY WIFE
           Oh, Mr. President, you're
           exaggerating.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Indeed not. My father was a Xhosa
           chief, and therefore a polygamist.
           As you know, I am not.
                          (BEAT)
           But when I look at you ... I envy
           my father.
                         
          The man is a major flirt, and really enjoying himself. But,
          once again, he is dancing with a stranger --
                         
          -- and, when we get close to his eyes, we realize that
          Mandela is pushing himself way past empty.

          Big party, spilling onto the streets. Most of the partiers
          are white. Black South Africans look on, or serve drinks.
                         
          We follow the crowd into a big sports bar --
                         
                         
          INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT
                         
          -- where the Springboks are pounding beers and blowing off
          the steam of months of training grind, plus a huge win.
                         
          Even though most of the players are with their wives or
          girlfriends, pretty, single women crowd them, two and three
          deep, men pay for round after round of beers.
                         
          Pienaar and Nerine are part of the action. Then Pienaar gets
          a TEXT MESSAGE which makes him shake his head, give Nerine a
          chagrined look.
                         
          He grabs the Springbok closest to him, puts his mouth near
          the player's ear and screams again the hubbub:
                         
                          PIENAAR
           COACH'S RUN, NINE A.M. SHARP. PASS
           IT ON.
                         
          The Springbok shakes his head -- bloody coach -- grabs the
          player next to him, repeats it.
                         
          Pienaar watches the message travelling through his team --
          and grins.
                         
          Then, something catches his eye on one of the big overhead
          TV's.
                         
          ON THE TV: news footage of the Mandela victory boogie. The
          boogie is followed by a quick "How far we have come" type of
          montage. One of the images shows an island ringed by rough
          surf.
                         
          Pienaar gets an idea.

          When he gets to an intersection, he sneaks a peek down at the
          palm of his left hand.
                         
          CLOSE-UP ON PIENAAR'S HAND, where he has drawn a crude street
          map.
                         
          Pienaar takes a left at the intersection.

                          COACH

          board, pulling on tracksuits against the cold sea air.
                         
          It is early winter. The seas are fairly rough.
                         
          So are the stomachs of the `boks who partied hard last night.

          glory.
                         
          Ahead of the ferry, one of the most notorious island prisons
          in modern history --
                         
          -- ROBBEN ISLAND.
                         
                         
          EXT. ROBBEN ISLAND - DAY
                         
          Robben Island lies only eight miles from the mainland. It is
          two miles long, with sandy beaches full of penguins and
          seals. It would be pretty --
                         
          -- but for its MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON. Concrete, barbed
          wire, guard towers.
                         
          (In 1995, the political prisoner wing was shut, but the
          island still housed criminal prisoners, so the island still
          had the feel of real incarceration. Today, it is a tourist
          destination.)

          As they approach the island, a sense of dark history settles
          over the Springboks and their partners.
                         
          One of the Springboks turns to a DECKHAND, getting ready to
          moor at the jetty.
                         
                          SPRINGBOK LOCK

          Sobering.

          The Springboks and their partners step onto dry land with
          some relief, look around at the prison, humbled.

           That would make it worse.
                         
          They head towards the prison entrance, slowly becoming a
          tighter and tighter bunch. The ghosts of Mandela, and all
          the others who spent much of their lives here, are very
          strong.

          around. This place affects them, deeply.

          INT. ROBBEN ISLAND PRISON - SECTION B - DAY
                         
          Section B is the bleak political wing. Tiny cells line each
          side of a damp concrete hallway.
                         
          A PRISON GUARD shows the Springboks into the hallway, and
          they dwarf it, as they stand there, shocked. Shocked at what
          was done in their names. This group is as quiet as we have
          ever seen them.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Can we see the President's cell?
                         
                          PRISON GUARD
           Yes, of course.
           (leading them down past
                          THE CELLS)
           We've done it up just the way it
           was.
                         
          They reach a cell with a piece of white cardboard on the
          door, showing the number 466/64 -- MANDELA'S PRISON NUMBER.
                         
                          PRISON GUARD
           (pointing at the number)
           That means he was the 466th
           prisoner admitted in 1964.
                         
          The Prison Guard unlocks the door, pulls it open, then
          unlocks the metal grill that is the inside door.

          INT. MANDELA'S CELL - DAY
                         
          Pienaar peers into the cell. It is tiny. There is no bed,
          just a sisal mat on the concrete floor, with a couple of
          blankets. A chamber pot, a short bench, a tin cup and plate
          are the only other objects in the room.
                         
          A couple of small lockers are screwed high to the wall. The
          barred window is opaque. It lets in light but does not allow
          the prisoner a view.
                         
          When Pienaar enters, we see how small the cell really is. He
          can reach out and touch the opposite walls at the same time.
                         
          This is a bleak, horrible, dehumanizing place. Pienaar is
          stunned by it. He turns, slowly, looking at Mandela's world
          for over twenty years.

          The other Springboks and their partners wait to look into the
          cell themselves, a little puzzled by how much time Pienaar's
          taking.
                         
                         
          INT. MANDELA'S CELL - DAY
                         
          Pienaar almost looks as if he is in a trance. He hears
          Mandela's voice in the cell with him.
                         
           MANDELA (V.O.)
                          (RECITING "INVICTUS")
           Out of the night that covers me,
           Black as the pit from pole to pole,
           I thank whatever gods may be
           For my unconquerable soul.
                         
          Now, Pienaar sees Mandela in prison clothes, in the cell.
          (The image is unclear, ghostly.)
                         
           MANDELA (V.O.)
           In the fell clutch of circumstance
           I have not winced nor cried aloud.
           Under the bludgeonings of chance
           My head is bloody, but unbow'd.
                         
          Pienaar sees Mandela sitting on the dirt in the prison yard,
          breaking up rock with a hammer, along with rows of other
          political prisoners.

           Looms but the Horror of the shade,

           Finds and shall find me unafraid.
                         
          Pienaar sees Mandela leading his fellow prisoners to the lime
          quarry, to mine lime under the eye of a guard who looks like
          Pienaar.
                         
           MANDELA (V.O.)
           It matters not how strait the gate,

           It's simple exhaustion, but it'll
           lead to worse if it's not treated.
           He needs complete rest. And I
           don't mean just shifting the
           affairs of state to his bedroom.

          closed.
                         
          Barbara enters. The sight of Mandela lying like this is
          chilling. It is too close to what he would look like lying
          in a casket.
                         
          Barbara makes sure he is breathing. He is. She unplugs his
          phone, takes it. Unplugs his TV. Sweeps the room for
          papers, articles, legal briefs. For the first time, she
          takes an arm load of stuff away from him. She gives Mandela
          one last, long look, closes the door behind her.
                         
          We stay behind and look at Mandela, and ponder South Africa's

          opposite numbers from Taiwan. A high-level affair that
          cannot be interrupted.
                         
          Nonetheless, Mandela takes a discreet look at his watch, and
          we realize that his mind is back home, with the Springboks.

          A quagmire, despite the efforts of the Zulu ladies. Muddy
          green and gold against the muddy blue, white and red of
          France. End of a close game. Both teams are tired, muddy
          and desperate.
                         
          The French assault the Springbok try line, wave after wave.
          The Springboks defend valiantly, but slowly go backwards.
                         
          Finally, the French score a try -- or do they?
                         
          CLOSE-UP ON THE RUGBY BALL, under a mountain of muddy men, on

          ON A BIG SCREEN TV in a private banquet room, the Springbok
          team watches the England/All Black semi-final, which the All
          Blacks dominate from beginning to end --
                         
          -- thanks to the exploits of JONAH LOMU, their unnaturally
          huge, fast left wing, of Tongan parentage (and unanimous
          choice for the best player in the entire World Cup).

          Jonah Lomu scores in the first two minutes of the match, the
          first of four tries. He runs through, over, and around
          hapless defenders. His speed and balance are almost
          unprecedented in a man his size.
                         
          The Springboks go quiet as they watch this beating by the All
          Blacks.

           beat Japan 145 to 17.

           145 points, in one match?
                         
          Linga listens openly.
                         
           MINISTER OF SPORT
           It's a new international record.
           (back to the briefing)
           They beat Scotland 48 to 30 in the
           quarter finals. You saw the match
           with England.
                         
                          MANDELA
           45 to 29. And it was not that
           close.
                          (BEAT)
           They seem unstoppable.
                         
           MINISTER OF SPORT
           If opposing teams play them
           straight up, Jonah Lomu runs wild.
           If they focus on Lomu, that leaves
           others free.

           But, how do we win?

          As in Cape Town, the Springboks jog through the streets. As
          in Cape Town, cars toot their horns, people cheer.
                         
          But the crowd running with them is twice as large as it was
          in Cape Town -- and twice as black.
                         
          This crowd shows that the Springboks really do have the
          support of the whole country now.
                         
          As the `boks rumble past, newspaper vendors, gardeners,
          pharmacy delivery men on small motorbikes abandon their tasks
          and run alongside the team.

           the team became so popular. So
           it's not exactly going to be the

          Park stadium is chaotic with people, cars, face painters,
          flag sellers, fruit vendors. Cops everywhere, and everywhere
          outnumbered.

          Jason was right about the demographics of the crowd: white,
          khaki-clad, quite a few old South African flags among the sea

          Jason finds the VIP box, looks out at the 747 --
                         
          -- and realizes that the jet is heading straight at that side
          of the stadium.

          ... leaving only the background roar of the revved up crowd.
                         
          The boys jog in place, dying for the release of rugby.
          Pienaar appears to be praying, silently.

          The REFEREE walks off the field, into the tunnel, stands
          there for a moment, then raises his whistle to his mouth and
          blows a LONG, ECHOING BLAST --

          -- which is the signal to come to the field.
                         
          The cop opens the door, throws down a full parade ground
          salute as Pienaar leads his men out of the dressing room.
                         
                          PIENAAR

          WITH THE `BOKS, we head down the hallway, down some stairs to
          the tunnel onto the field --
                         
          -- where the referee holds his hand up like a traffic cop,
          keeping the boys in a line in the tunnel.
                         
          As they wait, they hear the CRUNCHING APPROACH OF BIG MEN IN
          CLEATS.
                         
          Down the opposite stairway come THE ALL BLACKS. This is the
          first time we have seen them in the flesh.
                         
          Huge men, black on black uniforms, arrogant. Been here
          before, done this before. The best in the world, expecting
          nothing but the best from the day.
                         
          They ignore the Springboks, dismiss them, line up next to
          them in the tunnel.

          The SOUND OF THIRTY MEN JOGGING IN PLACE in their cleats, on
          the concrete, sounds like a drum roll before a medieval
          battle.
                         
          The Springbok wing sneaks a peek at JONAH LOMU.
                         
          The biggest, fastest wing ever. Even bigger looking in this
          confined space. Bigger than the Springbok wing, bigger than
          any of the Springbok backs, bigger than most of the Springbok
          forwards.
                         
          The referee nods to both captains, turns, and leads them onto
          the field --

          -- where the already-whipped up crowd goes crazy, as both
          teams sprint onto the field and go through their brief warm-
          up ritual.
                         
          WE FOCUS ON THE CROWD, focus on how white and old South
          Africa most of them are.
                         
          The referee blows his whistle again, and both teams assemble
          in a line, facing each other. Glaring like boxers across
          immaculate green grass.

          of SA Rugby.

          rugby jersey.
                         
          On his head is THE SPRINGBOK CAP given to him by the team in
                         CAPE TOWN
                         
          The crowd catches its breath. This is unprecedented,
          shocking ... and brilliant.
                         
          The Springboks digest this extraordinary display of support.

          Pienaar nods, eyes glinting. Mandela is giving them an edge.
                         
          As he walks towards the waiting teams, Mandela lifts the
          Springbok cap high, waves it, and fires his famous,

          ON THE FIELD, Mandela shakes hands with the All Blacks, who,
          as predicted, don't like his partisan clothing. Mandela
          looks up at Jonah Lomu.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Hello, Jonah.
                         
          Lomu looks down at Mandela, eyes glowing with aggression --
                         
          -- and suddenly, he bares his tattooed Tongan tongue in a
          FIERCE WAR CRY.
                         
          As do the rest of the All Blacks.
                         
          WE HAVE SEGUED TO THE FAMOUS HAKA, a Maori war dance that
          tells an opponent they're going have their daughters stolen,
          their wives ravaged and their brains eaten right out of their
          skulls with a sharpened tea spoon.
                         
          It is abundantly clear why, as the Minister of Sports told
          Mandela, half of the All Blacks matches are won before the
          whistle blows.
                         
          This is very intimidating.
                         
          Especially because, this day, the All Blacks push the haka
          closer and closer to the Springboks --
                         
          -- who do not back down. In fact, they close ranks and
          advance.
                         
          Major, major international smackdown. This is not fake. The
          emotions, the aggression are real.
                         
          ON MANDELA, whose diplomatic mask slips a little showing a
          warrior's glitter in his eyes. He wants to respond,
          primally. His fists clench at his side.
                         
          The HAKA ENDS with a fearsome, guttural Maori yell.
                         
          ON THE SPRINGBOKS, massed together, faces red with emotion,
          pulses racing.
                         
          Mandela takes a deep breath in.
                         
          Then the boys answer.
                         
          With, of course, a terrorist anthem of their own: NKOSI
          SIKELEL' IAFRIKA.

                          PIENAAR
                          NKOSI --
                         
                          ALL SPRINGBOKS
           -- SIKELEL' IAFRIKA etc ...
                         
          With decent pronunciation, with full fervor and heart, THE
          BOYS ROAR THE ANTHEM back at the All Blacks.
                         
          The crowd joins them. "Nkosi" roars through the stadium,
          through the nation.
                         
          ON MANDELA: his heart swells, as he sings with his people.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          ON JASON, who stands surrounded by his former enemies singing
          the song that kept him -- kept all of them -- going through
          the apartheid years.
                         
          In this stadium, at this moment, all hostility, all fear, are
          a thing of the past.
                         
          The tension finally goes out of Jason's shoulders.
                         
          ON JASON'S FACE, close to tears, as NKOSI slowly fades.
                         
          As Mandela said -- a very inspirational song.

          drum?

          kick off.
                         
          As the fly half back-pedals slowly, and pauses in readiness,
          waiting for the whistle --
                         
                          CUT AWAY:
                         
          TO RAINBOW NATION FACES, poised all over South Africa,
          WATCHING ON TV and IN THE STANDS. Heart/drumbeat over.
                         
          The last face is Sipho's.

          A RADIO PLAYS NEARBY, tuned to the game. The radio is in a
          cop car, manned by TWO BEEFY WHITE COPS. As the crowd noise
          rises, Sipho edges closer to the cops. They eye him out.

          Mandela front and center. Minister of Sport to his right,
          Prime Minister of New Zealand to his left, President of SA
          Rugby next to him.
                         
          Both using all their diplomatic skills to stay cool.
                         
                          MANDELA
           (to NZ P.M.)
           Perhaps we should make a small
           wager?
                         
           NEW ZEALAND P.M.

           I was thinking more along the lines
           of a case of wine.
                         
          Behind Mandela, Linga and Hendrick suppress grins. They are
          outwardly professional -- but bursting with excitement.

          The referee blows his whistle.
                         
          The All Black fly half boots the ball towards the Springboks,
          charges after it, along with the rest of the All Blacks.
                         
          Game on.
                         
          We have only seen snippets of rugby, so far. And mostly from
          a somewhat polite distance -- the usual distance of TV
          coverage. Say, at closest, the referee's point of view.
                         
          Not now. Not for the climax. We experience this beautiful
          piece of mayhem up close and personal.
                         
          We're inside the heaving scrums. We are the ball. We see
          the way cleats leave a pattern of round white dimples on
          abused skin, which quickly turn to purple as they fill with
          subcutaneous blood.
           136.
                         
                         
                         
          We feel a tackle in our own spine; we see teeth sink into
          flesh in the intimacy of a loose scrum; we feel a hard fist
          smacking us again and again in the hot privacy of a rolling
          maul.
                         
          For this is not a pretty match, not for one moment -- just as
          the Springbok coach wanted.
                         
          This match is all about a less talented team stifling the
          best team in the world by sheer determination and fitness.
                         
          This is about the Springboks applying continuous, unrelenting
          pressure, and forcing the vaunted All Black attack into
          making mistakes. Lots of them.
                         
          Dropped balls, errant passes, knock-ons. No fluency of
          movement, no electric building of momentum.
                         
          Because of one thing: tackling.
                         
          Tackling and tackling and tackling again.
                         
          The first time Lomu touches the ball, the stadium, the nation
          holds its breath --
                         
          -- until the Springbok wing scythes into him at thigh height,
          wraps him up and brings him down.
                         
          The second time Lomu gets the ball he is brought down from
          behind by Pienaar, with a picture perfect tackle.
                         
          We can cut away to the faces of the spectators when we want;
          from Mandela to Nerine to Sipho and on and on, all over the
          country. But, in truth, our attention belongs on the field.
                         
          ON PIENAAR, continually exhorting his men, leading by
          example, wreaking havoc in the All Black backfield.
                         
          ON LOMU, who always seems just one broken tackle away from
          running one in -- except that there are no broken tackles.
                         
          ON THIRTY BIG, STRONG, BATTLE-SCARRED MEN, who have devoted
          their entire lives to this moment. They are not playing for
          money. They are playing for pride, for their countries.
                         
          Outdated notions. We miss them.
                         
          No tries are scored in the Final. The two fly halves match
          each other, penalty goal for penalty goal.
                         
          With each made kick, the goal posts shrink for the next. The
          penalty goals are unchallenged. It is up to the kicker to
          make them or fail. That is pressure.
           137.
                         
                         
                         
          The score is 6 - 6 when, just before half time, the Springbok
          fly half takes a long, perfect pass from the scrum half, and
          with the All Black defenders looming, kicks a drop goal
          through the uprights.
                         
          The Springboks lead 9 - 6. A tight match.
                         
          So tight, in fact, that there is only one score in the second
          half -- an All Black drop goal that levels the score at 9 -
          9.
                         
          Until right before the end of the match, when the All Blacks
          camp in the Springbok half.
                         
          The scrum half sends a long, spiralling pass to the fly half,
          who is in perfect position to go for a drop goal.
                         
          The kick soars into the air, high and straight.
                         
          43 million South Africans hold their breath.
                         
          All around the world, fans lean forward on their chairs.
          This will be the decisive blow.
                         
          But the kick just goes wide.
          Relief.
                         
          The referee blows his whistle to signal the end of
          regulation. Both teams are spent.

          Pienaar turns to his men.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Who's the fittest team on this
           field?
                         
          The answer lies in their eyes: they are.
                         
          An All Black penalty goal makes it 12 - 9 almost immediately.
                         
          A Springbok penalty goal answers. 12 - 12.
                         
          Seven minutes from the end of extra time, the Springboks earn
          a scrum deep in All Blacks territory.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Keep it here. Run it forward.
                         
          The scrum goes down, wheels a little.
                         
           SPRINGBOK FLY HALF
           Francois!
          Pienaar turns his head. The fly half taps his own chest:
          give me the ball.
                         
          Pienaar hesitates, then nods to the scrum half: give him the
          ball.
                         
          The ball goes into the scrum.
                         
          The ball works its way back through the feet of the eight
          Springbok forwards.
                         
          The scrum half gathers it, spins it out to the fly half --
                         
          -- who takes one step to his left and KICKS A DROP GOAL high
          into the air.
                         
          Ball soaring past a backdrop of open mouths. Higher than the
          uprights ...
                         
          ... but through them nonetheless.

           Seven minutes.

          He glances over at the referee, makes another tackle --

          Jason is hugged by an ecstatic boer (Jason is not a hugger).

          Mrs. Pienaar and Nerine are in tears. Mr. Pienaar hugs a
          shocked Eunice.
                         
                         
          INT. VIP BOXES - ELLIS PARK - DAY
                         
          Pandemonium in the VIP box. Mandela shakes hands with
          everyone he can find. It is way too loud to say anything.
                         
          Hendrick and Linga almost hug. Almost. They shake hands
          with total joy and engagement, whack each other on the
          shoulder.

          Sipho toi-tois next to the cop car (a township war dance,
          very political). The two cops toi-toi with him.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          AROUND THE NATION, an EPIDEMIC OF HUGGING begins. This
          spills out onto the streets later, but for now, let's
          restrict this to the people who've been watching the match
          together.

          The Springboks say a prayer on the field. Pienaar kneels in
          the middle, leading the prayer.
                         
          Behind them, a WORK CREW ASSEMBLES A PORTABLE PODIUM.
                         
          At "Amen", Pienaar's men lift him to his feet, then onto
          their shoulders.
           141.
                         
                         
                         
          The crowd roars again and again as PIENAAR TAKES A VICTORY
          LAP on the shoulders of the men he has led through thick and
          thin.
                         
          Tears stream down his face, through his unstoppable grin.
                         
          As they near the podium, the team is intercepted by a news
          crew and --
                         
          -- none other then BOLAND BOTHA.
                         
                          BOLAND BOTHA
           Francois ... a few words ...
                         
          The interview booms through the PA system. Pienaar just nods
          -- he isn't about to spoil the moment by reacting to this
          buffoon.
                         
                          BOLAND BOTHA
           ... great game, but I don't think
           you could've done it without the
           amazing support of these 63,000
           South Africans --
                         
          Francois grabs the mike from Boland.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           (into mike, words booming)
           We didn't have the support of
           63,000 South Africans today. We
           had the support of 42 million South
           Africans.
                         
          The crowd roars.
                         
          The Springbok manager grabs Pienaar's shoulder, points.
                         
                          SPRINGBOK MANAGER
           They're waiting for you over there.
                         
          Pienaar turns, looks.
                         
          Mandela waits at the podium, eyes alight with joy.
                         
          In front of him is the WILLIAM WEBB ELLIS TROPHY, a big gold
          confection.
                         
          Their eyes meet.
                         
          Their eyes stay locked as Pienaar fights his way through the
          press, the officials, his own team, to the podium.
           142.
                         
                         
                         
          Mandela holds out his hand. Pienaar takes it. Big hands,
          one black, one white, one with bruises visible, one with a
          lifetime of bruises implied.
                         
          Both wearing the NUMBER 6 SPRINGBOK JERSEY.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Francois, I want to thank you most
           sincerely for what you have done to
           our country.
                         
          Pienaar shakes his head.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Mr. President, I want to thank you
           for what you have done.
                         
          Eyes lock again, for just a moment, blue eyes, brown eyes --
          African eyes, both.
                         
          And then PIENAAR RAISES THE TROPHY HIGH. A very traditional
          sports hero's moment, richly deserved.
                         
          Real gold, against the green of the battered field.
                         
          But that is not the real prize.
                         
          The prize is what happens next, all over the nation.

          celebrate.
                         
          Utter joy, everywhere, as black and white, servants and
          employers, strangers, enemies, foreigners are swept up in
          love and happiness.
                         
          People who have been suspicious of each other, hated each
          other, feared each other all their lives ... they hug each
          other on this day.

          A car horn beeps politely.
                         
          BMW, Mercedes, BMW come slowly down the street.

          Linga in front. Mandela is alone in the back seat. He looks
          out at his people as they cheer him through.
                         
          He also looks exhausted. Spent. None of that shining life
          force that makes him so big.

          -- which is just as crowded as the first, with happy South
          Africans.
                         
          It is as if every single person in the Rainbow Nation wants
          to celebrate together.

          streets.

          Jason nods, puts down his radio, settles back with a deep
          sigh. So do the rest of the boys in the car. This day is
          almost over.

          Hendrick looks out at the rolling street party -- and shakes

          President Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela undoes the top button of
          his rugby jersey, settles back with a deep sigh --
                         
          -- and drives home through a nation that has begun the
          process of forgiving itself. His nation.
                         
          GO IN ON MANDELA'S FACE as it settles into the now-familiar
          sphinx-like mask.
                         
          Except for his eyes.
                         
          Mandela's eyes glow with deep joy and satisfaction as he
          moves slowly through a moment in history that he has worked
          for, all his life.
                         
          ON MANDELA'S EYES ...

INT. SHOP. NR CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAWN.

The HUM of a large refrigerator just audible over the
sound of Indian music -
MARGARET, briefly glimpsed pondering cartons of milk.
The electronic PEEP of the cash til.
A man on a mobile phone pushes past MARGARET, who takes
her place second in the queue.
The female shopkeeper piles newspapers on the counter in
front of MARGARET. Distracted by images of the bombed
hotel on the TV, she hesitates for beat.

                        MAN BEHIND THE COUNTER
          One forty-nine please.

                        MARGARET
          How much is the milk?

                        MAN BEHIND THE COUNTER
          Forty-nine pence.
               (taking the change)
          Thank you.
MARGARET turns to leave, jostled by a tall young man
wired into an ipod.

EXT. STREET. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAWN.

MARGARET heads down the busy street, shopping bag in
hand.


INT. KITCHEN. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.
MARGARET sits at breakfast with her husband DENIS,
sipping tea. DENIS butters his toast. MARGARET shakes her
head.

                        MARGARET
          Too much. Much too much butter.

                        DENIS
          I like butter.
                        MARGARET
          Milk's gone up.

                                                                         2

            MARGARET reaches for a jug, pouring milk into it, sliding
            it down on a table.
                                     MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      49p a pint.
                                    DENIS
                      Good grief! We'll have to
                      economise. I suppose we could
                      always sell the car.
                           (chuckles)
                      Or take in paying guests!
            He scoops up the newspaper and glances towards the door -
                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
                      Watch out. She's on the prowl.
            MARGARET looks beyond DENIS to a a sense of growing
            commotion. A concerned POLICE GUARD coming up the stairs
            meeting JUNE [early 60's] MARGARET's carer, along a
            distant corridor, steady on the approach.
                                    MARGARET
                           (to DENIS)
                      Eat your egg.
            JUNE smiles with visible relief on seeing MARGARET, now
            sitting tapping open her egg.
                                    JUNE
                      Goodness! There you are.
            JUNE's look of quiet concern.
                                     MARGARET
                      Yes.
            MARGARET eats her egg.
                                     MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      Here we are.
            But for JUNE, she is entirely alone.


            INT. CORRIDOR CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DAY.

            WHISPERING-

                                    JUNE
                      I don't understand how it
                      happened, how could she possibly
                      have got out? It's very very
                      important -

            MARGARET looks out of the kitchen. Her POV down the
            corridor of JUNE and the POLICEMAN and a CLEANER.

                                                                         3

                                    JUNE (CONT'D)
                      Please just make it really clear.
                      Who's on after you?

                                       POLICE GUARD
                      Dixon.

            MARGARET slips away.


            INT.HALL. CHESTER SQUARE. DAY.

            MARGARET hurries through the hall.


            INT. BEDROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.DAY.

            A wide cupboard-

            MARGARET's eyes move back along the rail in front of her,
            her fingers touch hanger after hanger of brown tweed and
            grey twill.

            JUNE goes over to the curtains, pulling them back,
            letting in the sunlight-

                                    JUNE
                      Beautiful day. Oh, you've made a
                      start. Carol's coming soon, I'll
                      get some bags. Anything you want
                      to go to Mark, I'll bring up a
                      suitcase for it.

            The smell of smoke lingering. Suddenly DENIS' hand
            reaches across, wavering between jackets of brown tweed
            and grey twill-

            He reaches for a suit.

                                    MARGARET
                      No no no no. The grey.

                                       DENIS (O.S)
                      You sure?

            The swipe of a clothes brush, briefly seen, drawn across
            one sleeve-

                                       MARGARET
                      Yes.

            Distant footsteps-

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      ...Definitely the grey.

            JUNE returns, oblivious-

                                                                         4

                                    DENIS (O.S)
                      Righty ho. Boss knows best.

            JUNE spies the newspaper, sees the photos of twisted
            carnage on the front page.

                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
                      Don't let her take my paper away.

            JUNE reaches one hand out to scoop it up in passing-

                                    MARGARET
                      Oh, I haven't had a chance to look
                      at that yet, dear.

                                    JUNE
                      Sorry.

            JUNE hesitates, leaves the newspaper resting on the bed
            as she heads off with the suit on a hanger.

                                    DENIS
                      Atta-girl.

            DENIS smiles as he stands in the bathroom doorway,
            soaping his face with shaving cream-

            He hums to himself as he resumes shaving until-

                                    DENIS (O.S) (CONT'D)
                      Damn.

            MARGARET looks up, DENIS has nicked his chin-

                                    MARGARET
                      Blot it...Blot it..

            She turns, sees JUNE, through the ajar door, standing in
            the corridor, looking back at her

                                    JUNE
                      Sorry ?


            INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.

            A comfortable drawing room, filled with the photographs
            and memorabilia of a former political life.

            MARGARET stands by the window, half a dozen of DENIS'
            ties in her hand. Pulling back the net curtain, MARGARET
            peers out-

            Two POLICEMAN stand down below next to a Police BMW car.
            They are lost in conversation, pointing to the door,
            clearly concerned.

                                                                         5

            One POLICE MAN nods to the other, a sense of the changing
            of the guard as he drives off in the BMW.

            SUDDENLY from behind-

                                    DENIS
                      Now look what you've done. Are
                      they to keep the loonies out or
                      you in?

            MARGARET eyes DENIS, looking at her with wry smile -

                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
                      I'll be off then.

                                    MARGARET
                      Wear your scarf. There's a chill
                      out there.

            Suddenly looming over her and grinning down as if at the
            top of a tunnel SUSIE, MARGARET's personal secretary
            carrying a cardboard box.

                                    SUSIE
                      Good morning Lady Thatcher. Are
                      you alright ?
                           (concerned)
                      How are you feeling ?

                                    MARGARET
                      I'm fine, thank you Susie.

                                    SUSIE
                      I've just been reading about the
                      bombings.

                                    MARGARET
                      Yes. Frightful.

            SUSIE's mobile goes off.    She fumbles in her bag to
            switch it off.

                                       SUSIE
                      Sorry.

                                    SUSIE (CONT'D)
                      These are the books for you to
                      sign. I brought as many as I could
                      find. Shall we go through your
                      appointments?

            MARGARET looks at her still nonplussed.

                                    SUSIE (CONT'D)
                      We said we'd go through them
                      today.

                                                                         6

            MARGARET nods-

                                     MARGARET
                       Yes, of course, dear. Today.

                                     SUSIE
                       The invitation has come from
                       Downing Street for the unveiling
                       of your portrait. I'll put it on
                       the mantelpiece, and there's an
                       invitation from Lord Armstrong for
                       lunch on the first Friday of next
                       month.

            The murmur of SUSIE's voice, a kind of white noise-

                                     SUSIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                       I said no because you've got a
                       concert that afternoon but if
                       you'd like to..?

            SILENCE-

                                     SUSIE(O.S) (CONT'D)
                       ....It looks like a very
                       interesting programme.

            MARGARET's listens, oddly distracted-

                                     MARGARET
                       What are they playing?

            SUSIE looks at her momentarily at a loss then scrabbles
            back through the diary-

                                     SUSIE
                       I think they said Rogers and
                       Hammerstein.

            `SHALL WE DANCE' FROM `THE KING & I" SUDDENLY BREAKING
            THROUGH AS IF FROM ANOTHER TIME CARRYING INTO....


            INT. SADLER'S WELLS. LONDON. 1950. NIGHT.

            An orchestra in full flight-

            A programme for THE KING & I on a woman's lap. A man's
            hand reaches in and her hands slips into his.


            INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.

            Whilst SUSIE shuffles through the arrangements at the
            desk in the background, MARGARET stands at the window.

                                                                         7

                                    MARGARET
                      Silly man.

            MARGARET's gaze, seeing DENIS just visible in the street
            below. He looks up, smiles,

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      He hasn't got his scarf on.

            MARGARET throws DENIS a half wave. In return, he twirls
            his umbrella and does a couple of steps of a Chaplin walk
            for her benefit before passing the Postman who is
            shuffling through his letters as he approaches the front
            step, below.

            SUSIE looks on with quiet concern.


            INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.

            MARGARET' is at her desk signing a stack of her memoirs,
            The Downing Street Years.

            MARGARET opens one, reaching for a pen. The curve of inky
            handwriting as she begins to sign them, Margaret
            Thatcher.

            Close on the swoop of the pen. Without missing a beat,
            she writes the name Margaret Roberts...

            The insistent blare of an air raid siren from another
            time cuts through -

            INT. BACK PARLOUR. SHOP. GRANTHAM. 1943. DUSK.

            The rumble of an approaching air raid overhead-

            The STEADY SHAKE of the table legs all around pulls out
            to reveal-

            BEATRICE ROBERTS [early 50's] austere, crouched next to
            MARGARET under a wide kitchen table along with ALFRED
            ROBERTS [early/mid 50's] a cumbersome man and MURIEL
            ROBERTS [21 yrs]. The sound of an air-raid siren.

                                    ALFRED
                      Did someone cover the butter?

            All look at one another in a panic.

                                    MARGARET
                      I'll go.

            Suddenly MARGARET scrabbles out from under the table, all
            look on with horror-

                                                                         8

                               BEATRICE
                   Leave it.

                               ALFRED (CALLING AFTER)
                   Margaret-

            INT. SHOP. GRANTHAM. 1943. DUSK.

            MARGARET scooping up the butter cover slamming it quickly
            over the thin slice of butter left in the butter dish
            before sliding it into the cold cupboard underneath the
            counter.

            SUDDENLY the shop illuminates- A DISTANT EXPLOSION.

            MARGARET momentarily paralyzed before, running back
            towards the back parlour to resume her place under the
            table.

            INT. BACK PARLOUR. SHOP. GRANTHAM. 1943. DUSK.

            MARGARET scrabbles underneath.

            ALFRED surreptitiously pats her arm.

                                     ALFRED (CONT'D)
                      Good girl.

            She shrugs, flushing with pride.

                                    ALFRED (CONT'D)
                      Tomorrow, no matter what they do,
                      it'll be business as usual.

            The DRONE of the air raid dissolving away-

            INT. SHOP, GRANTHAM. 1945. DAY.

            A boy and girl look on as MARGARET measures flour on the
            shop scales.

                                    CUSTOMER (O.S.)
                      Two of the small beef, Mr.
                      Roberts.

            MARGARET glances up at her father serving further down
            the counter.

                                    ALFRED (O.S.)
                      What is the life blood of any
                      community? It's business....

                                                                         9

            INT. HALL. GRANTHAM. 1943. DAY

            ALFRED on a small town hall stage behind a makeshift
            podium.

                                    ALFRED
                      Not just big business but small
                      businesses, like mine.

            The SOFT press of MEN all around, MARGARET, a lone woman
            amongst them, peering over shoulders.

                                   BEATRICE
                           (passing/hushed
                            aside)
                      Margaret!

            BEATRICE tuts, shoving a tray in her hand.

                                    BEATRICE (CONT'D)
                      CUPS!

            MARGARET sinks a little, taking the tray, and glances
            back at ALFRED just visible on a stage.

                                    ALFRED
                      We on this island are strong.
                      We're self-reliant. Sometimes
                      we're plain bloody minded.


            NOW AT THE BACK OF THE HALL, holding a tray loaded with
            dirty cups, MARGARET watches her father, back turned to
            the kitchen filled with WOMEN and YOUNG GIRLS making tea
            and washing up cups.

                                    ALFRED (CONT'D)
                       But we also believe in helping
                      each other. And I don't mean by
                      state hand-outs...


            EXT. STREET. GRANTHAM. 1943. DAY.

            MARGARET sweeps outside the shop, glancing across the
            street at-

            THREE PRETTY GIRLS dolled up for the evening and arms
            linked, crossing on the other side of the pavement.

                                    PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN 1
                      Margaret, do you want to come to
                      the pictures?

            MARGARET's eyes catch on the glitter of a broach in
            passing. They turn to look at her WHISPERING and
            GIGGLING.

                                                                        10

                                    PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN 2
                      She can't come, she's got to

                      Don't let me down Margaret.

            The CHINK of a teacup-

            MARGARET looks down the corridor in expectation at
            BEATRICE standing at the sink working the SQUEAK of the
            cloth against a stubborn tea stain.

                                                                        11

                        Mother?

            BEATRICE comes down the corridor into the shop, wiping
            her hands on a cloth. ALFRED goes to hand BEATRICE the
            letter.

                                      BEATRICE
                             (shakes head)
                        My hands are still damp.

            BEATRICE turns and walks back to where she came from.

            MARGARET looks back at the letter, heart bursting, trying
            to contain her joy.


            INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.

            MARGARET looks down, pen in hand, the words Margaret
            Roberts newly signed in the front cover.

            She tears the page out.


            INT. BEDROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.DAY.

            MARGARET napping in bed.

            The still of the bedroom, caught in the half light of a
            late afternoon-

            A hand slides a teacup onto the bedside table -

            The flicker of MARGARET's eyelids-

            QUICKFLASH -

                                     BEATRICE

                        Margaret!

            BEATRICE tuts, shoving a tray in her hand.

                        CUPS!

            PRESENT -

            MARGARET stirs again, blinking awake.

            DENIS sits by the window. He is bent over a pair of
            spectacles, wrapping wire around one of the arms with a
            pair of pliers. Other items of clothing of his are on
            Margaret's couch.

                                                                        12

                                    DENIS
                           (without taking his
                            eyes of the job)
                      They're talking about you again.

            The murmur of JUNE on the phone-

                                    MARGARET

                      What time is it?

                                    DENIS
                      Sun's not quite over the yard arm.
                      Time for tea.

            A phone rings, O.S.

            MARGARET considers DENIS now wearing a pink turban and
            confronts the extraordinary head-gear.

                                    MARGARET
                      What have you got on your head?

            DENIS smiles, throwing back his head, the swathe of pink
            fabric from his turban hanging down ridiculously-

                                    DENIS
                      Found it in the cupboard and
                      thought bugger it, it's Friday,
                      why not fancy dress?

            MARGARET sits drinking her tea, JUNE's hushed tones
            almost audible.

                                    MARGARET
                      You look ridiculous.

            MARGARET strains to hear-

                                    DENIS
                      Bosslady no like?

            She makes a shushing motion.

                                    MARGARET
                           (as if to a bad dog)
                      No, Denis, Bosslady no like.

            MARGARET resumes listening. The door ajar, the sounds of
            life just audible outside-

                                    JUNE (O.S)
                      It's taken Carol so long to get
                      her to agree to this. She's been
                      so reluctant to let his things go.

            DENIS sinks onto the bed, bored.

                                                                        13

                                      MARGARET
                              (without looking)
                      Feet.

            He tuts and adjusts his legs so that his shoes don't
            dirty the bedspread.

            MARGARET stands, ear pressed close to the open door-

                                    JUNE (O.S)
                      You can never be sure she's taking
                      her medication...I think sometimes
                      she hides them..

                                      DENIS VO
                      Oh, rumbled!

            MARGARET looks back at her cup of tea, spots two pills
            resting in the tea cup.

            She considers the pills, pops them in her mouth, drinks.

                                    JUNE (O.S)
                      She's definitely more distracted
                      than usual today.

            A shout in the street. A woman's voice.

                                    CAROL OOV
                      Can I suggest you remove the
                      sticker from the back of your car.

            Margaret looks through the net curtains and sees CAROL
            THATCHER[early 50's] just visible stepping out of a taxi,
            remonstrating with the driver, clutching her purse and
            waving her credit card at him with rising irritation.

                                    CAROL OOV (CONT'D)
                      Well then take the sticker off! I
                      call that false advertising! I
                      would say keep the change, but
                      there isn't any change.



            INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.

            A scotch being poured. The cap not quite going back on
            the whisky bottle. A frantic fumble for the remotes for
            the tv.

                                    CAROL OOV
                      Hello June, any news? I've brought
                      every bag I could find.

                                                                        14

            High shot of MARGARET sitting in a chair watching TV. As
            if she has been there a while.

            CAROL enters with suit carriers in her arms.

                                    CAROL
                      Hello Ma. Bloody taxi driver.
                      Wouldn't take my card. I said
                      don't have a sticker saying you
                      take Visa and then insist on cash.
                      Can you believe it? I was
                      rummaging around the bottom of my
                      bag. He didn't get a tip.

                                    MARGARET
                      I didn't know that you were
                      dropping by today, dear.

                                    CAROL
                      (Dumping her stuff all over the
                      place)
                      Yes, you said yesterday...You
                      wanted to make a start on Dad's
                      things. The cupboards ? Then I can
                      help you dress.

            MARGARET, nonplussed.

                                    CAROL (CONT'D)
                      You've got Michael and-

                                     MARGARET
                      Jaqueline...

                                    CAROL
                      Coming for dinner tonight.

                                    MARGARET
                      Of course.
                           (turning up the TV)
                      We're having halibut.

            On TV, images of a bombed street,

                                    CAROL
                      Oh God. Isn't it terrible?

            MARGARET nods, both silently listening to the drone of
            the newscaster-

                                    CAROL (CONT'D)
                      They think it's Al Quaida -

            The charred remains of cars, desperate people running, a
            rescue operation midway-

            MARGARET blinks, inwardly reeling from the images-

                                                                        15

                                    MARGARET (V.O)
                      Denis!

            Quick Flash: Denis in pyjamas, brushing his teeth in a
            hotel bathroom, glances at her through the open door.

                                    DENIS
                      It'll be fine. Come on, get your
                      head down, it's ten to three, for
                      God's sake.


            EXT. GRAND HOTEL. BRIGHTON. 1984. NIGHT.

            Chaos outside the Grand Hotel in the aftermath of the
            bomb.

            The injured are pulled through the rubble.

                      At ten to three this morning an
                      explosion extensively damaged the

                      the Conservative Party conference.

                      Five people have died, many others
                      are injured, some critically. The
                      IRA have claimed responsibility.

            DENIS and MARGARET sit in their coats covering MARGARET's
            evening dress and DENIS pyjamas. Both looking out in
            silent shock at the devastated Grand hotel, reflected on
            the glass of the car windows.

            MARGARET looks on with quiet, sobering despair, still
            numb with shock. DENIS looks at her. He grips her hand.
            They sit, fingers locked.

                           (standing up)
                      We must release a statement,
                      offering our condolences.

                                    CAROL
                      I'm sure they've already-

                                    MARGARET
                      We must never, ever, ever give in
                      to terrorists.

            MARGARET sees JUNE and CAROL exchange looks of `oh
            dear...'


            INT.BEDROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.DUSK.

            MARGARET sits in a dressing gown at a dressing table,
            staring at her reflection. CAROL stands behind her,
            holding up several dresses.

                                    CAROL
                      Now ma, are we going long or just
                      below the knee tonight?

                                    MARGARET
                      Oh, below the knee I should think.

            She watches, irritated, as CAROL reaches to move a pile
            of DENIS' clothes-

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      No! Don't move those. I haven't
                      finished sorting them.

            CAROL settles beside her on a chair.

                                    CAROL
                      I hear you went out today...You
                      mustn't go out on your own Mummy.
                      We've talked about that.

                                    MARGARET
                      There was no milk.

                                    CAROL
                      Call Robert he'll get it for you
                      if June's not up-

                                    MARGARET
                      I am not for the knackers yet.

            From behind-

                                    DENIS (O.S)
                      Now take it easy, Margaret.

                                                                        17

            DENIS just visible, perched on the bed, looks up from
            doing the crossword in the newspaper-

                                     CAROL
                       No one is saying that.

                                     MARGARET
                       If I can't go out to buy a pint of
                       milk then what is the world coming
                       to. Really Carol, please don't
                       fuss about it. You've always been
                       like this, fuss fuss fuss. You
                       must find something better to do
                       with your time. It's most
                       unattractive in a woman. When I
                       was your age the last thing I
                       wanted to do was fuss around my
                       mother.

            Silence-

            CAROL, inwardly stung quietly busying herself, forcing
            all emotion away.

            MARGARET hesitates catching DENIS' eye, with quiet
            warning.

                                     DENIS
                       Four down, 9 letters.

            DENIS withdraws into his crossword.

                                     DENIS (CONT'D)
                       Something b something t something
                       n...something something
                       somthing...Refusal to change
                       course-

                                     MARGARET
                       Obstinate.

            DENIS writes, pleased.

            CAROL looks up, with quiet bemusement-

                                     CAROL
                       What?

            MARGARET deflects, pointing to a necklace in CAROL's
            hands.

                                     MARGARET
                       Pearls. I'll wear the pearls.

            CAROL slips them onto MARGARET'S neck and fastens them.

                                                                        18

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      There they are. My little twins.
                      Thank you, dear.


            INT. CORRIDOR. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. EVENING.

            The murmur of conversation-

            CAROL tails MARGARET, steady on the approach towards the
            drawing room.

                                    CAROL
                      It's nearly all familiar faces,
                      William, Michael and his lovely
                      wife-

                                    MARGARET
                      Jacqueline.

            CAROL smiles, clearly reassured-

                                    CAROL
                      And then there's Peter, James R
                      and James T and that very nice man-

            DISTANT LAUGHTER

                                    MARGARET
                      Yes-

                                    CAROL
                      - we met last year.

                                    MARGARET
                      Yes I remember-

                                    CAROL
                      I think he's bringing his new lady
                      friend just to mix it up a bit.
                      We're rather short on women - but
                      I'm sure we'll manage-

                                    MARGARET
                      I've always preferred the company
                      of men-

            CAROL gestures ahead, MARGARET nods, reticent, yet
            forcing herself on, she hesitates at the door, her hand
            trembling on the handle.

                                    CAROL
                      Ma?

                                                                        19

            INT. CORRIDOR.DARTFORD. 1949. EVENING.

            Close up of a shoe being rubbed on a calf. A young hand
            hesitating on a door handle.


            INT. SITTING ROOM. HOUSE. DARTFORD. 1949. EVENING.

            A 1950's drinks party-

            A bank of stuffy GREY SUITED MEN pontificating and their
            WIVES lost in a separate polite conversation-

                                    GREY SUITED MAN
                      Ah, Miss Roberts. Hoping to be
                      chosen as our candidate for
                      parliament.

            A young MARGARET [24yrs] stylish in a suit, straight from
            work, stands clutching her handbag, oddly out of place
            amidst the neat 50's chintz. A bank of sporting prints
            collage a wall. A bespectacled YOUNG DENIS THATCHER
            (30's) glances up from his drink, taking her in.


            INT.DINING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.EVENING.

            The MURMUR of dinner party conversation-

                                    MARGARET
                      Well I don't like coalitions,
                      never have...

            MARGARET's POV of her fingers absently grazing a
            confusing array of cutlery laid out in place setting in
            front of her.

            Her confused face.

                                    DENIS VO
                      Start on the outside...


            INT. DINING ROOM. HOUSE. DARTFORD. 1949. EVENING.

            DENIS whispers.

                                    DENIS VO
                      ...and work your way in.

            A long table packed with silverware. She looks back at
            her ornate and rather hideous starter, a tiny wobbling
            savoury confection in aspic.

                                                                        20

                                    PORTLY HOST
                      ...Attlee has his sights set on
                      the steel industry, you mark my
                      words.

                                    GREY SUITED MAN
                      They'll be nationalizing the
                      bloody air next.

                                    MALE GUEST
                      Yes, hold your breath, sir, that's
                      government property!

                                    PORTLY HOST
                      So was your father a political
                      man, too, Miss Roberts?

                                    MARGARET
                      Oh, yes, to his core. And Mayor of
                      Grantham.

                                    PORTLY HOST
                      And a grocer as well!

                                    MARGARET
                      Yes.

            Ears prick up around the table. The Host is lost for
            something to say.

                                    HOSTESS
                      And did you help, err, in
                      the...shop?

                                    MARGARET
                      Oh, yes. It was a family business.

                                    GREY SUITED MAN
                      A very good starting point for the
                      political life, I'm sure.

                                    MARGARET
                      That and a degree from Oxford.

            The put-down, though not intentional, causes Denis to
            smile.

            MARGARET catches the smile. She remains unruffled and
            goes back to her food, picking up a knife and fork,
            working her way in, teasing her hors d'oeuvres.


            INT. DINING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE.LONDON.PRESENT.EVENING.

            MARGARET sits oddly removed, hand instinctively covering
            her wine glass, as a WINE WAITER hovers.

                                                                        21

                                    MARGARET
                           (hushed aside to
                            WAITER)
                      Whisky.

            The MURMUR of conversation all around-


            INT. DINING ROOM. HOUSE. DARTFORD. 1949. EVENING.

            Pudding is on the go and Margaret is warming to her
            theme.

                                    MARGARET
                      What I do think is that a man
                      should be encouraged to stand on
                      his own two feet. Yes we help
                      people of course we help people.
                      But for those that can do, they
                      must just get up and do. And if
                      something's wrong, they shouldn't
                      just whine about it, they should
                      get in there and DO something
                      about it, change things.

            The female guests exchange glances. A half-chuckle from
            someone.

                                    PORTLY HOST
                      With all due respect, Miss
                      Roberts, what may have served in
                      Grantham-

                                    MARGARET
                      Can serve very well for the people
                      of Dartford too.

                                    MALE GUEST
                      Really?

            A general sense of quiet incredulity.

                                    MARGARET
                      I know much more than those who
                      have never lived on a limited
                      income. Just like the man or woman
                      on the street, when I am short one
                      week, I have to make economies the
                      next.

                                    GREY SUITED MAN
                      Nothing like a slice of fiscal
                      responsibility.

                                                                        22

                                    MARGARET
                      A man might call it fiscal
                      responsibility, a woman might call
                      it good housekeeping.

                                    MALE GUEST
                      I'm not sure a home economics
                      lesson is quite what the Dartford
                      constituents need. They see
                      industry being nationalized, the
                      unions on the up, the pound on the
                      slide...whoever can sort that lot
                      out - he's my man.

                                     MARGARET
                      Or woman?

            Denis lets out a spontaneous guffaw as the host and
            hostess exchange looks. He signals `Get them out of
            here'. The men rise.

                                    HOSTESS
                      Ladies shall we ?

                                    PORTLY HOST
                      Miss Roberts, do join the ladies.

            The ladies scurry to the sitting room. Margaret is the
            last to leave.


            INT. SITTING ROOM. DARTFORD. 1949. EVENING.

            As Margaret closes the door to the dining room -

                                    PORTLY HOST (O.S.)
                      Well. That's told us!

            The men laugh raucously. She turns to the ladies who are
            regrouping at the fireplace and regarding her with
            suspicion.


            INT.DINING ROOM.   CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.
            EVENING.

            The aftermath of the muted dinner party-

            MARGARET at the helm, a small whisky just visible nestled
            next to her wine glass. She is flushed and nicely mellow
            surrounded by mainly MALE GUESTS-

                                    MICHAEL
                      So, Margaret, how would you have
                      dealt with this if you'd been
                      Prime Minister?

                                                                        23

            MARGARET looks at him, her flicker of bemusement.

            ...slowly registering across the faces of her FRIENDS and
            COLLEAGUES including CAROL.

                                     MARGARET
                        Where?

                                      CAROL
                        The bombings, mummy. Today?

            MARGARET still lost

                                      CAROL (CONT'D)
                        We were just talking about them?

            MARGARET deflects, reaching for her glass, it trembles
            unsteady in her grasp.

                                      MARGARET
                        No, uhm, yes - we have always
                        lived alongside evil. But it has
                        never been so patient, so avid for
                        carnage, so eager to carry
                        innocents with it into oblivion.

                                      MALE GUEST
                        So, would you -

                                      MARGARET
                        Western civilization must root out
                        this evil, wherever it hides, or
                        she risks defeat at the hands of
                        global terror in a nuclear age.
                        Unimaginable!

            Appreciative murmur of agreements amongst the listening
            party-

                                      PETER
                        The Prime Minister gave a very
                        good statement I thought.

                                      MARGARET
                        Yes. Clever man. Quite a smoothie.

            Laughter-


            INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.
            NIGHT.

            MARGARET says final farewells to a guest. He walks away
            as another couple approach.

                                      MARGARET
                        You don't mind if I sit down...

                                                                        24

            Sitting down on a nearby chair, MARGARET looks with
            feigned recollection at the FEMALE GUEST as she sinks
            down on the ground in front of her, gripping MARGARET's
            hand.

                                    FEMALE GUEST
                      I heard you speak at conference in
                      1984 in Brighton just after the
                      IRA bombed the Grand Hotel. You
                      were remarkable. I hope you
                      appreciate what an inspiration you
                      have been for women like myself.

            MARGARET hesitates, smiles, nods to herself, considering-

                                    MARGARET
                      It used to be about trying to do
                      something. Now its about trying to
                      be someone.

            The FEMALE GUEST nods and scrambled to her feet, clearly
            concerned, shooting a look to her HUSBAND standing beside
            her, waiting to depart.

                                    FEMALE GUEST
                      Well anyway, I...thank you.

                                    MARGARET
                      Good night to you.

            MARGARET sits alone. In the background, the chatter of
            Carol saying final farewells.

                                    CAROL (O.S.)
                      Great to see you, thank you very
                      much for coming.

                                    MALE GUEST (O.S.)
                      Oh, thank you. It was lovely,
                      absolutely lovely. And I'm so
                      pleased to see your mother looking
                      so well.


            INT. DRESSING ROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT.NIGHT.

            A mirror lined dressing room-

            CAROL helps MARGARET with her shoes.

                                    CAROL
                      OK...hold on to me...that's right.

            MARGARET struggles with the catch on her pearls

                                                                        25

                                     MARGARET
                       Can you do the clasp, I can't
                       quite -

            CAROL hurries to help her, MARGARET quietly concedes.
            Fingers fumble to unclasp the pearls-

                                      MARGARET (CONT'D)
                       Thank you.

            CAROL drops the pearls into a jewelry box, close to
            MARGARET, staring back at their reflections.

                                     CAROL
                       You've got an eyelash.

            CAROL catches the stray eyelash on the tip of her finger,
            holding it close to MARGARET, with a smile-

                                      CAROL (CONT'D)
                       Make a wish.

            MARGARET, closes her eyes until-

            MARGARET blows. She opens them smiles. CAROL smiles.

                                     CAROL (CONT'D)
                       I spoke to Doctor Michael today-

            MARGARET glances away, deflecting.

                                     CAROL (CONT'D)
                       He is very good and very expensive-

            MARGARET ignores her-

                                     CAROL (CONT'D)
                       ...I know you're not due to see
                       him for another month but I've
                       spoken to him and he can fit you
                       in tomorrow.

            SILENCE-

                                     CAROL (CONT'D)
                       Just for a check up.
                            (silence)
                       Ma please-

                                     MARGARET
                       What does Mark think about it?

                                      CAROL
                       Mark?

                                                                        26

                                     MARGARET
                       Yes. Tell him to come up. I want
                       to talk to him about it.

            CAROL, hesitates, with concern-

                                     CAROL
                       Mark's with Sarah and the
                       children.

            MARGARET nods, heading through into the bathroom.

                                     MARGARET
                       Well tell him to come up and see
                       me after he's kissed them good
                       night, would you Carol darling?


            INT. BEDROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. NIGHT.

            MARGARET, sitting on her bed, glances expectantly towards
            the door. Carol sits down beside her.

                                     CAROL
                       He's not here Mummy.

            MARGARET hesitates, CAROL using all her might, not to
            crumble under MARGARET's cool gaze-

                                     CAROL (CONT'D)
                       Mark lives in South Africa...

            MARGARET inwardly flinches.

                                     CAROL (CONT'D)
                       ...you are not Prime Minister
                       anymore and Dad is...Dad is dead-

            Silence-

                                     MARGARET
                       You look exhausted, dear. You
                       really must try to get some sleep.
                       Taxis'll be few and far between at
                       this hour...

                                          CAROL
                       Righty-ho. Night night Ma. Sleep
                       well.

                                        MARGARET
                       Good night, dear.

            The slam of a door. MARGARET sits, alone.

                                                                        27

            INT. SADLERS WELLS.   LONDON. 1950. NIGHT.

            MARGARET'S POV of Denis turning to her in the theatre. He
            smiles.

            MARGARET's FINGERS absently grazing over the programme,
            in time with the music-

            SUDDENLY a closed fist reaches out, then opens to reveal
            a sugar mouse. Margaret's fingers reach for it, but it's
            teasingly withdrawn. Finally, she takes its.

            She turns to smile at DENIS, her face is glowing with
            happiness-


            INT. TOWN HALL 1950. NIGHT.

            MARGARET sits on the edge of a trestle table, scrunching
            a rosette in her hand. The Town Hall is empty save for a
            couple of Volunteers stacking chairs and sweeping the
            floor. The litter of election night is everywhere.

                                    RADIO ANNOUNCER
                      Twenty-four-year-old Miss Margaret
                      Roberts lost her bid to win a seat
                      in Parliament today, but she has
                      put new life into the Dartford
                      Conservative Association. Winning
                      candidate Mr Dodds had better
                      watch out, this bright young woman
                      is on his tail.

            DENIS appears in the doorway, carrying fish and chips. He
            slides them down in front of her.

                                     DENIS
                      Eat!

            MARGARET almost smiles. Then sinks once more into misery.

                                     MARGARET
                      Disaster.

                                    DENIS
                      Hang on...Hang on...Hang on...

            DENIS fishes in his pocket pulling out a hip flask. An
            impromptu supper made. MARGARET takes in the aftermath of
            rosettes, the whiff of defeat all around.

                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
                      You shaved thousands off their
                      majority. You did splendidly.

                                    MARGARET
                      Not splendidly enough.

                                                                        28

                                    DENIS
                      Ah I see. Self pity.

            MARGARET eyes him, mid chip-

                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
                      No one is saying you don't need a
                      safe seat. You deserve a safe
                      seat. But it does not come unless
                      you learn to play the game a
                      little.

                                    MARGARET
                      What game?

            She is fuming but he regroups with a big breath.

                                    DENIS
                      You are a grocer's daughter-

                                    MARGARET
                           (fiercely)
                      -And proud of being-

            He grabs her hand, silencing her.

                                    DENIS
                      - in their eyes. A single grocer's
                      daughter. But if you were to
                      become the wife of a moderately
                      successful businessman-

            For the first time, we see MARGARET taken by surprise.

                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
                      You'd get to parliament, and I'd
                      get to be the happiest man in- in
                      wherever they select you.
                           (SILENCE)
                      Margaret, will you marry me?

            She is genuinely stunned.

                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
                      Well ?

            She is frozen. Then she begins to smile and nod her head
            and smile.

                                    MARGARET
                      Yes. Yes!

            He leans over and kisses her, long and passionately until-

                                    DENIS
                      What ?

                                                                        29

                                    MARGARET
                      I love you so much but...I will
                      never be one of those women Denis -
                      who stays silent and pretty on the
                      arm of her husband. Or remote and
                      alone in the kitchen doing the
                      washing up for that matter.

                                    DENIS
                           (trying to retain the
                            moment)
                      We'll get a help for that.

            He leans forward to kiss her again but she pulls away a
            little.

                                    MARGARET
                      No - one's life must matter,
                      Denis. Beyond the cooking and the
                      cleaning and the children, one's
                      life must mean more than that - I
                      cannot die washing up a tea cup.

            He sits up and stares as if seeing her for the first
            time.

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      I mean it Denis, say you
                      understand.

                                    DENIS
                      That's why I want to marry you, my
                      dear.

            She kisses him.

            A CHINK of a TEACUP-

            They pull apart. FLUSHED and GIGGLING on seeing-

            A LONE WOMAN enters the hall, cleaning up the last of the
            tea cups, and generally tidying.

                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
                      Now eat.

            MARGARET smiles her joy at him as `SHALL WE DANCE'
            swells.

            And now she's in his arms as they dance, swirling through
            the election debris, eyes only for each other.

                                                                        30

            INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.
            NIGHT.

            MARGARET now on all fours, struggling with her glasses. A
            pile of DVD's on the floor, The KING and I amongst them
            momentarily catching her eye until-

            A DVD with hand-written scrawl that we can't quite read.

            MARGARET flicks open the box, struggling to get the DVD
            out.

            Fiddling with the DVD player, MARGARET puts in the disc
            and considers, squinting at the remote, trying to make
            the DVD player work until, suddenly...

            Super 8 footage - 1959

            Children on a beach in wind-swept, grainy super 8. Denis
            with a golf club and ping pong balls practicing his drive
            from a tee, sending ball after ball skying into the sea.
            Mark and Carol charge into the water to retrieve them.

                                    MARGARET
                      There they are, my little twins.
                      Mark...

            DENIS approaches the camera laughing and appears to take
            hold of it. MARGARET is seen sitting on a wobbly camping
            stool, hardly dressed for the beach, surrounded by papers
            weighed held down by pebbles. She merrily returns to her
            work.

                                    DENIS
                      Cornwall, wasn't it? Bloody
                      hell... Look at `em, little imps.
                      You never really got golf, did
                      you?

            DENIS sits behind her on the sofa in a dressing gown,
            watching the footage. She sips her whisky.

                                    MARGARET
                      You look happy.

                                    DENIS
                      Yes, I do, don't I? You're
                      drinking too much.

            MARGARET ignores him.

                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
                      Whatcha doing?

            DENIS looks at MARGARET, unwavering. She resumes a search-

                                                                        31

                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
                      Not like you. Looking back.

            MARGARET SUDDENLY presses rewind on the remote, clutched
            in her hand.

                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
                      Don't want to dig around too deep,
                      M. Don't know what you might find.

            The rapid rewind of Denis swinging his golf club.

                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
                      You can rewind it, but you can't
                      change it.

            She freezes the image of him turning to camera, laughing.

                                    MARGARET
                      They grow up so fast.

            Margaret turns with something to say, but Denis doesn't
            seem to be there anymore.


            INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.NIGHT.

            Now on the screen, Mark on a swing. MARGARET'S face
            softens.

                                    MARGARET
                      Mark.

            He turns and rushes towards the camera, whooshing past
            it.

            Without breaking step, suddenly, he's in the room,
            running past Margaret, still cheering and whooping.

            MARGARET's hand, just skimming MARK's golden curls. As he
            moves on, MARGARET's curiosity caught following him out
            and down the corridor of Chester Square, seeing the Mark
            and Carol disappear round a corner.


            INT. HALLWAY. HOUSE. FARNBOROUGH. KENT. 1959. DAWN.

            The view beyond-

                                    SPEAKER VO
                      Mr Eric Deakins, Labour...
                      13,437...

            The CRUNCH of gravel as CAROL and MARK race across the
            drive towards a blue ford car, covered with Tory blue
            streamers and a VOTE FOR THATCHER poster scrawled with
            the words Victory.

                                                                        30

            INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.
            NIGHT.

            MARGARET now on all fours, struggling with her glasses. A
            pile of DVD's on the floor, The KING and I amongst them
            momentarily catching her eye until-

            A DVD with hand-written scrawl that we can't quite read.

            MARGARET flicks open the box, struggling to get the DVD
            out.

            Fiddling with the DVD player, MARGARET puts in the disc
            and considers, squinting at the remote, trying to make
            the DVD player work until, suddenly...

            Super 8 footage - 1959

            Children on a beach in wind-swept, grainy super 8. Denis
            with a golf club and ping pong balls practicing his drive
            from a tee, sending ball after ball skying into the sea.
            Mark and Carol charge into the water to retrieve them.

                      There they are, my little twins.
                      Mark...

            DENIS approaches the camera laughing and appears to take
            hold of it. MARGARET is seen sitting on a wobbly camping
            stool, hardly dressed for the beach, surrounded by papers
            weighed held down by pebbles. She merrily returns to her
            work.

                                    DENIS

                      hell... Look at `em, little imps.
                      You never really got golf, did
                      you?

            DENIS sits behind her on the sofa in a dressing gown,
            watching the footage. She sips her whisky.

                                    MARGARET
                      You look happy.

                                    DENIS
                      Yes, I do, don't I? You're
                      drinking too much.

            MARGARET ignores him.

                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
                      Whatcha doing?

            DENIS looks at MARGARET, unwavering. She resumes a search-

                                                                        33

            MARGARET fingers brush dark panelled walls, making her
            way along endless corridors.

            Gothic arches, venerable busts, wood panelling and stone.

            MARGARET's pov as she stays to the side of the impressive
            corridor. She passes men in suits and groups. Others come
            towards her and notice her.

            Her POV as she pushes open a first door `TEA ROOM' - a
            circle of men turn round in chorus as if something with
            three heads has appeared.

            POV of a second opening door marked MEMBERS. A row of
            urinals. Two headless bodies come towards the camera,
            scrambling to zip up their flies.

            POV of the promise of sanctuary. LADY MEMBERS. The door
            opens onto a cupboard sized space. An ironing board.

            A sea of men's Oxford shoes from ground level. A pair of
            woman's shoes appear amongst them. They go on tip toe.

            From above we see Margaret's hat amongst the sea of mens
            heads and shoulders. Margaret is carried along in the sea
            of MALE MP's OXFORD SHOES.

            AIREY NEAVE [Extremely dapper, friendly 43] approaches
            MARGARET.

                                    AIREY NEAVE
                      Mrs Thatcher ! Airey Neave.
                      Welcome to the madhouse. Follow
                      me.

            The doors swing open-


            INT. HOUSE OF COMMONS CHAMBER. 1974. DAY

            MARGARET, now SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION, on the
            front bench, wearing a neat blue suit and a hat, a
            phalanx of MINISTERS sitting beside and around her, BLUE
            and GREY SUITED MEN, almost at first glance
            indistinguishable, with PRIME MINISTER EDWARD HEATH (late
            50's), neat, effete, slumped rather forlornly on the
            bench.

            MARGARET, her speech and papers in her hand is fighting
            hard but the OPPOSITION LABOUR BENCHES scent blood - and
            they literally bray, getting to their feet and shaking
            their order papers in her face.

            The SPEAKER tries to control the chamber but his VOICE is
            almost lost in the bedlam.

                                                                        34

                                    SPEAKER
                      The Right Honourable Lady the
                      Secretary of State for Education.

                                    MARGARET
                      The right honourable gentleman
                      knows that we have no choice but
                      to shut down the schools!

            Cries of `Shame!' From the opposition. The chamber
            reduced to a bear-pit. HEATH glum and offering no help to
            MARGARET whose voice becomes increasingly shrill.

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      Because his union paymasters have
                      called a strike deliberately to
                      cripple our economy. Teachers
                      cannot teach when there is no
                      heating, no lighting in their
                      classrooms. And I ask the
                      honourable gentleman, whose fault
                      is that?

                                    SHADOW MINISTER
                      Methinks the Right Honourable lady
                      doth screech to much. If she wants
                      us to take her seriously she must
                      learn to calm down!

            The OPPOSITION BENCHES love that, rocking in their seats,
            laughing... falsely of course.

            But MARGARET is aware that there are many MEN behind her,
            on the government benches, who are also sniggering in
            agreement.

                                    MARGARET
                      If the right honorable gentleman
                      could perhaps attend more closely
                      to WHAT I am saying, rather than
                      HOW I am saying it, he may receive
                      a valuable education in spite of
                      himself!

            Her opposite number Shadow Minister looks almost smug:
            smiling, pointing a finger at her.

                                    SHADOW MINISTER
                      Why has this Conservative
                      government failed? Why has it
                      forced so many in the public
                      sector into taking strike action
                      to save their own jobs?

            It brings the OPPOSITION benches to their feet, shouting,
            applauding, stamping...

                                                                        35

            EXT. WESTMINSTER STREET. 1974. DAY

            MARGARET walking with AIREY NEAVE towards Downing Street
            for a Cabinet Meeting.

            All around, heaped high on either side as far as the eye
            can see are bags of rubbish. But not neatly stacked, just
            thrown there, many of them rotting down, spilling their
            filthy, putrid contents onto the street.

                                    SHADOW MINISTER VO
                      Minister, the breakdown of
                      essential public services -
                      transport, electricity, sanitation
                      is not the fault of the trades
                      unions but of this Conservative
                      government in which you so
                      shamefully serve!

            The stench is awful - and MARGARET'S expression reflects
            that as she picks her way through.


            INT. CABINET ROOM. DOWNING STREET. 1974. NIGHT.

            The ranks of BESPECTACLED GREY-SUITED MINISTERS   at the
            Cabinet table, including GEOFFREY HOWE.

                                    HEATH
                      So these power cuts will continue
                      unless we can reach a compromise.

            EDWARD HEATH is in mid-flow.

                                    HEATH (CONT'D)
                      The miners are asking for a 35%
                      increase in wages. Obviously we
                      can't go anywhere near that. The
                      unions are not our enemies and
                      never have been. We want - and
                      have always wanted - the broadest
                      consensus...

            The MINISTERS nod. MARGARET determinedly edges a little
            forward so that she is in equal line with the other MALE
            MINISTERS.

                                    HEATH (CONT'D)
                      I'm sure we are all in agreement
                      that we must do nothing for the
                      moment that will further inflame
                      the current situation.

                                    MINISTER 1
                      Hear hear, Prime Minister.

                                                                        36

            MARGARET leans forward for a better view, trying to catch
            his eye. HEATH wavers, mid-speech. All turn to look at
            MARGARET - who sits unwavering. HEATH resumes.

                                    HEATH
                      - the fact of the matter is, it's
                      absolutely crucial that we are
                      seen by the public to be acting as
                      conciliators and not aggressors.
                           (Finally
                            acknowledging
                            Margaret)
                      Yes, Education Secretary.

                                    MARGARET
                      Yes...

            All eyes TURN on her again, hearing the reservation in
            her voice.

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      Prime Minister, with the Miners'
                      leader calling today for the army
                      to mutiny in support of the
                      strikes, this seems the wrong time
                      for conciliation.

            SUDDENLY ALL THE LIGHTS GO OUT.

            A lot of `bloody hell' `oh for god's sake'.

                                    HEATH
                      Be patient. They'll come back on
                      in a minute.

            A beam of light cuts through, just for an instant picking
            out HEATH'S moon-like face surrounded by darkness.
            MARGARET holds the small torch.

                                    HEATH (CONT'D)
                      Thank you, Margaret.

            A snigger, then the lights flicker back on.

                                    HEATH (CONT'D)
                      Your thoughts are duly noted.

            MARGARET turns of the torch and clicks her handbag shut
            in satisfaction. Heath's words echo in her head,
            `compromise...compromise...compromise...' An inward look
            as she's caught by a memory.

                                    ALFRED (O.S.)
                      We on this island are strong.
                      We're self-reliant. Napoleon
                      called us a nation of shopkeepers.

                                                                        37

            INT. TOWN HALL. 1949. NIGHT.
            The packed town hall, ALFRED ROBERTS in full flow on
            stage.

                                    ALFRED
                      He meant it as an insult but to me
                      it's a compliment. That's why he
                      couldn't beat us, and that's why
                      Hitler can't beat us.

            The crowd of men applaud. The lone woman in their midst,
            YOUNG MARGARET watches her father, face aglow.

                                    ALFRED (CONT'D)
                      We Conservatives believe in giving
                      people the freedom and opportunity
                      to fulfil their own potential,
                      especially the young. There's no
                      good in pretending we're all
                      equal, we're not all the same,
                      never have been, never will be. We
                      should encourage our children to
                      aspire to achieve more than we
                      have, for our children today will
                      be the leaders of tomorrow.


            INT. CAR. STREET. CENTRAL LONDON. 1974. DAWN
            ...CAROL and MARGARET seated, driving steadily along a
            deserted street. MARGARET thoughtful as the radio plays.

                                    VOICE ON THE RADIO
                      It's 1974 and you'd think it was
                      WWII. Blackouts, no petrol. It's a
                      mess. Heath should resign now and
                      make way for someone who's not
                      afraid to tackle the unions.

            CAROL'S nervous prattle begins to break through.

                                    CAROL
                      I swear, it's all gone completely
                      out of my head. My driving
                      instructor thinks I should pass
                      but I feel as if I've hardly had
                      any lessons. Ridiculous isn't it?
                      Maybe third time lucky.
                                    MARGARET
                      Right. The only thing you should
                      remember is that everyone else is
                      either reckless or inept. And
                      often both.
            MARGARET eyes the road, gesturing CAROL to move forward.

                                                                        38

                                       MARGARET (CONT'D)
                         One must be brave if one is to
                         take the wheel-

                                      CAROL
                         Right-o.

                                       MARGARET
                         Move over... Move to your right a
                         little bit...

                                       CAROL
                         But if I move to the right aren't
                         I on the wrong side of the road?

                                      MARGARET
                         Carol!

                                       CAROL
                         Well he's in the way!

                                       MARGARET
                         To the right. Move to the right!
            A yelp from CAROL as the car swerves a little, narrowly
            missing a lone CYCLIST-
                                       MARGARET (CONT'D)
                         So sorry! Terribly sorry!
            MARGARET throws a wave from the wound down window. The
            CYCLIST swerves on recognizing her, watching as the car
            goes round and round the square, almost balletic.

                                       CAROL
                         Hey, look at me, driving!
            CAROL's squeals of delight, let loose on the open road.
            The tyres screech on the corner.

            INT. KITCHEN. FLOOD STREET. LONDON. 1974. DAWN.
            Laughter -

            VOICES on the approach-

                                       CAROL
                         Thanks Ma, that was terrific! I
                         really feel I've got a handle on
                         it now.

            CAROL and MARGARET entering kitchen, still giddy from
            their adventure.

                                       CAROL (CONT'D)
                         You should have seen us, Pa.

                                                                        39

            DENIS in his dressing gown burning toast and attempting
            to make breakfast -

                                    MARGARET
                      Have you been trying to make
                      breakfast? For Goodness sake,
                      Denis!

            DENIS scrapes down the toast, eggs boiling in the pan.

                                    DENIS
                      I can boil a bloody egg.
                                    CAROL
                      Mummy took me for a test drive -
                      We went absolutely everywhere. All
                      over the place -
                                    MARGARET
                           (sudden/cutting in)
                      I've decided. I'm going to run.
            MARGARET smiles, a growing resolution gripping her.
                                    DENIS
                      What for?
                                    MARGARET
                      I'm going to run for Leader of the
                      Party.
            CAROL'S utter disappointment on seeing she has lost
            MARGARET already.

                                    CAROL
                      Silly me!

            CAROL storms out of the kitchen.


                                   DENIS
                           (calling after)
                      Good luck!
                                    CAROL (O.S.)
                      All the time I thought I was
                      having a driving lesson, it was
                      all about my mother, just for a
                      change!

                                    MARGARET
                      What's she on about?

                                    DENIS
                      It's her driving test this
                      morning!

                                                                        40

                                     MARGARET
                       Oh, right. Of course.

            A BEAT.
                                     DENIS
                       Are you saying you want to be
                       Prime Minister?
                                     MARGARET
                            (with false patience)
                       What I'm saying is that someone
                       must force the point, say the
                       unsayable. None of these men have
                       the guts.
            MARGARET sees the burnt toast and energetically starts
            clearing up and putting more bread under the grill.

                                     DENIS
                       The Prime Minister has been very
                       loyal to you, MT.
            He tries, with a trembling hand, to scoop boiled eggs
            from the pan.
                                     MARGARET
                       But he's weak, and he's weakened
                       the party. One must know when to
                       go.
                            (glancing at him)
                       You're shaking.
            She reaches out.
                                      DENIS
                       I can do it!
            DENIS pulls his arm away, sending boiled eggs flying.
            SILENCE.
                                     MARGARET
                       Goodness me! What is the matter
                       with everyone this morning?
            A beat. He looks utterly fragile.
                                     DENIS
                       I've told you what the matter is.
                       The business is a bit rocky at the
                       moment and the Doctor thinks I
                       need a rest.
                                     MARGARET
                       And do you need a rest?

                                                                        41

            It's almost challenging. He doesn't answer and she
            doesn't notice.
                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      We both know that it's highly
                      unlikely that I would ever be
                      elected leader, I'll never be
                      elected leader. But I will run. I
                      will run. Just to nip at their
                      heels and make them reaffirm the
                      principles on which the
                      Conservative Party must stand.
                      There's so much to do.
            She smiles.
                                    DENIS
                           (sotto voce)
                      You're insufferable, Margaret, do
                      you know that?
                                    MARGARET
                      Denis, you married someone who is
                      committed to public service, you
                      knew that. And it is my duty -
                                    DENIS
                            (interrupts)
                      Don't call it duty. It's ambition
                      which has got you this far.
                      Ambition. And the rest of us, me,
                      the children, we can all go to
                      hell!
            The SLAM of the door, DENIS gone-

                                    DENIS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                      Don't worry about me, I'll be
                      fine!


            INT. SITTING ROOM. CHESTER SQ. PRESENT. NIGHT

            MARGARET and DENIS sit on the sofa.

                                    MARGARET
                      Where did you go?

                                      DENIS
                      South Africa.

                                      MARGARET
                      Yes.

                                                                        42

            INT. KITCHEN. FLOOD STREET. LONDON. 1974. DAWN

            MARGARET eats breakfast alone, engrossed in the
            newspaper.

                                    DENIS (V.O.)
                      How many days passed before you
                      realized I was gone? Probably had
                      to ask the cleaning woman where I
                      was.


            INT. SITTING ROOM. CHESTER SQ. PRESENT. NIGHT

            MARGARET grips her whiskey, shaking her head.

                                    MARGARET
                      When did I lose track of everyone?

                                    DENIS
                      Too busy climbing the greasy pole
                      MT.

            Cutting in -

                                    INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                      Mrs Thatcher I understand you
                      recently visited the United States
                      of America.

            MARGARET'S attention is caught by an old interview,
            playing on the TV. She leans forward. On screen, she sits
            in a neat hat, leaning forward eagerly.


                                    INTERVIEWER (CONT'D)
                      What was it you took away from
                      that visit which may be of value
                      here in Great Britain?


            INT. STUDIO. LONDON. 1975. NIGHT

            MARGARET perched on a chair, smiling at the TV
            INTERVIEWER -

                                    MARGARET
                      Oh that's rather easy to answer,
                      actually. They are unafraid of
                      success.

            INT. REECE'S OFFICE. LONDON. 1975. DAY
            MARGARET is watching the same interview on a TV monitor.
            She is watching herself intently, as are REECE and AIREY
            NEAVE. They are polar opposites, REECE flamboyant to
            NEAVE's bluff.

                                                                        43

            She sounds very plummy, like a Conservative party wife
            from the shires. And she wears a hat.

                                    MARGARET ON TELEVISION
                      We in Great Britain and in Europe
                      are formed mainly by our history.
                      They on the other hand are formed
                      by their philosophy. Not by what
                      has been, but by what can be. Oh,
                      we have a great deal that we can
                      learn from them, yes. Oh yes!

            MARGARET is trapped in the moment - but the two men
            exchange a glance. NEAVE freezes the picture. MARGARET
            smiles uneasily, like someone expecting a compliment.
            REECE considers her, long and hard. It is a little
            unsettling until-
                                    REECE
                      Well er...For a start, that hat
                      has got to go. And the pearls. In
                      fact I think all hats may have to
                      go. You look and sound like a
                      privileged Conservative wife and
                      we've already got her vote. You've
                      got lovely hair but we need to do
                      something with it - to make it
                      more-


                                      AIREY NEAVE
                      Important.

                                    REECE
                      Yes. Give it more impact. But the
                      main thing is your voice. Its too
                      high. It has no authority.

                                    AIREY NEAVE
                      Methinks the Lady doth screech too
                      much

                                    REECE
                      People don't want to be harangued
                      by a woman or hectored. Persuaded
                      yes. That `oh yes' at the end of
                      the interview, that's
                      authoritative, that's the voice of
                      a leader.
            MARGARET stares at him.

                                                                        44

                                    MARGARET
                      It's all very well to talk about
                      changing my voice, Mr Reece, but
                      for some of my colleagues to
                      imagine me as their leader would
                      be like imagining, I don't know,
                      being led into battle by their
                      chambermaid. It's my background,
                      and my sex. No matter how I've
                      tried, and I have tried, to fit
                      in, I will never be truly one of
                      them.
            Both REECE and NEAVE are aware that she has spoken very
            nakedly - and is thus extremely vulnerable.
                                    REECE
                      If I may say so - I think that's
                      your trump card. You're flying in
                      the face of everything the Tories
                      have been thus far. It's really
                      very exciting. One simply has to
                      maximise your appeal, bring out
                      all your qualities and make you
                      look, and sound, like the leader
                      that you could be.

                                    NEAVE
                      You've got it in you to go the
                      whole distance.

                                       REECE
                      Absolutely.

                                    MARGARET
                      Prime Minister?! Oh no. Oh no no
                      no. In Britain? There will be no
                      female Prime Minister here, not in
                      my lifetime. No. And I told Airey,
                      I don't expect to win the
                      leadership, but I am going to run.
                      Just to shake up the party.
            NEAVE moves in intently-
                                    NEAVE
                      Respectfully, Margaret, I
                      disagree. If you want to change
                      this party, lead it. If you want
                      to change the country, lead it.
                      What we're talking about here
                      today is surface. What's crucial
                      is that you hold your course, and
                      stay true to who you are. Never be
                      anything other than yourself.
            MARGARET, though flattered, looks sceptical.

                                                                        45

                                    REECE
                      Leave us to do the rest.
            A BEAT
                                    MARGARET
                      Gentlemen, I am in your hands. I
                      may be persuaded to surrender the
                      hat. But the pearls were a gift
                      from my husband on the birth of
                      our twins and they are absolutely
                      non-negotiable.
            MARGARET smiles at them.

            INT. REHEARSAL ROOM. NATIONAL THEATRE. LONDON. 1975. DAY
            MARGARET stands humming, a THEATRICAL COACH presses her
            hand to MARGARET'S stomach.
                                    THEATRICAL VOICE COACH
                      And...bring it down.
            MARGARET hums lower, tries to project her voice.

                                    MARGARET
                      Maaaaaaaaaaaa.

                                    THEATRICAL VOICE COACH
                      Good, I think we can loose the
                      handbag, Mrs Thatcher...Hands down
                      the sides...Because this isn't
                      really about the voice, it's about
                      belief...A nice deep breath.
            REECE and NEAVE are watching and monitoring the
            performance. DENIS, though present, is having a crafty
            fag by the window.

                                    THEATRICAL VOICE COACH (CONT'D)
                      If you're calling Mr Thatcher, how
                      would you do that?
            MARGARET looks over at him.
                                       MARGARET
                           (calls)
                      Denis.
            He doesn't react.

                                    THEATRICAL VOICE COACH
                      Yes, I want more authority, I want
                      conviction, I want -

                                                                        46

                                    MARGARET
                           (a little more
                             authority)
                      Denis.

                                    THEATRICAL VOICE COACH
                      That's right, one more time, deep
                      breath -
            She puts on her new, lower voice.
                                    MARGARET
                      Denis.
            And DENIS reacts immediately, like a guilty thing
            surprised, stabbing out his cigarette, turning quickly
            towards her.
                                    DENIS
                      Yes MT!


            EXT. YARD. ICE CREAM FACTORY. DAY.

            MARGARET makes her way through a crowd of applauding
            workers in crisp white uniforms. Like them, she wears a
            white cap on her head.

                                    MARGARET
                      You are the backbone of our
                      nation! Small firms like Loveday's
                      Ice Cream. How are you? So nice to
                      meet you ladies.

            General merriment as MARGARET, now inside an ice-cream
            van, has a go at dispensing an ice cream from the
            machine.

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      I'll just have a small one,
                      because I'm watching my figure.
                           (handing the cone
                            out)
                      That's for you young man!

            INT. HAIR SALON. LONDON. 1975. DAY
            MARGARET is having new hair colour and the colourist is
            75 percent through putting her hair in foil.

                                    MARGARET (V.O.)
                      I passionately believe it's the
                      growth of small businesses into
                      larger ones that is critical for
                      Britain's future.

                                                                        47

            REECE and NEAVE are sitting nearby, both of them reading
            the Financial Times.

            EXT. YARD. ICE CREAM FACTORY. DAY.
            MARGARET among the ladies again.

                                      MARGARET
                        It has to be something icy on a
                        stick for Denis.

            Laughter.

                                      MARGARET (CONT'D)
                         (returning to her subject)
                        That's the only way we will
                        produce jobs, real jobs, jobs that
                        sustain.

            INT. HAIR SALON. LONDON. 1975. DAY
            MARGARET sitting under the dryer, cooking her new hair,
            still correcting paperwork while REECE and NEAVE look on,
            twiddling their thumbs.


            EXT. FACTORY. LONDON. 1975. DAY
            MARGARET is standing on an impromptu stage outside a
            factory. She has a hard hat on her head.
                                      MARGARET
                        The Trade Union Movement was
                        founded to protect workers. Now it
                        persecutes them. It stops them
                        from working. It is killing jobs
                        and it is bringing this country to
                        its knees. I say enough. It's time
                        to get up. It's time to go to
                        work. It's time to put the Great
                        back into Great Britain!


            INT. HAIR SALON. 1975. DAY
            The bouffant is now apparent. REECE AND NEAVE watch in
            awe.

            INT. BACKSTAGE. CONFERENCE HALL. BRIGHTON. 1979. DAY
            A darkened backstage. MARGARET, clutching her speech,
            goes over her lines. A FEMALE AIDE sprays her hair.

            She looks up, starts to move towards the light.

                                                                        48

            AIREY NEAVE is suddenly next to her.
                                    NEAVE
                      Give `em hell!
            He looks her up and down, with a smile.
                                    NEAVE (CONT'D)
                      You look magnificent. Next stop
                      Prime Minister.

                                    MARGARET
                      Oh Airey...

            As from the stage -

                                    ANNOUNCER
                      The leader of the Conservative
                      Party, Margaret Thatcher!
            MARGARET pushes back her shoulders and walks into battle
            to the sound of GROWING APPLAUSE.

            INT. MAIN HALL. CONFERENCE HALL. BRIGHTON. 1979. DAY
            BRITAIN NEEDS THE CONSERVATIVES bannered overhead and
            hung with Union Jacks. MARGARET a swathe of blue, as she
            passes through her GREY SUITED CABINET.
            From behind she stands, arms outstretched, accepting the
            applause, a shock of bright blonde hair as she stands
            before a sea of CONSERVATIVE DELEGATES holding up letter
            cards WE LOVE YOU MAGGIE!

            Wedges of fanatical party faithful on their feet in a
            kind of rapture. The blessed Margaret !
            DENIS just visible with REECE, HOWE, PYM, HESELTINE and
            several other GREY SUITED MINISTERS of her cabinet,
            seated close behind now jumping to their feet, with
            obvious relief and delight -
            RAPTUROUS APPLAUSE, FLASH BULBS POPPING
            MARGARET smiles, glorious, catching DENIS' eye. He is
            brimming with pride. AIREY NEAVE beams at his protegee.


            INT. CORRIDOR. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DAY.
            Close on a photograph of MARGARET and AIREY NEAVE.
            MARGARET sits looking at it, her coat on, her handbag on
            her lap.

                                                                        49

            INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK. HOUSE OF COMMONS. 1979. EVE.

            MARGARET is loading papers and files into the boot of her
            car. AIREY NEAVE drives towards her, winding down his
            window.

                                    NEAVE
                      Good night Margaret. My money's on
                      the filly to win!

                                    MARGARET
                      Oh, thanks Airey. Goodnight.

            He laughs and drives towards the exit of the car park.

            As MARGARET closes the boot and opens the door to get in
            the car suddenly there's a MASSIVE EXPLOSION, the sound
            magnified by being in the cavernous underground.

            For a few seconds we don't know what's happened.

            Through the smoke we see MARGARET running up the ramp
            towards us.

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      No. No, no! Airey!

            Her POV of the fireball of Neave's car. As Margaret looks
            in horror at the scene. Her shattered face.

                      The Irish National Liberation Army

                      Thatcher's spokesman on Northern
                      Ireland.


            INT. CONFERENCE HALL. NIGHT.

            MARGARET on the conference podium, blinking back tears.
            Behind her, Denis' face etched with the same sorrow.


            INT. STEPS. HOUSE OF COMMONS. DAY

            MARGARET walks alone down the grand stairway, sombre,
            deep in thought.


            INT. CORRIDOR. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DAY.

            MARGARET looks up from the photograph, tears in her eyes.

                                    AIREY NEAVE (V.O.)
                      If you want to change the party,
                      lead it.

                                    AIREY NEAVE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                      If you want to change the country,
                      lead it. You've got it in you to
                      go the whole distance!

            On MARGARET as memories flood in. A TV headline
            announces: ELECTION 1979.


            INT. CONFERENCE HALL. NIGHT

            MARGARET on the podium.

                                    MARGARET
                      Now, as the test draws near, I ask
                      your help. That together we can
                      shake off the shackles of
                      socialism and restore to greatness
                      this country that we love so much.
                      And the only way is for the
                      Conservative Party to win!

            The black streak of MARGARET'S car, a blur of colour,
            faces, waving flags -

            TV footage of polling night. Swingometers, pollsters,
            impressionistic snatches of reported speech.

            More footage of PEOPLE coming out of polling stations.

            Jubilant crowds applauding..

            MARGARET, silhouetted in her iconic stance, arms aloft...


            INT. CAR. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1979. DAY.

            MARGARET peering out of the window, hands sunk in the
            lap, a flash of the Royal blue fabric of her skirt,
            clenched in fingers.

                      Number 10 Downing Street.

            NOISE. FLAGS. BANNERS read `We LOVE YOU MAGGIE' blur
            through the window, an abstract cacophony of noise and
            colour-

                                    DENIS
                      This is it, steady the buffs old
                      girl.

            He clasps her hand for a moment as MARGARET smiles at
            him.

            The door swings open-


            EXT. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1979. DAY.

            The CAMERA from behind on MARGARET rising up out of the
            car, to face a waiting PRESS CORP. The jostle of a POLICE
            OFFICER, DENIS and OTHERS press her either side-

                                    MARGARET
                      I should just like to say that I
                      take very seriously the trust the
                      British people placed in me today,
                      and I will work hard every day to
                      live up to that responsibility.
                      And now, I should like to share
                      with you a prayer of St Francis of
                      Assisi: Where there is discord may
                      we bring harmony... Where there is
                      error may we bring truth... Where
                      there is doubt may we bring
                      faith... Where there is despair
                      may we bring hope..

            The CAMERA rises up, high above MARGARET until she is
            just a blue dot, on the dark tarmac, a lone woman
            standing facing the circle of cameras and microphones.

            The door of Number 10 looms ahead.


            INT. DRAWING ROOM. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1979. DAY.

            The cheers go over ..

            The CABINET gathering for a group shot-

                                    MARGARET
                      Shoulders back, tummies in!

            Laughter. Michael Heseltine, standing behind MARGARET,
            reaches out to smooth a stray lock of her hair.

                                                                        52

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      Oh. Thank you, Michael.

            MARGARET seated at the heart of her entire CABINET, as if
            she is royalty.

            The FLASH of the CAMERA - the image frozen.


            INT. CORRIDOR. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DAY.

            The same image, framed on a side table beside MARGARET.
            The distant hum of a hoover.

                                    MARGARET
                      I'm perfectly healthy. There's no
                      need for any of this.

            Denis appears, his hand inside his shoe, polishing it
            vigorously.

                                    DENIS
                      Just let them look under the
                      bonnet, MT. Check everything is
                      hunky dory.

            MARGARET hesitates. She sits in silence until-

                                    MARGARET
                      Really it's becoming quite
                      tiresome.

                                    DENIS
                      What is?

                                    MARGARET
                      You.
                           (beat)
                      I was on my own for twenty four
                      years before I met you and I can
                      manage perfectly well without you
                      now. So will you please go away
                      and stop bothering me.



            INT. CONSULTING ROOM. HARLEY STREET. LONDON. PRESENT.DAY
            A distinguished consulting room-
            MARGARET sits silent, as an EMINENT DOCTOR checks her
            blood pressure. The beep of the machine, steady and
            monotonous until-
                                    DOCTOR
                      Just look straight at me, straight
                      ahead, that's it.

                                                                        53

            The DOCTOR scribbles some notes, considering-
                                    DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                      Are you noticing night sweats?

                                    MARGARET
                      No

                                    DOCTOR
                      Hallucinations?
            MARGARET hesitates. She shakes her head.
                                    MARGARET
                      No.
                                    DOCTOR
                      Sleep?
                                    MARGARET
                      Yes, I sleep. Four, five hours a
                      night.
                                    DOCTOR
                      So you wake early?
                                    MARGARET
                      And I stay up late. I always have.
            She looks at him as if he really should know this about
            her. The DOCTOR notes this down.
                                    DOCTOR
                      We just want to keep abreast of
                      it.
                                    MARGARET
                      Yes. Of course.
                                    DOCTOR
                      Grief is a very natural state.
                                    MARGARET
                      My husband has been gone for
                      years. Cancer.
                                    DOCTOR
                      Carol says you've decided to let
                      his things go. Probably a good
                      thing.
                                    MARGARET
                      Yes. It was my idea. To Oxfam.
                      Perfectly good stuff. People can
                      use these things.

                                                                        54

                                    DOCTOR
                      Still it must be a bit
                      disorientating. You are bound to
                      be feeling.
                                    MARGARET
                      What? What am I `bound to be
                      feeling'?
            The DOCTOR looks up from his note taking, hearing the
            quiet challenge in MARGARET's voice.
                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      People don't `think' any more.
                      They `feel'. `How are you
                      feeling?' `Oh I don't feel
                      comfortable with that' `Oh, I'm so
                      sorry but we, the group were
                      feeling...' D'you know, one of the
                      great problems of our age is that
                      we are governed by people who care
                      more about feelings than thoughts
                      and ideas.
                           (beat)
                      Now thoughts and ideas. That
                      interests me.
                           (beat)
                      Ask me what I am thinking-
            The DOCTOR hesitates, letting MARGARET settle until-
                                    DOCTOR
                      What are you thinking, Margaret?
            MARGARET looks at the DOCTOR, quietly struggling with a
            fury, threatening to unleash-
                                    MARGARET
                      Watch your thoughts, for they
                      become words. Watch your words,
                      for they become actions. Watch
                      your actions, for they become
                      habits. Watch your habits, for
                      they become your character. And
                      watch your character, for it
                      becomes your destiny. What we
                      think, we become. My father always
                      said that.
                           (beat)
                      And I think I am fine.
                           (beat)
                      But I do so appreciate your kind
                      concern.
            The sudden and persistent buzz of an intercom-
                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      Oh, do please answer that.

                                                                        55

            MARGARET holds his gaze, with quiet unwavering steel
            unsettling the DOCTOR a little.
                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      It might be someone who needs you.
            The DOCTOR reluctantly answers his intercom-

            INT. CORRIDOR CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DUSK.
            JUNE heads up the stairs, MARGARET following behind.
                                    JUNE
                      I'll give Carol a quick ring, let
                      her know we're back, then I'll put
                      your electric blanket on.

            MARGARET nods. Looking through the bannisters, her eyes
            fall on-
            A golf ball running along the floor. MARGARET considers,
            looks up-

                                    DENNIS OOV
                      Steady, steady, steady! Damn.
                      Fore!

            The ball bounces down the wooden stairs.


            INT. KITCHEN. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DUSK.
            MARGARET opens the fridge. A cold plated lunch resting on
            a shelf.
                                    DENIS
                      What about that medicine man, eh?
                      Ah. Cold supper. Standards are
                      slipping Margaret.
            MARGARET ignores DENIS taking out the plate unwrapping
            the cellophane off it and placing it on a table, already
            laid ready for her to eat.
                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
                      Well you really gave it to that
                      quack didn't you, darling ? Just
                      like the old days! Hallucinations
                      my eye!
            DENIS picks up a piece of cucumber from her plate. She
            absently smacks at his hand.
                                     DENIS (CONT'D)
                      How dare he?
            DENIS smiles.

                                                                        56

                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
                      But then you give us all the run
                      around, don't you?
            MARGARET looks at him, silently infuriated.

            INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DUSK.
            MARGARET pours herself a whiskey. DENIS looms close,
            serves a splash of soda.
                                    DENIS
                      I know you can hear me,
                      sweetheart, so there's no use
                      pretending you can't.
            MARGARET turns, ignoring him.

                                    MARGARET
                      Enough. Denis, enough!

                                   DENIS
                           (saluting)
                      Dismissed!

            INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DUSK.
            MARGARET sits reading DENIS' spy novel.
                                    DENIS
                      She does it in the end. Kills him-
            MARGARET slams the book closed.
                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
                      I don't know why you're being so
                      scratchy.
            MARGARET's eyes dart to the clock.
                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
                      It's not as if you've got anyone
                      else to talk to.

            Shaking her head, MARGARET tries to block him out.

                                    MARGARET (V.O.)
                      When the Himalayan peasant meets
                      the he-bear in his pride -

                                                                        57

                                    DENIS
                      You know, it's a marvel to me that
                      you can still quote huge chunks of
                      Kipling but try remembering the
                      name of that woman who's just made
                      you that godawful cold
                      collation... No? Come on... you
                      can do it... month of the year...
                      one syllable... rhymes with moon
                      ...
                                      MARGARET
                              (sudden/like a
                               lightbulb)
                      June.
            MARGARET turns to DENIS, a quiet appalling victory.
                                    DENIS
                      June! Bingo. Knew you'd get there
                      in the end. "When the Himalayan
                      peasant meets the he-bear in his
                      pride, He shouts to scare the
                      monster, who will often turn
                      aside, but the she-bear thus
                      accosted rends the peasant tooth
                      and nail. For the female of the
                      species is more deadly than the
                      male..."
            As he continues, MARGARET reaches for the remote, turns
            the television on. She moves onto the radio. Then the
            stereo. She moves on, talking to herself-
            A gradual growing cacophony of sound-

            INT. KITCHEN. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DUSK.
            MARGARET flicks on mixers, radios, toasters-

            INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DUSK.
            The noise almost unbearable now-
            MARGARET turns on a hi-fi, the TV now on-

                                    MARGARET
                      If I can't hear you then I can't
                      see you. And if I can't see you
                      then you are not here.
            MARGARET closes her eyes.

                                                                        58

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      And if you are not here, I am not
                      going mad. I will not...I will not
                      go mad.
            She opens them and suddenly freezes on seeing an image of
            herself, bewildered and leaving Harley Street, caught on
            the TV-
                                    BBC VOICEOVER
                      Baroness Thatcher made an
                      apparently routine visit to her
                      doctor today. Although rarely
                      seen in public, Lady Thatcher, the
                      longest serving Prime Minister of
                      the twentieth century, remains a
                      controversial figure.
            MARGARET turns up the volume to full, trying to hear over
            the cacophony of noise the changing images on the TV
            illuminating her pale face.
                                    JUNE
                      Margaret-

            MARGARET barely sees her, eyes riveted to the TV.

                                    BBC VOICE OVER
                      Almost lovingly dubbed by the
                      Soviets The Iron Lady, she's also
                      credited, with her friend Ronald
                      Reagan, with a decisive role in
                      the ending of the Cold War. Her
                      supporters claim she transformed
                      the British economy and reversed
                      the country's post-war decline.
                      Her detractors blame her savage
                      public spending cuts and sweeping
                      privatization of -
            JUNE moves like a dervish through the house, muting the
            television and turning off the last of the appliances-
            A gradual silence descends until-
            MARGARET takes in the image of herself on the mute
            screen, standing bewildered on the steps of Harley
            Street.
                                    MARGARET
                           (almost to self)
                      I don't recognize myself.

                                                                        59

            INT. BATHROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. NIGHT.

            The shelf of a bathroom cabinet. Shaving brush. Razor.
            Medicaments. MARGARET begins to pull them all off the
            shelves.

                                     DENIS (O.S.)
                       Am I out of the doghouse yet?

            Then a pair of glasses. More gently, MARGARET'S hand
            reaches into the cupboard and takes the glasses in her
            hand.


            INT. BEDROOM. HOUSE.CHESTER SQUARE.PRESENT.NIGHT.
            MARGARET lies in bed, book in her lap, DENIS beside her
            reading the paper. She closes the book and pulls off her
            reading glasses.
                                     MARGARET
                       They're unveiling that portrait of
                       me at Number 10 next month. The
                       invitation's on the mantelpiece.
                       So there'll be Churchill, Lloyd
                       George and me. Just the three of
                       us.
            SILENCE-
                                     MARGARET (CONT'D)
                       I said I didn't want any big fuss
                       but they insisted..

            SILENCE-

                       Telegraph... The Woman Who Changed
                       the Face of History..
            SILENCE-

            Voices from the past intrude -

                                     FOOT VO
                       Less than two years ago, the Prime
                       Minister quoted St. Francis and
                       talked about bringing faith, hope
                       and harmony to this country.
            MARGARET suddenly reaches out a hand, her hand shaking-
                                    MARGARET
                       Denis?
            She turns in bed. Sudden panic, DENIS is gone-

                                                                        60

            A HECKLING CHAMBER RISING THROUGH-


            INT. CHAMBERS. HOUSE OF COMMONS. 1980. DAY.

            A HECKLING chamber as MARGARET sits, facing LABOUR
            OUTRAGE, the labour leader, FOOT, grips his paper, mid
            speech-

                                    FOOT
                      Can the Right Honourable Lady
                      deny, that having brought about
                      the highest level of unemployment
                      since 1934-

            MARGARET bides her time on the front bench, waiting her
            turn, surrounded by her CABINET MINISTERS including HOWE,
            PYM and HESELTINE-

                                    FOOT (CONT'D)
                      The biggest fall in total output
                      in steel and coal production in
                      one year since 1931. And the
                      biggest collapse in industrial
                      production since 1921.

            MARGARET remains seemingly calm and serene, and yet one
            hand quietly grips the bench, her wedding ring tapping
            against the wood nervously.

                                    FOOT (CONT'D)
                      Can she also accept that her free
                      market economics designed to
                      create a growing middle class
                      ensures that the rich get richer
                      and the poor are irrelevant!


            INT. CAR. STREETS. LONDON. 1980. DAY

            A rising roar of voices -

                                    PROTESTORS
                      Maggie Maggie Maggie! Out Out Out!
                      Maggie Maggie Maggie! Out Out Out!

            MARGARET in her car driving through the blur of furious
            PROTESTORS.

                                    PROTESTOR 1
                      You're supposed to be a mother!
                      You're not a mother, you're s
                      monster! You're a monster!

                                                                        61

            INT. DRAWING ROOM. DOWNING STREET. 1980. EVENING.

            CLOSE UP on a button -

            The STEADY IN and OUT of a needle pulling taut on a
            thread. MARGARET stands, swathed in a glittering long
            dinner dress, a SEAMSTRESS stitching a stray button on
            the front of the bodice on her dress.

            Geoffrey Howe stands nearby in a dinner jacket.

                                    HESELTINE
                      May we have a word, Prime
                      Minister?

            A bank of MINISTERS, including HESELTINE, PYM, PRIOR,
            HOWE and GILMOUR, gather before her.

                                    MARGARET
                      Yes, but in order to arrive at the
                      palace on time, Geoffrey and I are
                      will be walking out of that door
                      in 15 minutes. As you can see -

                                    HESELTINE
                      I know you're running late
                      Margaret, but we have to address
                      this situation in light of
                      tomorrow's blistering press
                      coverage. Blistering! The knives
                      are out. Your draft budget's been
                      leaked, Geoffrey, they are baying
                      for our blood!

                                    HOWE
                      Michael we can't possibly buckle
                      at the first sign of difficulty.

            The SCRATCH of PRIOR's hand on unkempt hair-

                                    HESELTINE
                      No one is saying we have to
                      buckle.

                                    PRIOR
                      But is this really the time to
                      make these spending cuts in the
                      middle of one of the deepest
                      recessions this country has ever
                      experienced?

                                    HESTLETINE
                      We need a plan of action,
                      Margaret.

                                    PYM
                      Absolutely. A strategy.

                                                                        62

                                    GILMOUR
                      We must be armed.

                                       PRIOR
                      Agreed.

            MARGARET stiffens, the needle momentarily hovering mid
            stitch as MARGARET shifts a little-

            The SEAMSTRESS resumes sewing-

                                    PRIOR (CONT'D)
                      There's a perception, Margaret
                      rightly or wrongly, that we are
                      now completely out of touch with
                      the country.

            The patronizing tone inflames her.

                                    MARGARET
                      Really.
                           (beat)
                      How much is a pack of Lurpak?

                                       PYM
                      Lurpak?

                                    MARGARET
                      Butter, Francis.
                           (silence)
                      Forty two pence. Anchor butter is
                      forty pence. Flora margarine,
                      still the cheapest, is thirty
                      eight pence. I can assure you I am
                      not out of touch.

            Another MINISTER - GILMOUR - whispers the words:
            "Grocer's Daughter" - as a put down. The men smirk.

            MARGARET has caught the moment. A sudden flash of the
            pretty girls in the Grantham Street long ago, laughing at
            her.

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      What - did you say?

            GILMOUR makes a gesture.

                                    GILMOUR
                      Nothing. Nothing, Prime Minister.

            MARGARET is furious.

                                                                        63

                                    MARGARET
                      Don't try to hide you opinions.
                      Goodness me, I'd much rather you
                      were honest and straightforward
                      about them - instead of
                      continuously and damagingly
                      leaking them to the press. Well?

            MOMENTARILY SILENT-

            MARGARET's eyes travel around the room in waiting-

                                    PYM
                      Well, people can't pay their
                      mortgages.

                                    GILMOUR
                      The manufacturing industry is
                      practically on its knees.

                                    PYM
                      Honest, hard-working, decent
                      people are losing their homes.
                      It's terribly shameful.

                                    GILMOUR
                      The point is, Prime Minister, that
                      we must moderate the pace -

                                    HESELTINE
                      - if we're even to have a hope of
                      winning the next election-

                                     PYM
                      Quite right.

                                    MARGARET
                      Ah. Worried about our careers, are
                      we?

            They make noises - to the effect that nothing could be
            further from the truth.

            But MARGARET has their measure.

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      Gentlemen, if we don't cut
                      spending we will be bankrupt. Yes
                      the medicine is harsh but the
                      patient requires it in order to
                      live. Shall we withhold the
                      medicine? No! We are not wrong. We
                      did not seek election and win in
                      order to manage the decline of a
                      great nation.
                                    (MORE)

                                                                        64
                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      The people of this country chose
                      us because they believe we can
                      restore the health of the British
                      economy and we will do just that!
                      Barring a failure of nerve.

            The SNAP OF COTTON -

            MARGARET looks at them in a cold fury...

                                     MARGARET (CONT'D)
                       Anything else?

            SILENCE-

            MARGARET nods to the seamstress, dismissing her-

                                     MARGARET (CONT'D)
                       Thank you. You saved the day once
                       again, Crawfie, you're an angel.

            MARGARET straightens her cuff, testing the button, as the
            meeting slowly disbands and the MINISTERS move away.

                                     HOWE
                       You can't close down a discussion
                       because it's not what you wish to
                       hear.

                                     MARGARET
                       I don't expect everyone just to
                       sit there and agree with me. But
                       what kind of leader am I if I
                       don't try to get my own way - to
                       do what I know to be right.

                                     HOWE
                       Yes. But Margaret, one must be
                       careful of testing one's
                       colleagues' loyalty too far.

            MARGARET glances up watching the MINISTERS disappearing,
            in whispered conversation, like conspirators.

            PRIOR and OTHERS. MARGARET talking, they hang on her
            every word.

                                    MARGARET
                      But we shall never give in to
                      them. We shall never waver, not
                      for a second, in our determination
                      to see this country prosper once
                      again.

            The party faithful erupt in cheers, seconded by all
            Margaret's courtiers on the platform. PYM, PRIOR,
            HESELTINE, HOWE and above all DENIS, applauding as if
            their lives depended on it.


            INT. LADIES. HOUSE OF COMMONS. 1980. DAY.

            MARGARET sits clutching the sink, a light sweat breaking
            across her forehead. She looks up-

                                    NEWS READER (V.O.)
                      A car bomb has exploded outside
                      Harrods department store, killing
                      six people and injuring 71.

            Margaret on the podium.

                                    MARGARET
                      And now, it must be business as
                      usual.

            THE BRIGHTON GRAND HOTEL.


            INT. SITTING ROOM. SUITE. GRAND HOTEL. 1984. NIGHT.
            DENIS in pyjamas, brushes his teeth in the bathroom. He
            glances at MARGARET through the open door as she sits,
            still in evening dress, working on her speech.

                                    DENIS
                      Come on love, get to bed. I don't
                      know why you do this to yourself
                      every year, it's a speech at
                      conference, not the Magna Carta!

            She looks up, distracted.

                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
                      Time to call it a day, darling.
                      It's ten to three, for God's sake.

                                    MARGARET
                      I know, I'm coming DT. Nearly
                      there -

            BOOM!

                                                                        67

            An almighty explosion rips through the room; wood, glass,
            furniture splinters, curtains flay from the walls. The
            fall of plaster, devastating, the hotel room obliterated,
            reduced to a smoking, dusty rubble.

            MARGARET stands ghostlike, covered in debris.

                                   MARGARET (CONT'D)
                           (calling out)
                      Denis!

            MARGARET searching through the haze of fallen plaster,
            covered with dust, slowly clearing to reveal-

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                           (more desperate)
                      Denis- there you are. Are you
                      alright?

            DENIS ghostlike, covered in dust, still in his pyjamas,
            holding up an obliterated pair of shoes.

                                    DENIS
                      My shoes!

            Beyond, the wall of the bathroom entirely blown away -

            The CAW of gulls-

            Chaos outside the Grand Hotel in the aftermath of the

            The WHIR of SIRENS-

            DENIS and MARGARET sit in their car, looking out in
            silent shock at the devastated Grand hotel, reflected on
            the glass of the car windows.

                                    MARGARET (V.O.)
                      That's when I thought I'd lost
                      you.

            A TELEPHONE RINGS CUTTING THROUGH FROM ANOTHER TIME...


            INT. BEDROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. NIGHT.

            MARGARET wakes with a start, confused and fumbles for the
            telephone by her bed-

                                    MARGARET
                           (picking up phone)
                      Mark?... Hello darling... No, I'm
                      fine... I'm very well...

                                                                        68

            MARGARET squints, fingers fumbling for DENIS' watch.

                                     MARGARET (CONT'D)
                       How is... How's... Sarah?... And
                       the children..?

            MARGARET sits up -

                                     MARGARET (CONT'D)
                       ...Oh... You can't... That's a
                       pity... I was hoping to see you...
                       No really darling... That's
                       fine... Of course... another
                       time... Lovely Darling... Can't
                       wait...Yes...

            MARGARET suddenly relents, a flicker of sudden and urgent
            need, caught in her eyes-

                                        MARGARET (CONT'D)
                               (beat)
                       Mark?

            Silence-

            MARK gone. MARGARET hangs up, stares at-

            I Whistle A Happy Tune from the King and I just audible-


            INT. DRAWING ROOM.CHESTER SQUARE.PRESENT.NIGHT.

            MARGARET stands in the doorway, a jaunty "I Whistle A
            Happy Tune" seeping from the television.

                                     MARGARET
                       That was Mark. Not able to come.

                                     DENIS
                            (cutting in)
                       Boy's always going AWOL.

                                     MARGARET
                       Well it costs him a great deal to
                       fly everyone up here.

                                     DENIS
                       There you go, making excuses for
                       him. Now look where it's got you.

            DENIS stands dressed in dinner jacket and bow tie as he
            reads the back of "The King and I" DVD.

                                     DENIS (CONT'D)
                       Did you know Yul Brynner was a
                       gypsy from Vladivostok?

                                                                        69

                      Yes. He moved to Paris when he was
                      fourteen. He played the King of
                      Siam 4,625 times on the London and
                      Broadway stages. What are you
                      doing?

                                    DENIS
                           (turning round
                            shaking a cocktail)
                      One likes to make an effort. A
                      snifter?

                                    MARGARET
                      You're dead, Denis.

                                    DENIS
                      Ah. Well, if I'm dead... who are
                      you talking to? Shall we dance ?

            He takes Margaret in his arms. The music changes to
            `Shall we Dance' from `The King and I' as DENIS takes a
            confused MARGARET in his arms and begins an expansive
            waltz round the room. The room turns. YOUNG DENIS dancing
            with the YOUNG MARGARET. Now its OLD DENIS dancing with
            OLD MARGARET again. DENIS loses his footing, and MARGARET
            lurches towards the desk where her eyes fall on figurines
            of Falklands soldiers. She stares hard.

                      The Falkland islands, the British
                      Colony in the South Atlantic, has
                      fallen. Argentina claims its
                      marines went ashore this morning
                      as a spearhead to capture key
                      targets, including the capital,

            MARGARET sits, composed, staring up at a phalanx of
            military men and her ministers.

                                    MARGARET
                      Gentlemen, the Argentinian Junta -
                      which is a fascist gang - has
                      invaded our sovereign territory.
                      This cannot be tolerated. May I
                      make plain my negotiating
                      position. I will not negotiate
                      with criminals or thugs. The
                      Falkland islands belong to
                      Britain, and I want them back.
                      Gentlemen, I need you to tell me
                      today if that is possible.

                                                                        70

                                    ADMIRAL LEACH
                      Possible... just, Prime Minister.
                      We can have a Task Force ready to
                      sail in forty-eight hours.

            MARGARET is visibly stunned.

                                    MARGARET
                      Forty-eight hours?

                      But -

                                    MARGARET
                      But?

                                    ADMIRAL LEACH
                      We have a very narrow weather
                      window. We can't fight in winter
                      down there. Nobody can. If we are
                      going, we have to go now.

                                    MARGARET
                      Why were the islands left without
                      any naval protection?

                                    JOHN NOTT
                      In the last round of Defence cuts
                      we judged the risk of invasion to
                      be small.

                                    MARGARET
                      Did we?

                                    JOHN NOTT
                      And if you remember, Prime
                      Minister, you agreed that we
                      should reduce the naval presence
                      in the area to an absolute
                      minimum.

            MARGARET taps her fingers against the map, with growing
            irritation.

                                    HOWE
                      Margaret, the cost of sending
                      28,000 men and a hundred ships
                      twelve thousand miles, almost to
                      Argentina, will be absolutely
                      crippling.

                                    MARGARET
                      I don't think we should be
                      worrying about money at this
                      point, Geoffrey.

                                    GEOFFREY HOWE
                      We can't afford to go to war.

                                    ADMIRAL LEACH (V.O.)
                      We have to go now.

                                    MARGARET (V.O.)
                      The government has now decided
                      that a large task force will sail,
                      as soon as all preparations are
                      complete.

            INTERCUT (ARCHIVE FOOTAGE) the Task Force sets sail.

            MARGARET paces, deep in thought.

                      Prime Minister we do still have
                      three weeks before our ships reach
                      the islands.

                                    MP 2 (O.S.)
                      All we're saying is that we
                      shouldn't give up on trying to
                      find a diplomatic solution.

            Haig and Margaret sit facing each other, flanked by
            senior ministers.

                                    GENERAL HAIG
                      So you are proposing to go to war
                      over these Islands. They're
                      thousands of miles away, a handful
                      of citizens, politically and
                      economically... insignificant, if
                      you'll excuse me -

                                    MARGARET
                      Just like Hawaii, I imagine.

                                    GENERAL HAIG
                      I'm sorry?

                                    MARGARET
                      1941, when Japan attacked Pearl
                      Harbour. Did America go cap in
                      hand and ask Tojo for a peaceful
                      negotiation of terms? Did she turn
                      her back on her own citizens there
                      because the islands were thousands
                      of miles from mainland United
                      States? No, no, no! We will stand
                      on principle or we shall not stand
                      at all.

                                    GENERAL HAIG
                      But Margaret with all due respect
                      when one has been to war....

                                    MARGARET
                      With all due respect sir, I have
                      done battle every single day of my
                      life, and many men have
                      underestimated me before. This lot
                      seem bound to do the same but they
                      will rue the day.

            BEAT

            MARGARET turns to a tea trolley close by-

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      Now, shall I be mother?

            HAGUE looks confused, MARGARET lifting the teapot-

                                                                        73

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      Tea, Al, how do you take your tea?
                      Black or white?

            NAVAL MEN murmuring messages quietly to NAVAL ATTACHES.
            Male lips to male ears, something MARGARET has seen all
            her life. FRANCIS PYM and JOHN NOTT stand near MARGARET.

            Argentinian flags. MARGARET stares at the map. A
            whispered message to one of the ATTACHES. He moves a
            model boat on the map a few inches, leading a fleet of
            smaller model boats.

                                    NAVAL ATTACHE 1
                      The Argentinian ship the General
                      Belgrano and her escorts are
                      pursuing course 273 degrees toward
                      the Argentinian mainland. We are
                      tracking it with our submarine HMS
                      Conqueror.

            He points to a model submarine at some distance from the
            Argentinian boats.

                                    MARGARET
                      Is this ship a threat?

                                    ADMIRAL FIELDHOUSE
                      Both of these ships are carrying
                      Exocet missiles, Prime Minister.
                      Just yesterday they launched- then
                      aborted- an attack inside the
                      exclusion zone. There is a risk
                      they could try it again.

                                    FRANCIS PYM
                      The Belgrano is sailing directly
                      away from the islands. Can it
                      really be regarded as a threat ?

                                    ADMIRAL FIELDHOUSE
                      She's been changing course
                      continually. There's a strong
                      possibility that they're
                      attempting a pincer movement on
                      our carrier group.
                                    (MORE)

                                                                        74
                                    ADMIRAL FIELDHOUSE (CONT'D)
                      I advise that we engage them: hit
                      the Belgrano as a warning to the
                      others. Send them all back to
                      port.

            MARGARET turns to JOHN NOTT and FRANCIS PYM.

                                       FRANCIS PYM
                         It'll play badly internationally.
                         We'll be seen as aggressors.

            She stares at the map once more. One of the men
            supervising the map moves the model of the Belgrano a
            fraction further North.

                                       JOHN NOTT
                         This will be an escalation, Prime
                         Minister.

            She looks to LEACH.

                                       LEACH
                         If there is to be an escalation,
                         it's better that we start it.

                                       MINISTER
                         It is steaming away, Prime
                         Minister.

            Everyone is staring at MARGARET. Even the ASSISTANTS
            bustling in the background have stopped and are
            listening. Male faces turned to her. She herself seems
            caught in a pincer movement between the politicians and
            the servicemen.

                                      MARGARET
                         Sink it.

                         Argentinian sailors died...

            MARGARET'S eyes shining, as if with tears. A soft
            knocking at the door. She dabs them away quickly.

                      willing to risk their aircraft,
                      they have enough missiles to

            Prime Minister's Questions. MARGARET is at the Dispatch
            Box fighting it out with MICHAEL FOOT. GEOFFREY HOWE IS
            BESIDE HER.

                                    MARGARET
                      We were faced with an act of
                      unprovoked aggression and we
                      responded as we have responded in
                      times past: with unity, strength
                      and courage, sure in the knowledge
                      that though much is sacrificed, in
                      the end, right will prevail over
                      wrong.

            Huge cheers and "hear hears" from the Conservative
            benches. MICHAEL FOOT shifts uncomfortably on the benches
            opposite. She is unstoppable.

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      And I put it to the Honourable
                      Member opposite that this is not a
                      day for him to carp, find fault,
                      demand inquiries- they will happen
                      I can assure him of that for we
                      have nothing to hide- no, this is
                      a day to put difference aside,
                      hold one's head high and take
                      pride in being British.

            Barnstorming cheers. We see MICHAEL FOOT, utterly
            outmaneuvered by her speech. The Labour benches sit
            silent.

                      The point is, Prime Minister, I
                      don't think we can sell the idea
                      of a tax that asks everyone to pay
                      the same.

                                    MARGARET (V.O.)
                      Our policies may be unpopular, but
                      they are the right policies.

                      Prime Minister I just don't think
                      we can ask the poorest of the poor
                      to pay the same amount of tax as a

                                    MINISTER 1
                       Because -

                                     MINISTER 2
                       Because people... on the whole...
                       think that the tax is manifestly
                       unfair.

                                     MARGARET
                       Nonsense. Arrant nonsense. This
                       is a simple proposition. In order
                       to live in this country, you must
                       pay for the privilege- something,
                       anything! If you pay nothing, you
                       care nothing. What do you care
                       where you throw your rubbish? Your
                       council estate is a mess, your
                       town, graffiti, what do you care?
                       It's not your problem , it's
                       somebody else's problem- it's the
                       government's problem! YOUR problem
                       is, some of you, is that you
                       haven't got the courage for this
                       fight. You haven't had to fight
                       hard for anything. It's all been
                       given to you- and you feel guilty
                       about it! Well, may I say, on
                       behalf of all those who HAVE had
                       to fight their way up, (and who
                       don't feel guilty about it) we
                       resent those slackers who take,
                       take, take, and contribute nothing
                       to the community!

            SILENCE.

                                     MARGARET (CONT'D)
                       And I see the same thing, the same
                       cowardice in our fight within the
                       European Union, to retain British
                       sovereignty of Britain, the
                       integrity of the pound! Some of
                       you want to make concessions. I
                       hear some of you agree with the
                       latest French proposals.
                            (beat)
                       Well, why don't you get on a boat
                       to Calais? Yes, why don't you put
                       on a beret, and pay 85% of your
                       income to the French government!

            She has subdued them utterly. The silence is terrible.

                                     MARGARET (CONT'D)
                       Right. What can we realistically
                       hope to achieve by the end of
                       session, Lord President?

                                                                        82
                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      And why have we not made more
                      progress to date? What is that? Is
                      that the timetable? I haven't seen
                      that. May I see it?

                                    HOWE
                      Here it is, Prime Minister. Of
                      course.

            HOWE pushes the papers over to her. She picks up a
            pencil, starts to read.

            The MINISTERS watch as, quickly, she starts to score
            through the words.

                                    MARGARET
                      The wording is sloppy here, and
                      here.

                                    HOWE
                      If you say so.

                                     MARGARET
                      I do say so.

                                    HOWE
                      It's merely a first draft...

            MARGARET looks down at the paperwork.

                                    MARGARET
                      This is ridiculous. There are two
                      "T's" in "committee"!

            She presses so hard that her pencil breaks, so she shoves
            the paper back towards him, stabbing a finger at the
            offending word.

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      This is shameful. Shameful! I
                      can't even rely on you for a
                      simple timetable! Are you unwell?
                      Yes you are unwell. Give me the
                      pencil, give it to me!

            MARGARET snaps her fingers at HOWE, gesturing for his
            pencil, scratching away, ringing the offending word again
            and again. The MINISTERS stare at the scene appalled,
            utterly and wretchedly embarrassed.

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      If this is the best you can do I
                      had better send you to hospital,
                      and I shall do your job as well as
                      my own and everyone else's.
                      Gentlemen.

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      As the Lord President has come to
                      cabinet unprepared, I am obliged
                      to close this meeting.

            She waits for them to take their leave, but they sit
            there, frozen.

                                      MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      Good morning!

            Slowly, the men gather their papers and file out of the
            room, leaving MARGARET alone. She sits, gathering
            herself, hands shaking.

            THE ROAR OF PROTEST SURGES THROUGH -

            (ARCHIVE FOOTAGE) A HUGE MACABRE PAPIER-MACHE THATCHER
            HEAD, grimacing with one eyeball blinded and the other
            detached and hanging bloody on a cheek.

            INT. CAR. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1990. DAY.

            MARGARET peering out-

            ANGRY PROTESTORS slapping the glass as they pass, the
            sense of the car being attacked. The smear of smashed egg
            against the window screen.

                                    PROTESTORS
                      Out... Out... Out...

            MARGARET sinks back into her seat as the car, is jostled
            either side by a blur of colour, the bang of fists
            against glass, the roar of the crowd -


            EXT. TRAFALGAR SQUARE. LONDON. 1990. DAY

            (ARCHIVE FOOTAGE) Relentless images of violence over

            RIOTERS with blood streaming down their faces. Banners -

            With a WHOOSH of flames the north side of Piccadilly
            Circus goes up in flames. Smoke and blood and fire
            everywhere.


            INT. OFFICE DOWNING STREET. 1990. DAY
            Late afternoon-

            MARGARET sits, silently working.
            HOWE enters, MARGARET barely looks up from working-

                                    MARGARET
                      Geoffrey-
                                    GEOFFREY
                      My letter of resignation.
            HOWE slides a letter down on her desk-
            MARGARET looks down at the thick envelope.
            SILENCE

                                    GEOFFREY HOWE
                      Our differences, I'm afraid,
                      cannot be reconciled.
            MARGARET resumes working-
            HOWE waits and waits and waits-
            The SCRATCH of MARGARET's pen, she works on, refusing to
            stop for him.


            INT. CHAMBERS. HOUSE OF COMMONS. LONDON.
            Howe stands in Parliament, reading his resignation
            speech:

                                    HOWE
                      I have done what I believe to be
                      right for my party and my country.
                      The time has come for others to
                      consider their own response to the
                      tragic conflict of loyalties with
                      which I have myself wrestled for
                      perhaps too long.

                                                                        85

            INT. HALLWAYS. HOUSE OF COMMONS. LONDON.

            MARGARET walks alone down the hall.

                                    MINISTER 1 (O.S.)
                      Geoffrey's speech in the House of
                      Commons was devastating.

                                    MINSTER 2 (O.S.)
                      - just couldn't take any more of
                      the bullying.



            INT. CORRIDOR - HOUSE OF COMMONS. LONDON. 1990. DAY.

            MARGARET's POV as she moves along the corridors of power.

                                    MINISTER 3 (O.S.)
                      He was almost inviting someone to
                      challenge her for leadership of
                      the party.

            Fellow CABINET MINISTERS, unfamiliar backbenchers, the
            men in suits, all seem to avoid her gaze...then PYM in
            conversation with HOWE, abruptly terminated, as both men
            acknowledge her...

                                    MINISTER 4 (O.S.)
                      She behaved appallingly. I
                      wouldn't have spoken to my
                      gamekeeper like that.

                                    MINISTER 1 (O.S.)
                      I don't think she can survive
                      this.


            INT. STUDY. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1990. NIGHT.
            MARGARET stands, watching the evening news, HESELTINE
            just visible on the TV screen-
                                    HESELTINE ON TV
                      I'm here to announce my decision
                      to put my name forward as leader
                      of the Conservative party. I have
                      nothing but admiration for our
                      Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher,
                      but I believe our party and our
                      country need a new leader.
            MARGARET turns to DENIS, who stands, clearly shocked,
            worst fears confirmed.

                                                                        86

                                       TV JOURNALIST
                         It's extraordinary. The rules of
                         the Conservative Party make it
                         possible for Conservative MP's to
                         depose a sitting Prime Minister.

            MARGARET and DENIS on the sofa. She unwraps a sweet, eyes
            locked on the TV.

                                       MARGARET
                         I am the Prime Minister.

            Turning to Denis.

                                      MARGARET (CONT'D)
                              (offering the packet)

                         As Conservative MP's gather in
                         Westminster to discus who they
                         will back in the leadership
                         contest, the Prime Minister said
                         she would not be diverted from
                         critical international affairs


            EXT. PARIS STREET. NIGHT

            With the Eiffel Tower illuminated behind him, Trevor
            MacDonald makes his report.

                                       TREVOR MACDONALD
                         Tonight in Paris Mrs Thatcher is
                         among thirty four world leaders
                         who came together to celebrate the
                         end of the Cold War and herald the
                         start of a peaceful new age of
                         East/West cooperation.


            INT. GRAND HALL. PARIS. NIGHT.

            A magnificent painted hallway-

            MARGARET sweeping away from a dining room, regal in
            evening dress.

            INTERCUT -

            PARIS - A news journalist makes his report.

                                                                        87

                                    NEWS JOURNALIST
                      There's a general feeling that Mrs
                      Thatcher is going to win on the
                      first ballot. We're going to put
                      it to bed tomorrow night, is how
                      one of her campaign staff puts it.


            INT. GRAND HALL. PARIS. NIGHT

            MARGARET walks through a grand hall with her fellow
            PRESIDENTS and PRIME MINSTERS of the world, a lone woman
            amongst a sea of men.

                                    DENIS ON PHONE
                      M, I really think you should come
                      home and defend yourself old girl.
                      Heseltine is campaigning
                      ferociously.

                                    MARGARET ON PHONE OOV
                      I do think my time is best spent
                      seeing an end to the Cold War,
                      don't you? After all this time
                      they know what I stand for.

            PARIS -

                                    TREVOR MACDONALD
                      Will she, or will she not, be in
                      the job tomorrow?

            A GRAND HALL - a formal dinner, MARGARET flanked by bow-
            tied Prime Ministers and Heads of State.

                                    HEAD OF STATE 1
                      Margaret, they can't touch you.

            LONDON STREETS - CABINET MINISTERS walking along trying
            to hide their features from prying eyes.

                                    NEWS READER (O.S.)
                      Mrs Thatcher has failed to win
                      enough votes to secure an outright
                      win in the leadership contest and
                      must now decide whether to put her
                      name forward for the second round.

                      As Mrs Thatcher leaves Paris for
                      London to make a last ditch
                      attempt to pull together support
                      for her leadership, the ship may
                      have sailed.

                                                                        88

            MARGARET pushes through the double doors into her dining
            room.

                                    MARGARET
                      Treachery!

            Her cabinet are all around her dining room table. There
            is no seat for her. She moves round the table.

                                    MINISTER 1
                      We will never win another election
                      led by that woman.

                                    MINISTER 2
                      We need a leader who listens.

                                    MINISTER 3
                      This isn't about her, it's about
                      the party.

                                    MINISTER 4
                      One must know when to go.

                                    MINISTER 1
                      The question is, how does anyone
                      put it to her?


            INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.

            Close on a minister's face in the dim light.

                                    MINISTER
                      If you were to stand, I of course
                      would vote for you Prime Minister
                      -

            She is at her desk in the PRESENT in Chester Square as
            one minister after another in interchangeable glasses
            slide into the chair in front of her.

                                    MINISTER 2
                      - of course would vote for you
                      Prime Minister but I don't think
                      you can win. The loyalty of my
                      colleagues cannot be counted upon.

                                    MARGARET
                      It was the people who put me here -

                                    MINISTER 3
                      The loyalty of my colleagues
                      cannot be counted upon.

                                                                        89

                                    MARGARET
                      - it's up to them to tell me when
                      to go.


            INT. STUDY. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1990. NIGHT.

            MARGARET stands, watching the evening news.
                                    DENIS
                      Margaret, you can't let them do
                      this to you. Please, boss.
            MARGARET looks at DENIS, with quiet surprise, hears the
            desperation in his voice, the crack-
                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
                      They'll destroy you.
            MARGARET looks at DENIS, sees he is near to tears-
                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
                      Throw in the towel now, love.
                      Don't let those bastards see you
                      humiliated. You just won't win,
                      darling. Not this time.
                                      MARGARET
                      Oh Denis.
            DENIS, fingers touch hers, she looks at him, sees the
            tender concern in his eyes. MARGARET smiles, determinedly
            steely under his gaze.
                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
 154                  I am the Prime Minister.                       154

            On her face as CASTA DIVA breaks through.


            INT. HOUSE OF COMMONS. DAY

            MARGARET sits alone on the front bench.    A stream of
            voices from the past -

                                      SPEAKER (V.O.)
                      Order! Order!

                                    MARGARET (V.O.)
                      The Right Honourable gentleman is
                      afraid!

                                    NORTHERN VOICE (V.O.)
                      This is a naked strategy of
                      closing some coal mines and then
                      selling off -

                                                                        90

                                    MARGARET (V.O.)
                      They believe in striking, I
                      believe in working!

                                    IRISH VOICE (V.O.)
                      This is the woman who's watched
                      ten men on hunger strike starve
                      themselves to death and never
                      flinched!

                                    MARGARET (V.O.)
                      Despicable and cowardly -

                                    MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                      Cynical Falklands war -

                                    MINISTER (V.O.)
                      More homeowners, more
                      shareholders, more savings -

            The voices begin to blend into one another, white noise.


            INT. DOWNING STREET STUDY. 1990. EVENING

            MARGARET sips a whisky.

                                    MARGARET (V.O.)
                      I offer my resignation after
                      eleven and a half extraordinary
                      years -


            INT. CORRIDOR. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1990. DAY.

            MARGARET descends the stairs like an operatic heroine,
            her hand gripping the banister of the staircase. Below
            the Downing St staff waiting to say goodbye. Many are in
            tears.

                                    MARGARET
                      -proud to have left Britain in a
                      much better state than when we
                      took office.

            She passes the photographs of her predecessors and stops
            to receive a gift, opening it-

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      What's this then? A radio... How
                      useful.

            She moves down the receiving line of staff. The floor is
            carpeted with roses. Men's wet eyes. The door ahead. She
            is crying.

                                                                        91

            Finally reaching the door, MARGARET stands bracing
            herself. Denis's hand on her shoulder standing behind.

                                    DENIS
                      Steady, MT.

            MARGARET nods, bracing herself. A hand on the door
            handle. As it swings open-

            INT. BEDROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. NIGHT

            MARGARET stands staring at herself in the mirror.

                                    DENIS (O.S.)
                      The greatest Prime Minister since
                      Churchill deposed by a bunch of
                      spineless pygmies!

                                    MARGARET VO
                      All those years of taking the
                      tough decisions, does any of it
                      matter now?

                                    DENIS
                      It's all been turned to mush!

                                    MARGARET
                      What?

            DENIS lies on the bed behind her with the newspaper.

                                    DENIS
                      By these fools! These lily-livered
                      pinkos!

                                    MARGARET
                      These inept placators.

                                    DENIS
                      Very good! These vacillators.

                                    MARGARET
                      Vacillators! Poll takers.

                                    DENIS
                      Popularity seekers.

                                    MARGARET
                      So busy taking the pulse of the
                      public!

                                    DENIS
                      Weak -

                                                                        92

                                    MARGARET
                      (pulling down a rack of Denis's
                      black oxford shoes onto the floor)
                      These...weak...weak...weak...wea..
                      .weak...Men!

            DENIS's clothes are all over the room and the main
            cupboard is open and empty apart from shoes. There are
            several bin liners already filled with clothes.

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      Don't they know if you take the
                      tough decisions, yes people will
                      hate you today but they'll thank
                      you for generations.

                                    DENIS
                      Or forget you entirely and chuck
                      you out with the rubbish!

            MARGARET turns away from this thought and opens a last
            big chest of drawers.

                                    MARGARET V/O
                           (seizing shirts and
                            jerseys and putting
                            them on the floor)
                      All I wanted was to make a
                      difference in the world.

                                    DENIS
                      And you did, love, you did.

            She sits at the end of her bed and opens a box she has
            found in Denis's cupboard. There is a programme from `The
            King and I' and a faded blue rosette from some long
            forgotten election campaign. A small flyer `Margaret
            Roberts. Conservative Candidate for Dartford' and some
            childrens cards "to the world's greatest Daddy love Mark
            and Carol."

                                    MARGARET V/O
                      All I wanted was for my children
                      to grow up well and be happy -
                      happier than I was certainly. And
                      I wanted you to be happy of
                      course. Were you happy, Denis?
                      Tell me the truth.

            There is no response. MARGARET is momentarily lost in the
            room.

            Then, seized by some compulsion, she begins to pull out
            the rest of his clothes, shoving them into black bags.

            As shirts and trousers go in, quick flashes of Denis -

                                                                        93

            His youthful face, smiling at her at the opera.

            Laughing on the beach in Cornwall.

            At the door of Number 10, smiling at her.

            Sharing her bed.

            MARGARET looks up. Denis's suitcase is on the bed. His
            coat and hat lying beside it. She folds his dressing gown
            - the one from the bathroom hook - tenderly and puts it
            on the top of the case.

                                      MARGARET
                      Denis? Denis?

            And there he is by her side.

                                    MARGARET V/O
                      Here's your bag. You're all
                      packed, sorted.

            She walks him to the bedroom door and gives him a gentle
            kiss. DENIS starts to walk away.

                                    MARGARET
                      (seeing he is walking away in his
                      socks)
                      Denis wait...Where are your shoes?
                      You can't go without shoes! Not
                      yet.

            DENIS straightens his hat.

                                      DENIS
                      Steady.

                                    MARGARET
                      Yes...Steady...

                                    DENIS
                      Steady the buffs -

                                    MARGARET
                      Steady...Steady the buffs...

            DENIS heading out.

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
 154d                 NO...Not yet...Denis. Wait...I              154d
                      said I don't want you to go yet.
            The endless corridor, MARGARET calling after DENIS-

                                                                        94

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      Denis...Please...No...Not...Don't.
                      ..NO...I don't...I don't want to
                      be on my own.
            DENIS turns back for a moment -

                                    DENIS
                      You're going to be fine on your
                      own, love.
                           (beat)
                      You always have been.
            MARGARET calling out as DENIS reaches the window at the
            very far end of the house and appears to disappear into
            the white light-
                                   MARGARET
                           (calling out)
                      Denis!!

            INT. BEDROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.DAWN
            From above we see MARGARET lying dead asleep on the bed
            on a pile of DENIS' clothes. The bed is surrounded by
            bulging black bin bags.

                                    CAROL OOV
                      Mummy-
            CAROL looming over Margaret, looking horrified.

                      My God, Mum. Are you alright?
                           (opening the
                            curtains)
                      Mummy you should have called for
                      help, silly old sausage. Have you
                      not even been in your bed
                      properly? You've done all this?
                                    MARGARET
                      Yes, all sorted. Finished.
            MARGARET looks around her.

                                    CAROL
                      Yes well don't worry about all
                      this. June and I will crack on
                      with it.
                                    MARGARET
                      I was just going to get dressed.

                                                                        95

                                    CAROL
                      ...Shall I call someone, see if
                      anyone can come over and do your
                      hair?
            MARGARET looks at her warmly.
                                    MARGARET
                      Oh. No, you do it.

            CAROL reacts, surprised but pleased.

            INT. KITCHEN. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.
            MARGARET sit finishing a cup of tea. Hears Carol's bustle
            in the downstairs hallway.

                                    CAROL OOV
                      Right, I'm off June.

                                    JUNE
                      OK. `Bye.
            She stands, picking up the cup.
            From behind-
                                    JUNE (O.S) (CONT'D)
                      Oh let me do that, Margaret.
            MARGARET's turns for a moment-
            It is JUNE. MARGARET shakes her head.
                                    MARGARET
                      No, dear, I'll do it.
                                    JUNE
                      Carol said you might go to the
                      House of Lords today?
                                    MARGARET
                      No no. I'm not going anywhere.

            The sound of hot water running. CHINK of a teacup-
            MARGARET stands, washing up a tea cup.
            The SQUEAK of her wet cloth, working on a stubborn tea
            stain, puncturing the silence.
            The sound of birdsong and children playing drifts from
            the street outside.

                                                                        96

            MARGARET sets the cup aside, turns and walks out of the
            room, and out of sight.

            THE END
THE ISLAND

    We PULL BACK, in marked steps, to include neighboring apartments
    with identical frosted facades. Then more apartments, above and
    below, the tiers linked by ramps and crosswalks. It might be a
    prison cellblock but there are no guards apparent. Indeed, the
    residents move freely, all notably male, all clad in shearlings,
    polo shirts and slacks. It is just another day in Sector Four.

3   INT. NUTRITION PLAZA - SECTOR FOUR - DAY

    Satie's Gymnopedie plays from overhead speakers. 

    A glass wall looks out across a green mountain valley. The plaza, 
    formed in curves of creamy ceramic tile, is divided into two service 
    areas.

    Male residents in line on one side, females on the other. Both
    genders combine in the seating area. Lincoln reaches the head of
    the line. He swipes his ethercuff o v e r a scanner. A NUTRITION
    CLERK, a surly woman in uniform, eyes the readout on her screen-

                                    NUTRITION CLERK
                     Lincoln Six-Echo... Options are dried
                     fruit, oatmeal or anything in bran.

                                  LINCOLN
                     What? No bacon?

                                NUTRITION CLERK
                     You got a sodium flag, pal - now
                     what's it going to be?

                                 LINCOLN
                     Whatever.

    He shrugs, disgruntled. The clerk taps her screen. Turning to a
    row of chutes behind her, she collects a foil covered bowl and a
    drink can. Lincoln, less than appetized, loads his tray with the
    oatmeal and juice breakfast. Then he heads into the seating area.

    In the seating area, male and female residents sit eating and
    chatting happily. Uniformed busboys intermix, clearing and wiping
    tables. A divide in this community now starts to become clear...

    The busboys, like the nutrition clerk, like all the service,
    maintenance, and administrative staff we'll see, have distinct
    uniforms but no facial marking. They are known as "outsiders".

    The "residents", like Lincoln, have crosshatched scars on their
    upper left brows and ethercuffs o n their wrists. Mostly Caucasian,
    from mid-twenties to mid-sixties. There are no children here.

    We isolate a blonde - mid-20's, fresh, bright eyes, a fragile
    beauty, a crosshatch of two verticals and one horizontal. Her
    name is ESTER TWO-ALPHA. Seeing Lincoln, she smiles and waves-

                                     ESTER
                     Lincoln ! Over here!

                                                             3.



Lincoln crosses, a little surprised to see her. Pleasantly so.

                            LINCOLN
              Hello , stranger.

                           ESTER
              What? You don't recognize me?

                          LINCOLN
              It's just an expression, that's all.

                         ESTER
              You and your expressions, Lincoln. Now
              sit down and ask me where I've been.

                               LINCOLN
                     (sits , a spreading smile)
              Okay, Ester. Where have you been?

                               ESTER
              At the medical center. Just for tests
              but they had me on liquid nutrition.
                     (forks a mouthful of eggs)

              Mmmmm. This is the first solid food
              I've had in a week.

                          LINCOLN
              Exciting.

                            ESTER
              That's not the exciting part. I got my
              first trimester report: happy, healthy
              and contaminant-free... Both of us.

                          LINCOLN
              Us?

                        ESTER
              My baby... It's in perfect condition.
              I just hope I can keep it that way. I
              still have six months to delivery.

                          LINCOLN
              Then you leave all this behind, huh?

                          ESTER
              Why? Will you miss me?

Her eyes betray a flicker of something. It unsettles Lincoln.

                          LINCOLN
              I'll miss your coffee. C'mon, I
              already burned up my quota.

                                                                       4.



                             ESTER
                Okay. But this is the last time.

In a deliberate move, she drops her napkin on the floor. As she
ducks down to retrieve it, Lincoln steals a gulp of her coffee.
Rising again, Ester registers his souring look.

                            ESTER
                What is it?

Lincoln just nods across the plaza. Ambient conversation is now
ebbing at an arrival. An outsider in a grey, vaguely clerical
uniform - sanguine, settled, precise eyes. He might be a prison
warden but for the generally warm reception. He is known as The
Community Director. His name is MERRICK.

He crosses to a lectern, unlooping a chain from his neck with a
three-forked pendant known as a "tri-key". He slots the tri-key
into the lectern. The glass wall frosts over and pixellates i n t o
a live feed of himself. Now amplified by the plaza speakers,
Merrick begins his address-

                            MERRICK
                Good morning. To everyone here and
                everyone watching on etherscreen,
                welcome to the community address. Today
                I'm coming to you from Sector Four. For
                those of you here with sugar quotas, let
                me recommend the french toast. I just
                tried some and it's excellent, really.
                But I know what everyone's hungry for
                s o let's move on to the lottery. As
                always the draw will be made from our
                host sector. So tell me, Sector Four -
                is everyone ready for The Daily Spin?

Applause and whistles erupt, mostly from the younger residents,
who take on the zeal of a game show audience. The older ones -
including Lincoln - greet the prospect with labored tolerance.
Merrick turns the tri-key i n the lectern. The glass wall
switches from the live feed to a jumbotron o f flashing text;

- - DAILY SPIN!... GET READY TO WIN!... DAILY SPIN!--

                           MERRICK
                Let The Spin begin.

To a burst of cheers, he turns the tri-key another notch. The
glass wall becomes a spinning blur, like a tumbler on a slot
machine. But instead of icons, it clicks through names, each
separated by a blank line - from "Adams One-Alpha" to "Zucker
Three - Charlie" - scrolling the entire population of Sector Four.

                                                                     5.



    As the spin slows, a pent silence falls. Expectant eyes watch the
    names click through the P's, the Q's, the R's, the S's and . . .
    - - SPIN WIN!... STARKWEATHER TWO-DELTA... SPIN-WIN!--

                                     MERRICK
                   Starkweather Two-Delta! Step up!

    Cheers and applause as everyone looks for the lucky recipient.
    The excitement abates as it becomes clear he's not among them.

                                    MERRICK
                   Well , Starkweather, if you're watching
                   on etherscreen - your time has come, my
                   friend! You're moving out to The Island!
                          (another burst of cheers)
                   And the rest of you, never lose hope;
                   what do we know about The Daily Spin?

                                   THE YOUNGER RESIDENTS
                   Everyone gets to win!

                              MERRICK
                   An d tomorrow it could be you...

    Merrick steps down and departs. The plaza reverts to its former
    mood, dotted with murmurs of disappointment. Lincoln scowls.

                                ESTER
                   Don't worry. Your time will come.

                                 LINCOLN
                   That's easy for you to say. Your time's
                   guaranteed. All you have is six months.

                              ESTER
                   Six months of mood swings, sore back
                   and swollen feet. Want to trade places?

                                    LINCOLN
                          (scowl lifting)
                   Give me some more of your coffee.

4   INT . SUBWAY PORTAL - SECTOR FOUR - DAY

    The portal is spanned by a rank of latticed metal gates, known as
    an "ethergate." Residents swipe their ethercuffs o v e r scanners,
    the gates hiss open and they step through in systematic order.

                                                                      6.



5   INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - SECTOR FOUR - DAY

    The subway, formed in arches of creamy ceramic tile, is not
    unlike our own. In place of escalators, moving walkways deliver
    the residents onto the platform. Along the platform wall runs a
    strip of mirrored panels, etherscreen reporting in banner crawl:

    - - NEXT STOP... SECTOR 5 - SECTOR 6 - CENTERVILLE...
    At the tunnel edge of the platform is a safety fence, where the
    residents wait in a patient line, Lincoln among them. His focus
    is drawn to two younger residents whispering furtively nearby.

                            RESIDENT #1
                   A stim unit says it hits the wall.

                                RESIDENT #2
                   Okay . But I get to set the can.

    Resident #1 shrugs and hands him a drink can. Resident #2 ducks
    under the fence, reaching the can down to the track. Or what
    looks like a track. The struts lining the bed are not sleepers
    but buffers of galvanized rubber. Nor are there any rails. The
    relay system is provided by a series of metal posts, flanking the
    buffers to run in twin parallel. Known as "lode-poles," they now
    start thrumming and pulsing with red light, like runway beacons.

                                RESIDENT #1
                   Hurry it up. The shuttle's coming.

    Resident #2 regains the platform. We PUSH IN on the drink can,
    balanced on a buffer. It starts rattling. Then suddenly shoots
    upward into the air, arcing and bouncing off the tunnel wall,
    clattering into obscurity. Resident #1 whoops in victory.

    A rush of air heralds the shuttle. It sails out of the tunnel,
    floating three feet above the track. A hybrid of subway car and
    nautical craft, it has runners in place of wheels, like hulls on
    a catamaran. It is buoyed by a magnetic flow emanating from the
    lode-poles, an invisible river known as a "lode-stream". The
    shuttle drifts to a gentle halt, hovering, rocking a little. Its
    gangplanks fold out toward the platform and the safety fence
    lowers. Lincoln and the other commuters file routinely aboard.

6   INT . CENTERVILLE - DAY

    An avenue of cream colored buildings. Uniform in architecture,
    rising five stories to meet a mirrored roof. Despite lighting
    arrays, the absence of sky lends a chasmic quality . Lincoln
    follows the flow of residents up the avenue. Building signs read:
    "Dept. Of Labor", "Dept. Of Health", "Dept. Of Sanitation". He
    splits off, turning into a building marked "Dept. Of Population."

                                                                            7.



7   INT. OFFICES - DEPARTMENT OF POPULATION - DAY

    Frosted glass workstations, notably circular rather than square.
    Lincoln sits at his desk in front of a wraparound etherscreen,
    divided into three sections, a formation known as a "visor".
    Right-visor shows a polymorph in fractal cycle, like a permanent
    screen saver. Mid-visor shows a tomograph of a residential block;
    tiers of apartments shown as boxes, most in solid white, a few
    blink red with the text label "Vacancy". Left-visor shows a list
    of names and sociographic grading sheaded "Residents Pending".

                                   LINCOLN (TO VISOR)
                     Hudson Four-Alpha; profile reviewed.
                     Match to vacancy; 171, Sector 5.
                     Request clearance to populate.

    - - PROCESSING . . . FOUR-ALPHA, HUDSON; POPULATION APPROVED

    Left-visor, the name highlights then blinks out. Mid-visor, a
    box labelled "Vacancy" turns from blinking red to solid white.

                                 A VOICE (O.S.)
                     Hey, you want to know something?

    Lincoln looks up at a face grinning over the partition - mid
    30's, jovial, tall and burly. His name is JONES THREE-BRAVO.

                                JONES
                     You know that guy who won the Spin in
                     your sector? Starkweather?

                                 LINCOLN
                     No.

                              JONES
                     I had a bout with him last week. Guess
                     how long he's been here? Six months.

                                LINCOLN
                     Six months?

                                JONES
                     You don't believe me - look it up.

    - - TWO - DELTA , STARKWEATHER: 102, SECTOR 4 -- DAY: 186 / HR: 09:31

                                 JONES
                     What do you say now? Still think The
                     Spin's rigged for the long haulers?

                                                                     8.



                             LINCOLN
                   He got lucky, that's all.

                              JONES
                   And don't you wish it was you... out
                   there on The Island... nature's own
                   clean air zone... no screening, no
                   quotas... unlimited pleasure...

                               LINCOLN
                   Shut up, Jonesy.

                              JONES
                   Why don't you make me? In the ring.

                                 LINCOLN
                   You're out of my weight-class.

                              JONES
                   Not anymore. They just got the new
                   program in - multi-weight balancing.

                               LINCOLN
                   I'll think about it.

                                 JONES
                   C'mon, champ. A stim unit says you
                   won't last three rounds.

8   INT . BOXING RING - CENTERVILLE - EARLY EVENING

    - C R A C K - The same face recoils from a punch. Jones shakes it off,
    retreating, recovering. He resets his guard as Lincoln moves in.
    Lincoln jabs at Jones' defenses, his blowing hitting harder than
    we'd expect from his stature. Suddenly he breaks through with a
    left hook. Jones staggers back. A strange ripple distorts his
    face. Stranger still, his skin tone takes on a grainy pallor.

    As the bout continues, we widen to see the boxing ring is indeed
    a ring rather than a square and beyond the ropes is an outer ring.
    With Lincoln in FG, we now see another figure in the outer ring,
    mirroring his moves, dressed identically but for the gloves which
    are like gauntlets. The gauntlets are rigged to two armatures
    which are, in turn, rigged to a gantry-like mechanism. It glides

    noiselessly to and fro, shadowing the figure round the outer ring.
    RACK FOCUS reveals the figure is also Lincoln . The real Lincoln,
    in fact. The one in FG is a derivative hologram known as a "proxy".
    As Lincoln fakes and jabs, the counter-weighted armatures drag
    and recoil, duplicating the exertions of his proxy. Jones moves
    more sluggishly, his proxy now ghostly, transparent. Now being
    sent on a last offensive only to be roundhoused by another left
    hook. Jones' proxy topples and explodes into a pixellated mist.

                                                                     9.



                               LINCOLN
                   Whoooooo!

    Lincoln proxy - and Lincoln - punch the air in victory. Jones
    unlatches his gauntlets, sweating, galled by the defeat-

                               JONES
                   Sure you input the right weight class?

                                 LINCOLN
                   You're just too slow, Jonesy.

                                 JONES
                   You're faster `cause you're lighter.
                   Programmers... they always miss
                   something.

                               LINCOLN
                   Hey, you put up, now pay up.

9   INT . STIM BAR - CENTERVILLE - EVENING

    Rainbow light and swirling electronic music. The clientele are
    all male residents. Round the walls, poster-sized etherscreens
    display various dancing women, beckoning, text supers flashing:

    - - NEW AT THE PLEASURE CENTER!... OR TRY A MYSTERY DATE!...
    At the bar, Lincoln and Jones, freshly showered, each swipe their
    ethercuffs over a scanner. A uniformed BARTENDER notes the readout-

                                BARTENDER
                   Jones Three-Bravo; you got five units.
                   Your friend, he's got an alcohol flag.

                             JONES
                   So make it a beer and a Vita Cola.

    The bartender serves the drinks and they settle at the end of the
    bar. Scoping for onlookers, Lincoln steals a gulp of Jones' beer.

                              JONES
                   You know, you're going to get yourself
                   contaminated one of these days.

                               LINCOLN
                   Shut up, Jonesy.

                              JONES
                   So, you up for a rematch tomorrow?

                            LINCOLN
                   I can't. I got an interact.

                                                                        10.



                                JONES
                    With who? That blonde again?

                                LINCOLN
                    Hey, it's an authorized interaction.
                    We're on the same meditation program.

                               JONES
                    You want to get flagged for proximity?

                              LINCOLN
                    No law against friendship, Jonesy.

                                    JONES
                    Quick . . . Give me that beer back.

     TWO CENSUS OFFICERS ("CENSORS") enter the bar; in wireless head-
     sets and white uniforms, they seem at once clinical and military.
     CENSOR 1 carries a tablet known as an "etherboard". CENSOR 2,
     more imposing, carries a wide-muzzle rifle known as a "stopgun".
     Their foreboding appearance is greeted without alarm. As they
     move up the bar, the customers dutifully swipe their ethercuffs
     over the etherboard. Now reaching Jones, who swipes accordingly-

                                  JONES
                    What's going on, officer?

                                  CENSOR 1
                    Census check.

     Censor1 checks the etherboard; a headshot of Jones spins in 3-D.
     He offers it to Lincoln who swipes his ethercuff emphatically-

                                LINCOLN
                    What happened? You lost count?

                             CENSOR 1
                    I hope nobody's drinking off-quota.

                                LINCOLN
                    Vita Cola all the way, officer.

     Lincoln sips his cola. As they move on, he grimaces at the taste.

10   INT . SHUTTLE - IN TRANSIT - LATER

     Lincoln stares out of the window. The red pulse of the lode poles
     catches a glazed look in his eyes. His pupils, a little dilated.
     His focus returns to the interior and an etherscreen banner:

     - - G E T READY FOR THE DAILY SPIN!... TOMORROW IT COULD BE YOU...

                                                                             11.



11   INT. BEDROOM - LINCOLN'S APARTMENT - THE NEXT DAY

     The horizon. The morning sun streams over the green mountains.
     Lincoln lies sleeping, his head buried under the pillow. Off a
     beeping sound, he stirs and squints up at the mirrored ceiling:

     - - ETHER CALL PENDING ; ACCEPT OR SEND TO MESSAGE BANK?

                                   LINCOLN
                       Accept.

     The etherscreen resolves Ester's face, fresh and bright.

                                       ESTER (ON ETHERSCREEN)
                       Lincoln? I missed you at breakfast.

                                LINCOLN
                       I guess I overslept.

                                ESTER (ON ETHERSCREEN)
                       I just wanted to check we're still on
                       for tonight. The interact.

                                     LINCOLN
                       Right. I'll be there.

                                   ESTER (ON ETHERSCREEN)
                       I'll see you then. Enjoy your day!

     Her face blinks out. Lincoln gets out of bed with a smile.

12   INT . RESIDENTIAL BLOCK - SECTOR FOUR - DAY

     Lincoln exits his apartment and heads up the walkway. We reveal
     the walkway ends at another ethergate, governing residential
     access. Lincoln swipes his ethercuff o v e r a scanner and a gate
     swings open. He heads on, the gate hissing closed behind him.

13   INT . NUTRITION PLAZA - SECTOR FOUR - DAY
     Ravel's Pavane plays overhead. The plaza is emptying as residents
     leave for work. Lincoln arrives at the service counter. He
     swipes his ethercuff and greets the clerk with an amiable grin.

                                   LINCOLN
                       Just juice today. I'm late for work.

                                  NUTRITION CLERK
                       Too bad. I gotta serve the full meal.

     Lincoln shrugs, his gaze wandering past her into the kitchens.
     His grin fades as he spots TWO CENSORS talking to a busboy. Then
     the view is lost as he's served an oatmeal and juice breakfast.

                                                                        12.



14   INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - SECTOR FOUR - DAY

     Not so crowded at this hour. Halfway down the platform we see a
     vending machine with confections in nameless silver wrappers. A
     mouse-ish resident collects a bar from the trough. His name is
     KLEINWORT NINE-ALPHA. Seeing Lincoln approach, he preempts-

                              KLEINWORT
                   No, no, no. Use your own sugar quota.

                                 LINCOLN
                   C'mon, Kleinwort...

     He says this amicably enough but he's using his imposing presence
     on the smaller man. Kleinwort sighs and breaks off a chunk.
                             LINCOLN
                   So what's up with the Censors, huh?

                                  KLEINWORT
                   They're conducting a census check. Or
                   don't you watch the bulletins?

                            LINCOLN
                   I know what it is. I've just never
                   seen them out in this sector before.

                                     KLEINWORT
                   Probably just tracking a glitch. A bad
                   scanner or maybe an userware defect.
                          (off Lincoln's puzzled look)
                   Ethercuffs. They get damaged, you get
                   a false read. Sometimes even a dropout.

                               LINCOLN
                   What are you saying? They lost someone?

                                  KLEINWORT
                   Someone just isn't showing up where
                   they should be. What do you care?

     A rush of air heralds the shuttle, curtailing the conversation.
     Beneath his tousling hair, a frown plays on Lincoln's brow.

15   INT . LINCOLN'S WORKSTATION - DEPT. OF POPULATION - DAY

     Lincoln stares at the fractal on right-visor, at the intricate
     paths of dysplasia. The glazed look has returned to his eyes,
     his pupils, a little dilated. His stare narrows at an errant
     thought. He shrugs it off. But the thought returns, persistent.
     More to dispel than indulge it, Lincoln turns to mid-visor-

                                                                       13.



                              LINCOLN (TO VISOR)
                Census File: Two-Delta, Starkweather.
- - T W O - D E L T A , STARKWEATHER: 102, SECTOR 4 - DAY: -- / HR: --

                                  LINCOLN (TO VISOR)
                Accomodation Status : 102, Sector 4.

The tiered boxes resolve, zooming in to isolate Apartment 102.
The box shows solid white. Lincoln frowns, assimilating this.

                            LINCOLN
                Hey , Jonesy. Remember the guy who won
                The Spin yesterday? His apartment's
                still showing as occupied.

                             JONES (O.S.)
                So?

                          LINCOLN
                So you get 24 hours to move out.

                             JONES (O.S.)
                Maybe the system didn't update yet.

                           LINCOLN
                No. It updates on the hour. If he's
                gone it should be showing a vacancy.

                                  JONES
                      (appearing over the partition)
                What? You think he's still here? The
                guy wins a place on The Island and you
                think he just decided not to go?

                         LINCOLN
                I don't know. He wasn't there to step
                up. And now there's a census check...
                           JONES
                And now nothing. It's probably the
                programmers messing up.

                             LINCOLN
                Maybe.

                         JONES
                A stim unit says I can prove it. Cross
                reference with sanitation.

                                  LINCOLN (TO VISOR)
                Sanitation Status: 102, Sector Four.

                                                                        14.



     --PROCESSING... APT. 102; CLOSED FOR CONTAINMENT CHECK--

                                    JONES
                        See ? Standard procedure. They got to
                        sweep it for the next occupant.

     Their supervisor interrupts them - an outsider, efficient-type-

                                  SUPERVISOR
                        If you gentlemen aren't busy... Perhaps
                        I could get an update on sector six?

                                     LINCOLN
                        Still in the electrical phase, sir.

                                    SUPERVISOR
                        Well the guys upstairs are griping
                        about the backlog. So go over there
                        and light some fires, will you?

                                         LINCOLN
                               (pulls on his jacket to leave)
                        I'll take care of it.

                                         SUPERVISOR
                        Aren't you forgetting something?
                               (holds up A STEEL BRIEFCASE)
                        Or do you want to get contaminated?

16   INT . CONSTRUCTION ZONE - SECTOR SIX - DAY

     An arc of blue light. A uniformed worker steers a plasma torch
     over a conduit. In the fog of smoke, we see wires being spliced,
     circuits, tested. Outsiders in hardhats, goggles and cup masks.
     Lincoln comes over the crosswalk, starkly contrasted in dacron
     coveralls and a hooded gasmask. THE CREW FOREMAN intercepts him -
     drawn, desiccated features, a husky drawl. His name is MCCORD-

                                      MCCORD
                        Sorry, chief. I can't let you get any
                        closer. We got live wires over there.

     Lincoln's reply is muffled by the gasmask, lost in the noise.

                                      MCCORD
                        What's that you said?

     Lincoln repeats to no avail. Frustrated, he peels off his gasmask-

                                 LINCOLN
                        I said I can't hear you.
     M c C o r d c h u c k l e s at the irony.

                                                                      15.



                                MCCORD
                    He y , you get yourself contaminated,
                    don't come pointing the finger at me.
                               LINCOLN
                    How are you doing, Mac?

                               MCCORD
                    You know how it is. `Gets to the end of
                    shift, `crew starts draggin t h e i r feet.

                                LINCOLN
                    We l l the guys upstairs are griping
                    about the backlog. They want to know
                    when you'll be ready for move in.
                             MCCORD
                    I guess if we bust our backs, we could
                    be out of here by the end of the week.

                                LINCOLN
                    I'll tell them two weeks.

                                   MCCORD
                    Thanks , chief. I appreciate that.

                                 LINCOLN
                    So . . . got any stuff on you today?

17   INT . AIRLOCK - SECTOR SIX

     A sign reads "Warning! Contamination Risk!". Lincoln stands by as
     McCord u n l o o p s a neckchain w i t h a single-forked pendant known as
     a "uni-key". He slots it into the top of three keyholes. A light
     starts flashing and the airlock gives a heavily pressurized hiss.

18   INT . EXTRACTOR SHAFT

     A deep steady thrum. Giant extractor fans churn above and below,
     both directions seemingly limitless. The bleak concrete shaft is
     streaked with soot, threaded by ladders and catwalks. On one
     such, we isolate Lincoln and McCord. B o t h smoking cigarettes.

                                LINCOLN
                    I t ' s too bad.
                                MCCORD
                    What do you mean?

                                LINCOLN
                    T h a t your shift's almost over.

                                                                     16.



                           MCCORD
                You mean, these things? Well, these
                things ain't good for you anyways.

                            LINCOLN
                The y taste good.

An exchanged smile. A pause as they enjoy the guilty pleasure.

                         LINCOLN
                I like coming here. Talking. Most
                outsiders don't like to talk.

                              MCCORD
                That's because we ain't supposed to.
                They got rules about fraternization.

Lincoln nods. Another pause as they drag on their cigarettes.

                            LINCOLN
                What do you do when the shift's over?

                            MCCORD
                M o r e of the same. They cycle us onto
                the disposal detail. Hump `n dump crew.

                            LINCOLN
                H u m p `n dump crew?

                              MCCORD
                D e b r i s clearance. We hump the heavy
                stuff to a site on the outside.
                          LINCOLN
                Is it as bad as they say out there?

M c C o r d l o o k s momentarily puzzled. Lincoln displays his gasmask.

                           LINCOLN
                The air... the containments.

                           MCCORD
                Right.

                           LINCOLN
                But not everywhere. Not on The Island.

                              MCCORD
                    ( b e a t , stubs his cigarette)
                I don't know too much about that.
Lincoln eyes him narrowly. McCord p a u s e s , then tucks his lighter
into the cigarette box and offers it with a palliative smile.

                                                                       17.



                                MCCORD
                    He y , take it from me, you got a sweet
                    deal right here. So why worry, huh?
     Lincoln shrugs, accepting the gift with a slow exhale of smoke.
     We tilt up to follow the smoke plume, dissipating into the fans.

19   EXT . THE WORLD OUTSIDE - DAY
     A i r blasts up from a giant tunnel.

     W i d e n i n g , we see it is one of a huge ring, planted in the dust,
     backdropped b y mountainous red rocks. At the hub of the ring is
     a large cubic building. From its facets, giant appendages of
     ducting plunge into its surround. These are the inlets for the
     processed air that feeds the underground...

     This is the landscape of the world outside and manifestly above.

     F r o m the processing plant, we pull back and up, raking over a
     large industrial complex. More cubic buildings, cream colored,
     windowless, like stacks of giant playing bricks. Now we see the
     front of the complex. The planate f a c a d e , faceless but for the
     entrance, cubed in polarized glass, like a dark cyclopean eye.

     F r o m the entrance, we follow a walkway out to a dock where the
     ground drops away into a broad concrete trench; like the subway,
     lined with lode-poles and buffers, it is known as a "lodeway".
     From the dock, we follow the lodeway out to a perimeter wall; red
     rock slabs, twenty feet high, framing a giant gateway. The gates
     now glide open to disclose a view of the world outside the wall-

     The shimmering bleached wilderness of The Arizona Desert.
     O u t in the distance, where the lodeway tapers into the scrub, a
     vehicle emerges from the shimmer. A hybrid of bus and nautical
     craft, single hulled, known simply as a "liner". Now as the
     liner becomes clearer, a decal on its prow is revealed - a
     crosshatch insignia over a blocky l e g e n d "The Sanger Institute".
20   INT . ENTRANCE HALL - THE SANGER INSTITUTE - DAY

     The polarized glass shows the liner has docked and A TOUR GROUP
     is disembarking. The men are mostly over 40, bloated by luxury.
     The women, mostly under 30, wives and girlfriends, all jewels and
     haute couture. They filter into the entrance hall to be greeted
     by the courtesy staff. Pretty girls in short skirts and blazers
     with the crosshatch insignia, led by a pert redhead named LYDIA.

                                  LYDIA
                    L a d i e s and gentlemen, my name is Lydia
                    and on behalf of our staff, I'd like
                    t o welcome you to The Sanger Institute.

                                                                          18.

                                    LYDIA (cont'd)
                    Before we start the tour, we'll be serv-
                    i n g r e f r e s h m e n t s in the visitor center
                    and circulating our standard discretion
                    agreements. I should add that today you
                    are all very lucky because our CEO and
                    founder, Dr. Henry Sanger, is with us
                    and will be leading the tour personally.

21   INT . INNER FOYER - LATER
     The crosshatch emblem spins on a wall-to-wall screen. Not a real
     screen but a projected flat known as a "holoframe". Here, Lydia
     assembles the tour group, nursing wine glasses and canapes. The
     holoframe fades up a serene music track and a commercial begins:
     A series of vignettes; an old man shuffling on a walking frame --
     a middle-aged woman in a bathing suit, one breast flattened by a
     mastectomy -- a young woman in labor, her face knotted in pain.
     The group watches with frowns and disapproving mumbles. Then-

                                V O I C E (O.S.)
                    I t ' s not a pretty sight, is it?
     E y e s turn to a figure behind them, dressed in a vestmental w h i t e
     labcoat - 70's, tall, slightly hunched by senility, eyes like
     quicksilver, glittering. He has the hauteur of a visionary
     stooping to the role of a salesman. His name is DR. HENRY SANGER.

                                      DR. SANGER (cont'd)
                    M o r t a l i t y . We all know its face and yet
                    w e look away, don't we? We deny that our
                    l i v e s are ordained to suffering. That
                    w e are all, inalterably, going to die.

     He pauses, fielding the various disconcerted looks. Then smiles.

                                DR. SANGER
                    I t takes courage to confront mortality,
                    my friends. And I see it in each of
                    y o u . My name is Dr. Henry Sanger and
                    I'm here to reward your courage.
     L y d i a applauds. The tour group dutifully follows suit. Sanger
     whispers a question in Lydia's ear. She broadcasts her response-

                                   LYDIA
                    T o d a y ' s group is from New Gaza Health
                    Care. They're with the platinum plan.

                               DR. SANGER
                    N e w Gaza. Yes, very good oncology unit.

     M u l l i n g this, he ambles through the holoframe which ripples at
     his passage. Rallied by Lydia the tour group follows him into--

                                                                  19.



22   INT. SALES HALL - DAY

     A hall of windows, each window framing a display case, each
     display case housing a different taxidermied a n i m a l . Not unlike
     a museum. On closer inspection, more like a chamber of horrors.
     I n one window is a pig with a horribly distended abdomen. Another,
     magnified, shows a mouse with a human ear grown on its back. In
     another, a chimpanzee stares out at us with glaringly human eyes.

                               DR. SANGER
                   I t doesn't get any prettier, does it?
                   But this is not a freakshow, my friends.
                   This is a war museum. A history of our
                   battles with mortality... and defeats.
                   Take the stem cell, for instance. A bid
                   to cultivate human parts for transplant -
                   in rodents, primates, barnyard animals.
                   It's enough to make your skin crawl. In
                   some cases literally, giving rise to a
                   new range of cross-species viruses. But
                   that's how we learn. From our mistakes.
     The y turn a corner. Another hall of windows, portals onto tanks
     of amber fluid that might be formaldehyde. Suspended within are
     embryos, fetuses and infants. All human. All grotesquely mutated.

                               DR. SANGER
                   C a s e in point, the clone. Back in the
                   beginning, the mapping of the human
                   genome was declared a historic landmark-
                   t o break the curse of heredity, to
                   correct congenital defect... genetic
                   engineering became the brave new world
                   of medical science. A bright future
                   that led to a dark age and much of the
                   legislation we know today. But while
                   the clone laws may have narrowed the
                   field, science marches on. Only to hit
                   the same wall over and over again - the
                   enigma of growth, the alchemy that
                   takes us from embryo to adult. A clone
                   barely reaches infancy before its
                   growth enzymes misfire, resulting in
                   the kind of monstrosities - which are
                   only effigies - you see here.

     S o m e reassured sighs from the women. They turn another corner onto
     another hall. A hall of mirrors. Simple, full-length mirrors.

                            DR. SANGER
                   So what do we learn from our mistakes?
                   That human parts cannot grow outside a
                   human body. That human bodies cannot
                   grow outside nature's grand design.

                                                                  20.



A FAT MAN, supporting his bulk with a walking stick, grunts -

                         T H E FAT MAN
               S o what the hell are we doing here?

                            DR. SANGER
               L e t ' s say one day you go to your doctor
               for a checkup. He discovers you have
               imminent renal failure and require a
               kidney transplant. What would you do?

                           T H E FAT MAN
               I wouldn't do nothing. My brother'd
               g i v e me one of his. Or else.

                           DR. SANGER
               E v e n if your brother's kidney is with-
               o u t defect, there's still a 38% chance
               of rejection. Or less if he's your twin.

                           T H E FAT MAN
               He's not. He's older.

                          DR. SANGER
               But what if you did have a twin?

O f f the fat man's confused look, Sanger smiles and gently coaxes
him to face a mirror. Their reflections stare back at them.

                           DR. SANGER
               What if you had a genetic double who'd
               give you not just one of his kidneys,
               but both? In fact, any organ or body
               part you ever had cause to need?

                            T H E FAT MAN
               What ? You mean like a clone? I thought
               you said all that stuff was a bust.

                        DR. SANGER
               I said the problem with a clone is it
               doesn't survive infancy. The solution
               is to find a different starting point.
               Why sow the seed when you can create
               the fruit? Or what we like to call...
               an "agnate".

L y d i a starts clapping., then s t o p s , realizing this wasn't a cue.

                         DR. SANGER
               An agnate is sequenced from a point on
               the cellular timeclock. I t is spawned
               post-maturate. It is `created' adult.

                                                              21.



                                DR. SANGER (cont'd)
              O f course, its brain is still vestigial
              s o for the first three years we keep it
              i n suspension. During which time we use
              d a t a impression to supply a template
              f o r functionality - a process we call
              " f o u n d a t i o n " . After foundation we
              t r a n s f e r the agnate into "containment"
              w h e r e it enters the conditioning
              p r o c e s s . An ongoing series of quality
              c o n t r o l s designed to test and maintain
              i t s functionality. After a minimum of
              t w o years conditioning, the agnate
              b e c o m e s eligible for harvest...
                      ( t o the FAT MAN, smiling)
              An d you, my friend, get your new kidney.

A hush falls among the group as they process what they've heard.
It's a sign of the times that none of them seems to be horrified.

                        T H E FAT MAN
             L e t me see if I got this straight. You
             can create this whatever... this walking
             spare parts holder... but I gotta w a i t
             five years to get hold of em?

                        DR. SANGER
             The spare parts, as you put it, need to
             be tested for integrity. But as many of
             our clients leave it till late in life
             to take out the policy, we do offer the
             option for early harvest. Given the
             risks, however, a waiver is required.

                       T H E FAT MAN
             S o five years or no warranty? For the
             premiums you're asking?

                        DR. SANGER
             An d what if the organ you   needed was a
             heart? Ask yourself, each     of you. If
             you had to put a price on     your life,
             your very survival - what     would it be?

A deep lull as the group considers this. Sanger picks his moment.

                         DR. SANGER
             I t ' s a question your insurance company
             has already answered. For them, the
             agnate obviates costly and ineffective
             treatment programs. Should you decide
             t o take out our policy, not only will
             they lower your existing premiums but
             they'll also cover the production cost.

                                                               22.



The incentive ripples across the faces. A troubled one speaks up-

                          T O U R MEMBER
              This "agnate"... what happens to it?
              After our friend here gets his kidney.

                            DR. SANGER
              That's entirely his decision. Our role
              is intermediary. We, as the insurance
              provider, guarantee the condition and
              availability of the agnate but all
              other rights are retained. In legal
              terms, the policy holder is defined as
              a "sponsor". The premiums, in effect,
              becoming sponsorship payments,
              maintaining the agnate until such time
              as harvest is required. At such time
              and where feasible, the sponsor has
              the option to extend sponsorship,
              retaining the agnate for secondary
              harvest or, shall we say, let the
              policy expire.

                             T O U R MEMBER
              E x p i r e ? You mean... let it die?

                            DR. SANGER
              N o . Not as you and I know it, at least.
              The associations of life and death are
              no more applicable to an agnate than to
              a cow in a field. It exists in a state
              of limited consciousness - aware not of
              life but of functionality. Imbued with
              the knowledge to maintain its function
              but without the capacity to question it.
              And yet, in many ways, the end if the
              most humane part of the process. The
              agnate goes to harvest without any fore-
              b o d i n g and is painlessly returned to the
              sleep from whence it came. Eternal or
              otherwise. There is mortality for an
              agnate. Just utility and redundancy.

                        T O U R MEMBER
              S o it doesn't know? It doesn't know
              its... its p u r p o s e in life?

                         DR. SANGER
              W h o does know my friend? Who among us
              knows our true purpose in life?
S a n g e r ambles on, plunged in thought. Lydia picks up the slack-

                                                                  23.



                          LYDIA
              This month we're offering a special
              rate for new sponsors. Including a 10%
              discount on the his-and-hers plan.

She ushers the group round another corner. Another holoframe and
another commercial, displaying the same characters as the first;
The old man with the walking frame is now running in a park--
The woman with the mastectomy is now at a party, her cocktail
dress broadcasting a full cleavage -- The young mother is now in
a waiting room, smiling as a doctor hands her a newborn baby.

                         LYDIA
              DR. SANGER? Would you like to close?

                            DR. SANGER
              Yes . . . Now some of you may be thinking
              this commercial is staged. But these are
              not actors, these are past customers.
              Real p e o p l e enjoying the real f r u i t s of
              sponsorship. What we offer here at The
              Sanger Institute is not just health
              insurance but indemnity. What we offer
              is the chance of a new lease on life...

The tour group applauds, this time without prompting from Lydia.

                         DR. SANGER
              N o w Lydia will walk you through the
              rest of the tour and explain the
              various limitations and exclusions.
              But I do have time for a few questions.
H a n d s are raised. A waspish-looking woman butts ahead of them-

                         T H E WASP
              The commercial. The girl with the baby.
              What is that? A fix for infertility?

                         DR. SANGER
              You mean the maternity plan? No.
              N o t endemic infertility at least. As I
              said, the law prohibits genetic
              alteration so a defect endemic in a
              sponsor will also be present in their
              agnate. No, what the maternity plan
              provides is a way round the risks and
              rigors of childbirth. Under this plan,
              an agnate becomes eligible for
              pregnancy shortly after foundation. A
              simple donation of sperm from the
              father, then the agnate is fertilized
              and brings your baby to term.

                                                                      24.



                                THE WASP
                     An d then what? You get it in the mail?

                                DR. SANGER
                     F o r practical reasons, delivery is
                     handled by your healthcare p r o v i d e r .

                                T H E WASP
                     An d "the agnate" - what happens to it?
                     When it's, you know - delivered.

                                DR. SANGER
                     The same rule applies. You can continue
                     your sponsorship. Or not. And in this
                     case, there's a natural window for
                     compliance as the agnate is routinely
                     sedated after delivery. As to whether
                     it wakes up from that sleep, like I
                     said, the choice is yours...

                                      T H E WASP
                            ( b e a t , a shrug)
                     An y t h i n g to avoid stretch-marks, right?

     The other tour members, some more guiltily than others, laugh.

23   EXT . PROCESSING PLANT
     A i r blasts up from the same giant tunnel, swallowing the laughs.

24   INT . EXTRACTOR SHAFT

     The acoustic hollowing as we look up from the now empty catwalk.
     The blast of air fading into the deep, steady thrum of the fans.

25   INT . CONTAINMENT

     The thrum fading to silence. A flat, measured silence as we
     revisit the community in soundless montage. The residential
     block, the frosted facades. The nutrition plaza, the counters,
     the chutes. The subway, the moving walkways. Centerville, the
     buildings now emitting a trickle of agnates, ending their
     workday - unwitting participants in their own greater utility.

26   INT . DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - CENTERVILLE
     A glass wall looks down on the avenue. The furniture is trans-
     p a r e n t , ethereal. Merrick sits at a console desk studying an
     etherboard. O f f a buzz, he taps a button. The door opens and
     Lincoln enters, composing a deadpan. He doesn't like this man.

                                LINCOLN
                     You wanted to see me?

                                                                    25.



                               MERRICK
                   Yes . Please, take a seat.
He taps     a button. The glass wall frosts over. It's unnerving but
Lincoln      stays deadpan, moving the chair before taking a seat.
Merrick      reviews the etherboard: Lincoln's headshot s p i n n i n g in
3D w i t h   a scroll of data. Then he looks up, forming a smile-

                                MERRICK
                   How ' s Lincoln Six-Echo today?

Lincoln shrugs, noncommittal. Merrick eyes him thoughtfully.

                                     MERRICK
                   E v e r y t h i n g going okay?

                            LINCOLN
                   I guess not.

                              MERRICK
                   Why do you say that?
                             LINCOLN
                   I f I'm here.

                              MERRICK
                   I'm not sure I deserve such a negative
                   association. My job's only to see that
                   you're happy. That everything's okay.

                                LINCOLN
                   Right.
                             MERRICK
                   I t sounds like you don't believe me.

                              LINCOLN
                   Why wouldn't I?

                                   MERRICK
                          ( s i t s back, smiling)
                   I t ' s part of your makeup. To challenge
                   things. To question what's around you.

                                LINCOLN
                   Ah.

                                  MERRICK
                   P e r h a p s you can utilize that facility
                   by helping me solve a little puzzle.
Lincoln shifts, feeling uneasy. Merrick consults the etherboard-

                                                                 26.



                                MERRICK
                You're doing well in most areas - pro-
                f i c i e n t a t work, exercising rigorously,
                your last medical puts you in excellent
                condition. But screening's picked up
                some deviations. Trace levels, changes
                in your sleep pattern... I see you've
                also been burning up your quotas...

                           LINCOLN
                A r e you saying I'm contaminated?

                            MERRICK
                No.
                            LINCOLN
                The n what's the problem?

                             MERRICK
                The r e are parameters, Lincoln. When
                someone starts straying from those
                parameters, we need to find out why.

                            LINCOLN
                Why?

                               MERRICK
                Because you - not just you, all of our
                residents - are special. Because people
                like me don't get to go to The Island.

He smiles. Lincoln stays deadpan, wondering where this is going.

                          MERRICK
                S o tell me, have you noticed any
                changes in yourself?

                            LINCOLN
                No.
                            MERRICK
                What about your sleep pattern? You
                feel you've been sleeping properly?

Lincoln shrugs, refractory.

                           MERRICK
                L e t me put it another way, when you
                wake up, do you feel... disrupted?

                         LINCOLN
                Disrupted?

                                                                  27.



                                MERRICK
               R e s t l e s s , disoriented, uneasy...
                        LINCOLN
               I don't know.

                              MERRICK
               They're all words in your vocabulary.
               I know you understand what they mean.
Lincoln ' s jaw clenches, patronized. Merrick notes this, resumes-

                                MERRICK
               Quotas . . . nutrition. Do you feel like
               you want more than you're given?
                        LINCOLN
               I don't know.

                         MERRICK
               Do you have any difficulty staying
               focused? At work, for instance?

Lincoln ' s jaw twitches. Merrick notes this, proceeds with care-

                           MERRICK
               H a v e you been experiencing feelings,
               sensations you don't quite understand?

                        LINCOLN
               I don't know.

                         MERRICK
               Do you sometimes feel agitated for no
               apparent reason? Frustrated, angry...

                             LINCOLN
               That's it.

                             MERRICK
               An g r y ? You feel angry?

                           LINCOLN
               Right.

                           MERRICK
               When exactly do you feel angry?

                           LINCOLN
               Now...
Lincoln leans forward as if to assert this. Merrick slowly nods
like he's just revealed something. He taps the etherboard-

                                                                 28.



                          MERRICK
               I'm going to order some tests at The
               Medical Center. In the meantime, I'd
               like you to stay away from stimulants -
               protein, sugar, caffeine...

                        LINCOLN
               I already burned up my quotas.

                          MERRICK
               But I know you can get around them.

He levels a knowing look. Lincoln stiffens again, unsettled.

                          MERRICK
               I'm asking you to cooperate. Not for
               my sake, Lincoln, but for your own.

                         LINCOLN
               Is that it?

                            MERRICK
               The r e is one other thing. You have a
               female friend. "Ester". Your file shows
               you've been interacting regularly.

                              LINCOLN
               The r e ' s no law against friendship.

                         MERRICK
               O f course not. We encourage interaction
               in the hope it'll be of mutual benefit.
               But given these deviations... let's
               just say proximity becomes an issue.

                        LINCOLN
               I know the rules of proximity.

                             MERRICK
               The rules of proximity apply to sexual
               contact, Lincoln. In this case it goes
               deeper than that. Ester is entering
               h e r second trimester. A time of change
               and emotional confusion. Further inter-
               a c t i o n might be... unhealthy for you.
Lincoln , patronized, looks away. This pill he won't swallow.

                          MERRICK
               An d for Ester - well, she has only six
               months left to delivery. Then she'll
               move out to The Island and whatever
               ties she has here will be broken.

                                                                       29.



                                      MERRICK (cont'd)
                    A s a friend, shouldn't you make her
                    t r a n s i t i o n as painless as possible?
     Lincoln ' s deadpan falters. This one, a bitter pill, he swallows.

                                 MERRICK
                    G o o d . Now I'm also going to refill
                    your pleasure quota. It may help to
                    settle you down a little.

                                 LINCOLN
                    Thank you. I feel much better now.

                               MERRICK
                    I'm not sure you do. But I think
                    you'll do what's right, Lincoln. You
                    may not trust me. But I trust you.

27   INT . COMMUNITY CENTER - CENTERVILLE - EVENING

     A theater in the round. The audience is mostly pregnant females
     and older residents. As the lights dim, eyes turn to the stage.
     Speakers bring up Handel's O m b r a M a i Fu. Then a glowing mist
     rises, condensing into a huge sphere, like a seed. Known as a
     "holomorph", it reacts sonically, germinating into stems and
     branches and blossoms, growing and evolving with the music. The
     diaspora i s as spellbinding as it is pacifying. It is beautiful.

28   INT . FOYER - COMMUNITY CENTER - EVENING

     The music from within is like a warm beckoning hand. The foyer is
     slightly vaulted to accommodate a statue. On a bench at its
     f o o t , Ester sits alone, waiting patiently. As Lincoln enters,
     s h e rises to greet him, smiling. He seems more sullen than
     usual.

                                 LINCOLN
                    S o r r y I'm late.

                                ESTER
                    I t ' s okay. I was waiting to tell you
                    something anyway. Guess what?

     Lincoln looks at her, unsettled by her flourishing smile.

                              ESTER
                    M y baby - I felt it move. And it's the
                    weirdest feeling too. I can't explain
                    it. It's like being more... more h e r e .
     Lincoln returns a deadpan look. Ester's smile wavers a little.

                                                                          30.



                                ESTER
                     I'm sorry. I'm all excited and we're
                     supposed to be finding peace of mind.

                              LINCOLN
                     I have to cancel, Ester.

     His voice is expressionless. Ester shrugs, refreshing her smile.

                               ESTER
                     S o I'll see you at breakfast tomorrow?

                              LINCOLN
                     I don't think so.
     Ester ' s smile falls. Her eyes, reaching, trying to understand.

                                ESTER
                     Did I do something wrong, Lincoln?

                                LINCOLN
                     No.

     A small word but it comes heavily. Before Ester can ask another
     question, Lincoln turns and leaves. His jaw, clenching with the
     effort of self-containment. Ester watches him, not hurt, just a
     little confused. We widen to encompass the height of the statue.
     The likeness is idealized but unmistakably that of Dr. Sanger.

29   INT . PLEASURE CENTER - NIGHT

     B l u e light. Lincoln walks up a long corridor, carrying a sealed
     plastic bag. Along the walls, poster-sized screens like those in
     the bar, display images of women, gyrating, licking their lips.

30   INT . PLEASURE CELL - NIGHT

     The blue light sustains. To one side is a mirrored wall, known
     as an "etherwall". It is currently pixellated t o display a grid
     of women's faces, artificial consorts waiting to be selected.
     Facing the etherwall i s a large aquarium-like tank, filled with
     gelatinous blue liquid. This vessel is known as a "sense tank".

     Lincoln sits at the rim, naked, wearing a full-head oxygen mask.
     He couples it to a hose dangling from the ceiling. Then lowers
     himself into the tank. On the inner facet, a touchlight k e y p a d
     resolves. Lincoln taps some keys and the etherwall a c k n o w l e d g e s :

     - - P L E A S U R E PARTNER SELECTED; PROGRAM COMMENCING...

     Lincoln looks out at the etherwall. The faces blink off to leave
     him staring at his reflection. Just one left, a pouting redhead,
     who licks her lips in anticipation as the lights dim.

                                                                       31.



     A holographic mist now rises. First resolving a proxy of Lincoln,
     naked, replicating his posture in the tank. Then the redhead is
     conjured, her buxom nudity glimpsed through the swirling mist.
     Lincoln proxy reaches out to stroke redhead proxy's breast. In
     the tank, Lincoln's fingers caress only the gel, his fingertips
     met by soft arcs of light - neurological charges, conducted by
     the gel, creating the sense of touch. They are known as "impulse
     arcs". Redhead proxy responds, dappling her lips across Lincoln
     proxy's neck. In the tank, impulse arcs flicker across Lincoln's
     throat, then down his chest, descending to more erogenous zones.
     Lincoln stiffens and closes his eyes, yielding to the sensation.

     The sensation engulfing him, Lincoln's brow starts to furrow. Not
     with ecstasy. Something darker. His eyes open, his pupils fixed
     in a black dilated stare. Resisting the artificiality, his face
     forming a sneer, tightening until... he slams h i s palm into the
     touchpad. The tank shakes. The proxies blink out. Lincoln stands
     mirrored in the etherwall. His hand, pressed against the glass in
     a posture of defiance. His reflection, warped and shuddering.

31   INT . ELEVATOR SHAFT

     F r o m darkness grows a seed of light. Red light, pulsing to reveal
     the shaft, lined by lode-poles, here in triangulated relay. The
     polarity cradles a dark mass towards us. An elevator in descent.

32   INT . DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

     Merrick   is at his console, working late. Off a buzz, he taps a
     button.   The door opens and an outsider enters - 40's, square set,
     hollow,   remote eyes. His hair is damp and he wears post-decon
     scrubs.   A USMC ring is visible on his finger. His name is SCHEER.

                                    MERRICK
                     K a r l . . . Welcome back.

     S c h e e r pauses, his face twitching. Then sneezes violently.

                              SCHEER
                     I forgot how much I hate the air here.

                                 MERRICK
                     J u s t a histamine reflex. Your system's
                     readjusting to the sterile environment.

                                 SCHEER
                     I t ' s the smell I hate. Empty.

                                 MERRICK
                     Yes , well I cut short your leave for a
                     reason. I take it you've been briefed?

                                                                     32.



                                SCHEER
                      ( s i t s , sniffing)
                O n e of our lab rats is missing.
W i t h a dour look, Merrick slots his etherboard i n t o a dock. A
proxy resolves over the console, quarter scale, spinning in 3D;
male, African American, bull neck. Data etches across thin air:

- - P R O D U C T ID: STARKWEATHER; FOUNDATION: II; GENERATION: DELTA;
- - I N T E G R A T I O N DATE: 01/27/84 // CONTAINMENT REF: 102, SECTOR 4

                           MERRICK
                His name is Starkweather Two-Delta. He
                dropped off the ether two days ago. At
                first we thought it was a system error.
                Then we found this in a garbage chute.

He opens a drawer and pulls out an ethercuff. He hands it to
Scheer who considers it remotely for a few seconds. Then-

                             SCHEER
                D e l t a generation, huh?

                              MERRICK
                That's right.

                          SCHEER
                I t was a Delta the last time.

                            MERRICK
                T h a t was entirely different. The
                product suffered a head injury.
                            SCHEER
                What happened to this one?

                          MERRICK
                We don't know. He just disappeared.
                           SCHEER
                N o t easy to disappear. Unless he
                figured a way through the boundary.

                            MERRICK
                He's a code two, Karl. A low functioner.
                          SCHEER
                I f you ask me, it's a mistake giving
                them any functions at all.

                            MERRICK
                The y don't function mentally, they don't
                function physically - you know that.

                                                                      33.



                           SCHEER
               The n perhaps if you're going to breed
               lab rats, you should breed them tame.
His look, albeit from a distance, throws a stone. Merrick hardens-

                         MERRICK
               I f you bothered to read the clone laws,
               you'd realize we have no choice in the
               matter. The virtual humanity statutes
               accord them a set of freedoms. All we
               can do is prescribe the limits. And
               even those are subject to regulation.
               Scope of knowledge, range of activity,
               even their speech patterns. The law
               requires that what is of human origin
               be provided with human characteristics.

                          SCHEER
               You mean, like fallibility?
Merrick pauses. He's not going to take the bait.

                          MERRICK
               The ether shows no attempts on the
               boundary. He's here, Karl. But for
               some reason, your men seem unable to
               find him. It's your job to contain the
               products. I'd like you to do it, okay?

                        SCHEER
               A little sensitive, aren't we?

                           MERRICK
               J u s t after Starkweather went missing,
               his sponsor placed an order. An order we
               can't fill. Damn right I'm sensitive.

                               SCHEER
               A l r i g h t . How much time do I have?

Merrick taps a button. A holoframe appears beside the proxy.
Even in two dimensions, the face is identical. Just a different
hairstyle and a gold earring. This is the face of The Sponsor.

                               MERRICK
               J a m i l Starkweather . . . last week he
               sustained a hepatic trauma resulting in
               liver hemorrhage. In medical terms, we
               have maybe a few weeks. In legal terms,
               we're already o n borrowed time...
                      ( a s Scheer rises to leave)
               An d Karl?

                                                                            34.



                                   MERRICK (cont'd)
                      I don't want a godawful m e s s like the
                      l a s t time. Minimal damage. Understood?

33   INT . LINCOLN'S APARTMENT - PREDAWN

     The horizon. The green mountains cast black by the predawn
     glower. Lincoln sits rigidly hunched on his bed, still in
     yesterday's clothes, sleepless. He is staring fixedly out of the
     window, hungrily, as if inviting the outer darkness to come in.

     His gaze lowers onto his jacket, slung across the bed. He digs
     in the pocket. And pulls out the cigarette pack. For a moment he
     considers it. Then slowly, purposefully, he opens it. He slips a
     cigarette between his lips. And lights up. He leans back, taking
     a slow drag. Exhaling, he watches the smoke rise. His gaze rests
     on the etherscreen above, expectant. The cursor comes to life:

     - - S C R E E N I N G . . . CONTAMINANT DETECTED: ADVISING SANITATION CTRL

     R e f l e c t e d in the ceiling, Lincoln grins at his small victory.
34   INT . RESIDENTIAL BLOCK - SECTOR FOUR

     Q u i e t , empty at this hour. Just the drum of footfalls as Lincoln
     marches up the walkway, puffing his cigarette. He stops at the
     ethergate, regarding it as if for the first time. Then he stubs
     out his cigarette. And swipes his ethercuff o v e r the scanner.

35   INT . THE ETHER GRID

     A blue dot blinks in space. We widen to establish its locus on a
     tomograph. Now building the boxes, the quadrants, the sectors.
     Revealing a vast, fully dimensional hologram of containment. It
     spins in the vaulted chamber like a giant geometrical phantom.

36   INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM

     O v e r l o o k i n g the ether, like a studio control booth. Known as
     "Ethercon", it's also the title of the Censor at the console.
     Scheer stands over him, now in a white censor uniform with black
     chevrons on the sleeves, marking his seniority. He instructs-

                                    SCHEER
                     R e v e r s e map. Crop to twelve hour
                     segments. Then put up a sub-grid.

     - - S T A R K W E A T H E R TWO-DELTA: ETHER HISTORY; REVERSE MAPPING...

     T o one side, a miniature of the ether grid resolves. It peppers
     with a series of blue dots. Then a blue line stems from a point
     of origin to start joining them. Scheer leans in, eyes honing,
     watching the blue line retrace the last steps of his quarry.

                                                                     35.



37   INT. NUTRITION PLAZA - SECTOR FOUR - PREDAWN

     The glass wall reprises the predawn glower. The plaza is empty
     at this hour. But the service counters are staffed as breakfast
     is being prepared. The clerk looks surprised to see Lincoln
     arriving so early. He seems grim, latent, stiffly swiping his
     ethercuff o v e r the scanner. She eyes the readout on her screen-

                                   N U T R I T I O N CLERK
                    Lincoln Six-Echo... Options are dried
                    fruit, oatmeal or anything in bran.

                             LINCOLN
                    I want some bacon.

                               N U T R I T I O N CLERK
                    You heard the options.

                               LINCOLN
                    An d coffee. I want coffee.
     The clerk sighs and taps her screen. Turning to the chutes, she
     collects a foil covered bowl and a juice can and sets them on
     Lincoln's tray. Lincoln glances down at it, then back up-

                                LINCOLN
                    This isn't what I asked for.

                               N U T R I T I O N CLERK
                    You want to get into it? Look, I just
                    work here, pal. I serve the meal and
                    make sure it goes down on your record.
     Lincoln nods slowly. Then picks up the bowl. And flings i t across
     the plaza. Then the juice can, trying to outdistance the bowl.
     Finally, the tray, which rotors almost to the far side before
     clattering into obscurity. Then he turns back to the clerk-

                               LINCOLN
                    P u t that on my fucking r e c o r d .

38   INT . SUBWAY PORTAL - SECTOR FOUR

     The latticed wall of ethergates. The rising beat of footfalls as
     Lincoln approaches. He swipes his ethercuff o v e r the scanner. The
     gate slowly hisses open. Too slowly for Lincoln, who kicks it and
     barges his way through, leaving the gate to shudder on its hinge.

39   INT . SUBWAY PLATFORM

     The walkways, unmoving. The platform, deserted. The echoing beat
     of footfalls as Lincoln marches up to the vending machine. He
     swipes his ethercuff o v e r the scanner. A screen illuminates:

                                                                36.



--SUGAR QUOTA EXCEEDED; ACCESS DENIED

Lincoln glowers at the message. His jaw clenching, twitching with
anger. Erupting, he lashes out, punching t h e machine. He winces
as his knuckles crack. Then grabs the machine, trying to rip it
off the wall. Pulling, straining, sneering with effort, until-

He lets go with a defeated gasp. Then kicks the machine in final
affront. The machine resounds with a dull boom. For a moment, he
stands there, chest heaving. Then suddenly traps his breath...

The r e , in the fading boom, a noise. Faint, rhythmic. Becoming
discernible as THE SOUND OF A MAN SOBBING. Lincoln turns toward
the platform. Tracing the sound, he crosses to the safety fence.

                           LINCOLN
               Hello?

His voice echoes to nothing. He leans over the fence and peers
up the tunnel. There. In the fog of darkness, a figure. A figure
paused, half-standing, like an animal on the brink of flight.
The figure seems to stare at him. Then pulls upright. Now moving
forward and into the light. His face is African American, bull-
n e c k e d , eyes wild and bloodshot. A stranger to Lincoln, we know
him as STARKWEATHER TWO-DELTA. His voice is quivering, unhinged-

                           STARKWEATHER
               Please...

Lincoln stands, frozen by the sight of this dark, dishevelled
resident. As he climbs up onto the platform, we see his hands,
the fingertips grated and bloody. He lumbers towards Lincoln-

                              STARKWEATHER
               P l e a s e , you have to help me...

He rushes forward, grabbing Lincoln, pulling him face-close-

                          STARKWEATHER
               Y O U CAN'T LET THEM TAKE ME!

The stranger's eyes grow darkly, his pupils abysmal, black with
dilation. Lincoln fiercely shrugs off his grip, backing away...

                          LINCOLN
               W h o are you? What's wrong with you?

The stranger's eyes bore into him, obsidian. Face contorting,
baring his teeth like a rabid dog. Suddenly he lunges a t Lincoln-
- B O O M - ramming him back into the vending machine - Lincoln is
stunned - suddenly a vice-like grip on his wrist swings him round-
- C R A C K - into the etherscreen banner, webbing at the impact...

                                                                           37.



     For a moment, all is a blur. Teetering, Lincoln props himself
     against the wall. Then his focus resolves on the etherscreen and
     his fractured reflection. He releases a deep, bewildered breath.
     Then he notices his wrist. His ethercuff i s missing, his skin,
     grazed red from abrasion. Confusion yielding to anger, he looks
     for his assailant. But the platform is empty. His jaw clenches.

40   INT . SUBWAY PORTAL - SECTOR FOUR

     T H E DRUM OF FOOTFALLS as Starkweather rushes up to the ethergate.
     H a n d shaking, he swipes Lincoln's ethercuff o v e r the scanner. The
     gate hisses open and he barrels through, suddenly spurred by --

     LINCOLN BURSTING UP from the well of walkways, charging forward
     like a bull. The gate now closing, Lincoln races for the gap,
     barging his way through. And the gate snaps shut with a CLANG.

41   INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM

     A N ALARM SOUNDS. The console flashes. Ethercon responds with a
     flurry of keystrokes. Scheer rejoins him as he pulls up a sub-
     g r i d . This one evolving past tomograph, mosaicing a n g l e s from
     etherscreen, conjugating a 3D l i v e feed known as an "etherview"--

                                                             M A T C H CUT TO:

42   INT . NUTRITION PLAZA - SECTOR FOUR - DAWN

     S T A R K W E A T H E R BARRELING ACROSS THE PLAZA; glancing off tables,
     sending chairs flying. Some residents, arriving for breakfast,
     scatter at his onset. Shocked faces, looking back and forth as
     Lincoln follows, in hot pursuit, vaulting the toppled furniture.

43   INT . ELEVATOR BANK - AN UPPER LEVEL

     A SQUAD OF CENSORS CONVERGING; called suddenly to duty, looping
     tri-keys r o u n d their necks, donning headsets, priming stopguns.
     S c h e e r leads them into the elevator, coolly relaying his orders-

                                   SCHEER
                    S u b j e c t headed into North Quadrant. Two-
                    m a n teams - we block him and force him
                    to ground. If you have a shot, hook him
                    but keep it above the belt. Management
                    doesn't want us to "damage the product".
     The Censors roll their eyes knowingly. Scheer taps his headset.

                                     S C H E E R (INTO HEADSET)
                    E t h e r c o n ? Sector Four North; code an
                    exclusion for tri-key a c c e s s . Then
                    give me a full quadrant lockdown.

                                                                          38.



44   INT. RESIDENTIAL BLOCK - SECTOR FOUR

     A VERTICAL ONTO A RESIDENTIAL BLOCK: the grid of crosswalks, the
     tiers of frosted facades; quiet, the residents still dormant--

     A DRUM OF FOOTFALLS: Then a figure breaking frame, racing up the
     walkway of an upper floor; then another figure, in hot pursuit --

     T H E LOCKDOWN I N I T I A T E S : the lights shifting spectrum from white
     to ultraviolet, bathing the quadrant in a lambent purple haze--

     S T A R K W E A T H E R : his eyes bulging with panic as he races up the
     walkway, straining for an ethergate a t the far end of the floor--

     LINCOLN : his eyes charged with adrenaline, straining to close
     ground on his assailant; oblivious to the building noise of--

     T H E LOCKDOWN: locks hissing, lights flashing, ripping up the row
     of frosted facades; sweeping past Lincoln and onward toward--

     S T A R K W E A T H E R : the ripple of hissing locks rushing up on him, he
     pours on the pace, sneering with effort as he tries to outrace--

     T H E LOCKDOWN: the ripple spearing ahead of him to the end of the
     floor; now banking across the ethergate a n d sealing the exit.

     S T A R K W E A T H E R : stalled by the realization he's trapped; he spins
     round, looking for another avenue of escape only to find--

     LINCOLN: blindsiding h i s assailant with a headlong tackle; both
     men toppling over, hitting the floor with a bone-jarring thud--

     S T A R K W E A T H E R : quick to recover, breaking lose of entanglement;
     now struggling to his feet, stumbling onward up the walkway--

     LINCOLN : gets up to resume pursuit, then pauses, spotting his
     ethercuff, discarded on the ground. He looks up in confusion at--

     S T A R K W E A T H E R : a short distance ahead, climbing over the walkway
     rail; launching himself off, into a seemingly suicidal plummet--

     LINCOLN : leaning over the rail, seeing his assailant land safely
     on a crosswalk beneath, resuming his flight on the lower floor as-

     - B O O M - A GUNBLAST r i p s the air. A KEENING SOUND builds to a wail-
     - T H U D - LINCOLN JOLTS as something hits his shoulder, catching him
     off-balance, a stab of pain keeling him onto the rail -CLANG -

     LINCOLN SLUMPS INTO FG - TWO CENSORS converging like white ghosts
     from the purple haze - one reprimanding his recalcitrant cohort-

                                                                           39.



                               CENSOR
                    You asshole! You hooked the wrong one!
     He crouches to examine Lincoln. Blood is blossoming from a wound
     on his shoulder, jutting from which is a projectile. The censor
     presses its base and it snaps loose of its unintended target.

     N o w we see the projectile more clearly. A fat metal pellet, snub-
     n o s e d , finned at the tail by four metal teeth. On impact, the
     nose recesses to release a springload a n d the teeth snap forward
     to bite into the target. This device is known as a "hookhead".

                                     CENSOR
                    J u s t a flesh wound. `Hit his head
                    pretty hard. Possible concussion.
                           ( i n s p e c t i n g Lincoln's pupils)
                    T h i n k you can walk, buddy?

     Lincoln nods slightly. The censor unloops a tri-key f r o m his neck-

                               CENSOR
                    You see this? It'll get you past the
                    lockdown. You're to report to The
                    Medical Center. You understand?

     O f f Lincoln's blank stare, the censor presses the tri-key i n t o
     his palm. Then departs. Lincoln stays where he sits, still dazed
     from the concussion. Absently he watches the censors race off up
     the walkway, dissolving back into the purple haze as we-

                                                                     C U T TO:

45   INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM
     S T A R K W E A T H E R RUNNING. Meeting white uniforms at every turn, zig-
     z a g g i n g o v e r crosswalks, down ramps. The rat in the maze, dumb to
     its inevitable destination. Widening, we see we are watching the
     action on etherview, racking and dollying like a deific e y e .

                                E T H E R C O N (INTO HEADSET)
                    E a s t side team hold position. Subject
                    headed for the second floor crossramp.

46   INT . GROUND FLOOR - RESIDENTIAL BLOCK
     C l o a k e d in shadow, Scheer listens to the play-by-play on headset.
     With a tap, he changes the channel, whispering to his squad-

                                S C H E E R (INTO HEADSET)
                    G i v e him some space. I have him.
     A N O T H E R ANGLE: Starkweather hits the deck running, sprinting up
     the avenue. In BG, Scheer steps forth, stopgun l e v e l l e d , aiming--

                                                                             40.



     -BOOM- The flash of the muzzle, the shrill wail of the hookhead.

     - T H U D - Starkweather jolts as the shot hits him square in the
     back, arching as the hookhead b i t e s ; but he keeps on running-

     - B O O M - B O O M - B O O M - Scheer unleashes his ordnance, filling the air.

     - T H U D - T H U D - T H U D - Starkweather jolts from one, two, three more
     hits; hookheads b i t i n g , spraying blood; but he keeps on running.
                                 S C H E E R (INTO HEADSET)
                      A l l clear. Flood the area.

     A N O T H E R ANGLE; Floor level, as between the tiles, tiny red lights
     start blinking, rippling forward in a wave. Known as "lode-pins"
     their small magnetic pulses accumulate into a low level stream.

     The hookheads c l a w e d in Starkweather's back also start blinking
     red. The invisible stream flowing beneath his feet, Starkweather
     feels its force. The duelling polarities stealing his traction.
     His run reducing to a slipsliding s t a g g e r . Then his feet leave
     the ground. He flails for a handhold. But there's nothing. The
     force lifts him a foot clear off the ground before balancing out
     to dangle him in mid-air, squirming about like a fish on a hook.

     A N O T H E R ANGLE; Scheer advances to reel in his catch. The stream
     bows before him, red lights blinking out. Until all that remains
     is the section where Starkweather hangs suspended. Scheer stops
     at its limit, looking up at him like some curious zoo exhibit.

                                  S C H E E R (INTO HEADSET)
                      H o o d him, cuff him, patch the bleed.
                      Then let's get him up to Level Three.
     A N O T H E R ANGLE: looking down from high above as the Censors move
     in on Starkweather. Scheer now walking away, tapping his headset-

                                       S C H E E R (INTO HEADSET)
                      E t h e r c o n ? Send word to dispatch.
                      Starkweather Two-Delta is secured.

     R E V E R S E ANGLE: Lincoln in CU, looking down. He has seen and heard
     all that has just passed. In his eyes, we see his daze clearing,
     consciousness coalescing, deepening. His pupils dilating into a
     deep and uncanny stare. What can only be described as a dawning.
47   INT . NUTRITION PLAZA - SECTOR FOUR - LATER

     N o w full but unusually quiet. Residents sit in whispered, anxious
     discourse. The news of the incident is spreading. Off a series of
     chimes, eyes turn to the glass wall, now pixellating i n t o an
     outsider's face - calm, official. THE COMMUNITY ANNOUNCER begins-

                                                                      41.



                                COMMUNITY ANNOUNCER
                    Good morning - this is a community
                    bulletin... Following an incident in
                    Sector Four earlier this morning, The
                    Department of Sanitation is issuing an
                    all-sector contamination warning...

     TRACKING the rapt concern of the residents, Ester among them.

                               COMMUNITY ANNOUNCER
                    The incident involved a resident found
                    to be infected with a pathogen. While
                    the risk is assessed, residents are
                    advised to be aware of the symptoms.
                    Should you experience aberrant levels
                    of anxiety or witness it in others,
                    immediately contact The Medical Center.

48   INT . DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

     The proxy of Starkweather spins over the desk. Merrick regards
     i t with a frown. Scheer sits turning the ethercuff i n his fingers
     with a demeanor of cool curiosity. Underneath, he's rattled.

                               SCHEER
                    You want to tell me what's going on?

                                   MERRICK
                    There's nothing going on, Karl.

                               SCHEER
                    I'm jaded. Not stupid.

                                  MERRICK
                    What's your point?

                             SCHEER
                    I checked up. In the past year, three
                    products have destabilized. All of them
                    Deltas... and there's nothing going on?

                                  MERRICK
                    You're jumping to conclusions.

                                SCHEER
                    Once I can overlook. Twice I can call
                    coincidence. Three times I start giving
                    a shit. Because if these products are
                    defective...

                                   MERRICK
                    Q u a l i t y control is not your concern.

                                                               42.



                        SCHEER
              S o it is a quality control issue?

                            MERRICK
              That's not what I said.

                        SCHEER
              He was in the subway tunnels for two
              days. In the dark, no food, no water.
              His fingers were scraped to the bone.
              He was trying to dig his way out. Now
              you try to explain to me why that is.

His look says he smells a rat. Merrick weighs him a moment. Then
sighs, a little depleted. He gets up and crosses to the glass
wall. Looks down on the avenue, at the agnates m i l l i n g beneath.

                               MERRICK
              It's not an exact science - biogenesis.
              There's a degree of trial and error. If
              the agnate doesn't come together on the
              first pass, we have to abort and start
              over. It's like breaking inertia. The
              bioreactor, the growth medium - we just
              keep upping the levels till we achieve
              integration. At which stage the agnate
              is deemed physically stable. We rely on
              foundation to provide mental stability -
              matching the templates to their capacity
              but walling it in with parameters.
                     ( b e a t , considers the proxy)
              When signs of instability started to
              show up, it pointed to foundation. A
              hole in the wall, an oversight. But it
              was only happening in the later generat-
              ions . Which pointed back to biogenesis.

                        SCHEER
              So there was a production defect.

                              MERRICK
              Actually the opposite. We found out in
              the later generations, the levels were
              so high that when we broke inertia, the
              process kept going. Over-integrating.
              Specifically the neural system. It
              produced a condition called synesthesia.

                       SCHEER
              Synesthesia...

                                                                  43.



                             MERRICK
               A fusion of the senses, creating a
               component awareness. Sixth sense,
               s e c o n d sight, whatever you want to call
               it. Its emergence seems to be arbitrary.
               But it gives them experiences beyond
               their functional parameters. And
               ultimately... it destabilizes them.
               However, if we catch it early enough we
               can control it with re-conditioning.

Scheer absorbs this with a slow grin. Merrick looks puzzled.

                          MERRICK
               You find this amusing?

                          SCHEER
               Poetic.

                          MERRICK
               Poetic?

                           SCHEER
               This "agnate" took off just before his
               sponsor placed an order. Maybe he got
               the sense his days were numbered...

Merrick ' s composure cracks a little. He hadn't thought of this.

                           MERRICK
               This stays between you and me, Karl. I
               trust I can rely on your cooperation?

                            SCHEER
               Don't you mean my complicity?

                                MERRICK
                      (hardening again)
               Remind me, why is it you were
               discharged from the military?

                             SCHEER
               What's your point?

                            MERRICK
               Learn to be a team player, Karl. Or
               you'll find yourself out of another
               job.

Scheer rises, discarding the ethercuff onto Merrick's desk.

                             SCHEER
               Nobody else would take it.

                                                                     44.



49   INT. EXTRACTOR SHAFT

     The deep steady thrum of the extractor fans. We are TIGHT ON the
     frame of an airlock. Hissing, it indents and opens. Lincoln steps
     through, eyes black and uncanny. The tri-key g l i n t i n g , dangling
     from his fingers. Scanning around, he fixes on a section of wall.
     He wipes off some soot. Legible beneath is a number. Twenty. He
     assimilates this. Then turns his gaze up the extractor shaft.

50   INT . ELEVATOR SHAFT

     Looking up an elevator shaft. The red pulse of the lode-poles,
     rippling downward as an elevator descends from the surface.

51   INT . OUTER THRESHOLD - LEVEL THREE

     A tiled chamber. Draped off cubicles. The elevator doors slide
     open. An outsider emerges, dressed in a flightsuit, emblazoned
     "Medical Courier". He announces himself, seemingly to no one-

                                      T H E COURIER
                     Clearance code: NG-230-2DS.

                                V O I C E ON SPEAKER
                     New Gaza Healthcare. Okay, you're
                     clear. Go ahead and get undressed.

52   INT . DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER

     The pressure door hisses, heaving open. The courier steps inside,
     naked, covering his genitals, some goggles slung around his neck.
     He takes position on two marked footpads and puts on the goggles-

                              T H E COURIER
                     I tell you, I hate this fucking r u n . I
                     always leave this place with sunburn.

                                V O I C E ON SPEAKER
                     Try full-course decontamination. It's
                     even more fun. Especially the colonics.

     The lights blink out. A red glow rises. Twin planes of light
     scrape across the courier, infra-red, searing his epidermis.

53   INT . INNER THRESHOLD - LEVEL THREE

     A chamber like the first. The inner pressure door hisses open.
     The courier emerges, dripping wet from a decon s h o w e r . He goes
     to a cubicle, grabbing a towel and dries himself off. Laid out
     within are some scrubs. Beside them is A STEEL COOLER, inset
     with a thermostat and embossed with the crosshatch insignia.

                                                                     45.



54   INT. CORRIDOR - LEVEL THREE

     The courier strolls up the corridor, now dressed in the scrubs
     and carrying the cooler. He turns a corner and his footsteps
     gradually fade out. A flat, sterile silence falls in his wake.

     A metal squeal. A ventilation grid levers down from the ceiling.
     A pause. Then a pair of feet drop through, legs, torso. Dropping
     to the floor, Lincoln stands revealed. Sweaty, smeared black
     with dust. For a moment he looks around to get his bearings.
     Suddenly he freezes, hearing-

                                  A VOICE (O.S.)
                     C h e c k in at the nurse's station. Up
                     the corridor, left, then first right.

     The footsteps are now coming back. Lincoln spins round. He finds
     a door. A lock panel. A moment of panic. Then he fumbles the tri-
     k e y f r o m his pocket, hurriedly slotting it into the lock panel.

55   INT . THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR - SECONDS LATER

     Lincoln waits, ear to the door, listening as the footsteps pass
     and fade out of earshot. Lincoln releases his breath in relief,
     calming a little, then frowning as he registers another sound.

     Very faint, rhythmic. He turns and looks around. The room is in
     partial shadow. To one side is a row of seats, to the other, a
     row of windows, covered by blinds, light creasing through. The
     sound repeats. Muffled. But now unmistakably THE CRY OF A BABY.

56   INT . HARVEST ROOM

     A grid of bio-readouts, each square alive with graphs and digits.
     The familiar baseline of a cardiograph. A lever-arm mounted with
     an IV r e s e r v o i r , dangling tubes and wires onto the OR table.

     We see A DOCTOR and A MIDWIFE, in whose arms A NEWBORN BABY
     squirms and bawls. Lying on the table, we see THE MOTHER, her
     feet up in stirrups, deeply flushed and puffing from exertion.
     Marked by her crosshatch as an agnate, she has just given birth-

                                THE AGNATE MOTHER
                     May I hold her?

                               THE DOCTOR
                     We have to run a few tests on her first.
                     In the meantime, I'm going to give you
                     something to help you relax, okay?

     Off his smile, the agnate mother nods, anxiously watching the
     midwife wrap her baby in blanket. The doctor taps a button and
     watches the IV reservoir misting with a pale colored fluid.

                                                                              46.



     The cardiograph marks the drop as the fast-acting sedative takes
     effect. The agnate mother watches drowsily as the midwife takes
     her baby from the room. Then the cry of the newborn is shut out.
     J u s t the cardiograph now, the beeps evening out, the scart o f
     peaks shallowing a s the agnate mother falls asleep. The doctor
     taps a button. On the grid, the face of a DESK NURSE appears.

                                 THE DOCTOR
                        I'm incubating the baby for 24 hours
                        prior to transport. But go ahead and
                        contact the sponsor. Tell her she has
                        a beautiful baby girl.

     The nurse nods. The grid square goes blank. A pause. Then the
     doctor taps another button. Text appears. Reading it, he cites-

                                    THE DOCTOR
                        Let the record show the sponsor has
                        signed Clause 22 of The Basic Sponsor-
                        s h i p Agreement. Initiate compliance.

     A light starts blinking. The doctor walks stiffly out of the
     room. The door hisses closed. The agnate mother is left alone.
     Sleeping peacefully, blind to the fluid now seeping into her IV.
     D e a f to the slowing beep of the cardiograph. The peaks of the
     baseline falling. Spacing, fading, slowing, slowing, until...
     The cardiograph flatlines. An d a sepulchral stillness falls. Our
     angle widens with the growing emptiness. The lifelessness.

57   INT . OBSERVATION ROOM

     Lincoln looks down from above, eyes frozen in the slatted light.
     His fingers are trembling, rattling the blinds against the glass.

58   INT . CORRIDOR

     Lincoln tumbles out of the door. He can't breathe, can't think,
     his mind is in overload. He stumbles around like a wounded
     animal. His focus suddenly and searingly r e t u r n s as he hears-

                                          DESK NURSE (O.S.)
                        Starkweather ? Like the football player?

59   INT . NURSES STATION - LEVEL THREE - CONTINUOUS

     A rotunda spoked by corridors. A console at its hub, manned by
     the desk nurse we saw earlier. The courier stands over her-

                                      THE COURIER
                        That's right. Starkweather.

                                                                       47.



                                 DESK NURSE
                    Still showing in surgery. Sorry.

                                  THE COURIER
                    Honey, I got a bird on the pad and a
                    storm moving in. How long's it gonna be?

60   INT . ANOTHER OPERATING ROOM

     Another grid of readouts. Another cardiograph beeps. A spotlamp
     illuminates the OR table and STARKWEATHER TWO-DELTA - his face,
     slack with anesthesis, eyes rolling a little beneath the lids.
     The rest of him under a sheet, cut out over the belly, the flesh
     slit and parted by a clamp, framing a window into his innards.

     Standing over him, mid-operation, A SURGEON and SURGICAL TECH.
     Interrupted by a chime, the surgeon looks up at a screen, where
     a panel flashes: "PAGING". He cradles his bloody gloves and
     elbows a button. The face of the desk nurse resolves on screen-

                               DESK NURSE (ON SCREEN)
                    The courier's here for pickup.

                                THE SURGEON
                    Well he's going to have to wait a while.
                    It took forever to put this one under.

                                SURGICAL TECH (O.S.)
                    Doctor...

                                DESK NURSE (ON SCREEN)
                    He's asking for an ETA. Said something
                    about some kind of storm moving in.

                               THE SURGEON
                    For Christ's sake, is that my fault?
                    Just find a way to stall him, okay?

                                S U R G I C A L TECH (O.S.)
                    Doctor.

                                SURGEON
                    What is it?

                                     SURGICAL TECH
                    Subject's heart rate is spiking.

                               SURGEON
                    Not again. Boost the anaesthetic lev...

     Suddenly he's sprayed with blood a s the clamp springs loose from
     the stomach, clattering to the floor. He's frozen by shock as...

                                                                               48.



     Starkweather sits bolts upright. Dazed, he looks at the surgeon,
     the tech, then down at his wide-open stomach. Instinctively, he
     clutches it. Then, his mind assimilating the horror, he SCREAMS.
     Now launching off the operating table, the lever-arm swinging
     out, blindsiding t h e tech - tubes and wires snapping loose -
     instruments flying - Starkweather lunges for the doorway - the
     surgeon steps up to block him - only to be hurled aside...

61   INT . CORRIDOR - LEVEL THREE

     THE BLARE OF AN ALARM. Starkweather, clumping down the corridor,
     clutching his open stomach, blood streaming down his legs. He's
     delirious, running nowhere, anywhere, running blind. Reaching the
     end of the corridor, he stops suddenly, seeing WHITE UNIFORMS.
     He doubles back up the corridor. Kicking at doors with bare feet,
     frantic for any means of escape. He spots a ventilator grid,
     slightly open. He jumps, reaching for it. Once, twice, then his
     feet slip from under him. He hits the floor with a damp splat.
     TWO CENSORS turn the corner, ready for action. But there is
     Starkweather, face-down in a starburst o f his own blood.

                                    CENSOR (INTO HEADSET)
                       Yeah, no sweat, subject is secured.

62   INT . DUCTING - MINUTES LATER

     POVCEILING VENTILATOR GRID. Looking down through the slits onto
     Starkweather directly beneath. He now has a loose white hood over
     his head. His wrists and ankles are bound by plastic cuffs. A
     loop of intestine plumps out from his belly. His weight is such
     that the Censors have to drag him away, leaving a bloodsmear o n
     the floor. His guttural whimpers are the only sign of life.

     CLOSEUP: Lincoln's face in part shadow, looking down. The gleam
     of his eyes as Starkweather disappears from view. Listening now,
     to those feeble whimpers, growing fainter, ever fainter until
     they disappear from earshot. Silence again. Emptiness. All that
     remains of Starkweather is a wending bloodsmear o n the floor.

                                                           SLOW FADE TO BLACK.

63   INT . BEDROOM - DAWN

     The horizon. The green mountains in different aspect, framed by
     a different window. The bedroom is like Lincoln's but with a few
     feminine touches. Ester, in her papery pajamas, sits brushing
     her hair. With a chime, etherscreen scales over her reflection:
     - - E T H E R C A L L P E N D I N G ; ACCEPT OR SEND TO MESSAGE BANK?--

                                                                        49.



                                  ESTER
                    Accept.
     The etherscreen resolves Lincoln's face, dishevelled, urgent-

                                    LINCOLN (ON ETHERSCREEN)
                    Ester . . . I have to talk to you.

                                    ESTER
                    Lincoln ? Are you okay? I was worried.

                                LINCOLN (ON ETHERSCREEN)
                    What are you talking about?

                               ESTER
                    The contamination warning. Somebody
                    said you'd been exposed.

     Lincoln pauses to process this. Hunted, more cautious now-

                             LINCOLN (ON ETHERSCREEN)
                    I want you to meet me as soon as you
                    can. But you can't tell anyone.

                              ESTER
                    Is it true? Were you contaminated?

                               LINCOLN (ON ETHERSCREEN)
                    You know where to come.

     His face blinks out. Ester is left frowning at her reflection.

64   INT . BEDROOM - LINCOLN'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Lincoln stares at his own mirror image. His eyes, fraught with
     revelation. His clothes, begrimed with dirt and blood. He rests
     his head against the etherscreen panel, shuddering, pressing his
     eyes tightly closed. As if he could ever forget what he's seen.

65   INT . CENTERVILLE - DAY

     The routine flow of residents up the avenue. Lincoln walks, head
     bowed, trying to look inconspicuous. Showered, white shirt and
     blue slacks under his shearling, he looks a little too scrubbed,
     too clean. He spots a familiar figure up ahead. He catches up.

                                  LINCOLN
                    Jonesy. . .

     J o n e s lets him fall into step with a look of mild curiosity-

                                                                           50.



                                 JONES
                     Hey, champ. Are you alright? I heard
                     there was a contamination scare.

                              LINCOLN
                     I saw what happened to him.

                                 JONES
                     What are you talking about?

                                       LINCOLN
                     Starkweather . . . What they did to him.

     Jones huffs, dismissively. Lincoln grabs his shoulder, ardent-

                                 LINCOLN
                     They cut him open, Jonesy. The y took
                     him upstairs and they cut him open.

     Jones holds his gaze a moment, then shrugs off his grip.

                                JONES
                     You caught that fucking p a t h o g e n ,
                     didn't you? You're contaminated.

                                    LINCOLN
                     J o n e s y , listen to me...
     But Jones just backs away. Lincoln makes to follow. Then stops
     dead in his tracks. Across the avenue, TWO CENSORS are on patrol
     and his best friend is now heading towards them. With a barren,
     torn grimace, Lincoln turns away and melts back into the crowd.

66   INT . COMMUNITY CENTER - CENTERVILLE - LATER

     R i n g s of empty seats round the empty stage. Ester enters warily,
     walking up the aisle. Lincoln waits in the shadows. He checks to
     see she hasn't been followed. Then steps forward. Ester recoils-

                                      ESTER
                     Please . . . don't come any closer. I
                     don't want to get contaminated.

                                   LINCOLN
                     Ester, I'm not contaminated.

                                ESTER
                     But they said...

                                LINCOLN
                     I'm not contaminated!

                                                                  51.



His shout echoes through the empty auditorium. Ester looks at
him, alarmed by his vehemence. Lincoln calms himself a little-

                                 LINCOLN
               Contaminants, pathogens... it's just
               what they tell us to keep us inside.

                           ESTER
               What do you mean?

                        LINCOLN
               I saw it. Why they keep us here. To
               use us. To take things from us.

                             ESTER
               You're not making sense.

                           LINCOLN
               Your baby... they're going to take
               your baby away... you understand?

                         ESTER
               M y baby? Why would they do that?

                        LINCOLN
               I don't know! But I saw it!

                             ESTER
               You're scaring me, Lincoln...
               I want to go back now.

                          LINCOLN
               You can't go back! Don't you get it?
                             A VOICE (O.S.)
               N o b o d y move! Stay right where you are!

A CENSOR steps through, stopgun l e v e l l e d . Ester freezes. Lincoln
hovers, mind racing. The censor moves in, tightening aim on him.
Ester looks on anxiously as he approaches Lincoln. Lincoln now
sees the censor pulling out some plastic cuffs. The same cuffs
used on Starkweather, promising the same fate... TRIGGERING HIM--

LINCOLN LUNGES AT THE CENSOR - ramming him - toppling him across
the seats - knocking the stopgun f r o m his grasp - recoiling as--

THE CENSOR RETALIATES - driving a knee into his groin, doubling
him over - then a knee to his head - THUDDING INTO HIS SKULL-

                            ESTER
               Don't hurt him!

                                                                        52.



     ESTER RUNS UP grabbing at the white uniform, trying to restrain
     him - the censor swats her blindly - hitting her in the stomach--
     LINCOLN SPINS ROUND at the sound of Ester's yelp - only to be
     roundhoused b y the censor - the blow sending him to the floor--

     Ester DOUBLED OVER - wincing at the pain - clutching her belly
     instinctively, protectively - an ominous scowl knotting her face-
     THE CENSOR PUNISHING LINCOLN - kicking him down the aisle - then
     suddenly hearing a noise from behind - turning to face it as --

     - B O O M - A GUNBLAST R I P S THE AIR. The brief wail of a hookhead.

     - T H U D - THE CENSOR RECOILING - lurching as the hookhead b i t e s -
     starting to gag - blood jetting from his neck - a hookhead
     c l a w e d into his jugular - gurgling, collapsing to the floor--

     Ester STANDING FROZEN - holding the stopgun - seeing Lincoln now
     getting up - she drops the stopgun l i k e it's on fire, aghast-

                                ESTER
                     Lincoln?

     L i k e she's asking him what she did... Silence - the rasp of the
     censor, blood foaming - another sound - FOOTFALLS. Lincoln goes
     to the door - an IMMINENT MASS OF WHITE UNIFORMS. He grabs Ester-

                                LINCOLN
                     RUN!!!

67   INT . FOYER - THE COMMUNITY CENTER

     CENSORS BURSTING IN - led by Scheer, pushing through into the
     main hall - the statue of Dr. Sanger looking serenely down--

68   INT . MAINTENANCE CORRIDOR - BEHIND THE COMMUNITY CENTER

     A HISS OF DEPRESSURIZATION - a pressure door swings open - Lincoln
     and Ester tumbling through - running up the maintenance corridor--

69   INT . COMMUNITY CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

     CENSORS FANNING OUT - sweeping the hall, stopguns r e a d y - Scheer
     finds the fallen Censor - crouches to examine him, then-

                                     SCHEER
                     Somebody get someone down here!

     A Censor splits off to join him, tapping his headset - Scheer
     rises again - in his eyes, detachment yields to cold intensity--

                                                                     53.



70   INT. VARIOUS CORRIDORS - CONTAINMENT INFRASTRUCTURE

     THE CENSORS: flooding through into the maintenance corridor, in
     their white uniforms, they seem like a swarm of antibodies--

     LINCOLN AND ESTER: deeper in, at another pressure door, fumbling
     the trikey i n t o the lock. A tense second. The lock hisses open--

     SCHEER : pushes through the opening gap of another pressure door,
     taking the lead, his Censors surging up in his wake --

     LINCOLN AND ESTER: meeting an intersection, veering at random,
     running blind, running deeper into the faceless labyrinth--

     SCHEER : catching up, hitting the intersection, pausing to split
     his squad in each direction - white uniforms dispersing--

     LINCOLN AND ESTER: reaching another pressure door. Footsteps
     audible. Lincoln jams the tri-key i n t o the lock. And waits. The
     seconds pass. But the door doesn't open. Lincoln looks around
     for another exit. Ester looks at him in mounting panic then--
     THE PRESSURE DOOR OPENS: not onto a corridor but an elevator
     car. Pulling Ester inside, Lincoln finds an array of buttons.
     His fingers hovers, uncertain which to press. So he punches all
     of them, stabbing madly, trying to prompt the door to close.
     SCHEER : turns a corner, seeing his quarry at the far end of the
     corridor, he gathers pace. The elevator is closing but he doesn't
     break stride. He deftly taps his headset, opening a channel to--

                                     SCHEER (ON HEADSET)
                    Ethercon! The elevator - override it!
                    Do you read me? Bring it back down!

71   INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM

     Ethercon is working the console keys like a madman. His gaze
     flitting to a subgrid o f the complex, spinning the angles,
     navigating the mesh of lines. His voice comes apologetically-

                                  ETHERCON (INTO HEADSET)
                    You're off the grid, sir. Give me a
                    second. Can you tell me where you are?

     He recoils at the blaring volume of the response.

72   INT . CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE THE ELEVATOR

     Scheer stands with his Censors, poised, watching the panel chart
     the elevator's descent. A light flashes and the doors open. They
     level their stopguns o n . . . nothing. The elevator is empty.

                                                                       54.



                                      SCHEER (INTO HEADSET)
                    Foundation Levels - all of them. Lock
                    them down. Access only on my command.

73   INT . FOUNDATION LEVEL

     A dead acoustic. A corridor paved with sound proofing panels. It
     ends at a pressure door, where Lincoln and Ester now arrive.
     Lincoln looks back to the elevator at the other end. No going
     back. He slots the tri-key into the lock. The door hisses open.

74   INT . FOUNDATION CHAMBERS

     Amber light. The sound of slow bubbling. Lincoln and Ester pause
     to adjust to the gloom. They are in a hall of windows. Ester is
     the first to venture forth, as if drawn, to the nearest window.

     Behind the glass is a foundation tank. Bubbling with viscous
     fluid, laced with various tubes pulsing matter to and fro. The
     tubes connect to a form. A human form, an adult form but curled
     foetally. I t is known as a "nascent". In this tank is a female
     nascent, shifting slightly, causing Ester to gasp. The nascent
     registers the noise, turning its head. Its eyelids are closed but
     its eyeballs move, questioning. A slight furrow appears on its
     crosshatched brow. Ester recoils in sudden horror, perhaps
     remembering on some deep level that this is where she came from.

                                  LINCOLN
                    Ester ! Come on!

     Spurred to action, Ester follows Lincoln onward up the hall.
     Still conscious of movement all around, of nascents stirring at
     the sound of their footfalls like the ripples of a nightmare.

75   INT . FOUNDATION CHAMBER

     A STOPGUN n o s e s through the door. Followed by Scheer moving in
     silence, honed. How much time has passed is unclear. He signals
     his censors to split off. Tracking Scheer's advance, we INTERCUT:
     ANOTHER FOUNDATION CHAMBER: Censors making their sweep. Strobes
     of light from an armature mechanism moving up the row of tanks.
     It angles to project a grid across each nascent's face, then
     fires a short laser burst, searing a crosshatch into the brow.
     ANOTHER FOUNDATION CHAMBER: another contingent moves up another
     row of foundation tanks. The nascents within have cables plugged
     into their ears, filaments pulsing. The nascents a r e in a posture
     of rigor, sinews straining as they accept the data impression.

     RETURNING TO SCHEER as he reaches the end of the first chamber.
     No further access, just a continuing wrap of foundation tanks.
     He pauses, confused for a second. One of the censors comes up-

                                                                    55.



                                      CENSOR
                      Nothing , sir. No sign.

                                  SCHEER
                      They can't have got past this level.

     Scheer peels off his headset, giving full leash to his senses,
     straining to concentrate. Seconds of pent silence. Then he hears
     a faint humming. His gaze slowly drifts up to a ventilator grid.

76   INT . / EXT . THE FUNNEL - NIGHT

     A POV LOOKING UP. The funnel mouth framing a vista of the world
     outside. A hostile vista of black sky, maelstroms of sand. The
     sound of blasting air, suborned to the giant howl of a DUSTSTORM.
     A HAND. Reaching over the funnel lip as Lincoln pulls himself up
     with a mighty effort. Blinking, blinded by the sand, he swings
     astride the lip. Then he reaches down to pull Ester up. Ester
     gains the lip and likewise swings astride, coughing, blinking.
     T H E DUSTY EARTH as Lincoln leaps down to meet it. We track up as
     he helps Ester down from the funnel. Her feet meeting the earth,
     we are now in CU o n their faces. Gaping and blinking at the
     prospect of the world outside. A world of darkness and storm.

     SUDDEN BLINDING LIGHT as halogens explode the darkness. Lincoln
     shields his eyes, scanning for their source. He spots a large
     cubic building, banks of spotlights on the roof. He pulls Ester
     away. Away from the lights and towards the safety of darkness.

77   INT . EXTRACTOR SHAFT

     T H E THRUM OF EXTRACTOR FANS. Scheer pacing on a catwalk. White
     uniforms above and below, flashlights roving, sliced by the
     blades of the extractor fans. From somewhere, comes a shout-

                                  C E N S O R (O.S.)
                      Sir ! We got em! Motion sensors just
                      picked them up at the surface!

78   EXT . FRONT OF THE INSTITUTE - NIGHT

     ANOTHER BURST OF HALOGENS. More spotlights engage, their blaze
     flooding across the foreview, catching two figures; Lincoln and
     Ester, running, now, veering sharply away from the light. Now
     disappearing from sight, dropping into the trench of the lodeway.

79   INT . MAINTENANCE ELEVATOR - CONTAINMENT

     THE RISING HUM OF THE LODE-POLES. The elevator crammed with
     censors. Scheer at the front, staring ahead. He looks very
     focused, bitterly so. The look of a man outwitted by lab rats.

                                                                 56.



80   EXT. THE LODEWAY - NIGHT

     THE DARKNESS OF THE TRENCH. Lincoln and Ester running along the
     lode-way, stumbling over the buffers. Above them, the dust
     flails in lashing tongues, starkly depicted by the halogens.

81   EXT . PROCESSING PLANT - NIGHT

     WHITE UNIFORMS IN THE NIGHT - censors spill forth into the
     halogen light, splitting in all directions. Scheer suddenly
     notices the corona of light from the front of the complex. He
     barks something inaudible to his men, launching into a run.

82   EXT . THE GATEWAY - NIGHT
     THE GATEWAY LOOMING ABOVE. Beneath, Lincoln and Ester, on their
     knees, clawing at the dust. Like burrowing animals, trying to
     widen the gap between the foot of the gate and the lodeway.

83   EXT . FRONT OF THE INSTITUTE - NIGHT
     A LONE WHITE UNIFORM. As Scheer reaches the forecourt, stopping
     to scan the spotlit view, the veils of the duststorm. His face
     tightening with urgency. Suddenly he taps his headset, barking-

                               S C H E E R (INTO HEADSET)
                    The lodeway! Flood it! Light it up!

84   EXT . THE GATEWAY - NIGHT

     THE RISING HUM OF THE LODE-POLES barely audible over the storm.
     Lincoln and Ester, washed by pulsing red light. Ester recoiling,
     her arm flinging back from the pull. Lincoln grabbing her, his
     own arm straining now. The polarity tugging their ethercuffs.

85   EXT . THE LODEWAY - NIGHT

     THE RED WASH OF LIGHT from the lodeway as Scheer races up the
     edge, eyes trawling the trench for his quarry. His pace now
     suddenly dropping, slowing to a halt. He doubles over, catching
     his breath. More white uniforms now appear from the dust as the
     Censors, unable to match his pace, finally catch up. The first
     reaching him, Scheer pulls upright, bellowing over the wind-

                               SCHEER
                    G e t me a bird!

                             CENSOR
                    A bird?! In this storm?!

                                SCHEER
                    The y got out! They got past the gate!

                                                                                  57.



     Scheer spins on his heel back towards The Institute. The Censor
     lingers, confused. Then he fixes on the lodeway. Floating past
     in the red wash are the luminous blue seams of two ethercuffs.

86   EXT . THE DESERT - NIGHT

     The perimeter wall silhouetted in the middle-distance. Lincoln
     and Ester scramble through the scrub, blinded by dust, driven by
     momentum. As Ester starts lagging behind, Lincoln grabs her arm-

                                      LINCOLN
                        Ester ! We have to keep going!

     But Ester resists him, breaking loose from his grasp. Lincoln
     looks at her, uncomprehending. Until he sees her expression, the
     harrowed stare in her eyes, the labored heaving of her chest.

                                     LINCOLN
                        Ester?

     Ester staggers back, losing balance, reeling as if spun by the
     storm. Her eyes widening, senses flooding. The howling wind, the
     swirling dustclouds, the pendent gulf of black sky. Her reel
     returning her to face Lincoln, Ester opens her mouth to speak.
     But all that comes is A SCREAM. A scream from deep within, shrill
     and hysterical, the only articulation she can find. Lincoln grabs
     her and covers her mouth. Fighting to stifle her, rocking to her
     convulsions. But Ester keeps screaming. A scream of everything.

87   INT . BEDROOM - SOMEWHERE - LATE NIGHT

     All is still. Just a muted shudder of wind on glass. The room is
     in shadow. All we see is a canopied bed where a figure,
     obscured, lies sleeping. The still is disrupted by a chime. The
     figure stirs, fumbling at the nightstand. A holoframe resolves,
     the light revealing Dr. Sanger, rumpled by sleep. He peers into
     the holoframe to find the face of Merrick, gaunt with concern-

                                        Merrick (ON HOLOFRAME)
                        He n r y . . . There's been a breach.

                                                                H A R D CUT TO BLACK.

     SLOW FADE UP:
88   EXT . THE RED ROCKS - DAWN

     A horizon. A brim of dawn over the red rocks. The view is framed
     by the mouth of a cave. Lincoln sleeps within, slumped against
     the rock, his head bowed heavily. The touch of first light opens
     his eyes. His brow creasing, as if waking from a bad dream into
     a worse reality. He looks around only to find himself alone. He
     gets up, a little shaky at first, then ventures out of the cave.

                                                                     58.



     He emerges onto a ledge, perhaps fifty feet up. He pauses, eyes
     adjusting to the quality of light. He sees the storm has reduced
     to a low wind, combing the floorland o f scrub. Now, across the
     ledge, he sees Ester. Perched on an outcrop, hugging her knees,
     watching the sunrise over the desert. He crosses and lowers to a
     crouch beside her. Ester turns to him with a confused frown-

                                 ESTER
                    W h e r e did all the green go?
     Lincoln looks deep into her troubled eyes. He answers gently-

                                 LINCOLN
                    The r e is no green. The windows in
                    there... they were just pictures.

     Ester absorbs this with difficulty. Lincoln rises again and
     stands looking out across the desert, into the barren unknown.

89   EXT . THE SKY OVER THE DESERT - MORNING

     From the massive sky grows a glinting shape. Like a helicopter
     but sleeker, aquiline. Without combustion, its only noise is the
     sibilance of blades slicing air. It is known as a "whisper".

90   INT . WHISPER - MORNING

     The pilot jockeys with the thermals. Scheer rides shotgun. Now
     in civvies, scanning the terrain with electronic binoculars. The
     flight console beeps. He taps a keypad. A holoframe resolves:

                                  CENSOR (ON HOLOFRAME)
                    Ground team checking in.

                                 SCHEER
                    Anything?

                               CENSOR (ON HOLOFRAME)
                    The storm pretty much covered their
                    tracks. We're scanning for thermals
                    b u t the hotter it gets, the harder it
                    is to isolate a heat signature. I don't
                    know, sir, it's a big desert out there.

91   EXT . CHASM - THE RED ROCKS - DAY

     The desert sun clefts the chasm into light and shadow. Lincoln
     trudges into view, Ester lagging behind. He stops to let her
     catch up, only to watch her slump onto a rock. He allows her a
     moment to rest and walks to where the chasm comes to an end.

                                                                     59.



     He surveys the terrain. His eyes roam the carpet of scrub, now
     narrowing on an inconsistency. A faint strip where nothing seems
     to grow. Tracing its lineage, he walks a few feet out. Then
     drops to a crouch and starts clawing away at the dust.

     His fingers meet something hard. He sweeps off the dust to expose
     a layer of concrete. Continuing, revealing the ghost of a line.
     What we might recognize as a lane marker but a curiosity to him.
     Continuing, opening a window in the dust. Now his fingers snag
     o n something. He tugs it and it gives a little, dust crumbling to
     reveal a section of rusted chainlink. A corner of metal is
     visible. Lincoln exposes the rest. A sign, barely legible: "US
     Government - Restricted Area". He frowns, trying to assimilate.
     Ester comes up to join him. Off her anxious look, he decides-

                             LINCOLN
                    I think I've found a path.

92   EXT . THE GREEN MOUNTAINS - DAY

     W h i t e rock blanketed by stands of fir and ponderosa pine. A
     whisper skims over the treecaps, circling in on a high shelf.
     Here, remotely nestled in a clearing, stands a glass villa.

93   INT . THE GLASS VILLA - DAY

     The flood of light, the majestic view lend an air of beatitude.
     The decor is minimalist with Native American accents, kokopelli
     spirits in carved silhouette. Dr. Sanger stands at a glass wall,
     looking out across the green mountain valley. On the sofa sits
     Merrick, now in civvies, still gaunt from worry. The air stirs
     as a maid ushers in A WOMAN - 30's, all business, sharp blue
     eyes, a severe, mannish coiffure. Her name is ELLEN CROWNE.

                                CROWNE
                    Good morning, gentlemen.

                                    SANGER
                    Bernard, this is Ellen Crowne from our
                    legal department. Ellen, this is
                    Bernard Merrick, director of products.

                                 MERRICK
                    Thank you for coming out here.

                                CROWNE
                    Well when Henry called me I got the
                    sense it wasn't for a social visit.

     They settle at a table. A jug of icewater a n d glasses laid out.

                             CROWNE
                    I understand there was an incident?

                                                                 60.



                            MERRICK
              First, let me stress there's no way we
              could have anticipated what happened...

                           CROWNE
              We're on the same team, Mr. Merrick.
              Just give me the facts down-and-dirty.

                               MERRICK
                     (uneasy, clears his throat)
              We'v e lost two of our products. They
              escaped containment last night.

Crowne casts a troubled look at Sanger. Merrick quickly adds-

                                Merrick (cont'd)
               However, we have all available
               resources dedicated to the search.

                         CROWNE
              How exactly did this happen?

                           MERRICK
              We'r e still piecing it together.

                        CROWNE
              Do we expect more products to escape?

                           DR. SANGER
              Don't be so alarmist, Ellen.

                         CROWNE
              I'm sorry, Henry, but you asked me
              here to assess our liabilities.

                        MERRICK
              To answer your question, we condition
              our products with a deterrent. A fear of
              contamination. And thereby of the outer
              environment. So to escape, they first
              have to escape their conditioning.

Crowne pauses to absorb this and to light a slim black cigarette.

                                CROWNE
              Containment is one of the terms of our
              state health license. The fact it was
              compromised could put us in violation.

                       DR. SANGER
              Bureaucracy.

                                                  61.



              CROWNE
Henry , it was a bloody battle getting
our license through in the first place.

                DR. SANGER
They're not going to pull our license,
Ellen. We have a lot of friends on the
Commission. Not to mention the goodwill
we earned in DC when we took over the
facility; a bunker complex for a bio-
chemical war that never happened... We
relieved them of a costly embarrassment.

           CROWNE
I'm not sure we can rely on that.

                DR. SANGER
Alright . What do you suggest?

              CROWNE
First, I need you to level with me.
What are our chances of finding them?

             MERRICK
Well, in our favor, they've never been
outside containment. They'd have no
coordinates, no sense of direction.

         CROWNE
I don't see how that's in our favor.

               MERRICK
They're in the middle of the desert.
Food and water become an issue.

          CROWNE
So they might return to the trough?

            MERRICK
Possibly.

           CROWNE
And if not? How long could they last?

         MERRICK
A few days maybe. But there is another
variable. We maintain the products in a
sterile environment. So basically their
immune systems are untested. Toxins,
pathogens, environmentals t h e rest of
us overcome routinely, to them...

                                                               62.



                             DR. SANGER
               That's a little drastic. Some immune
               systems are more adaptive than others.

                            CROWNE
               Let's take the drastic case. What then?

                              MERRICK
               Well . . . the male, we could cover. Fast-
               track another generation before the
               sponsor ever needed access. The female
               comes under the maternity plan. She's
               three months pregnant. Even if we fast-
               tracked another generation, we couldn't
               fast-track the pregnancy. We'd miss the
               delivery date, the sponsor would wonder
               why and there would be... difficulties.

Crowne looks worried. Sanger pours a glass of icewater.

                           DR. SANGER
               Even so, the worst may not happen.

                         CROWNE
               We haven't even touched on the worst. If
               these products reach a populated area,
               there's the problem of scrutiny.
                             DR. SANGER
               Ellen , we operate under State license on
               a lease from the Federal Government...

                             CROWNE
                    ( c u t s him off, harshly)
               We slipped through a loophole in the
               clone laws, Henry. And they only let
               u s through because they smelt money.
               And they gave us a government basement
               to cover their own a s s e s not ours. It's
               at the core of our license - why we
               screen potential sponsors, why we make
               them sign discretion agreements, why
               containment is such a critical factor -
               to limit the extent of public scrutiny.

                             DR. SANGER
               E i t h e r way, it's unlikely they'd get
               that far. It's at least twenty miles to
               the next settlement. Right, Bernard?

Merrick hesitates before nodding his assent. Crowne pounces on it-

                                                                    63.



                                     CROWNE
                    Something to add, Mr. Merrick?

                                    MERRICK
                    I just don't think we should under-
                    estimate them. Especially the male.

                               DR. SANGER
                    And I don't think we should panic.

     He cautions Merrick with a discreet look, then shakes a pill
     from a bottle. Crowne looks forward to both men. Very serious.

                                      CROWNE
                    Gentlemen, whatever happens we need
                    t o keep one thing clearly in mind. As
                    far as the world at large goes, we are
                    just another medical services company.
                    Anything that alters that perception
                    puts us at risk. And we cannot rely on
                    the sanction of the law to protect us.
                    Whenever and wherever and in whatever
                    condition we recover these products, we
                    have to stay beyond reproach. All it
                    takes is one nudge to put us in the
                    spotlight. Then you'll see how fast
                    politicians can run for cover.

     Merrick shifts, uneasy. Sanger takes the pill with a bitter smile-

                              DR. SANGER
                    I n other words we need to find them
                    o r else. That's very astute, Ellen.

94   EXT . DESERT HIGHWAY - SUNSET

     The dust swirls and puffs across a highway of yesteryear. A dirt
     track but for patches of exposed concrete and angles of buckled
     lampposts. The empty path reaches to a blood-red sunset.

95   EXT . SCRAPYARD - SUNSET

     The dust skims over mountains of rusted scrap. Nestled in the
     mountains is a shack. A sign creaks in the breeze "Osmund D e e r ,
     Licensed Salvage Merchant". On the porch sits an old man in a
     greasy ballcap a n d dungarees. This is the eponymous owner, OZZIE.

     He's sitting on a lounger, surveying his empire, enjoying a beer
     and a cigarette. Exhaling a drag of smoke, his eyes crease to a
     squint. He sees something through the smoke, silhouetted against
     the sunset. An approaching figure, wary, like a flighty animal.

                                                                          64.



                                OZZIE
                    Hello?

     The silhouetted figure doesn't answer, just stares back at him.

                               OZZIE
                    Can I help you?

     This seems to get a response. The figure ventures closer. We
     recognize Lincoln. Exhausted, dust-covered and dry-throated -

                              LINCOLN
                    My friend... she needs water.

96   INT . BACK ROOM - THE SHACK - SUNSET

     A mass of technology and furniture from recent and distant past.
     Lincoln lowers Ester onto a threadbare sofa. Ozzie, excited to
     have visitors, bustles up with a water gallon, pouring a glass.
     Lincoln takes it and tips it to Ester's lips. She coughs it out
     at first. Then takes the glass and starts drinking with vigor.
     Ozzie sets down the water gallon in front of his visitors. Then
     settles in an armchair and cracks open a beer. It lends the mood,
     albeit strained, of a social visit. Lonely old Ozzie wanting to
     make it so. Despite which, both men have an eye on each other.

                               OZZIE
                    Got stuck in that supercell, didya?

     Lincoln eyes him, wary of the question. Ozzie reads confusion-

                                     OZZIE
                    Supercellstorm , that's what they call
                    it on the news anyways. I n my day, we
                    just called `em "big ol' h o w l e r s " .

     Ozzie chuckles to himself. It seems to put his visitor at ease.

                                OZZIE
                    Yep, I heard it shut down some of the
                    lodeways. Dust in the works, I guess.
                    Where were you folks headed anyways?

     Lincoln gulps down some water, deciding an answer. Then ventures-

                                LINCOLN
                    Away.

                                 OZZIE
                    A w a y ? You mean, like outta s t a t e ?

                                LINCOLN
                    " O u t of state"...

                                                                          65.



     The term is meaningless to Lincoln but he likes the sound of it.
     Ozzie grins. This is starting to feel like a real social visit.

                               OZZIE
                    N o w where's my manners gone? I'm Ozzie.
                    Osmund r e a l l y . But folks call me Ozzie.

     An awkward lull as Ozzie waits for his visitor to reciprocate.

                                     OZZIE
                    S o m e t i m e s I like to make a joke of it,
                    my last name bein' D e e r . . . "O. Deer".

     O z z i e chuckles but the pun seems lost on his visitor. He lets it
     drop. The awkward silence returns. Lincoln drinks the water,
     wondering if this strange old man is as harmless as he appears.

                                OZZIE
                    We l l now, looks like yer g i r l f r i e n d ' s
                    made herself at home.

     Lincoln looks at Ester, slumped over, asleep on the sofa. Ozzie
     puts a finger to his lips, beckoning his visitor out of the room.

97   EXT . SCRAPYARD - DUSK

     The porch light comes on, casting the scrapyard in grades of
     light and shadow. Ozzie steps out onto the porch, lighting a
     cigarette. His visitor hovering at the threshold, he offers the
     pack. Lincoln steps out and takes one. Ozzie lights it for him-

                                    OZZIE
                    Yer girlfriend sure is pretty.

     His visitor looks at him curiously. Ozzie misinterprets that
     he's said something out of turn. Time to change the subject-

                              OZZIE
                    So what's with them tattoos, huh?

     He taps his forehead. Lincoln fingers his crosshatch, suddenly
     aware of it now and suspicious of the question. Ozzie palliates-

                                OZZIE
                    Hey , in the eye of the beholder, right?
                    Now this place, this is beautiful to
                    me. This is my place. I own it. `May
                    not look like much but you'd be
                    surprised. C'mon, lemme show you...

     Ozzie moseys into the scrapyard, beckoning his visitor. Lincoln
     hesitates, then follows him, sensing it's better to play along.

                                                                       66.



                                    OZZIE
                    M o s t a t h i s heavy stuff's industrial
                    scrap. Comes in from all over. Easy way
                    round the recyclin' l a w s . Me, I sell it
                    on to the boondock b o y s for meltdown.
                    Other stuff, I pick up at the scrap
                    markets. Fix it up, `fetches a price.

     The y reach a vehicle shell. A rust-pocked chassis, canted on its
     axle, we might recognize it as an automobile from our own era.

                               OZZIE
                    Fossil fuel transport. This piece o'
                    junk's a collector's item. All that
                    Age of the Wheel nostalgia, "elegant
                    era of transport" bullshit. I find the
                    parts, she's as good as solid gold.

     Ozzie pats his investment and moves to another rusted metal pile.
     Steepled by rail tracks, we see elevator sheaves, tension cables.

                                 OZZIE
                    Now this here's got a colorful history.
                    Came in from this ol' g o v e r n m e n t bunker
                    out in the valley. `Got shut down way
                    back. Then this new outfit took over,
                    stripped the place out. I guess they're
                    doin' s o m e more remodelling cause I
                    just had `em in again the other day...
                           ( a tug of smoke, reflective)
                    Hump`n dump crew. Nice fellas.

     Lincoln frowns. The term is familiar. The taste of smoke, a hint.
     But his memory has been clouded by trauma. Ozzie reads his face-

                               OZZIE
                    You okay there?

     Lincoln looks at him, something breaking the clouds. A sense of
     danger, indistinct. Suddenly cautious, he stubs his cigarette-

                               LINCOLN
                    I'm going to check on my friend.

98   INT . FRONT ROOM - THE SHACK - DUSK

     A front room turned into a front office. Piles of paper teeter
     atop junk furniture. A bankers lap we might recognize from our
     own era glows over a desk where Ozzie is rummaging, looking for
     something. He stops to peer through and check on his visitors-

                                                                   67.



The woman still lies asleep on the sofa. The man is sitting
beside her armchair, head bowed, seemingly plunged in thought.
O z z i e resumes rummaging to find a crumpled delivery note. He
reviews it for a moment. Then quickly clears away some more
papers to uncover a keypad device. It is known as a "holocom".
He taps a key and a holoframe resolves. Then taps in some digits
from the delivery note. The holoframe snows with static. Then a
crosshatch insignia appears, spinning in 3D:

                              RECORDED VOICE (ON HOLOCOM)
               Welcome to The Sanger Institute. If you
               know your party's extension, press...

                           LINCOLN (O.S.)
               What are you doing?

Ozzie jerks round to find his visitor suddenly standing there.
He fumbles on the holocom keypad and the crosshatch blinks out.

                              OZZIE
               Nuthin . I wasn't doin nuthin .

Lincoln frowns, the sense of danger becoming more distinct.
Ozzie reads his visitor's troubled expression, realizing-

                        OZZIE
               I knew it... them clothes... them
               weird tattoos... I mean, I heard
               stories from those guys but I never...

O f f his visitor's frown, Ozzie bites his tongue. He's cornered
in this cramped space with a freak of science. Time to backpedal-

                          OZZIE
               N o t that I believe `em... buncha c r a z y
               stories... nuthin t o do with you...

He chuckles feebly. But his visitor just stares back at him,
pupils dilated and dark, somehow inhuman. Time to wriggle out-

                               OZZIE
               W h a d d y a s a y we just forget about it,
               huh? How about I go getcha a beer?

He makes a move past but his visitor doesn't budge. Lincoln
senses danger in this old man, whose fear is now manifest-

                               OZZIE
               What e v e r you want... Just take it...
               Whaddya w a n t . . . ? You want money...?

                                                                     68.



      His visitor frowns. Ozzie quickly unlocks a cashbox. He grabs
      some colored plastic cards and offers them like meat to a lion.

                                 OZZIE
                     I t ' s all I got... Take it... just
                     please... just don't hurt me...

      His visitor takes a blue card, inspecting it like a curiosity.
      Then steps closer. Ozzie shrinks back. An ominous moment, then-

                                 LINCOLN
                     " O u t of state" - how do I get there?

      O f f Ozzie's cowering and confused look, we -
                                                               C U T TO:

99    EXT . SKY OVER THE DESERT - NIGHT

      F r o m darkness grows a seed of light. The whisper flies low and
      quiet, its spotlight roving the undulant desert. Now picking out
      metal glints as it banks over a scrapyard. Now training its beam
      on a figure in the dust whirl beneath. Ozzie, his hair flying
      wild, gesticulating madly. The whisper follows his directions,
      nosing onwards, its spotlight corrugating across the red rocks.

100   EXT . SHUTTLE STOP - NIGHT

      I n the middle of nowhere, a canopied platform. Not unlike the sub-
      w a y platform, it borders a deeply trenched lodeway. A wave of dust
      rolls in, swelled by the whisper, landed beyond. It seems to bring
      Scheer to the platform. He scans around for a clue, a footprint
      perhaps. But somehow he already knows. He looks up the lodeway,
      eyes honing. The deep black line stretches far into the night.

101   INT . THE GLASS VILLA - NIGHT

      Silence. Still. Sanger sits nursing a cup of herb tea. Crowne
      sits smoking. Stubs in the ashtray speak of long hours waiting.
      The still is broken as Merrick emerges from an adjacent room.
      Sanger and Crowne look up, expectant. Merrick closes the door
      with slow care. Then he faces them, a grim tenor in his voice-

                                   MERRICK
                     Bad news.

102   EXT . PHOENIX - NIGHT

      The whisper slices the night, running lights blinking. We pan to
      frame it against a skyline of black towers. A glittering row of
      domes and spires, somehow celestial, touching the sky. The city
      bears no trace of its origins, once built over Indian ruins, now
      rebuilt, subsumed by urban overhaul. It has become a metropolis.

                                                                        69.



103   INT. ROOFTOP NIGHTCLUB - PHOENIX

      A glass dome, faceted, insectile. A haut-monde h i v e . The movers
      and shakers of the high-tech boomtown drinking, dancing. Shot
      waitresses dose blue tequila. Bass music thuds like a heartbeat.
      Scheer looks out of place here but the crowd's too self-absorbed
      to care. He moves through them, invisibly, towards a corner booth.

      TWO MEN IN SUITS sit with a bottle of blue tequila. The first is
      bald, pale and dead-looking, he'd be the grim reaper but for his
      fixed leer. The second is long-haired, bearded, hulking, more of
      a grim ploughman. He has a metal brace screwed into his forearm.

                                  SCHEER
                     Which one of you is Diggs?

                                   DIGGS (THE BALD MAN)
                     That's me, slick. This here's my
                     partner Burdon. Don't mind him. He
                     gets a little shy around strangers.

                                 SCHEER
                     What happened to his arm?

                                     DIGGS
                     `Pursuit last week. The guy took a
                     swing at him with a fireaxe. Didn't
                     stop Burdie though . `Took down that
                     fucker with one arm, didn't you?

      Burdon sips his drink. Scheer, underwhelmed, takes a seat.

                                SCHEER
                     You don't look like bounty hunters.

                                 DIGGS
                     Well we're on the job, see? And it
                     kind of helps if you bleed in. You
                     don't look like a bondman either.

                                SCHEER
                     I'm just an intermediary.

                                DIGGS
                     Now that's what people use when they
                     don't want to get their hands dirty.

      He grins, cannily. Scheer grimaces, a pro suffering an amateur.

                              SCHEER
                     I was told you also handled civil
                     bonds. Debt runners, data-thieves...

                                                               70.



                          DIGGS
              What we hunt depends on the bounty.

                          SCHEER
              It's worth ten platinum. Unmarked.

Diggs pauses at this. A huge amount. Suspiciously huge. He licks
some salt, downs a blue tequila shot and bites a slice of lime.

                            DIGGS
              What's the bond?

                         SCHEER
              The parties I represent want to limit
              the specific details. But let's just
              say industrial secrets are involved.

                         DIGGS
              Ten platinum. Must be big secrets.

That canny grin again. It raises Scheer's hackles-

                         SCHEER
              Any good at keeping them?

                         DIGGS
              Oh, me and Burdie, we're busy bees. We
              don't have time to file every report
              and we got real bad memories. But just
              so we understand each other, slick,
              we're talking about a bag job, right?

Scheer returns an equivocal look. Then dips in his pocket for two
digital slides - Lincoln and Ester's headshots, spinning in 3D.

                            DIGGS
              What's up with these tattoos? They
              look like fucking boondock types .

                         SCHEER
              All I'm authorized to tell you is they
              have no records in this state. Also
              that they're not armed or dangerous.

                         DIGGS
              How about we start with their names?

                          SCHEER
              John and Jane Doe...

                            DIGGS
              You're kidding me, right? No names?

                                                               71.



Scheer's look says he's serious. But Diggs is still confounded.

                          DIGGS
              The n - with all due respect - how the
              fuck d o you expect us to find them?

                             SCHEER
              Because you won't have to look. They
              jumped an overnight shuttle. They'll be
              headed for the terminal, trying to get
              out of state. It's strictly a recovery
              job. For you, it should be childsplay.

                          DIGGS
              The n why not do it yourself? Or is the
              dog ring just to impress the ladies?

The grin. Scheer moves his hand to cover the USMC ring, stiffly-

                         SCHEER
              The parties I represent want to stay at
              arm's length. And just so we understand
              each other that means no connection, no
              papertrail, no police interest...

                        DIGGS
              Is that everything?

                           SCHEER
              . . . no mistakes. They want these two
              brought in quickly and quietly and
              unharmed. Once you have them, you'll
              contact me for further instructions.

                       DIGGS
              I don't know. What do you say, Burdie?

B u r d o n looks over. Then suddenly stands bolt upright, diving into
his jacket, jerking out what looks like a pump-action shotgun.

                           BURDON
              F r a n k Hofstetter! This is a bond
              recovery! Step away from the bar!

F A C E S TURN as he swings aim across the bar - HOFSTETTER, slight,
wide-eyed, looking hunted - customers moving away, exposing him -
Burdon chambering a cartridge, emphatic - Hofstetter f r e e z e s - a
deer in the headlights - a moment of hesitation - then he runs.

- B O O M - BURDON FIRES but the shot misses, hitting the bartender -
exploding on impact with A BLINDING ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE - the
stunned bartender spasms and drops - Burdon pumps and chambers
another slug - his weapon now earned the name of a "thunderbolt".

                                                                            72.



      A STAMPEDE BEGINS - customers running scared - his quarry lost
      in the stampede, Burdon vaults over the table - Diggs pulls out
      what looks like a twin-barrel sawn-off and launches after him -
      Scheer stays seated, watching the hunt with remote curiosity--

      H O F S T E T T E R C L A W S THROUGH THE STAMPEDE - spotting Burdon and the
      thunderbolt close behind - he drops out of the firing line - onto
      his knees - crawling, banged about - almost at the exit, almost--
      T W I N BARRELS PRESS TO HIS HEAD - Diggs looks down - grinning,
      beckoning him upright - Hofstetter l o o k s up - bleak, defeated -
      A GIRL blunders into them - toppling over Hofstetter i n t o Diggs--

      H O F S T E T T E R T A K E S HIS CHANCE TO RUN - now scrambling against the
      stampede - Diggs disentangles himself and levels his weapon -
      the stampede parting - throwing themselves to the ground as--

      - B O O M - DIGGS FIRES - the scattershot hits Hofstetter a s he flees
      up some steps - peppering his leg - sparks off metal as Diggs
      keeps firing - his weapon now earned the name of a "rainmaker".
      H O F S T E T T E R R E A C H E S A CATWALK - his leg dragging, numbing from
      t h e tranquilizer cores - the catwalk dead-ends - blind panic now -
      He ducks under the rail, reaching for the dome - finding a
      precarious handhold, he swings across - trying to climb --

      D I G G S COMES UP BENEATH - looking up, grinning - the pathetic
      sight of Hofstetter - one leg useless - clinging to the dome
      like a fly trapped under glass - as Burdon goes to recover him -

                                   DIGGS
                      Don't bother. He'll drop by himself.
      B u r d o n pulls out some handcuffs and stands waiting. Diggs returns
      to the booth. Pouring out two tequila shots, he grins at Scheer -

                                    DIGGS
                      N o w . . . where were we?

104   EXT . THE DESERT - MORNING

      S u n l i g h t blinks off a chain of carriages, travelling the trench
      of a lodeway. The overnight shuttle slits through the desert.

105   INT . PASSENGER CAR - MORNING
      The sun is a muted orb behind polarized glass. Lincoln stares out
      of the window at the bleak new world blurring past. He's wearing
      Ozzie's ballcap o v e r his crosshatch, his former clothes discarded
      for some of the old man's ill-fitting denims. Perhaps a disguise
      or perhaps just to shed the memory. He glances across at Ester,
      dressed likewise, her hair teased to cover her crosshatch. She's
      dozing, head rested on the glass. A TICKET COLLECTOR comes up-

                                                                        73.



                               TICKET COLLECTOR
                      Tickets...
      Lincoln looks at the man in uniform, uncertain what he wants. The
      ticket collector shakes his head. These two look like deadbeats.

                                   T I C K E T COLLECTOR (CONT'D)
                      A d u l t fare is forty five currency
                      units. Do you have the money, sir?

      Lincoln assimilates. Money. The word is familiar. He pulls out
      the blue plastic card. The man in uniform looks encouraged. He
      gives him the card, watching him slot it into a handheld device,
      which briefly flashes, then the card is returned. Lincoln sees a
      strip at the top is now transparent, like a depleted reservoir.
      He assimilates. Not so different from the transactions in the
      world below. Then he notices Ester is awake and is looking at
      him. Her bright eyes, dim and troubled, somehow accusatory.

                                  LINCOLN
                      I t ' s going to be okay, Ester.

                                ESTER
                           (faint)
                      Is it?

                                LINCOLN
                      We just need to get out of state.

      Ester , disconsolate, looks out of the window. In her gaze, the
      forlorn air of a hatchling fallen from the nest. Lincoln watches
      her, knowing her troubles and knowing that he cannot relieve them.

106   EXT . PHOENIX - DAY

      The skyline stands reprised in daylight. A glimmering citadel.

107   EXT . SHUTTLE STOP - PHOENIX - DAY

      P a s s e n g e r s climb the steps from an underground gloom. Lincoln and
      Ester with them, jostled by the more certain flow. They cross the
      portal onto the street and stop, dazzled by the sunlight. Only to
      be dazzled again by the sudden, stunning prospect of the city...

      F i r s t there's the quality of light, a burning white, perhaps from
      depleted ozone, depicting everything in a surreal shimmer. Then
      there's the towers, darkly crystalline, facets of polarized glass
      rising to domes and spires, like monolothic f i n g e r s reaching for
      the sky. The traffic flashing past, the chassis identifiable as
      trucks, taxis, compacts, sedans, streamlined in a nautical trim,
      hull runners in place of wheels. The sound of claxons, more like
      fog horns than car horns. Then there's the street itself, a six-
      l a n e lodeway, lanes marked with buoys, bobbing around on cables.

                                                                            74.



      The graceful arcs of pedestrian bridges at the intersections. The
      citizens, strange hairstyles, fashions, all wearing sunglasses.
      Even to us it's a wondrous sight. The urbanism, the grandeur, as
      if here in the heart of southwest, Manhattan has met Venice.

                                  V O I C E (O.S.)
                      He y , man, spare a little green?

      A w e interrupted, Lincoln and Ester look around. Slouched by the
      street exit is A HOBO with a mangy dog. He grins toothlessly-

                                   T H E HOBO
                      A i n ' t eaten in two days, have we, boy?

      Lincoln and Ester step back as the dog rises to greet them. Tail
      wagging, it noses forward, sniffing. Then, abruptly, drops its
      tail and backs off, whining. Lincoln and Ester likewise back off.
      Both sides have just discovered a new species. The hobo pets his
      whining canine, watching the strangers walk off with curiosity.

108   EXT . STREET - DAY

      The sunlight flares off passing vehicles, hypnotic. The faces of
      pedestrians flash past. Lincoln and Ester wander in thrall up the
      street. Everywhere new sights, new curiosities bombard them...

      The storefronts, mysterious recesses behind polarized glass. The
      glass, alive with pixellated g r a p h i c s , marquees: "Temps! Temps!
      New Tech Opportunities!" - "Beauty Therapy! Manicures, Dermals,
      Follicle Grafts!" - "Discount Legal Service! Class Actions Only!"

      H o l o f r a m e b i l l b o a r d s loom over the street, huge shimmering
      panels like phantom jumbotrons, commercials playing on a loop:
      - - A businessman in a conference room, shrinking from a fierce
      negotiation; the scene replayed with the same businessman, now
      on his feet, stabbing his finger angrily in the air; a pill
      bottle in CU, a text super "Combatrine! The Aggression Enhancer"
      - - A teenager bemused by his homework: his parents escorting him
      into a clinic; the teenager hooded by an electronic dome; his
      parents clapping; the teenager smiling as he accepts a diploma;
      a text super "Intellex: Data Impression For A New Generation"

      Lincoln suddenly looks round, realizing Ester is gone from his
      side. He scans the sea of faces. Then spots her stepping through
      a doorway. Over the threshold is a holoform: a pig with wings,
      circled by the legend "Hog Heaven! Home Of The True Hamburger".

109   INT . HOG HEAVEN - DAY

      F a s t food outlets have evidently changed little. Promotional
      posters in 3D: "Ham Slam", "Porker Forkers", "Bacon Blitz".

                                                                     75.



      Service counter, seating area. Ester is looking around like
      Alice In Wonderland. Lincoln comes up, out of breath, edgy-

                              LINCOLN
                     I told you to stay with me.

                                     ESTER
                           ( i n n o c e n t , plaintive)
                     I'm hungry.

                                  LINCOLN
                     O k a y . Okay...

      He nods, realizing he is too. He plants Ester in a seat and looks
      around. People stand in line transacting, receiving food trays.
      Not unlike nutrition plaza. Lincoln ventures to the counter. He
      offers the blue card hopefully. THE SERVICE CLERK looks at him-

                                T H E SERVICE CLERK
                     A r e you gonna tell me what you want?

                                      LINCOLN
                            ( b e a t , no other reference)
                     What are my options?

                                  T H E SERVICE CLERK
                     K n o c k yourself out, buddy.

      He indicates a menu above. Lincoln assimilates, looking up at
      the menu. Understanding now, his face lifts to almost a smile.
      It's the first time he's been given an unrestricted choice.

110   INT . SEATING AREA - A FEW MINUTES LATER

      Lincoln returns to Ester with a tray of food and drink. She's
      staring off again, distant. He puts a burger and drink cup in
      front of her. She seems not to notice. He tries to engage her-

                              LINCOLN
                     I asked the man how to get to the
                     terminal. He said it's not far.

      But Ester just keeps staring, her brow now furrowing as A LITTLE
      GIRL skips past, maybe 11, sipping a soda. Now Lincoln sees her
      too and is transfixed. Now the little girl notices the strangers,
      staring at her. She hurries onward, uncomfortable. Lincoln and
      Ester's eyes follow. It's the first time they've seen a child.

111   EXT . PHOENIX TERMINAL - DAY

      A low rumble. A plume of smoke. A sudden eruption of fire. A bird
      rises from the flames and a phoenix spreads its wings. Widening,
      we reveal this is a holoform o v e r the terminal entrance.

                                                                        76.



      Union Station now looks more like Grand Central. A huge granite
      facade, a covered colonnade linking to pedestrian bridges at the
      corners. Here, in the flow of figures, we make out Lincoln and
      Ester, resembling tourists. Then, a short distance behind, we
      spot two more figures. The hobo and his timorous dog. Following.

112   INT . CONCOURSE - TERMINAL - DAY

      V a u l t e d . Arched windows, mosaiced i n polarized glass. Sunlight
      falls in filtered shafts. Footfalls echo off polished granite.
      Lincoln and Ester scan around. Ester looks daunted by the space.
      Lincoln looks focused. He sees people in line, transacting.

113   INT . TICKET WINDOW - DAY
      The sign on the window reads "Tickets". Lincoln assimilates. The
      word is familiar. He steps up to the counter with Ester. A TICKET
      CLERK - female, immaculately groomed - greets them with a glossy
      smile. Lincoln offers her the blue card. She seems not to notice.

                                    T H E TICKET CLERK
                     We l c o m e to Phoenix Union Station. What
                     is your date of travel, sir?

      Lincoln has to think. Dates mean nothing to him. He ventures-

                                 LINCOLN
                     Now...

                                T H E TICKET CLERK
                     An d what is your destination?

                                LINCOLN
                     O u t of state.

                                T H E TICKET CLERK
                     I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?

                               LINCOLN
                     We want to go out of state.

                                T H E TICKET CLERK
                     I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?

                                 V O I C E (O.S.)
                     L i k e talking to a wall, ain't it?

      Lincoln and Ester turn to look. The interceder is pale, bald,
      wearing leathers. A stranger to them, we recognize him as DIGGS-

                                       DIGGS
                     H o l o s e r v e . C h e a p e r than flesh and
                     blood but nothing between the ears.

                                                                     77.



      Diggs demonstrates, wafting his hand across the ticket counter.
      It cuts through the ticket clerk with a holographic ripple.

                                   DIGGS
                      F i r s t time I used one of these, I
                      asked her out on a date...

      He grins genially, examining their faces, verifying his quarry.
      Lincoln examines the pale man. The sense of danger is welling-

                                  LINCOLN
                      What do you want?

                                  DIGGS
                      J u s t wanted to help, that's all.
      D i g g s shrugs, disarming, trying to win them over, nice and easy
      per the mandate. Then he notices the eyes of his male quarry. The
      pupils, black and dilating. Suddenly the male jerks away, like a
      shying horse, drawing the female with him. Diggs, unperturbed,
      makes no attempt to follow. Turning his back on them, he touches
      a device concealed in his ear canal, a miniature two-way radio-

                                     D I G G S (INTO RADIO)
                      B u r d i e , it's them. East exit.

114   EXT . TERMINAL - DAY

      Lincoln and Ester emerge into the colonnade, rejoining the flow
      of figures. Lincoln presses the pace, alert, darting looks back.
      The pale man doesn't appear to be following. But the sense of
      danger is spurring him to gain distance. Ester, vicarious to the
      danger, stays close to Lincoln's side, scurrying to keep up.
      Neither of them notices the grey vehicle sliding up on them,
      kerbside. A commercial transit van known as a "cutter", it's a
      common sight on the streets. The driver leans out of the window -
      hair tied back, dressed in buckskins, we recognize BURDON-

                                 BURDON
                      You folks need a ride?

      Lincoln and Ester turn to look. The dark giant is just another
      stranger, cast in a demeanor of casual inquiry. He's offering an
      opportunity to gain distance but Lincoln remains hesitant. The
      sense of danger, turbulent, hard to read. Burdon sugars the way-

                                     BURDON
                      P r i v a t e cab. No state surcharge...

      He taps a button and the side-door slips open. Lincoln looks into
      the lightless c a v i t y , wavering, uncertain. Ester, hugging close,
      nervous. Figures passing, jostling them toward the cavity. The
      dark giant, looking on expectantly. The pause stretching, then-

                                                                78.



                           VOICE (O.S.)
               He y ! What the fuck are you doing, man?
B a c k down the colonnade, THE HOBO is gesticulating to Burdon-

                        T H E HOBO
               I told you! They went inside!

The hobo doesn't see Lincoln and Ester, unwitting that he's just
betrayed himself as their shadow... and Burdon as their predator.
His dog starts barking. Lincoln starts backing away with Ester,
his eyes blackening, the danger surging, the dog barking, the
giant's face dropping, the elements converging... They bolt.

                           BURDON
               Shit!

B U R D O N JAMS INTO REVERSE - but his pursuit is cut short by a
parked vehicle - he swings a look back, jabbing his earpiece-

                            B U R D O N (INTO RADIO)
               N o r t h Corner! North Corner!

LINCOLN AND ESTER RACE UP THE COLONNADE - against the flow of
figures - darting and weaving like fish swimming upstream --

D I G G S BURSTS FROM THE NORTH EXIT - launching up the north side
of the terminal - thinner foot traffic here, faster going --

LINCOLN AND ESTER SLOWING - the flow massing under the portico -
they peel through - the holoform p h o e n i x rumbling overhead --

D I G G S TURNING THE NORTH CORNER - pausing to touch his earpiece -
now launching south down the colonnade - towards the portico -
jerking a pair of handcuffs from his belt, ready for the snatch--

LINCOLN AND ESTER GAINING PACE - past the portico now, the way
opening - Lincoln's eyes flaring - a face in the distance ahead -
the pale man - he swings Ester around - doubling back to find --
B U R D O N COMING UP BEHIND - the flow of figures, no obstacle -
parting at his thunderous onset - his quarry, stopped and
staring at him - almost upon them - handcuffs at the ready--

LINCOLN FREEZES - caught between the dark giant and the pale man -
Ester cringing to his side - the dark giant charging up on them -
sunlight on metal - the sight of the handcuffs - TRIGGERING HIM--

LINCOLN GRABS ESTER - swinging her off the sidewalk - lowering
her into the lodeway - leaping down to join her - lode poles
pulsing, thrumming - rivets on their denims, rattling from the
polarity - traffic soaring past on lode-stream, chest-high -

                                                                       79.



      DARTING OUT INTO TRAFFIC - Lincoln leads Ester by the hand like
      a child - across the lanes, dodging, weaving through the gaps -
      claxons b l a r i n g , deafening - sunflashes, blinding - a sudden
      shadow - a huge freight truck bearing down, no gaps ahead --

      LINCOLN DRAGS ESTER TO THE GROUND - both flattening against the
      concrete lode-bed - the shadow engulfing them - the truck's hull
      runners shearing narrowly over their heads - the rush of air,
      sweeping off Lincoln's ballcap - rousing a storm of dust--

      LINCOLN AND ESTER CHOKING - crawling onward through the dust -
      hull runners scudding overhead - maybe only a foot of clearance -
      buoy cables whipping around like cheesewire - onwards, crawling
      across the concrete - fighting their way across the lode-stream--

      B U R D O N WATCHING from the sidewalk where Lincoln and Ester first
      dropped, scouring the trench for a sight of them. Now he spots
      them, climbing up onto the sidewalk the far side of the street.

      D i g g s now arrives at his side, sweating, out of breath. Now
      seeing their quarry take off up the far side of the street, he
      turns to his lumberous p a r t n e t , fury mixed with incredulity-

                                 DIGGS
                      Why the fuck d i d n ' t you go after them?!

      B u r d o n just looks at him, displaying the metal brace on his fore-
      a r m . Diggs, out of sheer frustration, gives him a pounding shove-

                                DIGGS
                      Fuck!

115   EXT . ALLEY - DAY
      The refuge of shadow. The alley is divided by a lodeway and the
      walls on each side are jutted with dumpsters. Lincoln and Ester
      run up the narrowed strip of sidewalk, forced into single file.

      A huge shape looms ahead. A garbage vehicle known as a "scow".
      Like a leviathan spreading its tentacles, the scow's tube-arrays
      dock with the dumpsters and start sucking the contents out.

      Lincoln glances back to find Ester has stopped and is cringing
      away from the tentacled monster. He returns to her, his eyes
      flicking around, aware that their real predators are close-

                                LINCOLN
                      We have to keep going.

      He takes Ester's hand, drawing her onward. But Ester recoils,
      shaking off his grip. Now he looks at her more closely. She's
      panting, shuddering, fraught with trauma. Her voice is haunted-

                                                                            80.



                                      ESTER
                     P l e a s e . . . Please, I want to go back...
      She shrinks into the shadows, shaking her head. The hatchling
      wanting to return to the nest. Lincoln meets her eye, deeply-

                                  LINCOLN
                     T h o s e men - that's what they want too.
      Ester holds his gaze, chest heaving. Then looks back towards the
      alley mouth. Her fingers reach for her belly, clawing a little.
      Then her eyes lower, assimilating, reason reasserting its heavy
      grip. Lincoln senses her turmoil. His voice is soft but sturdy-

                               LINCOLN
                     We have to keep going, Ester.

      Ester looks up at him again. The forlorn air seems to have faded.
      Her eyes, grimly set. Her face, a little haggard. Older somehow.
      She takes Lincoln's hand and together they head off up the alley.

116   EXT . ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

      The alley mouth darkens as a vehicle turns off the street. The
      grey cutter moves through the shadows, prowling and shark-like.

117   INT . CUTTER - DRIVING

      The drone of resistors. The throbbing glow of the drive console,
      a panoply of instrumentation. Burdon steers in silence, Diggs
      beside him, edgy, intent, combing the shadows for their quarry.

                                       DIGGS
                     S u n n a v a b i t c h ! What the fuck d o we do
                     now, huh? They could be anywhere...

                               BURDON
                     We go back to the office and run `em.

                               DIGGS
                     A s what? John and Jane Doe?

                               BURDON
                     We ask the guy.

                                  DIGGS
                     Y e a h , let's tell him we couldn't hack
                     it in kindergarten. See how long him
                     and his ten platinum stick around.

      He fires a barbed look. Burdon absorbs this, unflinched, thinking-

                                                                       81.



                                BURDON
                      I t was blue, right?

                                DIGGS
                      What?

                                  BURDON
                      The y were using a blue currency card.

118   EXT . STREET - DAY

      Lincoln and Ester walk up the street. Wary of attention, they go
      with the flow of figures, eyes peeled for predators. The sights
      of the city now seem hostile. Faces flash past, dead-eyed in sun-
      g l a s s e s . Traffic rushes like steel rapids. Storefronts construct
      a black wall. Holoframe b i l l b o a r d s loom, mocking, half-noticed:

      - - A woman in a bathroom, adjusting her sexy neglige; a crack in
      the door shows a man in bed, waiting; the woman closes the door
      and picks up what looks like a toothpaste tube; she arches her
      eyebrow; "F.I.G. F e m i n i n e Impulse Gel... Because who needs him?"
      - - A cemetery under a grim overcast sky; suddenly a frisbee flies
      across frame; an old woman, dressed like a teenager, catches it;
      she tosses it to an old man dressed likewise; a text super "Death
      Sucks!", a sting, "New Gaza Healthcare: Your Life Is Our Life."
      Lincoln and Ester stop at the corner. They look around, blindly,
      no coordinates, no frame of reference. Urban canyons, identical,
      gordian a n d chasmic. P a s s i n g figures jostle. Then Lincoln spots
      something across the street. It looks like an over-sized phone
      booth. Its beacon flashes; "C.I.N. - CITY INFORMATION NETWORK."

119   INT . CIN BOOTH - DAY

      A flourish of music greets Lincoln and Ester as they enter. The
      fanfare conjures a holoform i n mid-air. A cartoon rattlesnake,
      benignly rendered, welcomes them with a clownish, fanged smile:

                                THE SNAKE
                      H i there! I'm Tattletail! What e v e r you
                      want to know, wherever you want to go, I
                      got the answers! Let's look at the menu!

      A set of text frames appear: "Residential Listings", "Business
      Listings", "Transport Listings", "Hotel Listings". Lincoln
      assimilates. The terminologies are not unfamiliar.

                                 THE SNAKE (CONT'D)
                      N o w let's make a selection!

                                                                     82.



                                   LINCOLN
                         ( b e a t , venturing)
                     Transport...
                                  THE SNAKE
                     O k a y ! Let me open that directory for
                     you! I'll be with you in two shakes!

      The snake rattles accordingly and coils in a holding pattern.
      Then a tomographic map of the city appears. A red dot plants
      itself under a text flag "You Are Here!". Then other red dots
      scatter across the map, each flagging with transportation icons.

120   INT. CUTTER - STREETS - DRIVING - DAY

      B u r d o n steers calmly, scanning the streets. Diggs impatiently
      bashes the keys of a holocom on the drive console. A holoframe
      hovers, snowed with static. Then a secretary's face appears -
      sagging, older, primped and painted young. Her name is JANEEN-

                                  J A N E E N (ON HOLOCOM)
                     D i g g s & Burdon Bond Agency.

                                    DIGGS
                     J a n e e n , where the fuck have you been?

                                   J A N E E N (ON HOLOCOM)
                     B e a u t y therapy. I got a date tonight.

                                DIGGS
                     O h , Jesus... Listen, I want you to
                     punch into the currency stream for me.
                     Sweep for blue card transactions.

                                   J A N E E N (ON HOLOCOM)
                     You're kidding me, right? You have any
                     idea how long that's going to take?

                              DIGGS
                     I want serial numbers, batched a n d
                     cross-referenced. Start from Union
                     Station and work your way out...

      B e f o r e he can object he taps a key. The holoframe blinks out.

121   EXT . BUS STATION - LATE AFTERNOON

      A surging sound. A surface of water. A burst of spray. A dolphin
      leaps from the waves and hangs suspended. Text scrolls around:
      "Get Out Of State & Out Of Mind - Ride the Grey Dolphin Line!"
      This is the next incarnation of the greyhound. The blue facade,
      crested into waves. We make out Lincoln and Ester, now looking
      more like transients than tourists, dirty, worn and exhausted.

                                                                      83.



122   INT. CONCOURSE - BUS STATION

      Low roof. Flat lighting. The faces here seem less threatening,
      the young and the low-income. Lincoln and Ester look around. Not
      unlike the train terminal. People standing in line, transacting.

123   INT . TICKET WINDOW

      Lincoln and Ester step up to the ticket window. A TICKET CLERK -
      male, immaculately groomed - greets them with a polished smile.

                                     T I C K E T CLERK
                      We l c o m e to Grey Dolphin Bus Lines.
                      What is your destination, please?

      Lincoln squints at him. Then wafts his hand across the counter.
      The ticket clerk flinches at the impact. Then composes himself.
      A trace of camp as he smiles bashfully at the rugged customer-

                                  T I C K E T CLERK
                      I t ' s okay. Really. I get that a lot.
                      I'm sorry, now where were we again?

                               LINCOLN
                      I want to get out of state. Now.

                                     T I C K E T CLERK
                      B e l i e v e me, I know how you feel. So
                      where did you want to go exactly?

                                 LINCOLN
                      O u t of state...
                                  T I C K E T CLERK
                      J u s t wherever the wind takes you, huh?

                                     LINCOLN
                      Where's that?

                                   T I C K E T CLERK
                      We l l , if it was me, out to the west
                      coast. It's perfect this time of year.

      Lincoln nods, liking the sound of this. The ticket clerk smiles,
      enjoying the acceptance of his suggestion, he ventures hopefully-

                                        T I C K E T CLERK
                      T r a v e l l i n g alone, are we?

                                 LINCOLN
                      N o . With her.

      He gestures, then realizes Ester is gone from his side again.

                                                                     84.



      He scans the faces. The clerk, disappointed, taps some keys.

                                 T I C K E T COLLECTOR
                      T w o adults, let me see... I'm afraid I
                      can't get you seats till the morning.

124   INT . FOOD SERVICE AREA - BUS STATION

      A grill bar. A rank of vending machines. Ester moves through the
      seating area as if drawn. Now over the ambient noise, we isolate
      the cry of a baby. Ester is following the sound to its source.
      She finds a Mexican woman shushing her infant. The woman looks
      up and smiles. Ester just stands there, awe-struck. Lincoln now
      comes up to reclaim her. He's about to ask why she wandered off
      when she turns to him. He sees her eyes are brimming with tears.
      Tears of joy and sorrow. It's the first time she's seen a baby.

125   EXT . STREET - DUSK

      The winged pig flutters over the doors of "Hog Heaven". The
      milling customers are suddenly parted by Diggs, bursting out
      through the doors. He leaps into the grey cutter, parked
      kerbside. I t peels out with a flash of its halogen eyes.

126   INT . CUTTER - DRIVING - DUSK

      B u r d o n steers, glancing inquisitively at his partner. Diggs taps
      the holocom, urgently, galvanized. The holoframe resolves snowed
      with static. Janeen's face appears. Less primped, disgruntled-

                                   J A N E E N (ON HOLOCOM)
                      D i g g s & Burdon Bond Agency.

                                DIGGS
                      We got a positive on the serial number.
                      Punch in and pull up the transactions.
                      Start with the last hour and work back.

                                    JANEEN
                      G r e a t . So I got to park my ass in
                      front of a screen all night?

                                  DIGGS
                      I t ' s a platinum bond, Janeen. We get
                      this, I'll buy you a new ass, okay?

      He grins at Burdon. The thrill of the chase glows in his eyes.

127   INT . WAITING AREA - BUS STATION - NIGHT

      A blue glass partition wall looks out onto the depot. More like
      a marina with an embarcadero a n d a row of docks. "Liners" slot
      in and out, their nautical trim making them seem like ferries.

                                                                    85.



      Lincoln and Ester sit waiting. Lincoln, rigid, watchful. Ester,
      gazing across at the Mexican woman, who as the infant cradled
      asleep. Ester glances wistfully at Lincoln. Then she frowns-

                                      ESTER
                      Lincoln , what is that? On your face?

      Lincoln turns, touching his face. He feels stubble there. For
      the first time. His body is naturalizing but it feels unnatural
      to him. Ester reaches out and runs her fingers across his cheek.
      Lincoln stiffens a little, unused to this type of contact. But
      her touch is gentle and the contact is warming. Their eyes
      slowly meet, flickering, something passing between them. Then
      Ester's face contorts slightly. She emits a shallow cough.

                                 LINCOLN
                      A r e you alright?

      Ester clears her throat. But another cough follows.

                                ESTER
                      M y throat... it feels dry...

                                     LINCOLN
                      O k a y . . . I'll get you some water.

128   INT . FOOD SERVICE AREA - NIGHT

      E m p t y . The grill bar is closed. Only the vending machines are
      active. Lincoln considers them. Not unlike those he used to
      know. He finds one that offers water bottles. The sign reads
      "Arctic Melt". He pulls out his blue card and looks for the
      slot. Then pauses, picking up his reflection in the glass. He
      examines the shadowy growth on his face. Then he notices his
      eyes. They seem to be darkening. The pupils, welling open. Then
      he feels it. The sense of danger, surging up like a geyser.

129   INT . DEPARTURE AREA

      Ester sits waiting, anxious now, coughing persistently. Hearing
      footfalls, she looks round. But the face that greets her is not
      Lincoln. It's the pale man, the one who chased them. Before she
      can react, he forcefully pulls her upright, tapping his earpiece-

                                   D I G G S (ON RADIO)
                      P i e c e of cake, Burdie. J a n e Doe's in
                      the bag. Keep an eye out for John-Boy.

      Ester looks around in panic. Faces turn but none of them are
      Lincoln's. Diggs confronts the spectators, flashing a badge -

                                  DIGGS
                      Bond recovery... state license.

                                                                      86.



      He marches his female quarry towards the exit. Now she starts to
      struggle and he jerks her back, slapping a cuff onto her wrist-

                                 DIGGS
                     Play nice, little girl. Now you want
                     to tell me where your boyfriend is?

                                   LINCOLN (O.S.)
                     Behind you.

                                     DIGGS
                     What?

      - T H U D - LINCOLN HAMMERS HIS FIST into the pale man as he turns -
      dropping him, flat-on-his-ass - pulling Ester away from him -
      D I G G S JERKS OUT THE RAINMAKER - quick to his feet - more insulted
      than hurt - targeting his quarry - who suddenly duck down as--

      - B O O M - DIGGS FIRES - A WOMAN SCREAMS - the Mexican woman - her
      face, peppered with tranquilizer core - her baby starts crying--
      Ester FROZEN - horrified by the screaming woman - the bloody,
      slack grimace - the baby bawling - Lincoln dragging her down-

      - B O O M - THE BLAST OF THE THUNDERBOLT - Burdon positioned behind
      them - narrowly missing his target - hitting the partition wall -
      - C R A S H - THE PARTITION WALL EXPLODES in a blinding electrical
      discharge - shattering into a sudden TEMPEST OF GLASS SHARDS -

      LINCOLN AND ESTER SPIN ROUND to see the pale man retargeting -
      the dark giant reloading - exit blocked, they lunge towards --
      T H E PARTITION WALL - kicking through the hole in the glass -
      Ester's last glimpse of the screaming woman - the howling baby -

130   EXT . BUS DEPOT - NIGHT

      LINCOLN AND ESTER LEAP OUT onto the embarcadero - running -
      faces blur past - liners flash by with glaring halogens--

      D I G G S LEAPS OUT AFTER THEM - rainmaker poised - the embarcadero
      g l u t t e d with passengers - he can't get a bead on his quarry--
      LINCOLN AND ESTER VAULTING over the scattered luggage - the
      crowd thinning - the canopy opening onto the street beyond--

      D I G G S RIGHT ON THEIR TAIL - people screaming, parting as they
      see his weapon - the firing line clearing - he levels aim and--

                                     M E T R O PD OFFICER (O.S.)
                     M e t r o PD!      Drop it!

                                                                              87.



                                 DIGGS
                      I'm a bond agent!

                               M E T R O PD OFFICER
                      I said drop the fucking w e a p o n !

      D i g g s sees his quarry now escaping. With a scowl, he complies.
      He laces his fingers, tapping his earpiece in the process-

                                        D I G G S (INTO RADIO)
                      N o r t h b o u n d on Third. Get `em, Burdie -
                      and take off the fucking g l o v e s . . .

                                                                        C U T TO:
131   EXT . STREET - NIGHT

      T H E GREY CUTTER VEERS ROUND A CORNER - Burdon at the wheel - his
      quarry visible ahead - he jams the throttle - revs rising -

      LINCOLN AND ESTER SPRINT UP THE SIDEWALK - disorientation - the
      sudden diaspora o f lights and darkness - the sharp acoustics -

      T R A F F I C SWERVING - CLAXONS B L A R I N G - the cutter hurtling up the
      street, relentlessly - its halogen eyes, burning, growing -

      LINCOLN AND ESTER RACING FOR THE END OF THE BLOCK - towards a
      pedestrian bridge - trying to outpace the cutter -

      T H E GREY CUTTER CLOSING - Burdon punching a button - the side
      window slides open - he levels his thunderbolt, angling a shot-

      LINCOLN AND ESTER VEER LEFT - up onto the pedestrian bridge -
      rising above the traffic - claxons b l a r i n g beneath as --

      T H E GREY CUTTER PLOUGHS INTO THE INTERSECTION - banking into a u-
      t u r n - vehicles braking to avoid collision - LIGHTS, CLAXONS -

      LINCOLN AND ESTER - turmoil raging behind them - a glimpse of
      the cutter regaining pursuit - Lincoln sees an opening ahead--

132   EXT . ALLEY - NIGHT

      LINCOLN PULLS ESTER INTO THE SHADOWS - the sidewalk narrowing -
      they run onward, glancing off dumpsters - DULL BOOMS OF METAL -
      A FLOOD OF HALOGENS - the cutter banking sharply into the alley -
      pouring on the speed - the quarry trapped in its headlights--

      LINCOLN AND ESTER - nowhere to run - THE LIGHTS GROWING - THE
      RISING DRONE OF RESISTORS - Lincoln sees another opening --

                                                                        88.



133   EXT. PEDESTRIAN ALLEY - NIGHT

      LINCOLN PULLS ESTER INTO THE DARKNESS - a narrow access, barely
      lit, hard to see - a sudden dead-end - they SLAM INTO A BARRIER--

      A CHAINLINK F E N C E - the links shuddering - Lincoln looks up and
      sees it's scalable - claws into the links - STARTS CLIMBING-

      Ester TRYING TO CLIMB - rattled by coughing - fighting to
      breathe - her limbs shaking - her muscles failing - then--

      - B O O M - A BLINDING ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE - SUDDENLY THE FENCE IS
      ALIVE WITH ELECTRICITY - BURNING FINGERS JITTER ACROSS THE LINKS-

      LINCOLN AT THE TOP OF THE FENCE - jolted by the sudden shock -
      muscles in reflex - falling - landing the far side of the fence--

      Ester STILL CLIMBING - the jolt instantly toppling her back -
      landing the near side of the fence - more rattled than hurt --

      B U R D O N RUNNING TOWARDS THEM - thunderbolt smoking from the shot-
      LINCOLN ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE FENCE - recovering from the fall--

      Ester ON THE NEAR SIDE OF THE FENCE - cowering, coughing -

      B U R D O N JERKS HER UP BY THE HAIR - like a rapacious viking - he
      looks through the fence at Lincoln - sniffing her, almost bestial-

                               BURDON
                     G o ahead. I'll look after her.

      LINCOLN ' S EYES FLICKERING DARKLY - jaw clenching - the sense of
      danger urging him to run - but Ester is in the giant's grips -

      Ester CLAWING TO BREAK FREE - coughing, rasping - her fingers
      snag on the giant's arm-brace - TUGGING WITH ALL HER STRENGTH--

      B U R D O N YOWLING AT THE SUDDEN PAIN - lashing out - flinging Ester
      into the fence - dropping the thunderbolt - CLUTCHING HIS ARM--

      LINCOLN LEAPING ONTO THE FENCE - scrambling up the link - the
      dark giant momentarily off-guard - HE VAULTS OVER THE TOP --

      - T H U D - BURDON SPINS ROUND - takes the full brunt of Lincoln's
      impact - overbalancing - THEY CRASH TO THE GROUND -

      LINCOLN STRUGGLES UPRIGHT - winded, but forced to face the dark
      giant - who is already on his feet, his mighty fist SWINGING OUT-

      - T H U D - LINCOLN TAKES A PUNCH TO THE JAW - recoils, reciprocates
      throwing a left hook - hitting hard but the giant barely flinches-

                                                                      89.



      -THUD-THUD- BURDON POUNDS INTO HIM - a storm of punches - his
      quarry, ducking and blocking - now backed up against the fence--
      Ester RETRIEVING THE THUNDERBOLT - trying to work the mechanism -
      coughing - hands shaking - accidentally touching the trigger -

      - B O O M - THE SHOT BLASTS INTO THE AIR - enough of a distraction
      for Lincoln - he lands the giant with A BONE-JARRING LEFT HOOK-
      B U R D O N KEELS OVER INTO THE WALL - cracking the back of his head -
      his knees buckling - sliding down - just catching sight of--

      LINCOLN AND ESTER SCRAMBLING UP OVER THE FENCE - and then the
      quarry is lost from sight in A DOWNPOUR OF ELECTRICAL SPARKS.

134   EXT . BACKSTREET - NIGHT

      S I R E N S WAILING IN THE DISTANCE. Lincoln and Ester race down the
      sidewalk, along a construction hoarding. Ester slows, doubling
      over, rasping. Lincoln looks at her, her l i p s , blue, her face,
      pale. The sirens, getting louder. He sees a gap in the hoarding-

135   EXT . ENCANTO PARK - NIGHT

      Lincoln and Ester emerge through the gap onto a derelict tract.
      A once public park, now a construction site. Mounds and craters
      of earth. Dim shapes of huge vehicles, like sleeping dragons.
      Patches of parkland, as yet untouched. Bowed palms, dead grass,
      a stagnant lagoon, a dull mirror for the ascendant moon. On its
      shoreline is a dilapidated construct that was once a boathouse.

136   INT . BOATHOUSE - ENCANTO PARK - NIGHT

      The refuge of shadow. The collapsed   roof allowing streams and
      puddles of moonlight. Lincoln helps     Ester onto a rotted bench.
      She slumps down, exhausted, Lincoln     watches her, helplessly.
      She's fighting for breath, wheezing     and coughing in deep rasps.

                              ESTER
                     I can't... I can't breathe... my
                     throat... it's so... dry...

                                 LINCOLN
                     I ' l l find you some water.

      He looks around blindly. Some junk in the corner. He rummages,
      finds a rusted metal box. Pries it open, empties the contents.
      Gauzes, band-aids - evidently a first-aid box - then a bottle.
      He opens it, sniffs. It smells pungent. Alcohol, not water.
      Ester suddenly starts sobbing. Lincoln returns to her side-

                                 LINCOLN
                     I t ' s going to be okay, Ester.

                                                                90.



                            ESTER
               N o . . . no, it isn't...

                           LINCOLN
               I ' l l find you some water, okay?

Ester looks up at him, wheezing, tears streaming from her eyes-

                          ESTER
               An d then what, Lincoln?

                           LINCOLN
               I ' l l find another way. Out of state.

                          ESTER
               An d then what? What if they find us?

                           LINCOLN
               The n we'll keep going.

                        ESTER
               I can't... I can't run anymore...

Ester folds over, sobbing and coughing at the same time. Pitiful
to watch. Lincoln crouches, gaining her eyeline, very deliberate-

                            LINCOLN
               We ' l l keep going till we get there.

Ester traps a sob, reading his eyes, something reviving in her-

                          ESTER
               The Island... You mean, The Island?

Lincoln answers with a brief smile. If this will keep her going
then the truth is redundant. He eases her out of the moment-

                          LINCOLN
               N o w I'm going to get some water. But I
               want you to stay here. It'll be safer.

Ester wipes away her tears, sniffing. Her breaths, calming.

                            ESTER
               Don't go yet. Stay with me, Lincoln.
               Stay with me for a little while.

Lincoln looks puzzled by Ester's request. Even more puzzled as
she rests her head on his shoulder, nestling into his neck. He
feels her against him. The warmth spreading through him again.
His arm reaching, as if of its own accord, closing around her.
I t feels right somehow. And there he stays, holding her, looking
out across the dereliction. And the moon rises over Encanto P a r k .

                                                                      91.



137   EXT. METRO PD STATION - NIGHT

      The holoform l o g o of The Metro PD glows over the threshold.
      Diggs exits with a dark glower. The cutter is waiting kerbside.

138   INT . CUTTER - DRIVING - NIGHT

      Diggs climbs in an Burdon steers out into traffic. The thrill
      o f the chase is gone from them now. Both seem equally grim and
      determined. Diggs taps the holocom. A holoframe resolves, snows
      with static. Then Janeen's face appears, dishevelled, bitter-

                                 JANEEN (ON HOLOCOM)
                     What the fuck do you want now?

                                     DIGGS
                            (very calm, very cold)
                     Punch into the currency stream, close
                     the net on downtown and keep the search
                     active. The next time they use the card,
                     I want to be right on top of them...

      O f f his icy tone, Janeen nods without retort. Diggs hits a key
      and her face blinks out. And the cutter prowls into the night.

139   EXT . DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT

      The winged pig flutters over the doors of "Hog Heaven". Another
      franchise on a more downtrodden street. Lincoln emerges with a
      bag of food and drink. He considers the blue card. The reservoir,
      now close to the bottom, his resources almost exhausted. With a
      look of foreboding, he pockets the card and turns the corner.
      An d suddenly stops in his tracks. But it's not a vehicle that he
      sees. Or a predator. His eyes are fixed on a holoframe billboard:

      - - A football player in montage; pummeling into a defensive line;
      running for a touchdown; gyrating in the endzone; spinning in an
      NFL podium shot, super; "Nobody Stops The Juggernaut!"; a team
      logo, super; "Come See The Phoenix Admirals! Rulers of the AFC!"
      Lincoln recognizes the player's face but it's not possible. He
      waits for the loop to restart. There it is again. The face of
      Starkweather Two-Delta. Incredulous, he stops a pedestrian-

                                LINCOLN
                     The man, the man up there. Who is he?

                                 PEDESTRIAN
                     What planet `you been living on?
                     That's the Juggernaut, brother.

                                LINCOLN
                     The juggernaut...

                                                                          92.



                                     PEDESTRIAN
                     Jamil "The Juggernaut" Starkweather -
                     highest rushing total in the league.
                     `Least till that injury blew out his
                     gut. Now the doctors are saying he'll
                     be back on his feet next season. Those
                     fuckers sure can work miracles, huh?

      Lincoln doesn't respond. The pedestrian shrugs and heads on,
      writing him off. Lincoln lingers, staring up at the billboard.

140   INT . CIN BOOTH - NIGHT

      The flourish of music greets Lincoln as he enters. The cartoon
      rattlesnake appears and smiles his clownish, fanged smile:

                               THE SNAKE
                     Hi there! I'm Tattletail! What e v e r you
                     want to know, wherever you want to go, I
                     got the answers! Let's look at the menu!

      The set of text frames appears: "Residential Listings", "Business
      Listings", "Transport Listings", "Hotel Listings".

                                THE SNAKE
                     N o w let's make a selection!

      A heavy pause. Lincoln's voice comes with a slight tremor.

                              LINCOLN
                     Residential...

                                   THE SNAKE
                     Please give me the name.

                              LINCOLN
                     Starkweather...

                                  THE SNAKE
                     Okay! Let me find that listing for
                     you! I'll be with you in two shakes!

      The snake rattles and coils. Then a headshot a p p e a r s with the
      face of Jamil Starkweather , scaled across with a red line.

                                       THE SNAKE
                     Starkweather , Jamil... I'm sorry! This
                     listing is blocked from the directory!

      Lincoln stands, darkly intent on the face. Now irrefutably the
      same face he saw in his life below. The snake shakes its rattle-

                                                                           93.



                                THE SNAKE
                     You want me to find another listing?
      Lincoln looks at the snake, flicking its tongue, coiling.

                                                             F A D E TO BLACK.

141   EXT . DOWNTOWN STREET - MORNING

      A downtrodden neighborhood. The buildings look like remnants from
      our own era. A scruffy man slouches up to a gated storefront. He
      slots a key into a lock panel and the gate rolls up, squealing.
      We widen to a vehicle parked kerbside. A familiar grey cutter.

142   INT . STORE - MORNING

      L i g h t s flicker on to disclose a gunshop. The array of firearms
      a s fathomless as their purpose. The scruffy gunshop o w n e r slouches
      inside. Diggs and Burdon enter on his heels. He yawns at them-

                               G U N S H O P OWNER
                     We ain't open for another hour.

                                  DIGGS
                     Y e a h , well we ain't in the market.

                                       G U N S H O P OWNER
                     E v e r y o n e ' s in the market, pal. One end
                     of the barrel or the other...

                                  DIGGS
                     We ' r e chasing up a currency record from
                     last night. These two ring a bell?
      D i g g s displays two digital slides. The owner pauses, suspicious.

                                 G U N S H O P OWNER
                     What are you? Cops? Lawyers?
      D i g g s answers by jerking out the rainmaker. The twin barrels
      aimed at his head, the gunshop o w n e r loses his cool a little-

                                 G U N S H O P OWNER
                     H i m , I remember... Came in just before
                     closing... wanted a shooter but didn't
                     have no ID... settled for one of these.

      He displays a HUNTING KNIFE, unsheathing it, showing the blade.

                                DIGGS
                     Did he give you a name?

                                G U N S H O P OWNER
                     No.

                                                                    94.



                                DIGGS
                     Did he say where he was going?
                                 G U N S H O P OWNER
                     No.

      D i g g s cocks the hammer. The owner flinches. Then, off the knife-

                                  G U N S H O P OWNER
                     The r e was one thing. Kinda w e i r d .
                     He wanted to know how to use it...

143   EXT . APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

      An apartment building towers overhead, vaguely ominous. Lincoln
      approaches the entrance with Ester. We now see he has a band-aid
      covering his crosshatch. He takes Ester briefly aside, teasing
      some tresses over hers. As she gently smooths down her hair,
      Ester catches his eye. A look flickers between them. Then-

                                  D O O R M A N (O.S.)
                     Fancy dress, was it, sir?

      A DOORMAN is looking at them like they just rolled out of a club
      he wouldn't be seen dead in. Off their flustered looks, he gives
      an apologetic smile. Then opens the door and holds it for them.
      Lincoln reaches for Ester's hand. Then stiffly leads her inside.

144   INT . CORRIDOR - AN UPPER FLOOR - DAY

      The doors are set with small glowing orbs at peephole level. Like
      eyeballs, watching, as Lincoln and Ester proceed up the corridor.
      They stop at a door. Lincoln checks the number. Pauses heavily.
      Then looks for some type of doorbell. As his eyes cross the orb,
      it seems to blink. Then comes a sound of disengaging locks. Then
      the door swings open. Lincoln flinches, taken by surprise. Then
      frowns as he sees there is no one on the other side of the door.

145   INT . APARTMENT - DAY

      Lincoln enters, wary, scanning around. A living room. Framed
      pictures. A sofa, chairs. A coffee table, empty bottles,
      cigarette packs, a full ashtray. A bureau, some paperwork.
      Silence, stillness. No sign of life, no sense of danger. Lincoln
      moves across to the bureau and starts leafing through the
      papers. Ester ventures in through the door, curious-

                                 ESTER
                     What are you looking for?

                              LINCOLN
                     I don't know. Something. Just wait
                     there and make sure nobody's coming.

                                                                    95.



As he leafs the papers, Ester waits dutifully by the door. Her
eyes wander across the framed pictures. Then narrow onto a 3D
p h o t o g r a p h . A college boxing team photo, grinning cup winners.

                            ESTER
                L o o k at this...

Lincoln returns to her. Ester points to the photo. A face in the
row, blurred but eerily familiar. Lincoln seems not to react.
Ester, curiosity piqued, scans the other pictures. She alights
on a framed certificate - "Thomas R. Lincoln, Attorney-at-Law".

                            A MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                What the hell are you doing?

Lincoln turns to confront A MAN in a robe. Disheveled from sleep,
grey from a hangover... the man's face is unmistakably his own.
This is TOM LINCOLN, sponsor of Lincoln Six-Echo, his bleary
eyes now widening in disbelief as he recognizes his agnate-

                           TOM
                Oh, Jesus...

Lincoln is better prepared for this encounter but still stunned
by the sight of his double in the flesh. Sponsor and agnate stand
frozen. The only movement is Ester, her eyes flicking between
the same men, fraught, confused. Lincoln breaks the silence-

                           LINCOLN
                Who are you?

Lincoln steps closer, eyes piercing. Tom takes a step back.

                            TOM
                The y said... I'd never have to see you.

                           LINCOLN
                Who?
Lincoln takes another step closer. Tom takes another step back.

                           TOM
                The people...

                            LINCOLN
                What people?

Lincoln takes another step closer. Tom stiffens, gathers himself-

                             TOM
                Look, if you don't get out of here
                right now, I'm calling security...

                                                                  96.



Lincoln examines him, assimilating. His double seems to be as
belligerent as he is. Reasoning now, threat response kicking in.
Lincoln draws the hunting knife. Unused to it, he points it like
a gun. But it's enough of a threat for Tom, who swallows dryly-

                           TOM
                Why are you here? What do you want?

                         LINCOLN
                I want to know...

Tom grimaces at the ambiguity. That face. His f a c e . If not for
the pounding headache this would be a bad dream. He lowers onto
the sofa. Finds a cigarette and lights up. A drag, mind kicking
in. The knife cautioning him. With a slow exhale, he confesses-

                             TOM
                One of the partners at my firm... he
                told me about it. Gave me a referral.
                I thought he was joking at first. I
                went out there, took the sales tour.
                Even before that I knew it wasn't a
                joke. There was this discretion agree-
                ment. I never saw anything like it and
                I've seen a lot. Ironclad... breathe a
                word and they've got you by the balls.
                I don't know... There's cancer in my
                family. Maybe it was just to keep up.
                All the partners were on the policy.

                           LINCOLN
                The policy?

He looks at his agnate. Then realizes the level of ignorance.

                               TOM
                Christ, you have no idea, do you?

                             LINCOLN
                About what?

Tom drags his cigarette, fingers trembling. He shakes his head-

                         TOM
                I can't fucking do this...

                            LINCOLN
                What are you talking about?

Lincoln moves closer, pointing the knife. Tom flinches, then-

                                  TOM
                Insurance. You're an insurance policy.

                                                                   97.



                           LINCOLN
               What is that?

                             TOM
               Health insurance... medical...

                           LINCOLN
               What does that mean?

                         TOM
               If I get sick... if part of me gets
               sick... I take a healthy part from you.

                             LINCOLN
               Why?

                          TOM
               How do you expect me to answer that?
               It's just how it works, that's all.

Tom looks at his agnate. The insistent stare. The knife, pointing
at him like a finger. His fear yields to a flicker of anger-

                           TOM
               What do you want? A fucking apology?

                          LINCOLN
               Why do I look like you?

                              TOM
               Because you are me . . .

                        LINCOLN
               I don't understand.

                              TOM
               Because they made you from my cells...

                             LINCOLN
               Made me?

                             TOM
                      ( a flare of anger)
               That's right. You were made. Cooked up
               in a centrifuge like a fucking boiled
               egg. Every thought running through your
               head, every word coming out of your
               mouth, all of it, manufactured, made...

Lincoln frowns, trying to assimilate. Too much to process.

                             LINCOLN
               You . . . you're the one who made me?

                                                                98.



                         TOM
               No.

                          LINCOLN
               Who made me?

                        TOM
               I signed a contract. I can show you.

He gestures to a mirror on the wall. Lincoln steps back but his
eyes are unremitting. Tom rises, cautious, crossing to the wall.
He opens the mirror to reveal a wall safe. His trembling fingers
tap the keypad and the safe hisses open. He draws out a contract
folder embossed with a crosshatch. Then offers it to his agnate-

                           TOM
               It's all right there. Who, why...

Lincoln takes the contract folder and starts flipping the pages,
reading. A pendulous silence falls. Tom stands watching, smoking
nervously. Ester stands by the door, trying to take all this in.

                           TOM
               Look you've got what you wanted. Now
               why don't you just get out of here?

                                LINCOLN
                      (pause, looks at him)
               There are men out there, looking for
               us. I want you to make them stop.

                        TOM
               I can't...

Lincoln sets down the contract and brings up the knife again.

                          TOM
               I can't. Look, I'm a lawyer, I know how
               it works. The contract, everything, it's
               all laced with confidentiality clauses.
               It means they don't want this to get
               out. It means whatever I do, they're
               not going to stop. You understand?

Lincoln pauses, assimilating. His double's expression indicates
that he's telling the truth. Maybe try a more practical request-

                         LINCOLN
               Do you have transport?

                                 TOM
               Transport , yes... yes, parked
               downstairs... Bay 53... Take it...

                                                                      99.



                                LINCOLN
                     And then you'll call security?

      Lincoln steps closer, pointing the knife. Tom tries to stay dead-
      pan. The lawyer kicking in. Look them in the eye when you lie-

                                TOM
                     I'm not going to call security. I'm
                     not going to call anybody, okay?

      Lincoln looks at his double, reason now yielding to anger. Deep,
      roiling. Tom looks at his agnate, fear welling, deadpan cracking-

                                  TOM
                     Look, maybe there's something... maybe
                     there's a way to cancel the contract...

      Lincoln presses the tip of the blade to his double's cheek.

                                TOM
                     For Christ's sake! It's not my fault!

      Lincoln inches the blade deeper into the trembling face, drawing
      blood. The anger urging, hungry for more blood. Then suddenly-

                                     ESTER
                     Lincoln ! No!

      Lincoln looks at her, the anger interrupted, the knife still in
      place. He pauses. Then returns to his double. The dreading eyes,
      the trickle of blood down the face. His e y e s . His f a c e . A long,
      foreboding moment. Then suddenly Lincoln lashes out. His fist
      sends his double flying, falling in a flurry of contract pages.
      Lincoln stands over him, looking down, like a dominant species.
      His double is unmoving, unconscious. Lincoln abruptly spins away.

146   INT . ELEVATOR - DESCENDING

      The light panel flashes. Lincoln stands grimly, head lowered,
      trying to fathom the anger roiling within. Ester stares at him,
      wanly. Both held in the dark tableau. And the elevator descends.

147   INT . UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - DAY

      The vehicle parked in bay 53 is a hybrid of sportscar a n d speed-
      b o a t , a two-seater known as a "skiff". Lincoln and Ester climb
      in. Lincoln reviews the drive console, the controls, all of it,
      meaningless. His eyes cross an orb set in the steering wheel.

      The orb seems to blink and suddenly the drive console lights up.
      Lincoln reviews it. A screen in front of him is flashing:
      "PILOTING: MANUAL/AUTO?". He assimilates. Then ventures-

                                                                     100.



                                LINCOLN
                      Auto...

      The interface processes, then asks: "DESTINATION: NAME/ADDRESS?"

                                 LINCOLN
                      O u t of state... West...

      The interface processes, then reports "UNDOCKING". Lincoln and
      Ester jolt as the skiff shunts forward. Lode-poles pulsing ahead
      of them, the skiff moves out, as if pulled by a phantom tugboat.

148   EXT . STREET - DAY

      The skiff buckets off the ramp into a street inlet. Then stops
      rocking a little. The interface reports: "ESTABLISHING UPLINK".
      On another screen, a road map appears. A red dot plants at their
      point of origin then bleeds into a red line, plotting a course.

      The autopilot scans for traffic, then nudges forward on the
      throttle. The resistors drone, the steering wheel turns and the
      skiff noses onto the street. Finding its lane, it drops to
      cruise speed. Lincoln studies the interplay of steering wheel,
      throttle and brake. Then glances at Ester. She's plunged in
      thought, staring off. She turns to him with a haggard frown-

                                 ESTER
                      The man back there... who looked like
                      you... does it mean I have someone too?

      Lincoln looks at her blankly, unknowing. Ester stares off again,
      her brow knotting with unanswered questions. But Lincoln's gaze
      lingers. Her pale skin, her limpid eyes, her hair fluttering in
      the breeze. It's the first time he's really seen Ester's beauty.

149   EXT . PHOENIX SKYLINE - DAY

      The domes and spires glint in the sunlight. We isolate a glass
      steeple. A crosshatch insignia. A legend "Sanger Industries".

150   INT . CROWNE'S OFFICE - SANGER INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY

      A corner office with a panoramic view of the city. Crowne sits
      at a console desk, reviewing some data on a holoframe screen. A
      knock on the door and HER SECRETARY enters, looking unsettled-

                               SECRETARY
                      I just thought I should warn you. I
                      have a sponsor holding. His name's
                      Thomas Lincoln. He sounded... angry.

                                                                      101.



151   EXT. STREET TUNNEL - DAY

      The skiff plunges into the shadow of an underpass. The interface
      flashes: "UPLINK INTERRUPT... AUTOPILOT DISENGAGING". Lincoln
      sits up, confused. The skiff is now slowing, drifting as if cut
      loose. He studies the controls again. Positions one hand on the
      steering wheel, the other on the throttle. Then he nudges it.

      The skiff lurches, veering out of its lane. Another vehicle zips
      narrowly past, rocking them with its invisible backwash. Ester
      looks at Lincoln, suddenly alarmed. Lincoln tries again, firm on
      the wheel, gentle on the throttle. And the skiff eases forward.

152   EXT . MOTEL - DOWNTOWN PHOENIX - LATE AFTERNOON
      D i s m a l . The kind of place that precedes a life on the street. We
      push in on a window, cracked glass, the drapes closed within.

153   INT . MOTEL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

      G l o o m y , musty. A "holovision" plays some type of NFL recap. But
      Scheer is not watching it. He is lying on the bed, staring at
      the ceiling, motionless. Off a beeping sound, he stirs. He taps
      a holocom on the nightstand. A holoframe appears, resolving:

                                  Merrick (ON HOLOCOM)
                     K a r l , there's been a complication.

154   EXT . INTERSTATE - SUNSET

      The sunset melts gold across the horizon as the skiff cruises
      westward. Eight lanes of lodeway rake through the salt flats.
      Lincoln is driving more confidently now. Ester is huddled asleep
      beside him. Suddenly the skiff starts to slow again. Lincoln
      reviews the controls. Throttle, forward, foot, off the brake.
      The interface flashes: "REMOTE LOCKDOWN E N G A G I N G " . The skiff is
      steering itself onto the hard shoulder. It now pulls to a dead
      halt. Ester is woken by the sudden inertia. She opens her eyes
      and looks around. They've stopped in the middle of nowhere.

155   EXT . THE SALT FLATS - SUNSET

      The sun sinks in a slow pink haze. Lincoln and Ester walk across
      the salt flats. Visible in the distance is a walled settlement.

156   EXT . THE HERITAGE PARK - SUNSET

      An adobe wall culminates at an arched wooden gateway. Lincoln
      and Ester approach. They haven't walked far but Ester is already
      short of breath. As they near the gateway a holoserve appears,
      like a sentry - Native American, buckskins, feathered headdress
      and facepaint. His voice seems as old as the wind-

                                                                     102.



                                    THE INDIAN HOLOGRAM
                     Welcome to Salt River Heritage Park,
                     home to the Hohokam Nation for over two
                     thousand years. The park is now closed.
                     Please come back during opening hours,
                     9am t o 5pm, Monday through Saturday...

      Ester steps closer. With the sun hazing through, the holoserve
      s e e m s angelic or ghostly. She's examining his striped facepaint-

                               ESTER
                     He has marks on his face like us.

      She turns to Lincoln with a flowering smile. Then rushes up to
      the gateway, suddenly galvanized, squeezing through a gap.

157   EXT . THE HERITAGE PARK - SUNSET

      A ring of Native American pueblos. Pithouses a n d coursed adobes,
      recreations and preserved ruins. Ester rushes around the ring,
      looking into the pueblos as if expecting to find them inhabited.
      She ducks into one of the pithouses. Lincoln follows her inside.

158   INT . PITHOUSE - SUNSET

      The mud walls show a skeleton of saguaro ribs, cholla branches.
      It's cosy in here, dim. The living area, recreated with mats and
      pottery. Lincoln finds Ester looking around, between excitement
      and confusion. She turns to him, her voice wavering, wheezing-

                               ESTER
                     Is this... is this place The Island?
      Lincoln answers with a softly negating look. Ester's face slowly
      falls, the energy draining from her eyes. She lowers onto one of
      the mats and lies down, huddling. She looks up to him, wheezing-

                                ESTER
                     I'm tired. Let me rest for a while.

159   EXT . PITHOUSE - NIGHT

      Silence prevails but for the faint rattle of Ester's breathing.
      Lincoln sits on low stool, in sentinel over her as she sleeps.
      In his eyes, we see the weight of foreboding. He doesn't know
      what they'll do when she wakes. Of a moaning sound he looks at
      Ester. Then realizes it isn't coming from her. The sound is far
      off, a rhythmic moaning. Now discernible as the chant of voices.

160   EXT . THE PLATFORM MOUND - NIGHT
      A blazing fire. Figures in silhouette, moving around, chanting.

                                                                     103.



      The platform mound is situated just beyond the heritage park. An
      ancient ceremonial site, stepped in ruins, dusted with caliche.
      Pima and Maricopa, descendants of the Hohokam, are congregated
      for a solstice ceremony. Off to the side, a group of horses are
      tethered, shuffling, snorting. Lincoln approaches, cautiously,
      but somehow like a moth to the flame. He stops at a distance,
      watching. The curiosity of congruent sound and movement.

                                VOICE (O.S.)
                     You look a little lost, my friend.

      Lincoln turns to a figure emerging from the night. A tall man -
      swarthy skin, mist-colored eyes. His tribal name is GREY DOVE-

                               GREY DOVE (cont'd)
                     Or did you come here for a reason?

      Lincoln examines the tall man. The face seems as deep and gentle
      as the voice. His sense of danger, unstirring, he concedes-

                              LINCOLN
                     I was looking for water.

                                GREY DOVE
                     Not the best place to look.

                               LINCOLN
                     My transport... it stopped working.

                              GREY DOVE
                     I see. And where were you going?

                                LINCOLN
                     Out of state...

      Lincoln sighs, the destination seeming very far away. Grey Dove
      considers him. This bruised, weary outsider is somehow childlike.

161   EXT . THE CEREMONY - LATER

      The fire blazes across the face of a shaman. Old, gnarled, and
      dry as the salt flats. With a sacred mutter, he slips a peyote
      button onto his tongue. Then flings back his head, casting his
      eyes to the stars. When he lowers his head again, we see his
      pupils dilating. He rises, chanting, moving in ceremonial steps
      around the fire. Tribespeople s i t in a ring, joining the chant.

      Beyond the ring, others are dining at a roasting pit. Roast
      rabbit. Cornflour bread. The food is as it might been two
      thousand years ago. Only the sight of plastic water gallons
      breaks the illusion. Lincoln stands apart with Grey Dove, eating
      ravenously, gulping from a water gallon. He looks around-

                                                                     104.



                                 LINCOLN
                     What is this place?

                               GREY DOVE
                     It is a sacred place. My people come
                     here to commune with their spirits.

      Lincoln looks at him, puzzled. Grey Dove smiles tolerantly.

                                     GREY DOVE
                     Not easy to understand perhaps. For us,
                     the spirit is like the shadow on the
                     rock. Sometimes close, sometimes far
                     away, sometimes the sky clouds and the
                     shadow fades. We come here to ask our
                     spirits to return to us. The man...
                           (gestures to the shaman)
                     He speaks to The Grandfather from whom
                     all spirits are born. The Great Spirit
                     who binds every living thing. He has no
                     name. But he is everywhere. In the sun
                     and the moon, the wind and the rain...

      The shaman's chanting grows louder, more insistent. His circuit
      around the fire becoming faster, building in religious fervor.

                                GREY DOVE
                     Now he asks for the gift of vision that
                     he may see through to the spirit shape
                     of things. To find the spirits of the
                     lost. To bring them into the light...

      The shaman's chanting suddenly stops. He is looking directly at
      Lincoln, pointing. His face, contorting with what might be anger
      or fear. He starts babbling in dialect, ardently. Lincoln frowns
      in confusion. Grey Dove quietly draws him away from the mound.

162   INT . PITHOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

      Ester stirs from slumber. On the ground beside her, she finds a
      bowl of food and a water gallon. Now through the gloom, she sees
      Lincoln, sitting on the stool like he never left, keeping vigil.
      Something seems different about him as he turns, registering her-

                                LINCOLN
                     A r e you alright?

                              ESTER
                     I feel better after I sleep.

      Lincoln nods absently and stares off out of the doorway. Ester
      moves closer, sensing something. He speaks as if from far away-

                                                                      105.



                                LINCOLN
                     The man out there... he said
                     everything has a spirit... every
                     living thing... but not...

      His voice cuts off. Ester looks at him, recognizing his pain.
      She doesn't understand what it is or what caused it. It's pain
      and it evokes a response in her. A feeling, taking her over. Her
      hand reaches out and strokes his hair. Lincoln looks up at her,
      questioning. With supreme knowing, Ester leans down and kisses
      him. At the touch of her lips, Lincoln pauses. The first kiss
      for both of them but Ester takes it in her stride. The calm
      ballet of nature. Fluidly peeling off her shirt, breasts
      steeping with moonlight. Lincoln rising to face her, feeling her
      proximity, her radiant heat. His fingers touching her breasts.
      Ester trembling, her lips once more finding his. Lincoln closing
      his eyes, the rush of sensation, overwhelming. He yields to it,
      returning the kiss, with hunger, with passion... with spirit.

163   EXT . THE INTERSTATE - DAWN

      The sun rises in the east, depicting the traffic in silhouette.
      A vehicle arcs from the fast lane onto the hard shoulder where
      the skiff sits abandoned. The grey cutter pulls to a halt.

164   EXT . HARD SHOULDER - DAWN

      D i g g s and Burdon move up on the skiff, cover positions, weapons
      levelled. Burdon spins in to the driver side, snapping aim with
      the thunderbolt. But the skiff is empty. The only sign of life
      is the interface, flashing red: "REMOTE LOCATOR TRANSMITTING".

      B u r d o n exchanges a look with Diggs. No dice. Diggs reaches in his
      pocket and pulls out what looks like an electronic telescope. He
      puts it to his eye and pans the salt flats. Burdon crouches at
      the roadside, looking for tracks. Then Diggs fixes on something-

                              DIGGS
                     I got thermals.

165   EXT . PLATFORM MOUND - SUNRISE

      The fire is now reduced to a heap of embers. The tribespeople
      a r e asleep around the mound, wrapped in ethnic blankets. Diggs
      and Burdon move up stealthily, weapons at the ready. The horses
      bristle and snort, betraying their approach. The tribespeople,
      stirred by the noise, awake. Diggs and Burdon swing aim around
      the ring as faces rise and stare at them. None of the faces have
      white skin. Diggs lowers his weapon and addresses the gathering-

                                DIGGS
                     I'm looking for two bond runners. They
                     ditched near here last night.

                                                                        106.



                                          DIGGS (cont'd)
                      One man, one woman. Tattoos on the
                      forehead...
                              (nothing, just silent stares)
                      Anyone's seen them, I got fifty green.
                              (still nothing, aggravated)
                      What the fuck are you? Deaf and dumb?

      The tribal faces just keep staring. Diggs scowls. Then suddenly
      swings aim with the rainmaker and fires. -BOOM- hitting one of
      the horses in the haunch. It rears up, whinnying, setting off
      the rest of the horses. Diggs turns back to the gathering-

                                     DIGGS
                     Somebody start talking.

      He scans around the ring. Then fixes on one of the women. She
      lifts a trembling finger to a man nearby. Grey Dove stiffens.

166   EXT . SALT MOUNTAINS - SUNRISE

      The sunrise depicts two silhouettes, moving across the ridge.
      Lincoln and Ester clamber over the calcified rocks. Ester now
      stops to catch her breath. She is wheezing again, fighting for
      air. As Lincoln looks on with concern, she musters a brave smile-

                              ESTER
                     I can make it.

167   EXT . SALT CANYON - EARLY MORNING

      A freight barge whooshes through the canyon, trailing a chain of
      low, arched containers, capacious in width rather than height.
      The conveyance is similar to a lodeway but wider, deeper, known
      as a "lode-canal". At each end of the canyon, it intersects with
      other lode-canals, converging to use the same passage, a system
      of signals and lockgates controlling the flow of freight traffic.
      High above, on the south rim of the canyon, we find Lincoln and
      Ester. Ester is no longer wheezing but rasping. She looks down at
      the passing vessel, daunted. Lincoln offers her small comfort-

                                  LINCOLN
                     Don't worry. The one we want goes the
                     other way. He said it goes slower.

      They exchange a smile. The chain of containers tailing off, the
      barge leaving the canyon with a blast of its resonant claxon.

168   EXT . THE SOUTH FACE - MORNING

      Lincoln and Ester descend the rocky slope toward the lode-canal.
      Ester stops, having to catch her breath every few steps. Lincoln
      tries to hide his concern, looking away towards the sunrise. The
      westbound vessel will be coming soon.

                                                                        107.



      They just need to get out of state... Now he frowns, sensing
      something. Faint but growing. His jaw clenches. His face
      tightens. His pupils start to dilate.

169   EXT . THE NORTH RIDGE - MORNING

      The north ridge is evidently threaded by a lodeway as we see the
      grey cutter pulling up. Diggs and Burdon get out and look down
      into the canyon. Diggs pulls out his scope and starts panning.
      Burdon peels off his jacket. It's early but it's already getting
      hot. Diggs now pauses, handing him the scope for his opinion-

                                DIGGS
                      Up there in the rocks. Three o'clock.
                      I'm not sure... it could be ambient.

170   EXT . THE SOUTH FACE - MORNING

      Lincoln and Ester hide in the shadow of a rock. Ester is muffling
      her breaths as best she can. Lincoln now hazards a look over the
      top. Two figures are climbing down the far side of the canyon,
      now pointing in their direction. He ducks back, assimilating.
      Hiding, no longer an option. Nor running, at least for Ester.
      His face sets in a grimace of conviction. His eyes glow darkly.

171   EXT . THE NORTH FACE - MORNING

      Diggs and Burdon reach the foot of the rocks. Neither speaks,
      communicating in hand-signals. Diggs slips into the lode-canal.
      Burdon covers, sweeping the thunderbolt across the south face.

      Diggs emerges from the far side of the lode-canal. He stays low,
      moving up into the rocks. Then, from above, a rock dislodges,
      rattling down. Diggs reacts instantly, targeting, opening fire-

      - B O O M - B O O M - The shots from the rainmaker swathe across the rock.
      The thunderbolt now adding to the barrage, Burdon firing from
      the far side - SHOTS, BOLTS, KICKING UP A STORM OF DUST --
      SUDDENLY HOLDING FIRE, waiting for the dust to clear, reloading.
      No sign of movement. Just a slide of rubble. Fading echoes.

      D I G G S STEALS ONWARDS UP THE ROCKS - into the fog of dust - the
      sunlight and shadow playing tricks on his eyes - then suddenly-
      LINCOLN BURSTS OUT OF THE DUST - from the left - tackling the
      pale man - both of them toppling - tumbling down the slope --

      THUDDING TO A HALT at the lip of the lode-canal - the rainmaker
      lost in the fall - the impact throwing up a billow of dust --
      THE DUSTCLOUD - Diggs and Lincoln struggling, clawing, punching -
      Lincoln, with surprise on his side, gaining with the upper hand--

                                                               108.



DIGGS' CLAWING FINGERS discover Lincoln's knife - tugging it from
his jacket - Lincoln grabbing his wrist, fighting for control -
THE KNIFE MOVING BETWEEN THEM - Diggs with better leverage - the
blade inching towards Lincoln's face - pressing into his cheek--

LINCOLN'S EYES - welling black, almost inhuman - the sense of
danger screaming in his ears - he grabs the pale man's throat -
DIGGS' EYES - bulging as he strains to push the knife home -
oxygen draining - conscious ebbing - he slumps back -

LINCOLN REGAINS THE KNIFE - the pale man seems to be out cold -
but he's not sure - he pauses holding the blade over him, then--
- B O O M - THE KNIFE FLIES FROM HIS GRIP IN A BURST OF DISCHARGE -

BURDON SNAPS AIM FOR ANOTHER SHOT - beading - his target moving
now - dropping out of the firing line - into the lode-canal--

BURDON INCHES TOWARD THE EDGE - thunderbolt angling downward -
into the trench - then suddenly he's GRABBED BY THE ANKLES -

LINCOLN STRAINING to overbalance the giant - feet up against the
wall - like trying to topple a tree - finally winning some give-

BURDON TOPPLES INTO THE TRENCH - his ankles clamped by his
quarry - both men meeting the concrete with a bone-shaking-

- THUD - LINCOLN IS CRUSHED BENEATH THE MASSIVE WEIGHT - the giant
already recovering from the fall - now dragging him upright--

- THUD - BURDON THROWS A PUNCH - mightily - hurling his quarry
across the trench - moving in quickly, following up with a kick--

- THUD - LINCOLN CRUMPLES as the boot smacks into him - then
another kick - then another - the world starts blurring --

BURDON TURNS AWAY - his quarry disabled for now - he recovers
his thunderbolt - turns back to administer the coup de grace--

LINCOLN LOOKS UP - the giant looming - the muzzle of his weapon
thrumming with energy - the rivets on his denims start rattling--

BURDON SPINS ROUND - the thunderbolt suddenly ripped from his
grasp - there, in the distance - AN EASTBOUND BARGE IS COMING -

LINCOLN SCRAMBLES UP THE WALL OF THE TRENCH - muscles straining,
feet slipping on the concrete - escaping the imminent vessel --

                                                               109.



DIGGS COMING TO - now seeing his quarry a short distance away -
emerging from the lode-canal - he looks around for a weapon, then-

                             BURDON (O.S.)
               Diggs! Get me outta here!

BURDON STRUGGLING TO CLIMB OUT OF THE TRENCH - with one arm,
it's almost impossible - fighting against his own weight--
DIGGS REACHING THE EDGE - seeing the eastbound barge coming -
grabbing his partner's outreached hand - pulling him upward -

BURDON'S PANIC - his other arm flinging away - HIS METAL BRACE
SNARED BY THE LODE-STREAM - the force shuddering his entire body-
DIGGS PULLING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT - feet slipping - locked in a
tug of war with the lodestream - THE BARGE IS CLOSING FAST--

BURDON'S HORROR - now suspended between the two forces - feet
kicking - THE BARGE IS ALMOST UPON HIM - he screams agonized--

                           BURDON
               Help me! HELP MEEEEE!

THE SCREAM IS INSTANTLY LOST in the whoosh of the barge. Diggs,
stunned, just looks at his hands, empty, spattered with blood.

                        DIGGS
               Burdie...?

THE SHADOW OF THE ROCK - Lincoln rejoins Ester - casting a look
back - the eastbound barge now plummeting into the distance--
D I G G S STOOPING AT THE EDGE OF THE TRENCH - looking down - all
that remains of his partner is a smear of blood at the concrete--

LINCOLN AND ESTER REACHING THE FOOT OF THE ROCKS - seeing THE
WESTBOUND BARGE against the sunrise - snaking into the passage--
DIGGS PULLING UPRIGHT - spotting his quarry - fire in his eyes -
drawing out a boot-knife - slipping it between his teeth--

THE WESTBOUND BARGE pulling through the canyon - lode-poles
pulsing ahead of it - polarity thrumming in opposing flow--
LINCOLN AND ESTER start running as the barge comes towards them -
Lincoln pulling Ester along - struggling to match the pace--

A SOUND LIKE A BEATING TYMPANY COMING TOWARDS THEM - they look
round to see - A SHADOW RUNNING ALONG THE TOP OF THE BARGE--
D I G G S FLINGING HIMSELF OFF THE BARGE - the blade in his teeth -
arms spread - for an instant, like a vulture against the sun--

                                                                110.



LINCOLN IS SUDDENLY CRUSHED by the weight of his landing - ESTER
IS HURLED SIDEWAYS - into a ditch - lost in a cloud of dust--
D I G G S PULLING HIMSELF UP, astride of Lincoln - snatching the
knife from his clenched teeth - the sound, like a whetstone--

LINCOLN SPITTING DIRT - suddenly grabbed by the scalp and tugged
sideways - twisted partways o n t o his back, forced to look up at--
A BLACK SPOT AGAINST THE SUN - Diggs' face set in a murderous
sneer - he wants to see this fucker's e y e s - the torment--

LINCOLN DAZZLED BY THE SUNLIGHT - but suddenly knowing the face
of death - now catching the brief glint of the knife as --
D I G G S PLUNGES THE BLADE DOWN - slicing into his quarry's hand as
he throws it up in defense - his quarry YOWLING WITH PAIN--

LINCOLN FEELING THE STAB - his deepest instinct suddenly awoken -
every impulse, every fiber brought into alignment - survival--
D I G G S IS HURLED INTO THE AIR as Lincoln surges upward - he
tumbles backward into the dust - losing hold of the boot-knife--

LINCOLN PUSHES HIMSELF UPRIGHT - only makes it half-way -
scrambling towards the pale man - all fours, like an animal--
D I G G S CLAWING AROUND IN THE DUST - fingers finding metal - the
boot-knife - he brings it up - slashing at his imminent quarry--

LINCOLN RECOILING - the blade nicking his face - sudden rage -
grabbing the pale man by the arm - swinging him round into--
- B O O M - THE MOVING WALL OF FREIGHT CONTAINERS - as the westbound
barge passes - Diggs bounces off - stumbling to keep balance--

LINCOLN ON THE RETREAT - the pale man coming at him with the
knife - another nick - seeing a gap now, shoving him backwards--
- B O O M - THE MOVING WALL RESOUNDS - Diggs howls - snagged by a
bolt - hurt, his fury becomes incandescent - he strikes madly--

LINCOLN STUMBLING BACK - the pale man coming at him - the blade
flashing to and fro - frenzied - like a threshing machine--
F O R C I N G HIM UP AGAINST THE ROCKS - the knife almost upon him -
he grits his teeth and lunges forward - charging like a bull --

DIGGS CAREENS BACKWARD, still swiping the blade - digging into
his quarry - headlong towards the moving wall - hitting with--
- W H U M P - no resonant boom - no bouncing back - Diggs has hit a
gap between the containers and HIS HEAD HAS BEEN LOPPED OFF -

                                                                       111.



      LINCOLN STANDS HORRIFIED - as the headless body is spun by the
      moving wall - dropping into the trench as the barge tails off-
      The westbound barge gains speed, leaving the canyon. But there
      is Ester, running after it, vainly, coughing and sputtering.

                                   LINCOLN
                     Ester! Stop! It's no use!

                               ESTER
                     We have to... get to... The Island...

                                 LINCOLN
                     It's going too fast!

                               ESTER
                     We have to... get to...

      Ester staggers a few more steps, then collapses to her knees,
      rasping for breath. As Lincoln reaches her, she slumps back into
      his arms. Her head lolling, eyes rolled back to white, a drool
      of blood spilling from her lips. Then the blast of a claxon c u t s
      the air as the westbound barge disappears into the distance.

                                                          F A D E TO BLACK.

172   EXT . SEDONA - LATE AFTERNOON

      A ranch home in the middle of nowhere. Long shadows.

173   INT . STUDIO - RANCH HOME - LATE AFTERNOON

      Late golden sunlight through a mist of sawdust. Abstract wood
      sculptures are visible. Juniper wood, carved along the bias of
      the grain, polished to accentuate the curves of natural growth.
      AN OLDER WOMAN runs a sander over a work in progress - 60's, in
      coveralls, gray her tied back, her face shielded by goggles and
      a bandana. She pauses to review her work, shutting down the
      sander, slipping off her goggles and bandana. Her face is eerily
      familiar. Her name is KATHERINE. She now moves to the window,
      catching sight of something outside. Curiously, she watches a
      vehicle coming down the long driveway. A dusty, grey cutter.

174   EXT . FRONT PORCH - RANCH HOME - LATE AFTERNOON

      Katherine opens the front door. The cutter is now docked in the
      port and a stranger is staggering towards her. In his arms, is
      an unconscious woman. Now Katherine can see the face - younger,
      but unmistakable even so. Her voice comes in a chilled whisper-

                                KATHERINE
                     O h , God... Oh, my God...

                                                                      112.



175   EXT. PHOENIX - LATE AFTERNOON

      A whisper cuts across the glistening skyline towards The Sanger
      Industries Tower. It circles in to land on a rooftop helipad.

176   INT . CROWNE'S OFFICE - SANGER INDUSTRIES TOWER

      Silence . Crowne sits at her desk. Merrick sits across from her.
      Waiting. The air stirs as the secretary ushers Dr. Sanger into
      the office. No greetings are exchanged. Sanger just lowers into
      a chair, a little unsettled to find Merrick has preceded him.

                              CROWNE
                     I take it you've heard the news.

                                DR. SANGER
                     The bond agents. Yes. Unfortunate.

                                      CROWNE
                     Unfortunate?
                            (pauses, lights a cigarette)
                     We're way past unfortunate, Henry.

                              DR. SANGER
                     I thought we'd covered ourselves.

                                CROWNE
                     The police won't connect the bond
                     agents to us. But that's not the
                     problem. It's the sponsor.

                                 DR. SANGER
                     What are you talking about?

                                MERRICK
                     The male agnate tracked him down.

                                  CROWNE
                     His name's Thomas Lincoln. It seems
                     they had a genetic reunion. Not a
                     h a p p y one. It was all I could do to
                     stop him going to the authorities.

                              DR. SANGER
                     I still don't see the problem.

                               CROWNE
                     He may not want a police involvement
                     but he's already threatened to file
                     suit. And he's one of the biggest
                     litigation attorneys in the city.

                                                              113.



                            DR. SANGER
              That's why we have you, Ellen.

                            CROWNE
              That's why I asked Bernard to come out
              here. To find out how it happened.

                       MERRICK
              I told her, Henry. About synesthesia.

S a n g e r casts a betrayed look at Merrick. Then returns to Crowne-

                        DR. SANGER
              I t was a marginal problem. And it was
              under control - according to Bernard.

                            CROWNE
              That's not the point. Whether or not
              it's a factor in this instance, it
              puts us in breach of the clone laws.

                        DR. SANGER
              I t doesn't even touch their genetics.

                           CROWNE
              I'm talking about self-awareness. The
              virtual humanity statutes require us
              t o give them consciousness to the
              l e v e l of functionality. But not beyond.

This gives Sanger pause. Crowne drags her cigarette acutely.

                              CROWNE
              L e g a l l y , we are naked on every level.
              Federal legislature, state licensing,
              sponsorship contract... But even if we
              did manage to weather the legal storm,
              we'd never survive the public scrutiny.

S a n g e r absorbs this, calmly shaking a pill from his pill bottle.

                          DR. SANGER
              I've spent my entire career facing down
              naysayers, Ellen. Don't think for a
              second I'm afraid of facing them now.

                         CROWNE
              You remember cryogenics? At the outset,
              people dismissed it as a rich man's
              folly. Eccentric millionaires freezing
              their brains, hoping to wake up in a new
              body.

                                                                114.



                                 CROWNE (cont'd)
               E v e n when cloning showed signs of
               m a k i n g it feasible, it wasn't moral
               a f f r o n t that caused the backlash. It
               w a s the scope. The scope, Henry. When
               t h e size of the customer base was
               e x p o s e d , it screamed inequality - one
               m e d i c i n e for the rich and one for the
               p o o r . The pressure for accessible cryo-
               genics a s good as buried the industry.
                       ( a pause for emphasis)
               O u r graves are being dug as we speak,
               g e n t l e m e n . Every passing second, they
               g e t deeper. If we're going to survive,
               w e have to act swiftly and decisively.

                               DR. SANGER
               A l r i g h t . What do you suggest?

S a n g e r dry swallows the pill. Ellen opens a contract folder.

                          CROWNE
               O u r security chief - I've been looking
               at his file. Ex-marine, served in South
               China - do we think he still has it in
               him?

                               DR. SANGER
                     ( r e a l i z i n g , suddenly harsh)
               A r e you insane?

The i r eyes deadlock. Crowne gives Merrick a sideways glance.

                           CROWNE
               ` You ever wondered why Henry takes
               those pills, Bernard? Why he doesn't
               avail himself of his own technology?

                         DR. SANGER
               An agnate could give me a new heart
               but to get it to function mentally...

                                CROWNE
               B u l l s h i t , Henry. Bullshit. You don't
               want to deal with reality. Only with
               concept. I may not have been there at
               the start but I heard the stories. You
               wanted in on every aspect of
               construction, from environmental
               design right down to the classical
               playlists. I t wasn't enough just to
               make it work, was it? No, you wanted
               your own little utopia.

                                                                       115.

                     Swanning a r o u n d in your mountain
                     r e t r e a t like some self-appointed

      S a n g e r crosses to the window, looking down onto the city.

                                DR. SANGER
                     You see that street down there...?
                     Running east from the stadium. My
                     father used to take me to church on
                     that street. An old Spanish church.

                                   CROWNE
                     What's your point?

                              DR. SANGER
                     I didn't know they'd torn it down.

177   INT . GUEST BEDROOM - KATHERINE'S HOUSE - EVENING

      A floral bedroom. Ester lies in bed, wheezing, semi-conscious.
      Katherine slips a pill between her lips and tips in some water.
      Lincoln stands watching. Katherine ushers him out of the room.

178   INT . KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

      The kitchen is arrayed with modern technology but softened with
      paintings and craftwork. A r t marginally overwhelming science.
      Katherine starts making some herb tea in the traditional manner.

                                 LINCOLN
                     What did you give her?

                                 KATHERINE
                     J u s t something to help her sleep. I
                     think she has a bronchial infection.
                     But I'm not sure I should give her an
                     antibiotic in case it effects the baby.

                               LINCOLN
                     S o you know about the baby...

      Katherine pauses, reality sinking its claws. She looks at him-

                                                                 116.



                            KATHERINE
               Is n ' t that why you came here?

                        LINCOLN
               I found your name in the listings. I
               wasn't sure. You don't look like her.

                           KATHERINE
               The y have a plan... For women like me.

                         LINCOLN
               S o you're the one who takes her baby.

Katherine winces at him. It's uttered so matter-of-factly. She
pauses, hanging her head, searching within herself.

                          KATHERINE
               You know when you're young? How you
               run around thinking you're immortal?

Lincoln ' s look says he has no idea. She seems not to notice.

                            KATHERINE
               The r e was a lodeway accident. I was...
               damaged. After that, I thought no man
               would ever want me. I was wrong. His
               name was John. He said he married me
               for my eyes. Ocean eyes, he called
               them. He always loved the ocean. Up
               there on the wall, that's John's boat.

O f f her gesture, Lincoln glances at the wall. A watercolor of a
yacht. Meaningless to him but Katherine gazes it at, fondly-

                            KATHERINE
               But I think there was always an unspoken
               regret between us. When we heard about
               the technology, it was like... forgive-
               n e s s , like a second chance. A child of
               our own, part of both of us. Sailing
               trips, fishing trips, so many plans...
                      ( a flat beat)
               J o h n got cancer a year ago. He died.

He r eyes mist, distant and bittersweet, talking to herself now.

                              KATHERINE
               I r o n i c . That the same technology could
               have saved his life. And now the baby
               is the only part of him I have left.
               And the boat. I still have the boat.

Lincoln looks discomfited. There's more to this than he thought.

                                                                     117.



179   INT. MOTEL ROOM - EVENING

      S c h e e r opens the door. Merrick stands at the threshold with an
      attache case. Scheer, seemingly unsurprised, brings him inside.

                              SCHEER
                     I told you we shouldn't have gone to
                     outside personnel. They were cowboys.

                               MERRICK
                     We had no choice, Karl. We had to keep
                     this away from The Institute.

                                  SCHEER
                     An d now?

      Merrick lowers in a chair, grim and leaden. He opens his attache
      and pulls out a contract folder. He hands it to Scheer.

                                   SCHEER
                     What's this?

                                 MERRICK
                     Your resignation papers. Maybe `early
                     retirement' would be more accurate...

      S c h e e r leans forward, frowning, curious.

                                MERRICK
                     T e n platinum bounty - if you sign the
                     papers, their loss becomes your gain.

                              SCHEER
                     A parachute... So there's a jump?

                                MERRICK
                     You understand that whatever happens,
                     The Institute must be able to deny it.

      S c h e e r says nothing. Merrick reaches in the attache and pulls out
      a case. Inside are a row of ampules and a pressure syringe-gun.

                               MERRICK
                     We use a chemical to dispose of waste
                     product. It's called di-halcyonate. I t
                     reacts on a molecular level to start a
                     process of internal combustion. The
                     subject is incinerated from the inside
                     out. In post-mortem application it's
                     done its job before rigor mortis. In a
                     live subject, well... you can imagine.

                                                                     118.



                                SCHEER
                     You want to dispose of your products.

                                 MERRICK
                     I t ' s a little more complicated than
                     that. We have to be very... thorough.
                     If you still have it in you, that is.

      S c h e e r gives him a sideways look. Then displays the USMC ring.

                                SCHEER
                     Why do you think I still wear this?

                              MERRICK
                     I don't know.

                               SCHEER
                     I was discharged from the marines for
                     insubordination. If you asked anyone
                     i n my unit, they'd call it heroism. I
                     disobeyed an order to fall back. I took
                     out a bunker complex single-handed.

                               MERRICK
                     S o you wear it is a badge of honor?

                                SCHEER
                     N o . It wasn't bravery. I wasn't afraid
                     of dying. I just didn't care. You see,
                     I suddenly realized I was just a sack
                     of flesh with a heartbeat. Life, death,
                     I just couldn't see the point anymore.

      Merrick allows a respectful pause, then-

                                   MERRICK
                     You'll find a vehicle parked outside.
                     It's unregistered, difficult to trace.
                     I take it we have an agreement...?

180   INT . KATHERINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      A slant of light falls across Ester, writhing in her sleep,
      rasping. Katherine and Lincoln peer in through the doorway,
      checking on her. Then Katherine quietly closes the door.

181   INT . KATHERINE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

      Lincoln paces around, feeling useless. Katherine considers him-

                                 KATHERINE
                     What do I call you?

                                                                 119.



                               LINCOLN
               Lincoln . My name's Lincoln.

                               KATHERINE
               Lincoln , I think she needs professional
               help. I think she needs to see a doctor.

                          LINCOLN
               N o . They'll find her. They'll take her.

                          KATHERINE
               N o t if I don't want them to.

                          LINCOLN
               You don't understand. They don't want
               people to know about her. Either of us.

                          KATHERINE
               The doctor I'm thinking of, he's an
               old friend. He look after John in
               t h e final stages. I trust him.

                           LINCOLN
               Why ? So you can take her baby?

                          KATHERINE
               N o . No, that's not what I want.
O f f Lincoln's blunt look, she sighs, lowering into a chair.

                               KATHERINE
               M a y b e I didn't realize she'd      be so...
                      ( c u t s off, a deep pause)
               M a y b e I just didn't want to.      Either
               way, I was wrong. I want you          to know
               that. I was wrong... And I'm          sorry.

A heavy lull. Lincoln hangs his head, remembering.

                           LINCOLN
               The y make you believe there's a place
               called The Island. Then they take you
               upstairs and put you to sleep. They
               cut you open. They take pieces of you.

Katherine looks at him, intuiting. She allows a pause, then-

                           KATHERINE
               E v e n if I had taken her baby, I swear
               to you, I'd never have... They give
               you a choice, you see, to extend the
               sponsorship after... after d e l i v e r y .

                                                                 120.



                                LINCOLN
                     N o . I saw a lot of us go to The Island.
                     But I never saw anyone come back.

                                KATHERINE
                     You mean... Even if I had extended the
                     sponsorship, they'd have... and kept
                     taking the money? But that's inhuman.

                                    LINCOLN
                          ( b e a t , a lost look)
                     Is it? I wouldn't know.

182   INT . UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - EVENING

      A sleek low vehicle known as a "straker" pulls down the ramp.

183   INT . APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING

      The orbs on the doors eyeball Scheer, moving up the corridor. He
      stops at a doorway. Rings the bell. Tom Lincoln opens the door-

                                TOM
                     Yes?

                                SCHEER
                     I'm from the Sanger Institute.

                                 TOM
                     I've given you people enough of my
                     time already.

                                 SCHEER
                     I t ' s just a formality. I need to see
                     your sponsorship contract.

      T o m pauses then lets Scheer inside. He crosses to the wall safe,
      taps the keys. Then pulls out the contract folder. He offers it.

                               SCHEER
                     Is this the only copy?

                                TOM
                     Why would I make copies? Do you think
                     I want anyone else to know about this?

      S c h e e r accepts the folder. As Tom turns to close the safe, he
      sets it down. And grabs Tom from behind, by the scalp, pressing
      the syringe-gun into his jugular. A HISS. Tom clutches his throat
      like it's on fire. With a boiling gurgle, he staggers forward.
      Sweating, collapsing. Convulsing, belching steam. Then falling
      slack. His skin starts to smolder. Scheer pauses, then tosses
      t h e contract folder on top of him, leaving it to burn with him.

                                                                          121.



184   EXT. NEW GAZA HOSPITAL - PHOENIX - NIGHT

      E s t a b l i s h i n g . A clean facade of white steel and glass. A hatch-
      b a c k vehicle known as a "corsair" pulls down the parking ramp.

185   INT . UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - NEW GAZA HOSPITAL - NIGHT

      The corsair pulls up at the ER entrance, Lincoln at the wheel.
      Katherine gets out of the passenger side. A doctor is waiting -
      50's, caring face. His name is DR. ABRAMS. He looks curiously at
      the man at the wheel. Then greets Katherine with a hug -

                                        D R . ABRAMS
                      Katherine . . . It's good to see you. I
                      haven't seen you since John's funeral.

                                  KATHERINE
                      We l l I've been keeping busy. Trying
                      to. Thanks for coming down to meet me.

                                  D R . ABRAMS
                      Your call was a little cryptic. What
                      is it exactly that's wrong with you?

                                  KATHERINE
                      I t ' s not me... Not exactly.

      She opens the rear door of the corsair. Ester is lying on the
      back seat. Dr. Abrams frowns as he notices the resemblance.

186   EXT . THE RANCH HOUSE - SEDONA - NIGHT

      The straker p u l l s up into the port.

187   INT . THE STUDIO / MAIN HOUSE - SEDONA - NIGHT

      The shadow of Scheer moving outside the windows, looking for a
      point of entry. He inspects the studio door for alarms. Then
      elbows the glass. Reaching inside, turning the lock. He enters
      the studio, glancing at the sculptures. Moving through the home.

      S i l e n t l y , systematically, checking the rooms. He reaches the
      guest bedroom, looks around. Something catches his eye. Spots of
      blood of the linens. Eyes honing, he moves on into the kitchen.
      He discovers a holocom keypad on the counter. Taps some keys.
      The holoframe flashes "REDIALLING". The holoframe snows with
      static. Then a receptionist's face appears-

                                 R E C E P T I O N I S T (ON HOLOCOM)
                      N e w Gaza Hospital, how may I help you?

                                                                     122.



188   INT. WAITING ROOM - NEW GAZA HOSPITAL - NIGHT - LATER

      Lincoln stands waiting. There are chairs but he's too tense to
      sit. Katherine and Dr. Abrams now enter. Lincoln looks at them,
      expectantly. There's a pause. Then Dr. Abrams speaks-

                                 D R . ABRAMS
                     Your friend... she has pneumonia. At a
                     very advanced stage. Its progress has
                     been unchecked by her immune system.

                                LINCOLN
                     C a n you help her?

                                    D R . ABRAMS
                     We have two options... One is a super-
                     b i o t i c . But there's the risk her immune
                     system might bow out of the fight. The
                     other is a nodal transfusion. Katherine
                     has agreed to be the donor. But the new
                     antibodies may not conform fully. They
                     m a y decide to attack the baby...

                              LINCOLN
                     I don't understand any of this.

                               KATHERINE
                     He means that by trying to help her,
                     we could lose her. Or lose the baby.

                                D R . ABRAMS
                     Or , if we do nothing, both. Her immune
                     system is... remarkably unstable. If we
                     don't act, the infection will take over.

      Lincoln lowers into a chair. He feels a pain somewhere. He can't
      quite pin down where. Or what caused it. Or why it hurts so bad.

189   INT . HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
      Ester lies in bed, dozing, looking more relaxed. Her oxygen mask
      makes breathing easier. Lincoln enters and sits beside her. She
      stirs, meeting his eye with a faint smile. Lincoln returns it-

                                   LINCOLN
                     He l l o , stranger.

                                ESTER
                     You look tired, Lincoln.

                                 LINCOLN
                     Ester...

                                                                     123.



                                 ESTER
                     I t ' s okay. I know. Katherine told me.
      She sits up, lowering her mask. Her hand finding his.

                                ESTER
                     She told me a lot of things. About how
                     they used a tiny part of her to make me.
                     She said it wasn't so very different.

                                 LINCOLN
                     What do you mean?

                                      ESTER
                            ( t o u c h i n g her belly)
                     F r o m this... From having a baby.

      Lincoln nods. A pause. Ester continues, more troubled, wheezing-

                                ESTER
                     She told me how they use us... And I
                     keep thinking... about the others...
                     the ones we left behind, about how
                     they'll never know... how they'll...

      Ester ' s out of breath again, coughing. Lincoln helps her put the
      oxygen mask back over her mouth. Ester slumps back, relaxing.
      Off Lincoln's worried look, she smiles at him with her eyes-

                                ESTER
                     I'm going to be okay, Lincoln.

                               LINCOLN
                     I know.

      But even to his own ears, the affirmation sounds hollow.

190   INT . MEN'S ROOM - HOSPITAL - NIGHT

      The stream of water gushes into Lincoln's hands. He splashes his
      face. Then looks at himself in the mirror. He looks sallow from
      sleeplessness. The facial hair makes him look like a shadow of
      his former self. For an instant he tenses at a light blinking in
      the glass. Blue light. Like etherscreen. Then he sees it's just
      a humidifier on the far wall. Tension ebbing, he splashes some
      more water. When he looks up again, he sees his pupils are
      dilating. The sense of danger. His voice comes in a cold whisper-

                               LINCOLN
                     No...

                                                                        124.



191   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

      Lincoln emerges from the restroom, scanning for the danger's
      source. Figures flash past in scrubs, white coats. Then he sees
      it. The figure emerging from the elevator. The face of Scheer...

192   INT . PREP ROOM - NIGHT

      A flurry of disturbance from the nurses as someone barges into
      the room. Dr. Abrams is prepping Katherine for the transfusion.
      Off the ruckus, he looks up. Lincoln comes up to them, urgently-

                               LINCOLN
                     We have to go. We have to get her out.

                                 KATHERINE
                     What are you talking about?

                                 LINCOLN
                     He's come for her. For us.

                                     D R . ABRAMS
                     What e v e r this is about, we can't move
                     her. She's already under sedation.

      Lincoln look to see Ester, asleep on the OR table beyond.

                                LINCOLN
                     How long before she wakes up?

                                D R . ABRAMS
                     The procedure takes three hours but...

                                   LINCOLN
                            ( t o Katherine, emphatic)
                     You'll take care of it, won't you? Take
                     her somewhere they can't find her...

      Katherine , understanding, simply nods. Lincoln takes a last look
      at Ester, then departs. Dr. Abrams, bemused, turns to Katherine-

                                       D R . ABRAMS
                     Katherine , what the hell's going on?

193   EXT . HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

      Lincoln moves up the corridor, purpose in his stride. His black
      gaze fixed on Scheer, making an inquiry at the nurse's station.
      Lincoln doesn't even break stride. He GRABS SCHEER FROM BEHIND--

      H U R L I N G HIM ACROSS THE NURSE STATION - INSTANT CONFUSION -
      NURSES RUNNING - PEOPLE SHOUTING - Lincoln takes off at a run--

                                                                      125.



      SCHEER RECOVERING - seeing his quarry through the confusion - no
      time for subtlety - he leaps over the nurse's station - pursuing-
      LINCOLN pauses at the emergency exit - checking to see his enemy
      is following - then pushing on through the doors into--

194   INT . STAIRWELL - NIGHT

      LINCOLN HAMMERS DOWN THE STEPS - an alarm sounding - shouting
      from beyond - FOOTFALLS BEHIND HIM - deeper into the gloom-

      S C H E E R VAULTING THE RAIL - shortcutting t h e flights of steps -
      catching sight of his quarry as he pushes through a door into--

195   INT . UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - NIGHT

      LINCOLN BURSTS OUT INTO THE PARKING LOT - flashes of light -
      vehicles pulling in and out - off across the parking docks -

      S C H E E R BURSTS OUT IN HIS WAKE - his quarry temporarily lost -
      now spotting him across the lot - leaping into a vehicle -
      LINCOLN FIRES UP THE CORSAIR - resistors droning - jamming the
      throttle - lurching out - NARROWLY MISSING ANOTHER VEHICLE -

      S C H E E R SPINNING ROUND as the corsair blurs past - it's heading
      for the exit ramp - he launches towards the straker -

196   EXT . EXIT RAMP - THE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

      T H E CORSAIR BURNS UP the parking ramp - SMASHING THE GATE ARM -
      plunging out into the street - bouncing across the lodestream -
      T H E STRAKER H U R T L E S UP close behind - into the snarl of traffic -
      steering expertly through - picking up the tail of the corsair -

197   EXT . STREETS OF PHOENIX - NIGHT

      T H E CORSAIR PLOUGHS UP THE STREET - TRAFFIC SWERVING out of its
      path - BUOYS CLANGING as it lurches from one lane to the next -

      LINCOLN JAMS THE THROTTLE - the resistors buzzing, growling with
      energy - he has one goal - draw his enemy away from Ester -

      S C H E E R COOLLY INTENT at the controls of the straker - keeping a
      certain distance - waiting for his quarry to make a mistake --

      A METRO PD OFFICER PULLS OUT - mounted on a hybrid of motorbike
      and jetski k n o w n as a "lode-runner" - SOUNDING THE SIREN--

      S C H E E R REACTING - the PD lode-runner pulling ahead of him - he
      can't allow a police intervention - he slips in behind --

                                                                             126.



      THE METRO PD OFFICER - darting looks back - headlamps b l i n d i n g
      his rear-view - another vehicle is coming up behind him fast -
      - C L A N G - THE STRAKER I M P A C T S - glancing the PD lode-runner which
      wobbles, corrects - the straker d r o p s back for a longer run up--

      T H E METRO PD OFFICER - yelling into his headset - inaudible over
      the siren - the headlamps a g a i n - the vehicle coming up behind--
      - C R A S H - THE PD LODE-RUNNER fishtails - its resistors suddenly
      clash with the prevailing polarity - A HUGE JOLT OF INERTIA-

      C A T A P U L T I N G THE METRO PD OFFICER through the air - plummeting
      down into obscurity - THE STRAKER W H O O S H I N G OVER HIS HEAD -
      T H E PD LODE-RUNNER LEFT SPINNING behind - resistors vying with
      the polarity - the drive system melting down - FUSING, SPARKING--

      - B O O M - THE PD LODE-RUNNER EXPLODES IN A FLASH OF ELECTRICAL FIRE-

      S C H E E R watches the fireball in his rear-view - there will be more
      police soon - he jams the throttle - he has to end this.

      LINCOLN SEEING THE STRAKER Z O O M I N G UP BEHIND - veering round
      another corner - the chassis tilting - A STEEP BANKING TURN -

      T H E CORSAIR HULL RUNNERS THUDDING across the buffers - recoil
      sending the chassis up against the concrete - SPARKS FLYING--

      S C H E E R TURNING THE CORNER - the windshield suddenly sprayed with
      sparks - jerking back on the throttle to avoid a collision -

      LINCOLN FIGHTING TO CORRECT THE STEERING - seeing the straker
      d r o p p i n g back - a chance to gain distance - JAMMING THE THROTTLE-

      A N INTERSECTION APPROACHING - Lincoln can't correct his steering
      in time - the corsair careens at full res over the intersection--

      C R A S H I N G THROUGH A GATE ARM - the ground dropping away into a
      steep ramp - suddenly the corsair is flying through the air--

      C R A S H I N G - SQUEALING ONWARDS - SCUDDING ACROSS VEHICLE ROOFS,
      finally nose-diving into an empty bay with a DEAFENING CRUNCH-

198   EXT . ENTRANCE - HOLSPAR STADIUM - NIGHT

      The straker p u l l s up at the smashed gate arm. In the booth, a
      holoserve p a r k i n g attendant greets the arrival with a smile-

                                     P A R K I N G ATTENDANT
                      We l c o m e to Holspar S t a d i u m , home of the
                      Phoenix Admirals, parking is fifteen
                      currency units...

                                                                          127.



      Scheer gets out of the straker. He looks down at the crashsite
      b e l o w . The parking lot, like a marina, is filled to capacity. A
      game is in progress. A corona of light coming from the stadium.
      Hoots, music, the roaring crowd. Over which, sirens can now be
      heard. Scheer draws the syringe-gun and heads down the ramp.

199   EXT . PARKING LOT - HOLSPAR STADIUM - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

      D u s t blooms from the crashsite. S c h e e r crouches, peering down at
      the wrecked corsair. The burst windshield, the dangling driver
      side door shows his quarry has escaped the wreckage. He rises
      and scans around. On the concrete, a trail of blood is visible.

200   INT . STORAGE AREA - HOLSPAR STADIUM - MINUTES LATER

      The blood trail leads down a gloomy stairwell. The game is just
      audible overhead. Lincoln stumbles down the steps, clutching his
      bleeding arm. Between pain and concussion, he loses his footing
      and falls. He tumbles down the remaining steps to the bottom.

      I n the gloom we   see groundskeeping e q u i p m e n t , supplies - edgers,
      aerators, spray    rigs, drums of insecticides, herbicides. For a
      moment, Lincoln    lies stunned. Then hears a noise and rolls over.
      He looks up the    stairwell. A shadow is descending towards him.

      W i t h painful effort, Lincoln starts crawling across the floor,
      eyes fixed on the shadow. Tensing as A HANDGUN noses out of the
      darkness. Then A STADIUM SECURITY GUARD steps into the light -

                                 S E C U R I T Y GUARD
                     You , what are you doing down here?

      N o w he sees Lincoln more closely - injured, his arm bleeding.

                                S E C U R I T Y GUARD
                     O h , Jesus... Are you okay, son?

      Lincoln eases a little as he sees the security guard lower his
      weapon. Then suddenly the guard is JERKED BACK BY THE SCALP.
      A HISS. Now suddenly the guard jettisons the handgun, clutching
      his throat like it's on fire. With a boiling gurgle, he staggers
      forward. Streaming with sweat. Toppling across a herbicide drum.
      Convulsing, belching steam. Then suddenly his body falls slack.
      S c h e e r is at the foot of the steps, discarding the spent ampule
      from the syringe-gun. Now screwing a fresh ampule into place.

      Lincoln turns to him, realizing what he's just witnessed is a
      glimpse of his own fate. He pushes himself upright, bracing.
      S c h e e r looks at him. Clutching his bloody arm, barely able to
      stay upright, but still ready to fight for life. He half-smiles-

                                                                                 128.



                                  SCHEER
                       I'm jealous of you. You have a reason to
                       live. I can't say I've ever had that...

      Lincoln holds his gaze, looking deep in his eyes. Then, as if
      scared by what he sees there, starts inching away, glancing at--

      T H E GUARD'S BODY SMOLDERING - lowering, melting through the drum-
      S C H E E R MOVING FORWARD, the smile leaving his face. A mask of
      hollowness as he moves in on his quarry, the syringe-gun poised.

      LINCOLN STUMBLING - collapsing to his knees - hanging his head
      as if in surrender... then suddenly his hand flies up-
      - B O O M - A FLASH OF LIGHT as he fires THE HANDGUN - recovered from
      the ground - AN ENERGY PULSE impacting the wall, fizzling out--

      S C H E E R KEEPS COMING, syringe-gun ready, blank-faced, unflinching-

      T H E GUARD'S BODY CRACKLING INTO FLAME - the drum splitting open--
      - B O O M - ANOTHER FLASH - Lincoln fires again - clipping his enemy--

      S C H E E R KEEPS COMING, a charred wound in his shoulder, relentless-

      T H E GUARD'S BODY BURNING - sliding into the sands of herbicide -
      - B O O M - B O O M - B O O M - LINCOLN KEEPS FIRING - more hits than misses--

      S C H E E R KEEPS COMING, blank faced, his body PITTING WITH IMPACTS--

      A BLINDING FLARE OF LIGHT - THE HERBICIDE IGNITING - THE DRUM
      EXPLODING - STARTING A CHAIN REACTION - OTHER DRUMS IGNITING -
      EXPLODING - FIRE - SMOKE - ENGULFING ALL IN A BLAZING INFERNO...

                                                               D I S S O L V I N G TO:

201   INT . TOP OF STAIRWELL - NIGHT - MUCH LATER

      A cacophony of sirens can be heard outside. A thick grey smoke
      gulches up from the stairwell. Shadows are visible. The sound of
      extinguishers. A FIREMAN climbs up, emerging from the smoke, he
      pulls off his breathing mask to address a waiting PD officer-

                                         T H E FIREMAN
                       N o t h i n g . . . If there was anyone down
                       there, they're a pile of ashes now.

                                                               F A D E TO BLACK.

                                                                         129.



202   EXT. CEMETERY - SOME DAYS LATER

      P e a c e . Sunlight. A bell tolling in the background. We make out
      Katherine, dressed in black, standing at a grave. The headstone
      reads simply: "Here Lies Ester & Her Unborn Son - May They Rest
      In Peace". There are no dates. Katherine lays down some flowers
      then looks across at Dr. Abrams. As he escorts her away, we see
      Crowne crossing towards them. She introduces herself delicately-

                                CROWNE
                    M r s . Ester? My name is Ellen Crowne.

203   INT . CEO'S OFFICE - THE SANGER INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY

      A celestial penthouse office. Katherine enters with Crowne.
      Merrick and Dr. Sanger rise to greet her. Strained solemnity.

                              DR. SANGER
                    M y name is Henry Sanger. I'd like to
                    offer my deepest condolences.

      His insincerity is transparent. Katherine just nods stiffly.

                                DR. SANGER
                    This is Bernard Merrick our facility
                    director. He knew Ester personally.

                               MERRICK
                    An d it's a terrible loss.

      M o r e insincerity. Katherine nods again. Then settles in a chair.
      Crowne allows a respectful pause. Then begins with due delicacy-

                                    CROWNE
                    L e g a l issues must seem trivial at this
                    time. But the sponsorship agreement has
                    certain conditions relating to confident-
                    i a l i t y . D e s p i t e this tragic t u r n of
                    events, those conditions remain binding.
                    We want to be sure you understand that.

                               KATHERINE
                    I see.

                                CROWNE
                    T h a t said, The Institute is likewise
                    bound by the terms of sponsorship and
                    while we reserve every right...

                               KATHERINE
                    You can stop there. I know why I'm
                    here. You wanted to know if I'm going
                    to sue you for breach of contract.

                                                             130.



                             DR. SANGER
              N o t h i n g so devious, Mrs. Ester. We
              simply wanted to find some way to
              heal the wounds from this incident.

                       KATHERINE
              I don't want restitution, Dr. Sanger.
              The reason I agreed to this meeting
              was to have the chance to talk to you.

                        DR. SANGER
              O f course. Please...

                         KATHERINE
              I never got to meet you when I visited
              The Institute. It was one of your sales-
              m e n who led the tour. I remember how
              h e described the agnates a s if they
              were some kind of mindless organisms.
              More like livestock than humanity...

                              CROWNE
              L e g a l l y , human rights don't apply.

                           DR. SANGER
              Don't interrupt, Ellen.

                       KATHERINE
              I remember how eager I was to believe
              him. But when I saw w h a t I'd created,
              in flesh and blood, when I touched h e r ,
              it was I who felt less than human.

                       DR. SANGER
              I understand.

He looks at her expressively. Perhaps he really does understand.

                               KATHERINE
              Ester ' s life was my responsibility and
              her death is my cross to bear alone. So
              I'm not going to sue you, Dr. Sanger...
                     ( b e a t , a sudden ominous tone)
              But I am going to blame y o u . Until the
              day I die, I will silently curse your
              name. That's w h a t I wanted you to know.

She drives it home with a horrible look. Sanger accepts it with
due gravity. There's an ugly pause. Katherine gets to her feet.

                         KATHERINE
              An d now I'd like to leave, please.

                                                                          131.



                               CROWNE
                     We do have other issues to discuss...

                                DR. SANGER
                     N o , Ellen, that's enough. I think Mrs.
                     Ester has said all there is to say.

204   EXT . STREET - OUTSIDE THE SANGER INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY

      Katherine descends the steps from the entrance. She crosses to a
      black funeral sedan, parked kerbside. D r . Abrams stands waiting-

                              D R . ABRAMS
                     I hope you know what you're doing.

                              KATHERINE
                     I don't think they suspected anything.

                                 D R . ABRAMS
                     J u s t understand that I've put a lot on
                     the line for you, Katherine.

                              KATHERINE
                     I know... But it felt good. It felt
                     like something John would have done.

205   INT . ROOFTOP FLIGHTPAD - THE SANGER INDUSTRIES TOWER

      C r o w n e escorts Sanger and Merrick to the waiting whisper.

                                  CROWNE
                     We l l , I don't know about the two of
                     you but I'd say we got off lightly.

                                 DR. SANGER
                     Did we?

                                  CROWNE
                     Don't start getting maudlin, Henry.
                     It's a little too late in the game.

      She shakes their hands as they climb into the whisper. Then
      watches it take off, ascending into the blinding sunlight.

                                                            D I S S O L V E TO:
206   EXT . THE SANGER INSTITUTE - SOME WEEKS LATER

      A i r blasts up from the giant funnel. Widening, we re-establish
      the huge ring, the processing plant, the giant appendages of
      ducting, the immutable red rocks. The shot sequence, reprising.
      From the processing plant, over the main complex. From the front
      of the complex, to the dock.

                                                                           132.



      Following the lodeway out to the perimeter wall. The gateway now
      gliding open to disclose a view of the shimmering desert. Out in
      the distance, the institute liner emerging from the shimmer. The
      crosshatch insignia.

207   INT . ENTRANCE HALL - THE SANGER INSTITUTE - DAY

      T h r o u g h the polarized glass we see the liner has docked. A TOUR
      GROUP is disembarking. Another parade of plutocracy, aging
      bloated me and brittle young women. They filter inside to be
      greeted by the courtesy staff, led by the ever-perky LYDIA.

                                     LYDIA
                     L a d i e s and gentlemen, my name is Lydia
                     and on behalf of our staff, I'd like
                     t o welcome you to The Sanger Institute.
                     Before we start the tour, we'll be serv-
                     i n g r e f r e s h m e n t s in the visitor center
                     and circulating our standard discretion
                     agreements. I should add that today you
                     are all very lucky because our CEO and
                     founder, Dr. Henry Sanger, is with us
                     and will be leading the tour personally.

208   INT . VISITOR CENTER - THE SANGER INSTITUTE - DAY

      The tour group pick and mingle at a buffet. We isolate a
      casually dressed man, lightly bearded, in a Phoenix Admirals
      cap, crossing to Lydia. She turns to greet him with a smile-

                                   LYDIA
                     Yes . . . Mr. Thomas, isn't it?
      The man tilts up to reveal his face. We see he is LINCOLN...

                              LINCOLN
                     I can't find my sunglasses. I think I
                     left them on the shuttle.

                                 LYDIA
                     We l l we're about to start the tour.
                     But I can have someone check for you.

                                  LINCOLN
                     Don't worry. I'll catch up.

209   EXT . PROCESSING PLANT - DAY

      Lincoln moves quickly along the wall towards the back of the
      complex. Hugging the shadows, scanning for onlookers. There is
      the processing plant and there, the ring of funnels. The sight
      brings a sudden rush of memories, painful memories, horrors.

                                                                        133.



      Lincoln steels himself, then breaks from shadow and races for
      the nearest funnel. He makes a running lap. His fingers grab
      t h e lip of the funnel and he pulls himself up. Reaching the lip,
      he finds the funnel mouth has been gridded o v e r . Then he hears-

                                  A VOICE (O.S.)
                      S i r , this is a restricted area...

      Lincoln lowers back to the ground. He finds himself facing A
      TECHNICIAN in a hardhat. His uniform reads "Air Processing".

210   INT . ELEVATOR - PROCESSING PLANT

      The doors slide open and the technician enters, stiffly. Then
      suddenly topples forward, pistol whipped from behind. Lincoln
      enters the elevator, a familiar handgun clenched in his fist.

211   INT . ELEVATOR SHAFT

      L o o k i n g up an elevator shaft. The red pulse of the lode-poles,
      rippling downward as the elevator descends from the surface.

212   INT . ELEVATOR - DESCENDING

      Lincoln is now wearing the technician's uniform. He watches the
      panel lights flashing down. "Level 3: Harvest" "Level 5: Labor
      Decon", "Level 7: Labor Quarters". His pupils are dilating but
      his face is set with determination. He knows what he must do.
      His gaze drifts down to "Level Twenty: Agnate Containment".

213   INT . THE ETHER GRID

      The holographic rendering of containment spins in the vaulted
      chamber like a giant geometrical phantom. The ether blinks with
      blue dots in their hundreds as the agnates g o about their day.

214   INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM

      O v e r l o o k i n g the ether, Ethercon sits at his console. The hiss of
      an opening door as someone enters. Ethercon looks round. He
      greets the technician's arrival with an inquisitive look. Then
      the technician takes off his hardhat. A crosshatch on his brow.
      Ethercon reacts almost instantly, reaching for the console. Then
      instantly freezes as Lincoln presses the handgun to his skull.

215   INT . CORRIDOR - LEVEL TWENTY SEVEN

      P a l e blue light. Ethercon leads the way down a silent corridor.
      Lincoln follows him, the handgun firmly levelled on his head.

                                                                            134.



216   INT. CHAMBER - LEVEL TWENTY SEVEN

      The pale blue light sustains. The chamber is reminiscent of the
      foundation chambers. The walls lined with tanks. But instead of
      amber fluid, these contain blocks of ice. Beside each tank is a
      grid of bio-monitors. E t h e r c o n stumbles into frame, prodded by
      Lincoln. Then, with a trembling finger points to one of the
      tanks. Lincoln holds aim on him and considers the glass facet.
      He wipes the condensation off the glass. Suspended in the block
      of ice is a shadow. A human figure. A device is attached to his
      stomach. Lincoln looks at the bio-monitors. A screen reads:

      " P R O D U C T ID: STARKWEATHER/ FOUNDATION: II/ GENERATION: DELTA".

      Lincoln looks across the EKG, the cardiograph, indications that
      Starkweather is still alive. Then he fixes on the RFI m o n i t o r . A
      resonant image of the brain. The shifting aura showing a level of
      consciousness. What thoughts must be going through that mind?
      The fate of the agnates s p a r e d from expiration. To be kept on
      i c e for future harvest. With a haggard look, Lincoln rests his
      hand on the glass where Starkweather hangs frozen. Connecting.

217   INT . SALES HALL - THE INSTITUTE - DAY

      An embryo in mutated effigy hangs suspended in the amber fluid.
      Dr. Sanger stands at the wall of display tanks, mid-way through
      his sales pitch. He delivers it now with noticeably less gusto-

                                       DR. SANGER
                     C a s e in point, the clone. Back in the
                     beginning, the mapping of the human
                     genome was declared a historic landmark-
                     to break the curse of heredity, to
                     correct congenital defect... genetic
                     engineering became the brave new world
                     of medical science. A bright future
                     that led to a dark age and much of...
                            ( a n abrupt pause, a frown)
                     . . . l e g i s l a t i o n we know today. But while
                     the clone laws may have narrowed the
                     field, science marches on. Only to...
                            ( a n o t h e r abrupt pause)
                     I'm sorry, I'm f...

      S u d d e n l y he clutches his arm, emitting a guttural gasp.

                                LYDIA
                     DR. SANGER?

      S a n g e r just looks at her. Then jolts from a spasm, clawing at
      his chest. His knees buckling, he topples against a display
      case. Pawing at the glass, he slides dreadfully to the ground.

                                                                        135.



                                 LYDIA
                     He's having a heart attack! A doctor!
                     Somebody get a doctor in here!

      The tour group keeps their distance, unsettled by the face of
      mortality. Sanger is now lying in contortion on the floor, his
      gaping eyes fixed on the display tank. The embryo in mutated
      effigy, rocking about in the amber fluid. The sight of this
      little human monster is one that will follow him to the grave.

218   INT . DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - CONTAINMENT

      The glass wall looks down on the avenue and the agnates m i l l i n g
      beneath. Merrick sits at his console. Business as usual. Off a
      buzz, he taps a button. The door opens and A CENSOR bursts in-

                                 CENSOR
                     S i r , I've been trying to contact you.
                     It's the ether... Something's wrong.

      Merrick taps another button and the glass wall frosts over. It
      pixellates o n t o an image of his own face. A recorded playback-

      I N T E R C U T T I N G : Agnates a t workstations watching on visors. In the

      We are still   in the apartment when the playback cuts out. The
      agnate looks    around as every piece of glass dissolves to trans-
      parency. The    mirror panels, the frosted walls, the window, which
      now shows no    view at all. Just the gleam of a holographic lens.

220   INT . DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

      Merrick looks down from the glass wall at the agnates m a s s e d in
      the avenue beneath. They are all looking directly up at him.

221   INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM

      Alarms sounding. The ether grid blinking with red dots. Ethercon
      sitting frozen at the console, the handgun pressed to his head.
      Lincoln stands over him. His face cast in a chill of vengeance.

222   INT . RESIDENTIAL BLOCK - DAY

      A glass facade. A noise from within. A primal, guttural noise,
      building to a roar. Now warping as we drop to slow motion. The
      glass webbing, bursting open from within, the facade exploding
      in a GLITTERING SHOWER OF SHARDS...

                                                             S L O W FADE TO BLACK.

223   INT . BASEMENT - A YEAR LATER

      No windows. No clue of where we may be. A safehouse somewhere.
      The passage of time is marked on Lincoln's face, careworn, long
      hair, a full beard. He sits in front of a data tablet, his image
      recorded on its screen. His voice also seems older as he speaks-

                                                                   137.



                                    LINCOLN
                    I t ' s been a year since the breakout. A
                    year in hiding, waiting for things to
                    quiet down. I don't know how many made
                    i t out or how many who did, survived. I
                    know there are people called politicians
                    trying to say it never happened. That's
                    why I've kept this journal. To keep the
                    truth alive. Alive... I've learned what
                    that means but it still confuses me. In
                    functional terms, I've been alive for ten
                    years. In human terms, more than thirty.
                    Human... I'm not sure about that one
                    either. They say I'm not human because
                    I have no mother or father. I guess I
                    have more to learn. But one word I do
                    understand is hope. So maybe this
                    j o u r n a l will give hope - to those like
                    me, who may be out there. To know
                    t h e y ' r e not alone. My name is Lincoln
                    S i x - E c h o and this is my testament...

      He sits back, contemplating the screen with an air of closure.
      Then he stirs at a sound. At first just a gurgle. Then a moan.
      Becoming the sound of A BABY CRYING. Lincoln crosses to a cot.
      He lifts up a baby boy, 6 months old, bawling and squirming.

                              A WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Is he hungry again? I just fed him.

      Ester steps into the room, sleep-mussed, her beauty deepened by
      maternity. The baby reaches out for her. Lincoln hands him over-

                                   LINCOLN
                    Lincoln Junior, huh? It still doesn't
                    sound right. That name.

                                ESTER
                    I t ' s the name of his father.
      She lovingly kisses him. Lincoln smiles at her, then the baby,
      sweeping the hair from the forehead. Unscarred, blemishless.

                              LINCOLN
                    We should finish packing.

224   EXT . JETTY - THE PACIFIC COAST - DAWN

      A private jetty stretches out to a pile of supply canisters. A
      yacht is moored. We recognized it as John's boat. And we recognize
      Katherine, holding the baby as Lincoln and Ester finish loading.
      The last canister stowed, Lincoln comes up to her. He smiles at
      the sight of her with the baby. Then prompts her gently-

                                                                       138.



                                 LINCOLN
                     Time to go.
      Katherine hesitates, part of her unwilling to let the baby go.
      Then she plants a lingering kiss on his downy hair and lets
      Ester take him. Lincoln presents her with the data tablet-

                                   LINCOLN
                     You'll make sure this gets out?

                                 KATHERINE
                     Yes . There are people sympathetic to
                     the cause. I'm going to get it to them.

                                  LINCOLN
                     Thank you, Katherine. For everything.

      He smiles. Katherine points to a canister left on the dock.

                                  KATHERINE
                     Don't forget that. It has the
                     operating manuals for the boat.

                                 LINCOLN
                     I've been looking at them for months.

                                KATHERINE
                     But the maps, the charts...

                                   LINCOLN
                         ( b e a t ; a meaningful look)
                     I don't need them either.
      Katherine nods, understanding. Nothing more to say, she hugs him.
      Then turns to Ester with the baby. She folds them in a yearning,
      almost maternal embrace. Tears well in her eyes. Then the sorrow
      turns to laughter as the baby starts tugging at her gray hair.

225   EXT . THE PACIFIC - DAWN

      The sun rises in the east, casting the coastline in silhouette.
      The light glows across Lincoln's face, at the helm of the yacht,
      staring back to the shore. He looks at Ester sitting beside him,
      the baby swaddled in a blanket at her breast. Then he looks out
      to the west, to the soft reach of dawn and the boundless horizon
      of sea. There never was an island. But perhaps there will be...
