                 Based on the book "Capote: A Biography" by Gerald Clarke

                

               TITLE UP:         "Western Kansas, 1959"

               EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING

               The CAMERA follows a SIXTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL, long hair, pretty 
               Sunday church dress, walking toward a peaceful farmhouse. At 
               the door she lifts the knocker. The door opens slightly. The 
               girl turns and looks past the camera at her MOTHER, sitting 
               in an old Plymouth idling in the driveway. Her mother shrugs, 
               motions for her to go inside.

               INT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

               The girl walks through the downstairs rooms. In the kitchen, 
               the PHONE is OFF the hook. The girl looks back toward the 
               open front door. She turns toward the stairs, climbs them.

               INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALL - CONTINUOUS

               She walks down the hall to a BEDROOM DOOR at the end. The 
               door is slightly ajar. She knocks, then enters the room.

               INT. FARMHOUSE, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

               The girl's POV: the CAMERA pans across the bedroom of a high 
               school coed. We see the desk, the bureau, the bed. On the 
               bed lies NANCY CLUTTER, her wrists and legs bound in rope, 
               SHOT in the head. There is blood on the wall. The sixteen 
               year-old girl stands immobile. Before she starts to scream,

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. KANSAS LANDSCAPE - DAY

               Trees ring the edge of a field.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. N.Y. CITYSCAPE, ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

               Buildings lit against the night sky.

               INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING/STAIRS - NIGHT

               Camera follows group of partygoers as they mount the stairs: 
               Truman Capote, Barbara (very tall), Rose, Christopher, 
               Williams.

               INT. SMALL, PACKED NEW YORK APARTMENT/KITCHEN - LATER

               The friends are standing in the crowded kitchen -- people 
               are coming in and out -- talking and drinking and laughing.

                         So Jimmy Baldwin tells me the plot 
                         of his book, and he says to me: the 
                         writing's going well, but I just 
                         want to make sure it's not one of 
                         those problem novels. I said: Jimmy, 
                         your novel's about a Negro homosexual 
                         who's in love with a Jew -- wouldn't 
                         you call that a problem?

               Laughter.

                                     CHRISTOPHER
                         Susan's father had a minor heart 
                         attack, so she's writing more erotic 
                         poems about death and sex.

                                     BARBARA
                         It's so tiresome.

                                     WILLIAMS
                         Hmm. What rhymes with angina?

               Laughter. We see Truman watching everyone laugh. GRAYSON 
               notices, leans in to him. As the rest of the group continues 
               talking, we come closer, hear their conversation.

                                     GRAYSON
                         How's your writing?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Oh, I've got a million ideas of what 
                         to write next -- I just have to choose 
                         one.

                                     GRAYSON
                         Really?

                                     TRUMAN
                         No.

               Their attention is pulled back into the group as:

                                     BARBARA
                         Who would I want to play me? Natalie 
                         Wood.

                                     ROSE
                         Too fat.

                                     BARBARA
                         Audrey Hepburn?

                                     ROSE
                         Not bad. Sort of middle-class.

                                     TRUMAN
                         When a movie is made of my life I 
                         know exactly who I want as me...
                              (beat)
                         Marilyn Monroe.

               Barbara cracks up, chokes on her drink.

               EXT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE/BACK PATIO - MORNING

               Truman sits with his coffee, reading the New York Times. An 
               article catches his eye. He sits up straight, folds the paper 
               over, reads it.

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, STUDY - DAY

               C/U of article being snipped out of PAGE 39 of the Times, 
               November 16, 1959. As the page gets turned around with each 
               snip, we see a small PHOTO of a middle-aged man wearing 
               glasses, with the caption: "FOUND DEAD: Herbert W. Clutter, 
               a wealthy Kansas farmer..." We read the headline: "WEALTHY 
               FARMER, 3 OF FAMILY SLAIN. Parts of the story: "HOLCOMB, 
               Kan., Nov. 15 (UPI) -- ...wheat farmer, his wife... two young 
               children found shot today..."

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, STUDY - MOMENTS LATER

               Truman on the phone.

                         William Shawn, please.
                              (he listens)
                         Adorable one? All of a sudden I know 
                         what article I'm going to write for 
                         you next.

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, STUDY/KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

               Truman on the phone, on a long cord, travels between the 
               study and the kitchen as he talks to William Shawn. We hear 
               pieces of the conversation, and see Truman in different parts 
               of the room as he says each bit.

                                     TRUMAN
                         ...never had anything like this happen 
                         to them before. They're used to 
                         sleeping at night with the doors 
                         unlatched....
                              (laughs)
                         Yes, we should buy stock in Master 
                         Locks -- all of Kansas will be in 
                         the hardware store tomorrow.

                         They have no idea who the killer is. 
                         But it doesn't matter who the killer 
                         is -- what matters is who the 
                         townspeople imagine the killer is. 
                         That's what I want to write about.

                         I'm gonna need some help... I'm 
                         thinking about Nelle -- she can 
                         protect me...

               JACK DUNPHY (strong, Irish-American, ten years older than 
               Truman) -- his longtime boyfriend -- enters the front door 
               with a bag of groceries, stops in the hall. He sees Truman 
               on the phone. Truman looks at Jack, though he's still speaking 
               to Shawn --

                         I want to leave tonight...

               EXT. TRAIN TRACKS, OUTSKIRTS OF NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

               A train barrels toward us, its headlight bright. The train 
               roars past, away from the city.

               INT. TRAIN, MOVING - NIGHT

               Truman hurries through the train, checking his ticket with 
               the sleeper cabins. His long SCARF trails behind. His longer 
               cashmere COAT practically brushes the floor.

               INT. TRUMAN AND HARPER LEE'S CABIN, TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

               Truman opens the door. Inside the cabin his childhood friend 
               from Monroeville, Alabama, NELLE HARPER LEE (yes, that Harper 
               Lee), is reading. She looks up, deadpan --

                                     NELLE
                         I figured you'd missed it.

               Nelle is a year younger than Truman, dowdy in dress, but 
               smart, tough, sensible. Truman smiles.

                                     TRUMAN
                         God I'm glad you agreed to come. 
                         You're the only one I know with the 
                         qualifications to be both a research 
                         assistant and personal bodyguard.
                              (then, noticing)
                         Oh, Nelle, you poor thing.

               He tries to spruce up her limp silk scarf.

                                     NELLE
                         Off. Truman. Off.
                              (holds his hands)
                         I'm happy to see you too, but I can 
                         still whip your behind.

               TWO BLACK PORTERS enter, one with an enormous TRUNK 
               (Truman's), the other with a sensible SUITCASE (Nelle's).

                                     PORTER #1
                              (reading tags)
                         Mr. Truman Capote, Miss Nelle Harper 
                         Lee. Where would you like these, 
                         sir?

                                     TRUMAN
                         That one up there and that one on 
                         the floor.

               He tips them.

                                     NELLE
                         What all did you bring?

                         to have you with us. If you don't 
                         mind my saying, your last book was 
                         even better than the first --

                                     TRUMAN
                         Thank you. You're very kind.

                              (to Nelle)
                         Ma'am.

               The PORTERS leave. Nelle is stunned. Truman fiddles with the 
               trunk locks, his back to Nelle. Silence, then:

                                     NELLE
                         You're pathetic.

               Truman doesn't answer.

                                     NELLE
                         You're pathetic.

                         You paid them to say that.

               Truman won't look at her. She whacks him.

                                     NELLE
                         You paid them to say that!

                         "Just when you think they've gotten

                                     TRUMAN
                         You think that was too much?
                              (laughter)
                         I thought that was a good line.

               More laughter. More smacking of Truman. Then it is quiet.

                                     NELLE
                         Pathetic.

               Nelle's awake, but still in her bunk, looking out the window 
               at the Kansas plains. Truman's dressing, watching her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FINNEY COUNTY COURTHOUSE, LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

               Truman approaches the GUARD DESK.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Mr. Alvin Dewey, please.

                                     GUARD
                         Third floor. In what used to be the 
                         Sheriff's Office.

               Truman CURTSIES.

               INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

               In the reception area, ALVIN DEWEY and the two other KBI 
               AGENTS assigned to the Clutter case are getting their jackets 
               on and straightening their ties. They've completely taken 
               over the office. They are: HAROLD "Brother" NYE (34); and 
               ROY "Curly CHURCH (60 - bald). They all smoke.

               Sheriff WALTER SANDERSON -- 60's, kind, overweight -- is 
               office-less (though he and his wife DOROTHY still live on 
               the fourth floor of the Courthouse.) WALTER lurks in the 
               background, nowhere to go, emptying one of many FILLED 
               ASHTRAYS, BOTHERED by the SMOKE. Truman and Nelle enter as:

                                     CHURCH
                         The wife said no more smoking in the 
                         house. I told her, "Fine. Walter's 
                         got a couch upstairs in his apartment. 
                         I'll stay with him and Dorothy till 
                         we're done here."
                              (to Walter)
                         I've got my bag and a carton of 
                         cigarettes in the car.

               WALTER looks uncomfortable. Dewey shakes his head at Church.

                                     DEWEY
                         Roy.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Mr. Dewey. Truman Capote from the 
                         New Yorker.

               Silence. The Agents stare at him.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Hello.

               Silence. Nye is looking at Truman, particularly puzzled.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Bergdorf's.

                                     NYE
                         Sorry?

                                     TRUMAN
                         The scarf.

                                     NYE
                         Oh.
                              (then)
                         Nice.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Thank you.
                              (turns to Dewey)
                         I wonder when we could arrange an 
                         interview? Some time to talk.

               Dewey stubs out his cigarette.

                                     DEWEY
                         About what?

                                     TRUMAN
                         We're not looking for any inside 
                         information -- I don't care one way 
                         or another if you catch whoever did 
                         this -- I'm writing an article not 
                         about the Clutter killings, but how 
                         they're affecting the town, how you 
                         all are bearing up --

                                     DEWEY
                         I care.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Excuse me?

                                     DEWEY
                         I care.
                              (puts on his hat, 
                              pulls out another 
                              cigarette)
                         I care a great deal if we catch 
                         whoever did this.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Yes --

                                     DEWEY
                         As do a lot of folks around here.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Of course.

               Dewey walks out. Nye and Church start out after him.

                                     NYE
                              (to Church)
                         New Yorker?

                                     CHURCH
                         You have press credentials?

                                     NYE
                         What's the New Yorker?

                                     CHURCH
                         Magazine.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Magazines don't give out --

                                     CHURCH
                         You can come to the news conference 
                         with the rest of them.
                              (tips his hat to Nelle)
                         Sears and Roebuck.

               Nelle and Truman are left alone.

               INT. SPARE COURTROOM - DAY

               Packed with PRESS from all over the Midwest, as well as local 
               Finney County CITIZENS.

               Dewey's leading the press conference from a FOLDING TABLE 
               set up in front of the Judge's bench, flanked by the two 
               other KBI Agents. He's got a cigarette burning in an ashtray. 
               Truman and Nelle stand in the back.

                                     DEWEY
                         I'll talk facts but I won't speculate. 
                         The main fact here we need to be 
                         clear on is not one, but four people 
                         were killed. A lot of folks say Herb 
                         Clutter had to be the main target 
                         because he was dealt with the most 
                         brutally --

                                     JOURNALIST #1
                         Had his throat cut.

                                     DEWEY
                              (a moment)
                         Yes. We'd all like to know why. But 
                         it could've been any one of the family 
                         they were after. We just don't know --

                                     JOURNALIST #2
                         You've identified the murder weapon?

                                     DEWEY
                         Wounds indicate a shotgun, close-
                         range, but no casings were found.

                                     JOURNALIST #1
                         Twelve-gauge, hunting --

                                     DEWEY
                         Right.

                                     JOURNALIST #1
                         They were all shot in the face?

               Dewey looks at the journalist. Then, evenly:

                                     DEWEY
                         No. Nancy in the back of the head.

                                     JOURNALIST #2
                         Is there any evidence of, I'm sorry, 
                         sexual molestation of the women?

                                     DEWEY
                         No.

                                     JOURNALIST #2
                         Anything else stolen?

                                     DEWEY
                         Kenyon's radio seems to be the only...

                                     JOURNALIST #3
                         The boy was sixteen?

                                     DEWEY
                         Fifteen. Nancy was sixteen.

                                     JOURNALIST #2
                         It's her friend that found them?

                                     DEWEY
                         Laura Kinney.

                                     JOURNALIST #2
                         Spell that?

                                     DEWEY
                         I assume you're okay with the Laura 
                         part. K-I-N-N-E-Y. But, please, leave 
                         her be.

               Lots of folks try to talk at once, one OLD MAN makes himself 
               heard above the rest:

                                     OLD MAN
                         There's talk of a bunch of Mexicans, 
                         a whole bunch of Mexicans...

                                     DEWEY
                              (standing, stubs out 
                              cigarette)
                         George, it's good to see you again. 
                         I do have an opinion whether this 
                         was the work of one man or a whole 
                         bunch, as you said, but it doesn't 
                         matter a whole lot whether it was 
                         Mexicans or Methodists or Eskimos. 
                         We're going to find whoever did this. 
                         Four good people from our community 
                         are dead. Let's remember that. Okay 
                         with you?
                              (holds up a notice)
                         The West Kansas Farm Committee's 
                         offering a thousand dollar reward 
                         for information leading to an arrest. 
                         Please print that.
                              (moving to the exit)
                         Thank you all for coming.

               The room is immediately noisy as Dewey makes his way to the 
               door, pulling a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, followed 
               by Church and Nye. He's about to step out when Truman catches 
               his eye. Dewey exits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RENTAL CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

               Nelle drives while consulting a MAP. Truman is leaning back, 
               looking out at the passing farms through the window. He speaks 
               almost to himself.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Mr. Dewey's protective of the 
                         Clutters. I wonder how well he knew 
                         them...

               Nelle glances over at him. He doesn't notice.

                                     TRUMAN
                         He was foxy with that old man.
                              (turns to Nelle)
                         Are you ever gonna let me drive?

                                     NELLE
                         Truman, you're a menace. You can 
                         barely see over the wheel.

               Truman looks back out the window at the farms, leans back.

                                     NELLE
                         This make you miss Alabama?

                                     TRUMAN
                              (rolling window down, 
                              shakes his head)
                         Not even a little bit.

               He leans his head out, closes his eyes.

               EXT. CLUTTER FARM - SUNSET

               Nelle pulls their car to the side of the COUNTY ROAD which 
               fronts the CLUTTER FARM. We recognize the FARMHOUSE as the 
               one in which Nancy Clutter was found dead. A HIGHWAY PATROLMAN 
               (20 years old) sits in a CRUISER parked up the driveway.

               CRIME SCENE TAPE marks the perimeter of the property. Truman 
               and Nelle get out of their car, stand at the foot of the 
               driveway, gazing at the lonely farmhouse.

                                                                  FADE OUT.

               EXT. HOLCOMB HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

               A gorgeous fall day. Crowds of kids arriving at school. Many 
               are SOMBER. As Truman and Nelle walk toward the kids, some 
               look warily at Truman and give him a wide berth.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Hello.

               Kids back away. Nelle notices. She leaves Truman, walks up 
               to a group of THREE GIRLS.

                                     NELLE
                         Morning.

                         Hi.

                         Can any of you tell me where I'd 
                         find Laura Kinney?

                         Oh, um...

               The girl glances toward the school entrance where LAURA KINNEY 
               (who found Nancy Clutter's body) walks with DANNY BURKE (tall, 
               17).

                                     NELLE
                              (gently)
                         Is that her? With the tall boy?

                                     GIRL #2
                         Yeah. With Danny Burke.

                         Thank you.

               As Nelle leaves, Girl #1 turns to her friend:

                                     GIRL #2
                         Oh, quiet yourself, Janice.

               Nelle sees Truman on his way toward Laura, calls out --

                         Truman. Truman --

               Truman doesn't hear. She watches Truman approach them. Laura 
               backs away. Danny leads her off. Nelle walks over to Truman, 
               looks at him for several moments.

               Nelle leaves. On Truman, as the bell rings and the mass of 
               teenagers starts to enter the school.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MAIN STREET, GARDEN CITY - DAY

               Truman walks alone, sees the Gilbart Funeral Home. He removes 
               his hat, slips past the few people standing outside.

               INT. GILBART FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS

               Warm but slightly tacky. Some people are engaged in hushed 
               conversation at the reception area. Truman slips past, into 
               the back room.

               INT. BACK ROOM, GILBART FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS

               No people, low light. Four CLOSED CASKETS at the back of the 
               room. Truman walks over slowly. After a moment, he checks to 
               make sure he's alone. Then he LIFTS THE TOP of one of the 
               caskets. It's Bonnie Clutter's body, in a long-sleaved navy-
               blue dress; but her head is wrapped in layers and layers of 
               white cotton gauze, and lacquered with a shiny substance -- 
               like an enormous cocoon. Truman stares.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Truman on the PHONE to Jack in Brooklyn. One of Truman's 
               trunks is open, displaying bottles of liquor, packaged and 
               tinned gourmet food, and stacks of unused yellow legal pads. 
               He drinks, standing at the window.

                                     JACK (OVER PHONE)
                         I think I scared a friend of yours 
                         this morning. He came looking for 
                         you while I was writing.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You hate my friends.

                                     JACK
                         I wouldn't say hate. So long as they 
                         don't knock on my door.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I saw the bodies today.

                                     JACK
                         Which?

                                     TRUMAN
                         The Clutters. I looked inside the 
                         coffins.

                                     JACK
                         That's horrifying.

                                     TRUMAN
                         It comforts me -- something so 
                         horrifying it's freeing. It's a 
                         relief. Normal life falls away.
                              (beat)
                         But, then, I was never much for normal 
                         life --

                                     JACK
                         No, you weren't.

                                     TRUMAN
                         People here won't talk to me. They 
                         want someone like you, like Nelle. 
                         Me they hate.

                                     JACK
                         I can't think of a single quality I 
                         share with Nelle.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Well --

                                     JACK
                         Maybe manliness.

                                     TRUMAN
                         My point exactly.

                                     JACK
                         It's why I left the Midwest in the 
                         first place. I knew I could only 
                         find someone like you in New York 
                         City.

               On Truman, gazing at the EMPTY TOWN SQUARE below.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. GARDEN CITY, VARIOUS - EARLY MORNING

               A SHOPKEEPER sweeps the sidewalk. There are THANKSGIVING 
               DECORATIONS in his shop window.

               A SCHOOL BUS picks up a SMALL BOY at the intersection of a 
               DIRT ROAD and the paved COUNTY ROAD.

               A SMALL BRIDGE over the Arkansas river. Below them, men are 
               sifting the riverbed with nets, moving slowly downstream.

               INT. WALKER HOTEL, LOBBY - EARLY MORNING

               Nelle waits by the FRONT DESK. The ELEVATOR DOORS open and 
               Truman emerges. He is DRESSED SOBERLY -- NO LONG SCARF, NO 
               LONG COAT. He walks toward Nelle, then TURNS as if he's a 
               runway model, walks away, turns again and walks back. He 
               stops a few feet in front of her. Nelle refuses to smile.

                                     NELLE
                         Let's go.

               EXT. HOLCOMB TOWN ROAD - EARLY MORNING

               Danny Burke walks down the road with a bookbag over his 
               shoulder. Nelle approaches him, Truman keeps his distance.

                                     NELLE
                         Danny?
                              (Danny stops)
                         Would you mind terribly if I walked 
                         with you for a bit?

               He shrugs. They walk together.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Laura opens door to Truman and Nelle.

               INT. LAURA KINNEY HOUSE, KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

               Nelle and Laura Kinney sit at the table. Truman stands at 
               the counter.

                                     LAURA
                         I thought you were from the FBI with 
                         your long coat.

                         Is that so?

                         That's why I ran off.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I've been getting a lot of that 
                         lately.

               Truman smiles. Laura smiles back, amused, a bit comforted.

                                     LAURA
                         It's fine talking to you all.

                         to talk since what happened.

                         Nancy was your best friend.

                                     LAURA
                         She was my best friend.

                         Pretty shattered. Nothing terrible 
                         ever happened to him before. Nancy 
                         just started wearing his ring again 
                         after this huge fight -- Mr. Clutter 
                         was trying to get her to end it 'cause 
                         Danny's Catholic.

                         Methodist. Danny was the last person 
                         at the house that night. That's why 
                         Mr. Dewey's keeps interviewing him -- 
                         they don't think he had anything to 
                         do with it -- just to see if he 
                         remembers anything unusual and all.

                         was involved.

                                     LAURA
                         That's been real hard for Danny.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Oh, it's the hardest -- when people 
                         have a notion about you and it's 
                         impossible to convince them otherwise. 
                         Since I was a child folks have thought 
                         they had me pegged because of the 
                         way I look and the way I talk. They're 
                         always wrong.
                              (looks at her)
                         Do you know what I mean?

               Laura stares at him and nods. He's clearly struck a chord.

                                     LAURA
                         I want to show you something.

               She goes in the door to the GROUND FLOOR APARTMENT. They see 
               her through the LACE CURTAINS getting something from her 
               DESK, which is stacked with books. Truman whispers to Nelle:

                                     TRUMAN
                         Not one person here understands her.

               Laura returns. She hugs a SMALL BOOK to her chest. After a 
               moment, she holds it out to them.

                                     LAURA
                         Maybe you'll get a better picture of 
                         Nancy. And the family.

               She turns back to the typewriter. She types. Truman lies 
               there, looking at the ceiling for a few moments. He closes

               Nelle turns to look at him. He's asleep. She goes back to

               Truman drinks coffee alone, sleepy. He takes a SMALL BOTTLE 
               of HOT-PEPPER TABASCO from his jacket pocket and shakes it 
               over his EGGS. He replaces the bottle in his jacket. Nelle

               Ding Dong. We see the FRONT DOOR open. Reveal MARIE DEWEY -- 
               pretty, 35, dressed primly -- and her two boys: ALVIN JR. 
               (9), and PAUL (6), lurking behind, curious. Marie smiles.

               Reverse onto Nelle... and Truman, dressed in a DARK SUIT, 
               hair neatly combed, like an Exeter schoolboy attending a 
               funeral. Nelle smiles.

               Nelle nudges Truman, who hands over his gifts: a BOTTLE OF 
               J&B, and a PACKAGE of GOURMET SPICED NUTS.

               A FOOTBALL GAME plays on the television. No one's watching. 
               We can HEAR Alvin on the phone in his study at the back of 
               the house.

               Truman and Marie at the stove. Nelle sits at the kitchen 
               table. Truman has his jacket off and an apron on, as does 
               Marie. They are peering into a POT OF BLACK-EYED PEAS. Marie 
               is shaking in drops of HOT PEPPER TABASCO.

                         he doesn't know who you are, but the 
                         minute you came to town he read your 
                         books. He had one of his men pick up 
                         "Breakfast at Tiffany's" in Kansas 
                         City 'cause it's banned from the

               Alvin walks toward the kitchen. He smokes. He looks exhausted. 
               He hears SQUEALS of laughter.

               INT. DEWEY HOME, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

               Alvin enters. They all stop laughing and look at him. nods

                         How you doing, foxy?

               She cracks up.

               INT. DEWEY HOME, DINING ROOM - LATER

               The remains of dinner. The kids have left. The bottle of J&B 
               sits on the table, half-empty. Marie's a bit drunk. Everyone's 
               PLATE is clean except for Alvin's, on which sits a MOUND of 
               uneaten black-eyed peas. Truman is mid-story.

                         I was writing the script as they 
                         were filming, all that time in Italy. 
                         I'd work like mad all day long and 
                         then dash down to the bar around 
                         midnight to hand in the next day's

                         -- and I mean drank, like famished 
                         water buffaloes. Well -- I'd only 
                         just handed them the final scene 
                         when the bellhop told me I had a 
                         phone call. It was my stepfather, 
                         Joe Capote, calling to say that my 
                         mother had died. I flew home to New 
                         York -- terribly distraught -- but 
                         when I got to the apartment I could 
                         see that Joe was in even worse shape 
                         than I was. He grabbed my hands and 
                         sat me down at the kitchen table, 
                         and he said to me, "Talk. Talk about 
                         anything, any subject in the world. 
                         Don't worry whether it will interest 
                         me or not. Just talk so I won't break 
                         down." And I did. He couldn't bear 
                         to be alone with his thoughts. It 
                         was too painful.

               It's quiet for a moment, then Marie looks at Alvin.

                                     MARIE
                         It's been a hard couple weeks for 
                         Alvin. He and Herb Clutter were good 
                         friends. From church.

                         Oh come on, Alvin. These are good 
                         people.

               Finally, Dewey looks at Truman and Nelle.

               INT. DEWEY HOME, STUDY - NIGHT

               Alvin shows Truman and Nelle the CRIME SCENE PHOTOS from the 
               Clutter murders. We see the four corpses, BOUND and SHOT, 
               the bloody footprints in the Clutter basement. Truman and 
               Nelle stare at the photos of Nancy and Kenyon. Then, quietly --

                         Who would put a pillow under the 
                         boy's head just to shoot him? Why 
                         would they tuck Nancy in?

                         I want to know the same thing.

               Truman hands Nelle one of the photos. She looks at it --

               Truman and Nelle are leaving. Alvin and Marie stand in the

               Truman smiles.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CLUTTER FARM - LATE AFTERNOON

               Truman and Nelle walk with PETE HOLT (70, very frail) on the 
               Clutter property. Apples rot on the ground, the trees are 
               bare, signs of disrepair are beginning to weather the house.

                                     HOLT
                              (re the apples)
                         I'd of picked them up but I haven't 
                         been myself. Mind you, I make the 
                         walk out here every day, check the 
                         house, make sure the pipes don't 
                         freeze -- that sort of item. The 
                         least I can do for Mr. Clutter.

                                     NELLE
                         How long have you worked here?

                                     HOLT
                         1940 -- a lotta years. The wife too, 
                         cleaning the house. Cooking.

                                     NELLE
                         Well, she's marvelous. Lunch was 
                         wonderful.

                                     HOLT
                              (ignoring this)
                         She had a hard job after what all 
                         happened. Cleaning. I burned most of 
                         the rest -- mattresses -- too far of 
                         a mess.
                              (then, looks at them)
                         I've asked around some -- if anyone's 
                         looking for a strong hand.

               They don't know what to say. Finally, he looks away.

                                     HOLT
                         I don't think they'll be able to 
                         sell the place till they catch the 
                         ones that did it.
                              (beat)
                         That's what I hear anyhow.

               Silence as the three of them look out over the barren fields.

               INT. CLUTTER HOUSE, BONNIE'S BEDROOM - DUSK

               Just the bed-frame -- the mattress is gone. Truman and Nelle 
               find her Bible on the bedside table, her bookmark, see the 
               painting of Jesus walking on water. Pete Holt stands off to 
               the side, waiting patiently.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WALKER HOTEL LOBBY, GARDEN CITY - NIGHT

               Through the front window we see a Christmas tree in the lobby.

               INT. WALKER HOTEL, TRUMAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Jazzy Christmas music on the RADIO. Nelle sits in the big 
               armchair with a drink. She laughs. We HEAR Jack on the phone:

                                     JACK
                         You're celebrating.

               We see Truman wearing a YELLOW SILK SHORT ROBE with white 
               lace, bare legs. He's on the phone and walking, for Nelle's 
               enjoyment, back and forth, like a runway model.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Remember Nelle's manuscript she sent 
                         me in New York?

                                     JACK
                         Mockingbird. Killing a Mockingbird. 
                         You said it was good.

                                     TRUMAN
                         And I was right. She just heard 
                         Lipincott wants to publish it.

                                     JACK
                              (pause)
                         Well. Jesus. That's terrific. Tell 
                         her congratulations.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Congratulations.
                              (covers phone, mouths 
                              to Nelle:)
                         Jealous.

                                     JACK
                         Just promise you'll be home by 
                         Christmas.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I can't leave now Jack -- I mean it 
                         was hard at first, but now I'm 
                         practically the mayor.

               He vamps. Nelle laughs.

                                     JACK
                         Alright.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I want to come home -- I do. Though 
                         if they catch whoever did this, who 
                         knows what -- I'll probably be here 
                         til next Christmas.

                                     JACK
                         Right. I'll let you go.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Jack, we'll go away this spring to 
                         write. Maybe Spain...

                                     JACK
                         Alright, Truman.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Bye.
                              (hangs up)
                         The poor boy misses me.

               Goes to the mini-bar to fix a drink.

                         Truman.

                         Nelle.

                                     NELLE
                         You remember when we were kids?

                                     TRUMAN
                         I was never a kid. I was born fully 
                         formed.

                                     NELLE
                         I had no idea what a homosexual was. 
                         But I knew whatever they were, you 
                         were one of 'em.

               Truman puts down his drink and marches out of the room, shuts 
               the door. Nelle's unsure whether she really insulted him. 
               From the HALL, we hear a WOMAN SHRIEK, and a MAN saying:

                                     MAN IN HALL (O.S.)
                         Oh. Uh. Oh. Excuse us.

               Truman runs back in, shuts door. They crack up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DEWEY HOME - NIGHT, CHRISTMAS EVE, ESTABLISHING

               Tasteful Christmas lights strung on the BUSHES. A WREATH on 
               the FRONT DOOR.

               INT. DEWEY HOME, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Truman, Nelle, Marie and Alvin. Drinks. A FULL ASHTRAY on 
               the coffee table in front of Alvin. He's distracted, smoking. 
               Marie holds a WOMEN'S MAGAZINE, checking what Truman says 
               with what's written there.

                                     TRUMAN

                              reciting)
                         -- girdle up -- no extra bulges -- 
                         if you're dressed right for him when 
                         he gets home, the evening should be 
                         smooth sailing. Bon voyage, gals.

                                     MARIE
                         I can't believe you got this whole 
                         page -- I only read it to you once!

                         TRUMAN
                 I've trained myself.

               Truman looks at Nelle.

                         TRUMAN
                 I have 94 percent 
                 recall.

                              (laughing)
                         You cut that out.

               Alvin stubs out his cigarette -- though it still burns. He 
               stands.

                                     MARIE
                         You believe that Alvin?

                                     ALVIN
                         Impressive.

               He walks out. Silence.

                                     MARIE
                         I'm sorry. He's upset.
                              (stubs out cigarette)
                         -- smoking three packs a day.
                              (then)
                         Two men did it. They know who. One 
                         of them used to have a cellmate who 
                         gave him up for the thousand dollar 
                         reward. They passed through Kansas 
                         City last week writing bad checks -- 
                         by the time Alvin's boys got up there 
                         they'd skipped out again.

                                     NELLE
                         Where to?

                                     MARIE
                         They have no idea.

               INT. DEWEY HOME, DINING ROOM - LATER

               Christmas dinner. Truman, Nelle, Marie and Alvin have just 
               sat down. They wait for the Dewey boys -- Alvin Jr. and Paul. 
               We hear them in the living room horsing around.

                                     DEWEY
                         Alvin. Paul. Now.

               It's quiet for a second. Then something crashes and breaks.

                                     DEWEY
                         Damnit.
                              (gets up, goes)
                         Come here.

                         Alvin Jr. Get over here.

                         Dad, the phone.

                                     DEWEY (O.S.)
                         Paul. Back to the table.

               Dewey returns to the dining room, pushing Paul ahead of him.

                                     DEWEY
                         Sit.

               Alvin Jr. enters.

                                     ALVIN JR.
                         Dad?

                                     MARIE
                         Tell them we're at dinner, Alvin.

                                     ALVIN JR.
                         Dad?

                                     DEWEY
                         Not now, Alvin.

               Alvin Jr. leaves. We hear the PHONE being HUNG UP. Alvin Jr. 
               returns and sits. They all get ready to say grace, then:

                                     ALVIN JR.
                         You need to call the Chief of Police 
                         in Las Vegas when you have a minute.

               Everyone looks at Dewey.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               EXT. COURTHOUSE SQUARE, GARDEN CITY - LATE AFTERNOON

               OVER BLACK SCREEN we hear the voice of a RADIO ANNOUNCER.

                                     RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         ...This is KERG radio, Garden City. 
                         A friendly broadcast from a friendly 
                         place. Our lead story:

               Slowly, the sounds of a CROWD emerge in the background.

               FADE UP ON: HIGH SCHOOL kids sitting on the hood and front 
               seat of a CHEW parked at the edge of a CROWD of 200 people. 
               Truman watches. It is COLD. A fat, shivering CO-ED reads the 
               headline in the Kansas City Star: "Police Fear Lynch Mob." 
               The CAR RADIO is on.

                                     RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

               Truman moves from the car into the large crowd. Old ladies; 
               ranchers; local businessmen; moms with kids; journalists 
               INTERVIEWING citizens; photographers lined up at the bottom 
               of the COURTHOUSE STEPS. We hear snippets of conversation as 
               we pass. A CITIZEN is being interviewed by a JOURNALIST; a 
               MOM WITH BABY standing with a FRIEND; a MIDDLE-AGED man in 
               an overcoat CRYING silently.

               Truman approaches Nelle and Marie Dewey, standing together 
               at the curb in front of the courthouse, near the 
               photographers. They are talking quietly, turn to Truman --

                                     NELLE
                         Hey.

               We hear LOUD CROWD NOISE at the south end of the square. A 
               CONVOY of FOUR CARS enters the square. It pulls around to 
               the front of the courthouse. STATE TROOPERS spill out of the 
               lead and rear CARS. Nye gets out of the second car. He opens 
               the back door. The crowd falls SILENT. Two state troopers 
               get DICK HICKOCK -- handcuffed, pale -- out of the car and 
               lead him up the steps. FLASH. FLASH.

               Dewey and Church open the third car's back door. Silence. 
               They retrieve PERRY SMITH. Perry is extremely SHORT, STRONG, 
               ODDLY BEAUTIFUL, with the dark skin and hair of his American 
               Indian mother, and the pug features of his Irish father. As 
               he stands, he has trouble straightening his stubby LEGS, as 
               if they are arthritic. Truman stares.

                                     MARIE
                              (whispers to Truman)
                         Motorcycle accident. He broke them 
                         and they never healed right.
                              (Truman looks at her)
                         Alvin told me.

               Truman watches Perry, transfixed. Perry seems terrified of 
               the crowd, all the faces, like a child. Perry scans the crowd. 
               His eyes fall on Truman. FLASH. FLASH. Truman and Perry look 
               at each other as Perry is led slowly past. At the top of the 
               steps the COURTHOUSE DOORS slam shut.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               EXT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE (4TH FLOOR OF COURTHOUSE ) - 
               MORNING

               FADE IN: Truman knocks on the door, a NEWSPAPER, a BOOK, and 
               a PAPER BAG in his hand. On the door it says "SHERIFF'S 
               RESIDENCE - PRIVATE". Dorothy Sanderson opens the door.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Truman Capote.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Dorothy Sanderson. I figured you'd 
                         be left alone this morning by that 
                         hard-working husband of yours.
                              (holds up bag)
                         So I have breakfast.
                              (holds up paper)
                         I have news.
                              (book)
                         And I have literature. My friend 
                         Jack mailed me the book you wanted.

               He presents book. Dorothy, flattered, takes it, reads the 
               inscription inside.

                                     DOROTHY
                         "For the maiden of the Midwest, the 
                         priestess of the plains, the queen 
                         of the kitchen: my first novel. 
                         Truman."

               It is "Other Voices, Other Rooms" and we see on the back of 
               it the INFAMOUS JACKET PHOTO of Truman at 23 draped sexily 
               on a couch. Truman curtsies. The PHONE RINGS.

                                     DOROTHY
                         You're too much. Go on into the living 
                         room, lemme grab that -- it's been 
                         ringing all morning.

               INT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, FOYER - CONTINUOUS

               Truman walks into the residence. To the left is the kitchen; 
               to the right is the living room. Truman looks back at Dorothy -- 
               she's still on the phone. He heads for the kitchen.

               INT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

               Truman walks slowly through the doorway of the large kitchen. 
               On the far side of the kitchen is a JAIL CELL. Inside the 
               cell is PERRY SMITH. (Now we know why Truman came here.)

               Truman STARES. Perry doesn't see him -- he's resting his 
               head on a small table, the tip of his THUMB in his mouth. 
               The chair seems too tall for Perry. He looks like a lonely 
               kindergartner, told to take his afternoon nap. After several 
               moments, Dorothy enters, flustered:

                                     DOROTHY
                         Oh. Truman. I meant in there.
                              (points to living 
                              room)
                         I... um...

               Perry sits up quickly, rubs his legs.

                                     DOROTHY
                         It's the women's cell. It's hardly 
                         ever used. But they wanted to, um, 
                         separate... Please. Let's sit in the 
                         living room. I'll set up in the living 
                         room.

               She gathers a tray of Truman's PASTRIES, and COFFEE CUPS.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Come.

               She goes -- Truman starts to follow, then lingers.

                                     TRUMAN
                         They put you in the women's cell.

                                     PERRY
                         Among other indignities.

               Perry's voice is oddly high, whispery -- special words are 
               precisely enunciated.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Well... she's a good cook.

                                     PERRY
                         She's scared of me.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I think so am I. A little bit.

                                     PERRY
                         Are you?
                              (a moment, then:)
                         You have any aspirin? My legs --

               Dorothy's in the doorway.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Um. Truman? All set.

               Truman looks at Dorothy, looks back at Perry.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I'm sorry.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COURTROOM - DAY

               Judge ROLAND TATE, white-haired, imperious, bangs his gavel. 
               The packed crowd quiets down. Perry and Dick sit at the 
               defense table chewing JUICY FRUIT GUM. Next to them: their 
               aged court-appointed lawyer, Franklin Weeks (70).

               Dick wears a SHIRT AND TIE. Perry wears jeans rolled up at 
               the cuff, his SHIRT OPEN at the collar. He draws on a piece 
               of paper with a STUBBY PENCIL -- a rather good picture of a 
               LARGE PARROT. Truman sits with Nelle, watching Perry --

                                     TRUMAN
                              (murmurs)
                         His feet don't touch the floor.

                                     JUDGE TATE
                         In the matter of the State of Kansas 
                         v. Richard Eugene Hickock and Perry 
                         Edward Smith this Court has been 
                         informed by counsel -- Mr. Weeks -- 
                         that defendants wish to waive their 
                         right to Preliminary Hearing. Mr. 
                         Hickock, is that your wish?

               Hickock looks at Weeks. Weeks nods. Hickock stands.

                                     HICKOCK
                              (unconvincing)
                         Yessir. Yes.

               Hickock sits. Truman whispers to Nelle --

                                     TRUMAN
                         Why are they doing that?

                                     JUDGE TATE
                         Mr. Smith.

                                     PERRY
                              (stands... then:)
                         I ask that the waiver be effectuated.

               Judge Tate looks at him for a moment --

                                     JUDGE TATE
                         So noted.
                              (bangs gavel)
                         We're adjourned.

               Crowd gets up. Much talk. Truman watches Perry and Dick 
               through the forest of bodies. They are led away in handcuffs. 
               Franklin Weeks stands slowly, then begins gathering his things -- 
               he's old and it takes him ages to collect his papers. Truman 
               watches.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE - AFTERNOON

               Truman knocks. He holds a PIE. Dorothy answers.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Mr. Capote.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (offers pie)
                         Madame Sanderson.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Is that for the two of us to share? 
                         Or for me to eat alone while you 
                         talk to our guest?

               Truman is caught. He smiles.

               INT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

               Truman sits near the bars of the cell. Perry draws on a scrap 
               of paper at the small table. Dorothy watches from the door 
               to the living room. The BOOK Truman gave to Dorothy lies on 
               the floor next to Perry's meticulously made bed.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Was it your choice to waive the 
                         hearing?

               Perry doesn't answer. Dorothy checks her watch, leaves. Truman 
               takes a bottle of BAYER ASPIRIN out of his pocket.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You still need some?
                              (Perry doesn't move)
                         Give me your hand.

               Perry extends his hand through the bars. As Truman shakes 
               some aspirin into it --

                                     PERRY
                         I could kill you if you got too close.

               Perry puts the aspirin in his mouth, CHEWS THEM, holds out 
               his hand for more. Truman gives him more, which Perry puts 
               in his pocket for later.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Would you like some water?

               Perry shakes his head. Silence.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Mrs. Sanderson lent you my book --

                                     PERRY
                         He said we'd curry favor with the 
                         Judge if we waived our rights.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Who did?

                                     PERRY
                         The lawyer.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Okay.

               Truman nods, not wanting to push this any further. Perry 
               picks up the book, holds it out through the bars.

                                     PERRY
                         Your picture's undignified. People 
                         recall first impressions.

                                     TRUMAN
                         What's been your first impression?

                                     PERRY
                         You want something.

                                     TRUMAN
                         From you?

               Dorothy pokes her head in from the living room.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Truman. Walter's gonna be home soon.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (to Perry)
                         I just want permission to talk.
                              (then)
                         Has anyone else visited?

               Perry doesn't answer.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Truman --

                                     TRUMAN
                         Will you tell me if you need anything? 
                         I can have whatever you want sent 
                         from New York.
                              (no answer)
                         Will you do that?

               On Perry, considering whether to trust this man.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         I'm writing a book. It's too much 
                         for a single article -- this town, 
                         the killers most of all -- you will 
                         be stunned by Perry Smith --

                         Why? What has he --

                         Not much yet, but I know. I can sense 
                         him. He's desperately lonely, 
                         frightened... I have questions -- 
                         are you ready?

               INTERCUT to WILLIAM SHAWN'S OFFICE. On Shawn -- he doesn't 
               know how to begin to respond.

               INT. HICKOCK'S JAIL CELL - DAY

               Perry has been placed in an adjoining cell for the afternoon. 
               He COMBS his greased hair in a mirror. A camera FLASHES.

               Nelle and Truman sit outside the cells. Franklin Weeks dozes 
               off to the side. RICHARD AVEDON -- small, dark, wiry, 
               flamboyant -- is snapping photos of a bare-chested Hickock 
               in the next cell, particularly his TATTOOS, while Hickock 
               chatters away.

                                     HICKOCK
                         Perry, honey. You look terrific...

               Perry is embarrassed, glances over at Truman. FLASH.

                                     HICKOCK
                         Calm yourself down, sweetheart.

               Perry glances at Nelle. She MOTIONS to him that his SHIRT is 
               buttoned wrong. Perry fixes it, looks back at her.

               Hickock notices Truman gazing at his tattoos -- the one on 
               his CHEST: the word PEACE, with a cross radiating rays of 
               light.

                                     HICKOCK
                         Be patient, Capote. Maybe later 
                         they'll send you my skin.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I have the perfect place for it, 
                         over the hearth.

               Hickock smiles. FLASH. Truman looks over at Perry, sitting 
               alone. Truman starts to remove his TIE.

               PHOTOS, in quick succession: Of Hickock pulling up his sleeve 
               to reveal his tattoos. Of Perry combing his HAIR. FLASH. The 
               GRINNING CAT on Hickock's hand. FLASH. Perry looking directly 
               at the camera. FLASH.

               Series of shots in and around the courthouse:

               TITLE UP:             "One month later"

               An officer approaches down a long hallway. A janitor cleans 
               the basin of the water fountain. Spectators are drawn into 
               the courthouse. The officer opens the courtroom doors. A 
               crescendo of sounds.

               INT. COURTROOM - DAY

               Spectators take seats. The jury files back into the box. 
               Perry and Dick chew gum. Perry wears TRUMAN'S TIE, and draws 
               on a pad with a NEW SET OF COLORED PENCILS -- another PARROT, 
               quite beautiful, now YELLOW. Nelle and Truman sit together.

                         Where'd Perry get the art set?

               Truman shrugs. Nelle raises her eyebrows. Judge Tate GAVELS 
               loudly, looks to the jury.

                                     JUDGE TATE
                         Members of the jury. Have you reached 
                         a verdict?

                         Defendants rise.

               Perry and Dick stand. Judge Tate turns back to the Foreman.

                                     JUDGE TATE
                         Perry Edward Smith and Richard Eugene 
                         Hickock stand accused of four counts 
                         of the crime of murder in the first

                                     JUDGE TATE
                         What is your verdict?

                                     FOREMAN
                         Guilty. On all counts.

                                     JUDGE TATE
                         Have you unanimously reached a 
                         sentence.

                                     FOREMAN

                         What is the sentence?

                                     FOREMAN
                         Death.

               Judge nods, the foreman sits. Judge turns to Perry and Dick.

                                     JUDGE TATE
                         Perry Edward Smith and Richard Eugene 
                         Hickock. You've been found guilty of 
                         four counts of murder in the first 
                         degree. You will be taken to the 
                         state penitentiary at Lansing. No 
                         later than midnight, May 13 of this 
                         year, nineteen hundred and sixty, 
                         each of you will be hanged by the 
                         neck until dead. So ordered.

               He GAVELS. Perry and Dick are set upon by Sheriff's Deputies 
               and led out. Photographers crowd them. Dick turns to Perry.

                                     HICKOCK
                         Alright, partner. Least now we're 
                         not the only killers in Kansas.

               Perry looks at him, utterly lost. FLASH.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Nelle sits at the window, smoking. Truman in the armchair, 
               holding a drink. They've been up all night. Their bags are 
               packed. Also -- a few packed boxes of written -- in yellow 
               notepads and many typed pages. Truman glances at his watch.

                                     SHAWN
                         He hasn't written a word yet, though 
                         he says it's the nonfiction book of 
                         the decade...

               We HEAR Truman before we see him:

                                     TRUMAN (O.S.)
                         He's little, but terrifying --

               We see Truman in the corner entertaining a small group. Jack 
               Dunphy stands off to the side. Nelle settles next to Jack.

                                     TRUMAN
                         He's as short as I am. And almost as 
                         pretty. I'd be with him right now 
                         but he's being given new 
                         accommodations --

               Guests laugh.

                         Most people assume he's a monster. I 
                         don't see him that way. The book I'm 
                         writing will return him to the realm 
                         of humanity -- it's the book I was 
                         always meant to write...

               Nelle and Jack stand back, watching.

                                     JACK
                         Watch out. This is the start of a

                         on her wall, two were upside down.

               The REPORTER laughs. A waiter passes. Truman taps his glass.

                              (to reporter)
                         To answer your question, I'm following 
                         "Breakfast at Tiffany's" by blazing 
                         a different path -- by inventing an 
                         entirely new kind of writing: the 
                         non-fiction novel.

                         You have a subject?

               Truman takes a last sip of his drink -- utterly serious now.

                                     TRUMAN
                         On the night of November 14, two men 
                         broke into a quite farmhouse in Kansas 
                         and murdered an entire family. Why 
                         did they do that? It's been suggested 
                         that this subject is tawdry -- it's 
                         not worthy of literature. I disagree. 
                         Two worlds exist in this country -- 
                         the quiet conservative life, and the 
                         life of those two men -- the 
                         underbelly, the criminally violent. 
                         Those worlds converged that bloody 
                         night. I spent the past three months 
                         interviewing everyone in Kansas 
                         touched by that violence. I spent 
                         hours talking to the killers -- and 
                         I'll spend more.

                         Researching this work has changed my 
                         life, altered my point of view about 
                         almost everything. I think those who

                         You're really very clever.

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY

               Truman sits in bed, writing on a yellow LEGAL PAD, surrounded 
               by PILES of notes. He squints his eyes, concentrating. Jack 
               enters, delivers a CUP OF COFFEE. Truman doesn't notice.

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER

               Truman is rifling through the boxes, looking for particular 
               notes. He can't find what he needs. The phone RINGS.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET, BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - LATE AFTERNOON

               Jack and Truman walk.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Perry's decided to appeal. He claims 
                         their attorney was incompetent -- 
                         that he never raised the issue of 
                         temporary insanity.

                                     JACK
                         So you find them a new lawyer.

                                     TRUMAN
                         They're facing execution in six weeks, 
                         Jack. They need someone to argue 
                         whether or not that's right.

                                     JACK
                         Okay.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I'd also like to see them alive, 
                         yes, thank you very much. I need to 
                         hear their story.

               They walk in silence for a few moments.

                                     TRUMAN
                         If you met him you'd understand. 
                         It's as if no-one's ever asked him a 
                         single question about himself. He's 
                         so... damaged -- and strange -- 
                         unexplored...
                              (then)
                         I don't trust this Hickock fellow. 
                         Perry's the only person who can 
                         describe to me what happened that 
                         night. I need to hear him say it.

                                     JACK
                         Just be careful what you do to get 
                         what you want.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I'm finding them a lawyer.

                                     JACK
                         Truman. You're finding yourself a 
                         lawyer.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR, DRIVING, TWO-LANE KANSAS HIGHWAY - DAY

               Truman drives alone, concentrating intently. He has to stretch 
               to see over the dashboard.

               EXT. KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY (KSP), LANSING - DAY

               A turreted, Civil War-era fortress an hour's drive from Kansas 
               City. Truman pulls up to the GUARDHOUSE.

               INT. KSP, WAITING ROOM/WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY

               Truman waits alone, looking at the lone decoration: a campaign 
               poster, showing a fat man in a suit grinning while holding a 
               shotgun. Across the bottom it reads: WALK TALL WITH KRUTCH. 
               A YOUNG PRISON GUARD sticks his head out of the office door.

                                     YOUNG PRISON GUARD
                         Warden Krutch will see you now.

               INT. KSP, WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY

               Wood-paneled walls, government-issue desk. On the wall behind 
               the desk is a CHART -- a racial accounting of the current 
               inmate population. It reads: WHITE - 1405, COLORED - 360, 
               MEXICANS - 12, INDIANS - 6.

               WARDEN MARSHALL KRUTCH is fat, coarse, sweaty even in winter. 
               And it's spring. He's running for Congress -- there are 
               "KRUTCH FOR CONGRESS" bumper stickers laying around the 
               office. He's enjoying a chance at a little publicity. The 
               YOUNG PRISON GUARD stands quietly by the wall.

                                     KRUTCH
                         We do well by our boys. Showers once 
                         a week. Feed em good. We'll be feeding 
                         Perry Smith in the infirmary soon if 
                         he don't eat. Get the food in through 
                         his arm.

                                     TRUMAN
                         What are you talking about?

                                     KRUTCH
                         Hasn't eaten in a month. But it's 
                         not his right to kill himself. It's 
                         the People's right. The People of 
                         this State. And that's who I work 
                         for, the People. You can write any 
                         of this down.

                                     TRUMAN
                         No one told me.

                                     KRUTCH
                         Yah. Won't eat.

                                     TRUMAN
                         When can I see him?

                                     KRUTCH
                              (checking desk calendar)
                         How about you come back Thursday?

                                     TRUMAN
                         No. That's no good. I need to see 
                         them now, then whenever I want for 
                         as long as I want.

                                     KRUTCH
                         Not how we do things here.

               Pause.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I see.

               Truman glances at the campaign stickers, the young prison 
               guard, then back at Krutch.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I understand what a burden unlimited 
                         visitation might be -- on this 
                         institution, and on the People who 
                         pay for it. I want to be clear that 
                         I don't expect the citizens of 
                         Leavenworth County to have to shoulder 
                         that burden.

               Truman reaches into his jacket, pulls from it an ENVELOPE 
               STUFFED with CASH. He lays it on the desk.

                                     TRUMAN
                         To be dispensed as you see fit.

               Krutch is stone-faced as he regards the money. Finally:

                                     KRUTCH
                         I didn't know where to count your 
                         boy -- being half-Indian. I did him 
                         a favor though.
                              (points to race chart)
                         Counted him White.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You're a kind and generous man.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW - DAY

               The second floor of a small building in the corner of the 
               prison complex. Decrepit. The one hall is lit by mesh-covered 
               BARE BULBS in the ceiling. Twelve cells -- six on each side. 
               Each is 7 by 10 feet, with one small, high WINDOW covered by 
               bars and wire. The YOUNG PRISON GUARD opens the heavy GATE 
               at the end of the hall and shows Truman in.

               They walk down the row of cells. In one of them we notice 
               Lowell Lee Andrews (20, white, spectacled, ENORMOUSLY FAT) 
               peering at his own face 4 inches from a mirror.

               Dick is leaning against the bars of his own cell. He smiles.

                                     HICKOCK
                         My hero.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Hello.

                                     HICKOCK
                         Thanks for your help with the lawyer.

                                     TRUMAN
                         That's fine.

                                     HICKOCK
                         You must be desperate for a story to 
                         come all the way out here.

                                     YOUNG PRISON GUARD
                         Mr. Capote. You're entitled to go 
                         in. You may, um, go in. If you wish.

               Truman hesitates for a second.

                                     HICKOCK
                         You want to see Perry. Go ahead.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Thank you.

               Truman walks to the next cell.

                                     HICKOCK
                         Ask me, he's just trying to prove 
                         the insanity defense.

               Truman sees Perry, gaunt, lying on his cot, almost comatose. 
               Perry's rather striking drawing of a LARGE YELLOW PARROT 
               sits propped on his table. An UNEATEN LUNCH TRAY lies on the 
               floor -- a cockroach runs over it. Truman watches, disturbed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

               Camera follows Truman as he walks down an aisle with a small 
               WICKER BASKET. He stops, looks at a shelf.

               INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

               Truman waits in the check-out line behind a MOM paying for 
               her groceries. Her SON (3) stands next to her legs, wearing 
               a little cowboy hat and cradling a TOY GUN to his chest. He 
               sucks his thumb. Truman and the boy look at each other.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - DAY

               Truman sits on the chair, his WICKER BASKET on the table. He 
               has spread out a cloth napkin. A GUARD watches from outside 
               the cell. Perry lies completely still on the cot. Truman 
               takes out jars of BONNET BABY FOOD, inspects the labels.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (to Perry)
                         I don't care what your plans are for 
                         yourself...

               He decides on the CUSTARD jar. He opens it, takes a plastic 
               BABY SPOON from the basket.

                                     TRUMAN
                         But you're gonna wake up enough to 
                         tell me what you did with my tie.

               He spoons a bit into Perry's mouth. The GUARD walks away. 
               Truman leans close to Perry, whispers:

                                     TRUMAN
                         It's okay. It's Truman. It's your 
                         friend.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER (LATE AFTERNOON)

               Perry sleeps. Truman stands against the wall watching him. 
               He has cleaned up the basket of food. He walks over to Perry's 
               desk, sees two handwritten notebooks on it: THE PRIVATE DIARY 
               OF PERRY EDWARD SMITH and PERSONAL DICTIONARY. Next to them, 
               he sees a pencil SELF-PORTRAIT Perry drew. It's very good. 
               Truman touches it.

               INT. KSP DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER (EVENING)

               Perry sleeps. Truman sits on the chair watching, waiting. 
               Perry opens his eyes, looks at Truman.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER (NIGHT)

               Perry is sitting up a bit, Truman helps him sip a cup of 
               water. Perry lies back down. He's looking at Truman.

                                     TRUMAN
                         How'd you learn to draw like that?

               Perry closes his eyes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR, DRIVING - AFTERNOON (NEXT DAY)

               Truman drives through the KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY gate, 
               waves to the Guard.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - EVENING

               Perry sits on the bed, cleaned up, wet hair neatly combed, 
               looking at a few OLD SNAPSHOTS he has saved in a handkerchief. 
               Truman sits in the chair across from him. Perry hands him a 
               photo of his mother. Perry speaks quietly.

                                     PERRY

                         That's your sister?

               Perry nods. Truman waits for more. It doesn't come.

                                     TRUMAN
                         We're not so different as you might 
                         think. I was abandoned repeatedly as 
                         a child. My mama'd drag me along to 
                         some new town so she could take up 
                         with another man she'd met. Night 
                         after night she'd lock me in the 
                         hotel room -- Mama'd turn the latch 
                         and tell the staff not to let me out 
                         no matter what. I was terrified -- 
                         I'd scream my head off -- till finally 
                         I'd collapse on the carpet next to 
                         the door and fall asleep. After years 
                         of this she just left me with 
                         relatives in Alabama.

                              (Perry nods)
                         That's when I met Nelle -- she lived 
                         next door.
                              (looks again at the 
                              photo, hands it back)

                         Drinking was not a good thing for 
                         her.

                                     PERRY
                         No tolerance for it.

                         No tolerance for him either.

               Truman's laughs, surprised by the joke, though it's unclear 
               whether Perry meant it as one. He stares at Perry.

                                     TRUMAN
                         What I can't decide is if you 
                         understand how fascinating you are.

               Perry doesn't respond, then --

                                     PERRY
                         I'm sorry about your tie. They took 
                         it away from me because we're all on 
                         suicide watch. It's why the lights 
                         stay on at night.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I hope we're past that now. You had 
                         me worried.

                                     PERRY
                         Okay.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I don't care about the tie. It's 
                         just a pity because it looked so 
                         good on you.

               Perry leans in, motions toward Dick's cell, lowers his voice --

                                     PERRY
                         Be careful of Ricardo. I think he 
                         wants you all to himself.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Alright --

                                     PERRY
                         But he's naturally mendacious -- not 
                         to be trusted -- if he had a hundred 
                         dollars he'd steal a stick of chewing 
                         gum.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You wouldn't.

               Perry shakes his head. Then, Truman nods toward Perry's 
               notebooks.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I want to take your notebooks with 
                         me -- I want to read them.

               Perry hesitates.

                                     TRUMAN
                         If I leave here without understanding 
                         you, the world will always see you 
                         as a monster. I don't want that -- I 
                         don't see you that way.

               A moment, then Perry reaches for the NOTEBOOKS, hands them 
               to Truman. Then he hands Truman the DRAWING he did of himself.

                                     PERRY
                         I tracked my father down in Alaska. 
                         I was 14. One day I said to him, 
                         "Mom's dead." I could see it. A week 
                         later we got the news. She finally 
                         drunk herself to death.

               Truman regards Perry. Then he looks at the drawing --

                                     TRUMAN
                         This is remarkable.

                                     PERRY
                         Sometimes you see a thing -- how it 
                         really is.

               On Truman holding the drawing, looking at Perry.

               EXT. KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Truman walks quickly to his car, holding Perry's DRAWING and 
               NOTEBOOKS. At the car, he looks back at the dark jailhouse.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL ROOM, KANSAS CITY - LATE NIGHT

               Truman at the desk, PERRY'S TWO BOOKS next to a LEGAL PAD 
               already filled with notes. He's on the PHONE with Nelle, 
               paging through the PERSONAL DICTIONARY captivated by it.

                                     TRUMAN
                         He trusts me -- that's why he gave 
                         it to me. He's given me absolutely 
                         everything.
                              (paging through Diary)
                         You should see his drawings, Nelle, 
                         how good he is. He wants so badly to 
                         be taken seriously, to be held in 
                         some esteem.

                         ever before have so many people been 
                         so directly responsible for my being 
                         so very, very glad. It's a wonderful 
                         moment and a rare one. Thank you!"
                              (beat)
                         There's an exclamation point on the

               EXT. KANSAS CITYSCAPE - VARIOUS (TWO WEEKS ELAPSE)

               INT. DINER, DOWNTOWN KANSAS CITY - MORNING

               Truman is eating breakfast with Alvin Dewey. A WAITRESS 
               refills their coffees.

                                     DEWEY
                              (to waitress)
                         Thanks.

               She leaves. An uncomfortable silence. Then:

                                     DEWEY
                         You're nothing if not hard-working.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You look good, healthy again.

                                     DEWEY
                         Not a chance.

               Dewey taps a cigarette out of his pack.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I've decided on a title for my book. 
                         I think you'll like it -- very 
                         masculine. "In Cold Blood."

                                     DEWEY
                              (lights the cigarette)
                         That refers to the crime or the fact 
                         that you're still talking to the 
                         criminals?

                                     TRUMAN
                         The former, among other things.

                                     DEWEY
                         I see.

               They eat for a moment. Then:

                                     TRUMAN
                         I've been wanting to ask if you'll 
                         let me look at your investigation 
                         notes.

                                     DEWEY
                         That lawyer you helped find for your 
                         friends got them a hearing at the 
                         Kansas Supreme Court --

                                     TRUMAN
                         I heard this morning.

                                     DEWEY
                         -- on the issue of inadequate counsel.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Alvin. Do you not want me to look at 
                         your notes? You are permitted to say 
                         no.

                                     DEWEY
                              (rises, takes out 
                              wallet)
                         I'll tell you what: if those boys 
                         get off, I'm coming to Brooklyn to 
                         hunt you down.

               Truman can't decide whether Dewey is kidding or not. Dewey 
               puts money on the table.

                                     DEWEY
                         I have to be in court at nine o'clock.

               He walks away. Over his shoulder:

                                     DEWEY
                         Call Roy Church. He'll show you what 
                         you want to see.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW - DAY

               Truman walks down the hall. He passes Dick's cell. Dick is 
               lying in bed. Dick rises and smiles widely at Truman.

                                     HICKOCK
                         Hey, hey...

               Truman smiles, puts HIS FINGERS TO HIS LIPS, continues past. 
               He stops outside Perry's cell. Perry (looking MUCH HEALTHIER) 
               is drawing at his table -- a picture of the HUGE YELLOW PARROT 
               swooping down from the sky. Truman watches for a few moments, 
               then Perry looks at him.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - MOMENTS LATER

               The Guard locks Truman inside with Perry.

                                     PERRY
                         Thank you.

               Truman looks at the Guard -- he leaves.

                                     TRUMAN
                         It was as much for me as for anyone. 
                         I couldn't bear the thought of losing 
                         you so soon.

                                     PERRY
                         We're going to be able to use your 
                         book for our case. You'll write we 
                         never got to raise our insanity plea. 
                         You wrote how terrible the lawyer 
                         was?

                                     TRUMAN
                         I haven't written a word yet.

               Beat.

                                     PERRY
                         What have you been doing?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Research. Waiting to talk to you.

                                     PERRY
                         All right.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I had hoped --

                                     PERRY
                         What are you calling it?

                                     TRUMAN
                         The book?
                              (looks directly at 
                              him)
                         I have no idea.

               Pause.

                                     TRUMAN
                         If I'm going to write about you -- 
                         if I'm going to determine how to 
                         write about you -- you need to tell 
                         me about that night at the Clutter 
                         house.

               Perry just looks at him.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Perry.

               Perry shakes his head.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Why? Do you worry what I'll think?

               Perry looks away. A long moment.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Is that it?

               Silence. Then:

                                     PERRY
                         Dick says you know Elizabeth Taylor.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I know a lot of people.

               Truman gives up for now. Sees the PICTURE OF THE YELLOW BIRD 
               on the desk.

                                     TRUMAN
                         What is that you keep drawing?

                                     PERRY
                         You must hate having to come to this 
                         place --

                                     TRUMAN
                         Perry, I have invitations to be in 
                         Morocco, Greece... I choose to be 
                         here. Those people have everything, 
                         all their prayers have been answered, 
                         yet they're more desperate than ever. 
                         I prefer to be here with you.

                                     PERRY
                              (looks at Truman; 
                              evenly)
                         I was ten, I wet the bed, the nuns 
                         at the orphanage hated the smell. 
                         First month one of them found me 
                         shivering -- just trying to get 
                         through the night. The Sister pulled 
                         back the covers and shined her 
                         flashlight to see what I'd did. The 
                         sheets were wet. She hit me so many 
                         times with that flashlight she broke 
                         it.
                              (he shrugs)
                         That night I dreamed about the yellow 
                         bird. Tall. Yellow like the sun. It 
                         picked me up and it clawed the Nun's 
                         eyes and it lifted me into the sky.

               They look at each other.

               EXT. BAR, DOWNTOWN K.C. - NIGHT

               Truman on the street outside the club at a PAY PHONE. He 
               talks with Jack in Brooklyn.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I'm just missing this one piece, 
                         Jack. Be patient with me.

                                     JACK
                         How long is that gonna take? Why 
                         don't you try leaving him alone for 
                         a while? Come to Spain. You can always 
                         visit him later.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I don't know.

                                     JACK
                         Well, I'm off. I've got my own writing 
                         to do.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Do it in Brooklyn. Wait for me.

                                     JACK
                         Too many people around.
                              (beat)
                         I'll leave the address on the kitchen 
                         table. Truman, what do you do there 
                         when you're not with him? -- It must 
                         be awful.

               Truman's watching a YOUNG GUY standing outside the bar, 
               looking at him.

                                     JACK
                         Think about what I said. Join me 
                         when you can.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I will. I will. Bye.

               Truman follows the YOUNG GUY into the bar.

               INT. HOTEL ROOM, KANSAS CITY - LATE NIGHT

               Truman sleeps. He OPENS HIS EYES in bed. Turns to the bedside 
               table to see the drawing of Perry looking at him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. KANSAS CITY - DAWN

               A young drifter stands alone on an empty street corner. He 
               checks a pay phone for a coin. It's empty.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - DAY

               Perry is lying on his cot reading an ADVENTURE MAGAZINE -- 
               something to do with finding buried treasure off the coast 
               of Mexico -- and sucking on the tip of his thumb. After a 
               moment he STARTLES and looks up.

               Truman stands outside his cell. He holds a stack of books: 
               Perry's PERSONAL DICTIONARY and DIARY, and a new WEBSTER'S 
               DICTIONARY and THESAURUS.

                                     PERRY
                         I didn't see you. Jesus, you...
                              (stands, tucks in 
                              shirt)
                         Come in. Where's the guard?

                                     TRUMAN
                         I can't. I brought you some things, 
                         but I have to fly back East.

                                     PERRY
                         When?

                                     TRUMAN
                         An hour. I'm sorry.

                                     PERRY
                         You can't.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I'm sorry.

                                     PERRY
                         Who are you going there to see --

                                     HICKOCK (O.S.)
                              (from next cell)
                         Capote, get it straight in your book -- 
                         we never intended on killing that 
                         family --

                                     PERRY
                         I told him that.

                                     HICKOCK (O.S.)
                         No premeditation --

                                     PERRY
                         I told him!

               Perry searches the cell for something else to give to Truman 
               to keep him there. Then, he stops. He has nothing left to 
               give, and is unwilling to talk about that night at the 
               Clutters. He becomes very still. Truman speaks gently --

                                     TRUMAN
                         Your writings are magnificent. I 
                         hope these help you do more.

               No response. Truman places the books on the floor just outside 
               Perry's cell -- Perry's writings in one stack and the new 
               dictionaries in another right next to it.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I have so much material -- from the 
                         trial, from our visits, your journals. 
                         I have to organize it all, and I 
                         have to start the process of writing.
                              (no response)
                         I'll visit soon. Perhaps this fall.
                              (backing away)
                         I miss you already. Write me every 
                         five minutes.

               He turns and goes. We stay with Perry as Truman leaves. We 
               hear Dick speak to Truman.

                                     HICKOCK (O.S.)
                         Be good now.

               Hear Truman's footsteps receding. Then, a long shot of the 
               hallway as the Guard lets Truman out the gate at the end of 
               the row. Silence.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL

               Perry looks down at the books sitting on the floor outside 
               his cell. He crouches, puts his hand through the bars and 
               touches the cover of the new dictionary. He's alone.

                                                                  FADE OUT.

               Over black -- the sound of a JET airplane -- loud, then 
               passing.

               EXT. BEACH - DAY

               FADE IN: BRIGHT WHITE SKY. Sounds of seagulls. Ocean, sand, 
               cottage houses in greenery set back from the beach.

               EXT. RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - DAY

               The house Jack rented. Jack types on the upstairs deck. Truman 
               pulls up in an OLD TAXI. Jack looks out over the railing to 
               the street. Jack emerges on the FRONT PORCH as Truman walks 
               up the path with his bags. They look at each other. Then 
               Truman looks around at the incredible garden, the ocean in 
               the background, and starts to LAUGH.

                                                                  FADE OUT.

               Title up:              "January, 1962"

               Sound of a MANUAL TYPEWRITER over black.

               EXT. RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

               FADE IN on the peaceful outside of the house. Sound of TYPING.

               INT. RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

               More typing. A PHONE rings. CAMERA tracks slowly through the 
               pretty, tiled living room, toward a DOOR at the far end.

               INT. BEDROOM, RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

               Truman at his DESK, surrounded by piles of filled YELLOW 
               PADS, NOTE CARDS, an open TRUNK of random notes. He is at 
               the MANUAL TYPEWRITER. The phone is on the floor, ringing. 
               He types. The phone rings. Exasperated, he picks up.

                                     TRUMAN
                         What.

                         Truman. I was supposed to be home 
                         for dinner with my wife three hours 
                         ago -- I have not been able to tear 
                         myself away from your book. It's 
                         that good. It's not good, it's 
                         astonishing. This first half is 
                         astonishing. If the second half lives 
                         up to this it, -- it -- how much is 
                         left to do?

                         I'm already well into the third part, 
                         but I -- I can't finish that till I 
                         convince Perry to describe the night 
                         of the killings to me. I was planning 
                         to visit this fall, see --

                         I think you need to talk to him now.

                         And we all need to see how this ends 
                         for the final part. I can't finish 
                         the book till I know what happens. 
                         If Perry and Dick are executed it's 
                         one thing -- and if not, well --

                         The Kansas court denied their appeal. 
                         It came over the wire on Friday. You 
                         need to talk to Perry now. He'll be 
                         dead by September. I'm sorry, I know 
                         how much you've come to care about 
                         him.

               Truman is completely immobile.

                         I want to set up a reading for you 
                         in the fall, in New York. We'll build 
                         some interest, and we'll publish in 
                         the fall.

               On Truman.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KITCHEN, RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - MORNING

               Truman at the stove watching his tea water heat up. Jack 
               enters with a HUGE BASKET of WINE and GROCERIES.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Plums. Thank god. We have nothing in 
                         the house.

               He takes one from the basket. Jack starts to unpack food.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Why aren't you working?

                                     JACK
                         I knew you couldn't be depended on 
                         to stock the kitchen.

               Truman looks at him blankly.

                                     JACK
                         What would we feed our famous guest?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Oh, Jesus. I completely forgot.

               He helps Jack put away the groceries. Then:

                                     JACK
                              (utterly nonchalant)
                         Plus -- I finished my novel yesterday.

               Truman looks at Jack, smiles widely.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

               Truman, Jack and Nelle. A BONFIRE, a wind-up Victrola playing 
               Ella Fitzgerald, bottles of wine. Jack and Nelle dance. Truman 
               toasts Jack drunkenly.

                                     TRUMAN
                         My man, my hero, my talented... My 
                         man...

                                     JACK
                         You said that.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You are the hardest worker, the most 
                         unsung talent I know. As Nelle passes 
                         by on her way to London to sell her 
                         book which needs no selling, may a 
                         little of her success rub off on 
                         both of us.

               Jack laughs.

                                     JACK
                         Here, here!

               Nelle tries to smack Truman but can't catch him. The song 
               changes to a slow one. Jack and Truman dance sweetly together. 
               Nelle sits on the sand and watches.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. UPSTAIRS DECK, RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - MORNING

               Breakfast. Truman and Nelle are sitting -- Nelle has a small 
               envelope in her hand. Truman is obviously uncomfortable. As 
               Jack delivers a platter of omelettes to the table:

                                     NELLE
                              (to Truman)
                         When was the last time you wrote 
                         back to him?

                                     TRUMAN
                         I don't know.

                                     JACK
                         What's this?

                                     NELLE
                         A letter for your boyfriend I was 
                         asked to deliver.

                                     TRUMAN
                         From Perry.

                                     JACK
                         Let's have it.

               Jack sits. Nelle opens the letter, reads:

                                     NELLE
                         "Dear Friend Truman. Where are you? 
                         Read this item in a medical 
                         dictionary: "Death by hanging is 
                         caused by asphyxia, by fracture of 
                         the cervical vertebrae, by laceration 
                         of the trachea." Not too comforting 
                         as we lost our appeal. Missing you -- 
                         alone and desirous of your presence. 
                         Your amigo, Perry."

               Pause.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Mr. Shawn told me about the court 
                         decision yesterday.

                                     JACK
                         I was wondering why you were in such 
                         a good mood. Surely, I thought, it's 
                         not because I finished my little 
                         book.

                                     TRUMAN
                         That's a terrible thing to say.

               Jack looks out at the ocean.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (to no one in 
                              particular)
                         I used to write him all the time. 
                         I've been so focused lately on the 
                         book.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Truman and Nelle carry her bags down the front walk toward a 
               waiting TAXI.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Jack says I'm using Perry, but he 
                         also thinks I fell in love with him 
                         when I was in Kansas. How both of 
                         those things can be true is beyond 
                         me.

                                     NELLE
                         Did you? Fall in love with him.

               Silence as they load the bags into the trunk.

                         I don't know how to answer that... 
                         It's as if Perry and I started life 
                         in the same house. One day he stood 
                         up and walked out the back door while 
                         I walked out the front. With some 
                         different choices, he's the man I 
                         might have become.

                         Are you kidding me?

               Truman shrugs, doesn't answer. Nelle kisses him.

                         Be nice to Jack. Sometimes I think 
                         he's what I like about you best.

               Nelle gets in the taxi, then leans her head out the window.

                         Truman. Honestly. Are you going back 
                         to Kansas because you care about 
                         Perry or because you need information 
                         before he's killed?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Can't it be both?

                                     NELLE
                         No. I don't think it can be.

               She drives away. Truman watches her go. He turns back up 
               toward the house, stops a moment to pick a FLOWER from the 
               bushes at the front gate.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW - DAY

               A Guard walks down the corridor carrying a SINGLE FLOWER. He 
               delivers it to Perry, then walks off. Perry is confused. He 
               hears FOOTSTEPS approaching, but can't see who it is.

                                     HICKOCK (O.S.)
                         Hey, buddy. Thanks.

               More footsteps. CAMERA on Perry as the footsteps finally 
               arrive outside his cell. He's shocked.

               REVERSE onto Truman, looking tanned, healthy, very blond. He 
               holds a STACK OF BOOKS with a BOW on top. He smiles.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW - LATER THAT NIGHT

               LONG SHOT of dimly lit corridor, light spilling out from 
               each cell. A ROW GUARD walks the hall. We hear voices 
               murmuring.

               SIX MORE GUARDS arrive at the top of the stairs. The ROW 
               GUARD walks over, unlocks the GATE to let them in.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - NIGHT

               Perry is looking at the cover of a BOOK -- "WALDEN POND." 
               Other books sit next to Perry on the cot. Among them -- WILLA 
               CATHER's "MY ANTONIA", also "GREAT EXPECTATIONS" --

                                     PERRY
                         What was he in jail for?

                                     TRUMAN
                         They said it was not paying his taxes. 
                         But really for being an outsider -- 
                         refusing to go along.

               Perry nods, looks at the other books.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You don't have to read any of these 
                         if you don't want to. But I thought 
                         you'd like something decent. You're 
                         much too smart for adventure 
                         magazines.

               Through the bars of Perry's cell, we can see the SIX GUARDS 
               enter Lowell Lee Andrew's cell (diagonally across the 
               corridor). The ROW GUARD appears at Perry's cell.

                                     ROW GUARD
                         Lock-down while Lowell goes to 
                         solitary. Nobody in or out.
                              (to Truman)
                         You want in or out?

               Truman looks at Perry, then back to the Guard.

                         In.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, LOWELL LEE ANDREW'S CELL - MOMENTS 
               LATER

               The SIX GUARDS start to pack up Andrews cell while he sits 
               on the cot and watches.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER

               Perry and Truman talk very QUIETLY. (Throughout this scene, 
               we see in the background, across the corridor, the mostly 
               obscured cell of Andrews. We see his incredibly FAT LEG being 
               shackled, his belongings being packed in boxes.)

                                     PERRY
                         Everyone says he's a genius. I don't 
                         think he's a genius. He's rich and 
                         he went to college -- like any of us 
                         would've if we got the chance. He 
                         came home for Christmas and shot his 
                         parents --

                         I won't be sorry to see him go. Always 
                         correcting my grammar.

               They watch Andrews being shackled in the background.

                         line.

               Truman regards Perry, who looks down.

                         I'm so sorry I've been away.

                         when they take him out to the Corner, 
                         but the whole prison shuts down.

                         I have to be in New York anyway.

               Perry nods.

                                     PERRY
                         How's the book going?

               One of the six guards CLANGS Andrews' cell bars with his 
               stick.

                         Ready.

               The ROW GUARD opens the cell door. Andrews is led out, arms 
               and legs shackled, into the corridor.

                         under your fat fucking chin.

               Andrews is led past Perry's cell. He looks in at Perry.

                                     ANDREWS
                         Next!

               Andrews shuffles down the hall. Perry watches him go. On 
               Truman watching Perry. We hear the GATE slam shut.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Packed. Nelle stands with William Shawn, who receives well-
               wishers. BEN BARON enters, seeing Nelle.

                                     BEN BARON
                              (loudly, over the 
                              hubbub)
                         Hello Hollywood. That's quite a bundle 
                         you sold your book for.

               Nelle is embarrassed, mostly for Baron, to have the issue of 
               money brought up publicly.

                                     NELLE
                         Well...

               Baron moves past, Nelle smiles politely, whispers to Shawn.

                                     NELLE
                         What a gentleman.

               INT. THEATER, BACKSTAGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

               Truman sits alone. In the background, we can HEAR the noise 
               of the huge crowd gathering in the theater. Truman wears his 
               MOST STYLISH LITERARY OUTFIT: a gorgeous dark green Knize 
               SUIT over a black cashmere turtleneck sweater, and horn-rimmed 
               GLASSES (which we've never seen him wear before).

               He's frozen with anticipation, nervousness. After several 
               moments a THEATER ASSISTANT opens the door.

                                     YOUNG ASSISTANT
                         Mr. Capote. Can I get you anything?

                                     TRUMAN
                         No.
                              (clears his throat)
                         Thank you.

               The assistant leaves. We hear the crowd quiet down. Truman 
               rises slowly, walks through the door to the backstage area. 
               We hear William Shawn on stage.

                                     SHAWN (O.S.)
                         Welcome New Yorkers...

               INT. WINGS/STAGE - NIGHT

               Shawn pauses briefly for a laugh that doesn't come. Truman 
               continues walking toward the backstage curtains.

                                     SHAWN (O.S.)
                         Thank you for coming to the first 
                         public reading, the first offering 
                         of any kind, of Truman Capote's new 
                         work "In Cold Blood." Our magazine --

               Truman walks on stage. Loud applause. Shawn sees him, slinks 
               back to his seat. Truman walks over to the podium, takes in 
               the enormous crowd. Once it is completely quiet:

                                     TRUMAN
                         Hello. My name is Truman Capote.

               People laugh and applaud loudly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - SAME TIME, NIGHT

               Perry, eating dinner alone at his table, looks up. We HEAR a 
               LOUD ENGINE revving outside.

               EXT. KSP, THE CORNER WAREHOUSE - SAME TIME

               A FRONT-LOADER TRACTOR drives into the warehouse. A PRISON 
               POLICE CAR parks outside the warehouse. Guards get the 
               enormous Lowell Lee Andrews, shackled, from the back seat, 
               walk him inside.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - NIGHT

               C/U on Perry, now standing on his chair and watching out the 
               tiny window.

                         Perry Smith's voice was both gentle 
                         and prim -- a voice that, though 
                         soft, manufactured each sound exactly -- 
                         ejected it like a smoke ring issuing 
                         from a parson's mouth.

               Perry watches through his window. From inside the warehouse 
               we hear the gallows TRAP DOOR spring and CLATTER. On Perry,

                         The village of Holcomb stands on the 
                         high wheat plains of western Kansas, 
                         a lonesome area that other Kansans 
                         call "out there." Until one morning 
                         in mid-November 1959, few Americans -- 
                         in fact, few Kansans -- had ever 
                         heard of Holcomb. Like the waters of 
                         the [Arkansas] river, like the 
                         motorists on the highway... 
                         exceptional happenings had never 
                         stopped there.

               We see the outside wall with Perry and Dick's faces peering 
               out through their tiny windows.

               EXT. KSP, THE CORNER WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               The TRACTOR emerges through the warehouse doors. It carries 
               in its FRONT SHOVEL the enormous, dead BODY of ANDREWS covered 
               by a BLACK CLOTH.

                         The four coffins, which quite filled 
                         the small, flower-crowded parlor, 
                         were to be sealed at the funeral 
                         services -- very understandably, for 
                         the effect... was disquieting. Nancy 
                         wore her dress of cherry-red velvet, 
                         her brother a bright plaid shirt; 
                         the parents were more sedately 
                         attired, Mr. Clutter in navy-blue 
                         flannel, his wife in navy-blue crepe; 
                         and -- and it was this especially 
                         that lent the scene an awful aura -- 
                         the head of each was completely 
                         encased in cotton, a swollen cocoon 
                         twice the size of an ordinary blown-
                         up balloon, and the cotton, because 
                         it had been sprayed with a glossy 
                         substance, twinkled like Christmas-
                         tree snow.

                         dawn, a carload of... strangers, 
                         ignorant of the local disaster -- 
                         were startled by what they saw as 
                         they crossed the prairies and passed 
                         through Holcomb: windows ablaze, 
                         almost every window in almost every 
                         house, and, in the brightly lit rooms, 
                         fully clothed people, even entire 
                         families, who had sat the whole night 
                         wide awake, watchful, listening. Of 
                         what were they frightened? "It might 
                         happen again."

               He closes his manuscript. Several moments of SILENCE, then 
               thunderous APPLAUSE.

               Truman's dressing room. Packed with well-wishers drinking 
               from bottles of CHAMPAGNE, smoking, toasting, shouting to be 
               heard. Truman in the corner with Christopher Isherwood, BEN 
               BARON others, laughing. A LITERARY ENTHUSIAST approaches,

                         Your portrait of those men was 
                         terrifying. Terrifying.

                         Thank you.

               Truman and Isherwood watch him walk away.

                         Your hairpiece is terrifying.

                         I was going to say the same thing!

               Truman laughs loudly. We SEE Nelle look over from across the 
               room at her friend having the time of his life.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         everything. It'll change how people 
                         see you as a writer. It'll change 
                         how people write. You'll finish by 
                         October?

                         I think so. You know they're scheduled 
                         for next month?

                         I'm flying to Kansas tomorrow. I'll 
                         get Perry to talk --

                         Honestly, what's he got to lose?

               Truman smiles at the joke, then stops himself.

                                     TRUMAN
                         It really is too awful. 
                         Institutionalized sadism.

                         As strange as it may sound to you, 
                         I'm going to miss him.

                                                                  FADE OUT.

               Over black -- the sound of a JET airplane -- loud, then 
               passing.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - DAY

               Truman, flushed, out of breath, stands outside Perry's cell. 
               He's just arrived. He holds a FOLDED-UP NEWSPAPER. Perry 
               sits at his table reading LEGAL DOCUMENTS.

                                     TRUMAN
                         When did you hear?

               Perry looks up, mistaking Truman's state for shared 
               enthusiasm. He smiles widely.

                                     PERRY
                         Two days ago.

               The Guard opens the cell for Truman. Perry holds up one of 
               the DOCUMENTS.

                                     PERRY
                         It's what we've been waiting for. A 
                         stay of execution to make a federal 
                         appeal.

               Truman enters. Perry goes to him and hugs him tightly.

                                     PERRY
                         All thanks to you.

               On Truman, shocked, being hugged.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER

               Truman sits on the bed, his coat still on, watching Perry -- 
               hyped up, talking, walking around the cell.

                                     PERRY
                         Kansas's had it in for me for ten 
                         years -- in prison the first time, 
                         at that trial, here. They can't corner 
                         me now. Not till the U.S. Government 
                         says so --

                         Perry, sit down. For a minute.
                              (Perry sits)
                         I need you to talk to me...

                                     PERRY
                         We've got all the time in the world 
                         to talk. About everything. I've been 
                         thinking about Ricardo. You need to 
                         stop sending him those trashy books. 
                         I won't even mention the pornography.
                              (getting up)
                         I realize he might have trouble 
                         grasping the literature you gave me, 
                         but those books only exacerbate the 
                         problem -- only 'heighten' or 
                         'intensify' it. Maybe we should start 
                         him on a program...

               Perry stops.

                         I know what exacerbate means.

                         There is not a word, or a sentence, 
                         or a concept, that you can illuminate 
                         for me. There is one singular reason 
                         that I keep coming here --

               Pause.

                                     PERRY
                         I've asked you not to --

                         This is ridiculous.
                              (to the Guard)
                         I'm ready.
                              (to Perry)
                         I have a plane to catch. I found 
                         your sister in Tacoma. Maybe she'll 
                         talk to me about something useful.

                         Don't go out there.

               The Guard lets Truman out of the cell.

                                     PERRY
                         Please don't go out there.

               The Guard shuts the door.

                                     TRUMAN
                         This is my work, Perry. I'm working. 
                         When you want to tell me what I need 
                         to hear, you let me know.

               He walks off down the hall. The GATE slams shut.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PERRY'S SISTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

               Cheaply built ranch house. LINDA MURCHAK (30) walks in the 
               kitchen back door, shuts it.

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                         They'll play outside a while longer.

               Mrs. Murchak looks like a female Perry, dark and small, 
               attractive and nervous. Through the window, we see THREE 
               LITTLE CHILDREN playing on a DECREPIT JUNGLE GYM in the yard. 
               Truman sits at the table, leafing through a PHOTO ALBUM.

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                         I don't want them to see that.

                                     TRUMAN
                         They've never seen these pictures?

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                              (shakes her head)
                         Too many questions.

               She joins Truman again at the table.

               We see an OLD PHOTO of the SMITH FAMILY -- Linda at age 8, 
               Perry (5); their older sister, June; their brother Frank; 
               and the parents: Florence (American Indian) and John (Irish) -- 
               in front of their rundown truck on a desolate road.

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                         June's dead. Frank shot himself. Now 
                         Perry's did what he did. I suppose 
                         I'm next. Some ruination will visit 
                         me.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I don't think life works that way.

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                         It does in this family.

               Truman turns the page. A PICTURE of Perry (3) and Linda 
               HOLDING HANDS and splashing in a big mud-puddle in the rain. 
               Linda is smiling at Perry, who is naked, laughing.

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                         I used to love him. He was my little 
                         doll.

               He turns the page. A PICTURE of Perry (6) and Linda sitting 
               on the back steps of a shack, poking with a stick at something 
               in the dirt. After a moment, she gets up, clears coffee cups.

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                         He scares me now.

                                     TRUMAN
                         When was the last time you saw him?

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                         Ten years.

               She picks up the album to put it away.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Do you think I could borrow one of 
                         those pictures?

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                              (hands it to him)
                         Take the whole thing. I don't want'em 
                         anymore.
                              (then)
                         Just... Perry doesn't know where I 
                         live. He thinks we're still in 
                         Portland. Please don't tell him we're 
                         not.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (he already has)
                         Alright.

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                         Don't be taken in by my brother. 
                         He's got this sensitive side he'll 
                         show. You believe he's gentle, so 
                         easily hurt. But he'd just as soon 
                         kill you as shake your hand. I believe 
                         that.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW - NEXT DAY

               Truman slows for a moment as he passes Hickock's cell.

                         Hello handsome.

               Hickock just stares at him. Truman, unnerved, moves on to 
               Perry's cell.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - CONTINUOUS

               Perry doing pushups. He sees Truman and stops. He stands. 
               The Row Guard approaches.

                                     ROW GUARD
                         You want to go in?

               Truman regards Perry for a few moments, then:

                         Yes

               The Guard unlocks the door. Perry STARTS TO MOVE toward it. 
               The Guard SLAMS it shut.

                         What's the name of your book?

               No response. Perry can barely control his anger.

               Perry picks up a cut-out ARTICLE from the NY Times from his 
               desk. He reads.

               Perry doesn't answer.

                         Who sent that to you?

                         It is my business, because it's not 
                         true. The organizers of the reading 
                         needed a title. They picked one -- a 
                         sensational one, I admit -- to attract 
                         a crowd.

                                     PERRY
                         They picked it.

                         Yes.

                                     PERRY
                         That's not your title.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I haven't chosen one yet.

               Perry stares at him, not believing.

                                     TRUMAN
                         How could I choose --

                         You pretend to be my friend...

                                     TRUMAN
                         How could I choose a title when you 
                         still haven't told me what happened 
                         that night? How could I? I couldn't 
                         possibly.

               Long pause. Truman reaches in his breast pocket and extracts 
               a PHOTO (the one of Perry and Linda splashing in the puddle.)

                                     TRUMAN
                         I have something from your sister.

               He hands it through the bars to Perry. Perry takes it.

                                     TRUMAN
                         She misses you.

               Perry looks at the photo. After a few moments, Truman turns 
               to the Guard.

                                     TRUMAN
                         It's alright. I'll go in.

               The Guard unlocks the cell. Truman enters. The Guard locks 
               up, walks away. Perry is still looking at the PHOTO.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I'm sorry. I should have told you 
                         what they made me call the book.
                              (touches Perry's arm)
                         I couldn't pretend to be your friend. 
                         The truth is, I can't help wanting 
                         to be.
                              (silence, then:)
                         You don't have to tell me anything 
                         if you don't want to.

               Perry looks at the photo of himself and his sister for a 
               long time.

                                     PERRY
                         Look at my belly.

               Perry sits on the bed. Then, almost to himself:

                                     PERRY
                         There must be something wrong with 
                         us. To do what we did.

               Truman waits him out, sitting on the chair. Finally, Perry 
               looks at him. When Perry speaks, it is quietly, completely 
               matter-of-fact.

                                     PERRY
                         We heard there was ten thousand 
                         dollars in that house. Once we'd 
                         tied up everybody and searched all 
                         over, I knew the guy who told us 
                         about it was wrong. There wasn't any 
                         money. But Dick wouldn't believe it. 
                         He went tearing through the house 
                         again, banging on the walls, looking 
                         for a safe. He said when he was done, 
                         he was going to come up to Nancy's 
                         room and have his way with her. I 
                         wouldn't allow it. I told him that. 
                         I sat with Nancy.

               Perry and Nancy. Perry sits quietly on the edge of Nancy's 
               bed. A SMALL BEDSIDE LAMP softly illuminates a portion of 
               the room. We hear Dick banging around downstairs.

                         It was nice in there.

               The scene is almost sweet, until we see that Nancy's legs 
               and hands are TIED and her mouth is TAPED.

                         Dick came to get me and we turned 
                         out the lights and went down to the 
                         basement, where we had Mr. Clutter 
                         and the boy. Dick kept saying "No 
                         witnesses." I figured if I just waited 
                         him out he'd give up and leave them 
                         tied up there. We'd drive all night, 
                         they'd never find us. Mr. Clutter's 
                         wrists were tied to a pipe over his 
                         head. He looked like he was hurt, so 
                         I cut him down.

                         We put a box there on the floor so 
                         he'd be more comfortable. He asked 
                         if his wife and daughter were alright 
                         and I said they were fine, they were 
                         ready to go to sleep. I told him it 
                         wasn't long till morning when somebody 
                         would find them.

                         He was looking at me. Just... looking 
                         at me. Looking at my eyes. Like he 
                         expects me to kill him -- expects me 
                         to be the kind of person who would 
                         kill him. I was thinking -- this 
                         nice man, he's scared of me. I was 
                         ashamed. I mean, I thought he was a 
                         kind man, a good... a gentleman. I 
                         thought so right up to the moment I 
                         cut his throat. I didn't realize 
                         what I'd did till I heard the sound.

               He stirs the custard, eats it.

                                     TRUMAN
                         ...It's harrowing -- all I want is 
                         to write the ending and there's no 
                         fucking end in sight... No. No, I 
                         haven't been drinking again...

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER

               Truman sits on the bed with a glass of bourbon, staring at 
               the television. An empty jar of BABY CUSTARD sits on the 
               bedside table.

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER

               Truman on the bed, the television still on, another drink. 
               We hear a DOORBELL. We hear Jack walk down the hall, answer 
               the door, shut the door. Jack enters with a TELEGRAM.

                                     JACK
                         I don't know how you can eat that. 
                         Perhaps if you weren't drinking so 
                         much you wouldn't have to.

               No response. Jack turns down the television, opens the 
               telegram.

                                     JACK
                              (reads)
                         "Dear friend Truman. Haven't heard 
                         from you in such a long while. Please 
                         help find new lawyer. If not, Dick 
                         will have to write Supreme Court 
                         brief himself. Our last appeal. What 
                         a pair of wretched creatures. Please 
                         help. Your amigo? Perry."

               Pause. Jack looks at Truman.

                                     JACK
                         Your amigo.

               Truman stares back. Finally, he turns back to the television.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Put it with the others.

               Jack goes to the DESK and places the telegram on top of a 
               LARGE PILE OF TELEGRAMS, all from Perry -- all, we should 
               assume, unanswered.

               Jack walks out. Truman sips his drink.

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER, EARLY EVENING

               Truman at the desk, still in PAJAMAS, typing. Jack enters 
               wearing a TUXEDO, reads over Truman's shoulder. We see:

               "...unable to find laywer despite extensive search. So sorry. 
               All best, Truman."

                                     JACK
                         You tried?

               Truman extracts the page from the typewriter, folds it, and 
               puts it in an envelope. He takes a sip of his BOURBON.

                                     JACK
                              (walking out)
                         You need to get ready.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LIMOUSINE, MOVING - NIGHT

               Truman and Jack are driven. Both wear TUXEDOS and OVERCOATS. 
               Truman drinks.

               INT. LIMOUSINE, MOVING - NIGHT, LATER

               Driving. Truman and Jack sit in silence, then:

                                     JACK
                         At least pretend for Nelle that you're 
                         having a good time tonight.

               The limo turns a corner and we see an ENORMOUS CROWD in front 
               of a THEATER. On the marquee it says: "Opening tonight - TO 
               KILL A MOCKINGBIRD"

               It is COLD. Truman and Jack's limo pulls up. An USHER opens 
               their DOOR.

               EXT. MOVIE THEATER - MOMENTS LATER

               Truman, obviously drunk, preens and poses on the red carpet 
               for the CAMERAS. Jack watches from the side.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SARDI'S RESTAURANT, OPENING PARTY - NIGHT

               Huge party in progress. Nelle walks through the crowd. People 
               turn to her saying: "Congratulations"; "Wonderful". She finds 
               Truman sitting at the BAR, receiving a new drink.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Nelle.

               She looks UNCOMFORTABLY DOLLED UP for the premiere of her 
               movie.

                                     NELLE
                         I thought I'd find you here.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (to the bartender)
                         Please, another.

               He hands Nelle his drink, receives another. After a moment:

                                     NELLE
                         How are you?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Terrible.

               Beat.

                                     NELLE
                         I'm sorry to hear that.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Well. It's torture. Torture...
                              (he drinks)
                         ...what they're doing to me.

                                     NELLE
                         Uh-huh.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Now the Supreme Court. Can you believe 
                         it? If they win this appeal I will 
                         have a complete nervous breakdown. I 
                         may never recover. Just pray things 
                         turn my way.

                                     NELLE
                         It must be hard.

                                     TRUMAN
                         It's torture. They're torturing me.

                                     NELLE
                         I see.

               Nelle regards him for a moment.

                                     NELLE
                         And how'd you like the movie, Truman.

               She puts her drink down on the bar and walks away. Truman 
               turns back to the bartender, shrugs.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I frankly don't know what the fuss 
                         is about.

               On Truman, alone at the bar.

                                                                  FADE OUT.

               EXT. STREET, OUTSIDE TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

               FADE UP on a PAPER BOY riding his BIKE down the street. New 
               buds are on the trees. It is SPRING. The BOY wears a NEW 
               YORK TIMES bag slung over his chest and is tossing copies of 
               the paper. One of them lands on Truman and Jack's stoop.

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - MORNING

               Phone RINGING. Truman asleep.

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, JACK'S TINY OFFICE - SAME TIME

               Jack is writing, longhand, at his desk. PHONE is ringing. 
               Jack notices that his door is slightly ajar. He kicks it 
               shut. The ringing is much quieter. He keeps writing.

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - SAME TIME

               Truman asleep. PHONE ringing. He wakes up, groggy, answers.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Hello.

               Pause.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Oh.
                              (no way out of this)

                         Mr. Smith, you're on the line.

               Now Truman's awake. We hear a series of CLICKS, then:

               Truman can't bring himself to speak.

                              the cradle, then:)

               Truman doesn't know what to say.

               We hear over the line a GUARD in the background:

               Perry and Dick being shackled, their belongings packed into

               with his STICK.

                                     GUARD

               INT. KSP, CONFINEMENT CELL - ONE WEEK LATER, NIGHT

               Perry lies alone on his cot. The DOOR opens, KRUTCH enters 
               with a GUARD.

                         Perry.

               Perry sits up. Krutch sits on the one chair. The Guard stands 
               by the door, takes out a PAD and STUBBY PENCIL.

                                     KRUTCH
                         You're allowed three names of people

               Krutch nods to the Guard who writes the name down. Krutch 
               waits, then:

                                     KRUTCH
                         Anybody else?

               Perry SHAKES HIS HEAD.

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

               In a chair near the window, Truman sits awake in his pajamas, 
               unable to sleep, completely unable to decide what to do. He 
               watches Jack sleep. A long time -- then Truman walks to the 
               closet, gets out a travel bag, starts to pack.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Truman sits next to William Shawn, who looks exhausted. The 
               STEWARDESS is approaching with the DRINKS CART. She collects 
               an empty BABY CUSTARD JAR from Truman's tray.

                         You want anything?

               Truman shakes his head.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Perry sits alone. The door opens and a Guard brings in his 
               LAST MEAL: three hot dogs, french fries, an ice cream sundae, 
               a strawberry soda. The Guard sets it down on the chair.

                                     PERRY
                         Thank you.
                              (then)
                         You sent the telegram to his hotel?

               Perry looks at the CLOCK on the wall: it's after 8pm.

                                     PERRY
                         May I make a phone call?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PHONE ringing. The CLOCK rads 8:55pm. Empty drinks glasses, 
               a custard jar. Truman lies curled in a fetal position on the 
               BED. Shawn walks the floor, exasperated.

                         That's him again.

               Truman is immobile. Phone still rings.

                         We've never even met. It is utterly 
                         inappropriate for me to be talking 
                         to him.

               Shawn gives up, PICKS UP the phone.

               INT. KSP, CONFINEMENT CELL - NIGHT

               Krutch and Guard enter Perry's cell. Perry hasn't touched 
               his meal.

                                     KRUTCH
                         You got a telex.

               Perry nods. Krutch reads:

                         "Perry. Unable to visit today because

                         It's not true, is it?

               Krutch hesitates a moment, then SHAKES his head.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INTERCUT with William Shawn on the phone in Truman's hotel 
               room. A TELEGRAM lies on the DESK. Truman lies on the bed.

                         need to speak to him.

               Shawn, terrifically uncomfortable, walks over to Truman and 
               holds the phone out to him.

               A moment, then Truman takes the phone. On Truman's face. We 
               hear, through the receiver, Nelle:

               Guard checks through the SMALL WINDOW in the door, then 
               approaches Perry, places a STICK OF GUM in Perry's mouth.

               pocket of his jacket. Krutch approaches.

               back, then looks to Truman who seems upset.

               HEADLIGHTS, then a PRISON CAR enters, stops. Dick is extracted 
               from the back seat. He stands, looks at the CROWD, then at 
               the GALLOWS. The Guards nudge him forward.

               INT. KSP, HOLDING CELL - A FEW MINUTES LATER

               CLOCK reads 12:05pm. Perry sits alone looking at his hands. 
               We HEAR A TRAP DOOR SPRING and CLATTER. Perry looks up.

               INT. PRISON CAR - NIGHT

               Light rain outside. Perry in the back seat being driven across 
               the yard. He looks out his window, sees a PICKUP TRUCK drive 
               out of the Corner Warehouse. On it: a BODY covered by a BLACK 
               CLOTH.

               INT. CORNER WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               The PRISON CAR enters, stops. Perry is removed from the back 
               seat. He stands, looks at the assembled men, looks at Truman. 
               He's nudged forward. As he passes DEWEY, he extends his hand:

                                     PERRY
                         Nice to see you.

               Dewey is caught off-guard so shakes his hand. Perry is led 
               to the base of the gallows.

                                     KRUTCH
                         Perry Edward Smith.
                              (reads)
                         "For the crime of murder in the first 
                         degree, by order of the Court of 
                         Finney County and the Supreme Court 
                         of the sovereign State of Kansas, 
                         you are sentenced to hang until you 
                         die."
                              (then)
                         You can say something if you want.

                                     PERRY
                              (quietly, to Krutch)
                         Is there anybody from the family 
                         here?

                                     KRUTCH
                         No.

               Perry is disappointed by this information.

                                     PERRY
                         Well. Tell them...
                              (he look out at 
                              everyone)
                         I can't remember what I was going to 
                         say for the life of me...

               He stops. Several moments.

               Krutch can't tell if he's done. Finally, Krutch nods to the 
               Guard. Perry is led up the STEPS. The Chaplain follows.

                                     CHAPLAIN
                         Though I walk through the valley of 
                         the shadow of death, I will fear no 
                         evil, for thou art with me.

               The Executioner puts the NOOSE around Perry's neck. Perry 
               chews his gum. Executioner opens a BLACK CLOTH SACK.

               Perry looks at the Chaplain reading prayers, looks at the 
               crowd, at Truman.

                                     CHAPLAIN
                         Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort 
                         me.

               The BLACK SACK goes over Perry's head. Truman watches. He 
               stands next to Alvin Dewey.

                                     CHAPLAIN
                         Thou preparest a table before me in 
                         the presence of mine enemies. Thou 
                         annointest my head with oil.

               The Executioner pulls the handle, Perry drops.

                                     CHAPLAIN
                         My cup runneth over.

               On Truman. Then a WIDE SHOT of the inside of the Warehouse: 
               twenty men watching Perry Smith hang, the Chaplain reading.

                                                                  FADE OUT.

               OVER BLACK:

               The SOUND of a TELEPHONE RINGING, as heard through the 
               receiver. We HEAR the CLICK of the phone being PICKED UP, 
               then, after a moment, a VOICE:

                                     NELLE
                         Hello.

               FADE UP:

               INT. HOTEL ROOM, KANSAS CITY - EARLY MORNING

               Truman sits on the edge of the bed in his WET OVERCOAT, as 
               if he'd walked in the rain.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Someday I'll tell you about it. For 
                         the moment, I'm too shattered.

               Pause.

                                     NELLE
                         They're dead, Truman. You're alive.

                                     TRUMAN
                         It was a terrible experience and I 
                         will never get over it.
                              (then)
                         There wasn't anything I could have 
                         done to save them.

               We hear Nelle light a cigarette.

                                     NELLE
                         Maybe not.

               We hear her exhale slowly.

                                     NELLE
                         But the fact is, you didn't want to.

               On Truman,

                                                                  FADE OUT.

               FADE IN: BRIGHT WHITE. AIRPLANE NOISE. COLORS RESOLVE INTO:

               INT. FIRST CLASS SECTION, AIRPLANE - DAY

               Truman, seated on the aisle, next to William Shawn. After a 
               long silence, he extracts from his leather briefcase a PACKAGE 
               wrapped in BROWN PAPER. Hands it to Truman.

                                     SHAWN
                         It came to the hotel this morning. I 
                         told them I'd give it to you.

               The package says KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY and is addressed 
               to Truman. Truman opens it.

               He takes out PERRY'S NOTEBOOKS -- the DIARY and PERSONAL 
               DICTIONARY. He opens the Diary. Toward the end, he finds 
               Perry's final entry. He READS silently. We hear Perry's VOICE:

                                     PERRY (V.O.)
                         Did we not know we were to die, we 
                         would be children. By knowing it, we 
                         are given the opportunity to mature 
                         in spirit...

               Truman turns the page. It's BLANK. He closes the Diary.

               We CONTINUE to hear Perry's VOICE as Truman takes out a 
               SNAPSHOT -- the one of Perry (at age 3) and Linda splashing 
               in the puddle.

                                     PERRY (V.O.)
                         Some take that opportunity. I hope I 
                         have...

               Truman takes out a PENCIL DRAWING Perry did of him. It's 
               very good, though Truman looks old and weary in it.

                                     PERRY
                         Life is only the father of wisdom. 
                         Death is the mother.

               Truman finds, at the bottom of the package, his TIE. He takes 
               it out, clutches it.

               Truman grasps for William Shawn's HAND, finds it, holds on 
               tightly. Shawn sits stoically, hoping no one will notice.

               The CAMERA pulls back, up the aisle. Truman clutches the 
               tie, and holds on to Shawn's hand, for dear life.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK.

               TITLE UP: (each title fades up in succession)

               In Cold Blood made Truman Capote the most famous writer in 
               America.

               He never finished another book.

               The epigraph he chose for his last published work reads: 
               "More tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered 
               ones. "

               He died in 1984 of complications due to alcoholism.

                                               THIRD DRAFT

                                               March 13, 1998




FADE IN:

EXT.  MARFA, TEXAS - 1993 - WIDE - DAY

The Texas plains, horizon to horizon, nothing but the browns
and ochres of earth and the blue and violet of the sky.  The
sheer scope of it sinks in:  the blank slate of nature, the
absence of man.  On the screen superimpose:

                    MARFA, TEXAS, 1993.

CREDITS BEGIN.

A plume of dust comes into frame.  The dust is from a TRUCK,
orange and white and violet, with "FedEx" blazoned across the
side.

The truck turns into a collection of ramshackle World War II
era Quonset huts and outbuildings.  Around the outbuildings
are large sculptures of wood and metal.

EXT.  QUONSET HUT - DAY

The door is opened by a WOMAN in her late twenties.  Hair
pulled back, casual, an artist.  She hands the DRIVER a FedEx
BOX which is decorated with a drawing of two ANGEL WINGS.
The Driver has a hand-held computer; a portable printer
dangles from his belt.

The Driver scans the package with his hand-held computer,
prints out a label and sticks it on the Box, ready to go.
But something on the box catches her eye.  She wants it back.
He glances at his watch.  She draws RINGS around the Wings,
uniting them.  She gives the box to the Driver, then hands
him a cup of coffee.  They've done this before.

He takes a sip of the coffee, then runs for the truck.  He
jumps in and heads back onto the plains.

EXT.  FEDEX OFFICE - MIDLAND/ODESSA - NIGHT - HOURS LATER

The Driver jams the distinctive Angel Wing Box on top of a
dolly and loads it into a CONTAINER with clear plastic sides.
A female Loader slaps a large bar code label on the
container, scans it, then pulls the container across a belt
of rollers onto a larger truck.  The doors of the truck
close.  The latch slams down.

A forklift hoists the container to the cargo doors of a 737.

EXT.  MEMPHIS AIRPORT SUPERHUB - NIGHT

The 737 lands.

EXT.  SUPERHUB - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

One of a seemingly endless line of FedEx planes, our 737
taxis to a gate at the FedEx SUPERHUB.  The Hub is a vast
living organism -- loud, complex, overwhelming, as much a
symbol of modern life as was the factory in Modern Times.

Five thousand people work in a frenzy of interconnected
activity inside three vast hangers brightly lit.  Hundreds of
forklifts and cargo-pullers dart about, their headlights
crisscrossing like a laser show.

Loaders quickly roll the container onto a FORKLIFT.

INT.  MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - NIGHT

The forklift speeds inside one of the hangers to a LOADING
BELT, where our Box is spilled into a Mississippi River of
packages, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of them, all shapes and
sizes, from shoe boxes to engine blocks.  Large mechanical
arms divert the immense flow of Workers at dozens of
stations.  The packages surge and move.

The Workers place the packages label-side-up on new belts,
where they're scanned by laser readers.  Picking up speed our
Box is shunted across the acres of interlocking belts.

The Box ends up in a much larger CONTAINER labeled CDG.

EXT.  MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - NIGHT

A forklift lifts the Container to a door on a giant MD-11.

INT.  GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT

A jumbled room jammed with computers and dominated by a HUGE
WALL GRAPHIC that charts hundreds of airplanes.  An Operator
moves a yellow strip labeled Jumbo 12 across the board.

EXT.  CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - DAY

SERIES OF SHOTS

The giant place touches down in Paris.  The Angel Wing Box
moves quickly on another belt and disappears into another
CONTAINER, which is loaded onto still another AIRPLANE.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG AIRPORT, RUSSIA - NIGHT

The plane lands.  The container is unloaded down a belt.  We
see our Angel Box.  Directly in front of it is a DENTED BOX.

INT.  ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICE, RUSSIA

SERIES OF SHOTS

Night.  The manic activity has come to a dead stop.  Our two
Boxes sit on a table in a corner not far from a small
Christmas tree.

Daylight now.  YURI, a Supervisor, saunters over, picks up
the Angel Box, sees an attractive co-worker, puts it down.

Night again.  A cat walks by the table where our two Boxes
have come to rest.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICE - DAY

A FedEx truck pulls out of the warehouse.  The walls of the
warehouse are covered with graffiti.  The streets are slushy,
the buildings blanketed in snow.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG - DAY

The Driver sits in the truck drinking tea.  He takes a last
sip, sighs, gets out with the Angel Box.  Walks slowly toward
an APARTMENT HOUSE.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG APARTMENT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

A beautiful young RUSSIAN WOMAN opens the door.  A young
AMERICAN MAN comes up behind her, signs the form and takes
the Angel Box.  We see Christmas decorations inside.  The
woman puts her arms around him as the door closes.

                     RUSSIAN WOMAN (O.S.)
               (accented English)
          It's pretty.  Who is it from?

                     AMERICAN MAN (O.S.)
          My wife.

We stay with the Driver as he ambles back toward the truck.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

The Driver has just delivered the Dented Box to ALEKSEI,
Russian Businessman, who closes the door of a Czarist-era
building.  Aleksei checks his watch, picks up the phone.

EXT.  FEDEX OFFICES - MANILA - DAY

CHUCK NOLAND, early thirties, walks along a line of brightly
colored jitneys, each bearing the FedEx logo.  With him is a
Filipino FedEx SUPERVISOR wearing a guayabera.  Chuck
glistens with a thin layer of sweat.

                     CHUCK
          My guess is we're talking fuel filters
          here, Fernando.  The gas is dirty, these
          jitneys get in the mountains, their
          engines cut out.

                     FERNANDO
          That could lose us half an hour.

                     CHUCK
          Easy.  Each way.

His beeper goes off.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - MANILA - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck is on the phone.

                     CHUCK
          So it finally turned up...

Chuck hesitates for a moment, then looks at his watch.

                     CHUCK
          I'll catch the sweep tonight.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

Strapped into the jump seat behind the pilots, Chuck sleeps
with a mask over his eyes.  On his lap are some travel
brochures.  We see sailboats, we see the Florida keys.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICES - DAY

Christmas in Russia.  Snow everywhere.  Brightly colored
lights.  Chucks gets out of a Volga with Aleksei.  He has a
bag over his shoulder, the dented package under one arm.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - DAY

The staff has assembled near the loading dock.  Yuri the
station manager stands in front, occasionally catching the
eye of the attractive woman.  Chuck displays the FedEx box.

                     CHUCK
          It took this test package thirty-two
          hours to get from Seattle to St.
          Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand
          miles.  And then it took forty-one hours
          to get from our warehouse in St.
          Petersburg to here, a distance of,
          what --

                     ALEKSEI
          Six kilometers.  Four miles.

                     CHUCK
          So how are we going to get this place
          shaped up?

There's a muttered chorus of answers.

                     CHUCK
          There's only one way.  We have to work
          together.  Every one of us depends on
          everyone else.  If one package is late,
          we are all late.  If one truck misses the
          deadline, we all miss the deadline.
          Let's start by taking a look around.

Chuck leads his team through the sorting area.  Yuri squeezes
right next to him, ostentatiously carrying a clipboard.
Chuck stops.

                     CHUCK
          Here, this table is too far from the
          wall.  Packages can slip down...like...
               (pulls out a package from
                behind a table)
          ...this.

He hefts the package, as if trying to guess what's inside.

                     CHUCK
          What could be in here?  Let's say one of
          you sent it.  Could be the closing papers
          on your dacha, could be a toy for your
          grandson's birthday, could be a kidney to
          keep your mother alive.  I don't think
          you want your mother's kidney to end up
          behind a table.

The Sorter shoves the table against the wall.  Yuri says
something to the Translator.

                     TRANSLATOR
          He says they have been very busy.  It is
          hard to get good employees.  He is sure
          you understand.

Wrong answer:  Chuck glances sharply at Yuri.  Aleksei
appears with a cellular phone.

                     ALEKSEI
          Phone call.  Malaysia.

Chuck takes the phone, opening his BAG as he does so.

                     CHUCK
          Kamal?  Right.  I'm getting them.

He pulls out a set of blueprints and tacks them to a bulletin
board as he talks.

                     CHUCK
          I'm looking at the blueprints of K.L.
          right now.  The belts are too small for
          the sorters.  Yeah, sometimes you never
          see what's right in front of your face.
          Look, it's --

Chuck keeps an eye on what is going on in the warehouse.
Then he notices something over by one of the trucks.

                     CHUCK
               (to a loader)
          Hold it!  Hazardous material needs its
          own container!
               (back on the phone)
          -- three in the afternoon there, right?
          That gives you five hours until the sweep
          comes through.  Do the sort by hand
          tonight, then put in a new feeder belt,
          say a twenty-four incher.  Yes, overtime
          is authorized.

He hangs up the phone.  He turns to the crew.

                     CHUCK
          I'm going out on every route, I'm going
          to work every job here, until I know
          enough to help you.  That's it.

The crew disperses back to work.  Chuck and Aleksei walk
toward the office.  They've done this before.  Chuck lets a
corner of his command persona slip.

                     ALEKSEI
          It's bad.

                     CHUCK
          Worse than Warsaw.

                     ALEKSEI
          Nobody remembers that.

                     CHUCK
          The failures they remember.  It's the
          successes they forget.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

A FedEx truck pulls out of the FedEx office.  Chuck is
inside.  He notices the graffiti on the walls.

INT.  TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck rides next to LEV, the driver, a serious sort.  The
Translator squats on some boxes between them, trying to keep
his balance.

                     CHUCK
          You sorted your packages before you left.
          None of the other drivers did.

The Translator and Lev exchange a few words.

                     TRANSLATOR
          He says he wants to be organized.  Do
          packages in order.

Chuck looks at Lev with respect.  Right answer.

                     CHUCK
          So how come the other drivers haven't
          left yet?

The Translator asks Lev, who looks at him as if he is crazy,
then snorts an answer.  The Translator blushes.

                     TRANSLATOR
          He says -- he is a very rude fellow --

                     CHUCK
          Tell me exactly what he said.

                     TRANSLATOR
          He says why don't his farts smell sweet?

Chuck grins.  Lev shrugs and says something else.

                     TRANSLATOR
          He says that's just the way it is.

                     CHUCK
          Lev -- it's Lev, right?  Listen, this is
          FedEx.  We don't have to accept the way
          it is.

EXT.  HOTEL - ST. PETERSBURG

A weary Chuck enters the hotel.  In the sky above him we see
the Northern Lights.  He doesn't even look up.

INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - LATER

Chuck is watching CNN on the television, working his
PowerBook, and holding the phone.

                     CHUCK
          No, keep trying.  A circuit's bound to
          open up.

He hangs up.

                     CHUCK
               (to himself)
          Those damn Northern Lights.

Just then the lights go off.  For a moment everything is
darkness.  Then a small light switches on.  Chuck has a
headlamp on.

He gets up, heads into the bathroom.  We stay in the bedroom.
After only a moment, the light reemerges.  It heads over to
his bag.  We go with it.

Chuck takes out a roll of toilet paper.  The guy is prepared
for anything.  He goes into the bathroom, closes the door.

The lights come back on just as the phone rings.

We hear scuffling sounds on the other side of the door.
Chuck charges out, holding up his pants.

Grabs the phone.

                     CHUCK
          Hello?  Great.  Try it.

He waits.  We hear an ANSWERING MACHINE.

                     KELLY (V.O.)
          This is Kelly, leave me a message and
          I'll call you back soon as I can.

This is not what Chuck wanted to hear.

                     CHUCK
          Kelly, damn, look, this is Chuck.  I'm
          going to be a little late.  Well, more
          than a little.  I had to go to Russia.
          Couldn't be helped.  Could you call and
          cancel the trip?  Look, we'll sail the
          Keys in March.  It's better then anyway.
          I'll be back before Christmas.  I
          promise.  I think.  I mean, I will.  I,
          uh --

He's stumbling over whether to say I love you.

                     CHUCK
          I miss you.

He gently hangs up the phone.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG - SERIES OF SHOTS

A surprised Yuri stands with the attractive assistant as
Chuck takes his clipboard away.

An even more surprised Lev stands by his truck as Chuck hands
the clipboard to him.

Chuck and the loaders clean off the graffiti.

Working alongside the sorters as the packages come in, Chuck
points out how to organize the inflow.

Chuck and Lev go over large maps of St. Petersburg with the
drivers.

INT.  FEDEX WAREHOUSE - ST. PETERSBURG - WEEK LATER

A big semi is being loaded with outgoing packages for the
airport run.  Aleksei, Chuck, Lev and the office executives
watch as containers are rolled on.

                     LEV
          We've never got all the trucks in on
          time.  Never.

Chucks looks at the clock.

                     CHUCK
          Only one still left?

                     LEV
          Route six.

Aleksei points at the big semi.

                     ALEKSEI
          If we don't send it now we may miss the
          connection in Paris.

The pressure in on.  Chuck looks around at his team.

                     CHUCK
               (to Aleksei)
          Give it five minutes.

EXT.  FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG - MINUTES LATER

The last truck rolls in.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG

The last truck enters and loading dock.  A few loaders move
toward it.  The executives all stand and watch.  But not
Chuck.  He's hands on.

                     CHUCK
          Let's go.

He heads toward the truck and begins pulling off packages.
All the other executives follow him.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG - MINUTES LATER

Led by Chuck, who works like a man possessed, they sort the
packages.

                     CHUCK
          That's Bermuda.  Bermuda is in the
          Memphis thru container.  No, Azores is
          Europe.

He gestures at a closed container.

                     CHUCK
          The Paris container.  Africa too.  Japan
          goes to Memphis.

Chuck is everywhere, setting the example.  The whole office
is energized, working together.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG - MINUTES LATER

They load the last container on the waiting truck.  Chuck
pounds the truck on the side.  Go.

The truck roars out of the loading dock.

Everyone takes a breath.  They are happy, proud.

                     LEV
          We did it.  All of them.

                     CHUCK
          Great job, everyone.  Remember, work
          together.  We are like a hand...

They've heard this before.  Lev holds up his hand just before
Chuck does.

                     LEV
          One finger, weak.  All fingers working
          together, strong.

This makes Chuck smile.

                     CHUCK
          You got it.

EXT.  CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - DAY

A FedEx MD-11 is being loaded with huge containers of
freight.  Chuck goes up the gangway next to the forklifts.

INT.  MD-11 - MOMENTS LATER

The pilots -- JACK and GWEN -- are going down their check
lists.  Chuck sticks his head in the cockpit.

                     CHUCK
          I absolutely, positively, have to get to
          Memphis overnight.

                     JACK
          Can't help you.  Try UPS.

                     CHUCK
          Jack -- gotta be something wrong with our
          physicals, you keep getting certified to
          fly.  Gwen, aren't you worried?

                     GWEN
          Terrified.

                     CHUCK
          We're on time, right?

                     JACK
          On time, Chuck.

Chuck hands Jack and Gwen small packages.

                     CHUCK
          Little present from the emerging
          republics.

Another FedEx Road Warrior named STAN gets on.  He and Chuck
are obviously old hands at this.

                     CHUCK
          What connects the world?  What makes it
          one?
               (they ignore him)
          We do.  FedEx.

                     GWEN
          You are such a lifer.

                     STAN
          What do you expect, from the guy who
          stole a kid's bicycle when his truck
          broke down?

                     CHUCK
          Borrowed.  I borrowed it.

The two of them strap in.

                     STAN
          How'd it go?

                     CHUCK
          Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one
          for a change.

He's finished a tough job.  He's relaxed and on his way home.
But Stan's his boss, and Stan's got bad news.

                     STAN
          I had to bump your plane last night.

Chuck can't believe it.

                     CHUCK
          You what?

                     STAN
          It was fifteen minutes late.

The plane begins to taxi.

                     CHUCK
          I checked the weather, you had the jet
          stream, you could have made it up.

                     STAN
          But I might not have.

                     CHUCK
          Jesus.  I got it working... You have no
          idea how hard it was... They're finally a
          team...

                     STAN
          I'm touched.

                     CHUCK
          You fucked us over.

                     STAN
          The point of FedEx, as I understand it,
          is to make the damn connection.

                     CHUCK
          I was making a point.

                     STAN
          What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let
          Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody
          down the line clean up your mess?

                     CHUCK
          Every person counts, every package
          counts, that's my point.

                     STAN
          You know what your problem is?  You just
          see the packages in front of you.  You
          don't see the big picture.

                     CHUCK
          Baloney.  I do see the damn "big
          picture."

EXT.  CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - NIGHT

The MD-11 takes off.

INT.  MD-11 - NIGHT

Chuck is focused on his PowerBook with the screen away from
us, Stan is doing tai chi amidst the FedEx containers.  It
feels a little surreal, all those containers surrounding
them.

Stan comes over, looks at the image on the computer.  It's a
sailboat with some technical specifications under it.

                     STAN
          I didn't know we had sailboats.

                     CHUCK
          It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.

                     STAN
          For all those vacation days you got
          coming.

Chuck doesn't look up.

                     CHUCK
          And never take.

                     STAN
          Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I
          couldn't risk being late into Memphis.

                     CHUCK
          Forget it.

                     STAN
          You know General McLelland, he wouldn't
          attack unless he had everything just
          right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him
          and said, General, if you're not going to
          use my army, could I borrow it for a
          while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant
          just said, let's go.

                     CHUCK
          I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with
          Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay
          attention.

                     STAN
          We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've
          got to be bold.  You always want all your
          ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100
          percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49.
          Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the
          dice.

                     CHUCK
          That's why you're a gambling man.

                     STAN
          That's why I'm running foreign and you're
          not.  That's why you're not married and I
          am.

                     CHUCK
          For the third time.

                     STAN
          Take the plunge, admit your mistakes,
          move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx,
          that's women, that's life.

Stan is so outrageous, Chuck can't help but laugh.

                     CHUCK
          You are one sick fucker.

                     STAN
          I'm trying to help you here.  There's
          Warsaw, there's this --

                     CHUCK
          This was nothing like Warsaw.  I held the
          truck then minutes, it's not that big a
          deal.

But apparently it is.

                     STAN
          Look, that kids' bike, that's a guy
          who'll do what it takes to get there on
          time.  Live up to your legend, that's all
          I'm saying.

Chuck reaches in his pocket, pulls out a bill.

                     CHUCK
          A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95
          percent in a month.

                     STAN
          Ninety five percent?  Just give me the
          money now.

                     CHUCK
          Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?

                     STAN
          We're on.

Chuck closes the PowerBook.

                     CHUCK
          Let's go off-line.

They both take out their Valium -- the price they pay for
being such road warriors.

                     CHUCK
          Two Valium...

Stan puts on his Walkman.

                     STAN
          And the Stones.  Got to be.

It's their ritual.  Chuck puts headphones from his Walkman
over his ears, puts a mask over his eyes and leans his head
back onto the headrest.  We hear the Rolling Stones.

EXT.  MEMPHIS AIRPORT - NIGHT - WIDE

The MD-11 arrives at its gate.  The cargo doors open.
Forklifts and a gangway roll up to the side.

INT.  MD-11 - NIGHT

Stan stands smiling over Chuck.

                     STAN
          Chuck.  Wake up Chuck.

Chuck pulls off the mask, takes out the earplugs.  He manages
a groggy grin.

                     STAN
          You gotta do your own delivery from here.

INT.  SUPERHUB - NIGHT

Chuck walks through the extraordinary nexus of speeding
packages that intersect in intricate paths above and around
him.  This is the beating center of the FedEx world, the
crossroads, the deep core where everything connects.  In his
still-drugged state it all seems weirdly psychedelic.  A
Christmas tree goes by, then a huge plastic Santa Claus, both
with shipping labels.

EXT.  CHICKASAW GARDENS - MEMPHIS - NIGHT

Chuck's car pulls into the driveway of a small cottage in an
older Memphis neighborhood.  The radio is playing the news.

INT.  CHUCK'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck drops his briefcase and his bag.  The place is a jumble
of clothes, papers, books, etc.  In the living room is a tank
of tropical fish.  The water looks a little green.  No
bubbles are coming from the filter.

Uh oh.

Chuck walks to the tank.  He tightens a piece of tape that
holds the power cord onto the filter, taps the filter with
his finger, once, twice...the bubbles start again.

                     CHUCK
          Damn thing.

But for a couple of fish floating on top of the tank it's too
late.

Chuck gets out his scoop and slowly skims them off.

                     CHUCK
          Sorry, I'm really sorry.

EXT.  CHUCK'S HOUSE - BACK YARD

Chuck digs a small hole in the back yard with a large kitchen
spoon.

Drops the dead fish in.

Fills the hole.

INT.  CHUCK'S HOUSE - LATER

The CD is playing.  Chuck lies in bed, switches on the TV.
This is no good.  He doesn't care how late it is, he's going
to find Kelly.

EXT.  MEMPHIS - NIGHT - LATER

Chuck drives in his car through the streets of Memphis.

EXT.  UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

Chuck pulls up to a lab building at Memphis State.

INT.  LAB - NIGHT

Two doctoral candidates are playing Doom on their computers
when Chuck walks in.

                     CHUCK
          You seen Kelly Frears?

One of them gestures toward a door.

                     GUY
          Xerox machine.

INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

Chuck makes his way in the semi-darkness past rack after rack
of specimens in bottles.

Ahead of him we see the flashing green light of a Xerox
machine.

INT.  XEROX ROOM

The light goes off.  KELLY leans over the machine, bangs on
it.

                     KELLY
          Sonofabitch!

                     CHUCK
          Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.

Surprised, Kelly turns to greet Chuck.

                     KELLY
          Chuck!  You're back!

She leaps into his arms.

                     KELLY
          Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium
          again?

                     CHUCK
          You smell like formaldehyde.

Kelly looks over at the Xerox.

                     KELLY
          My last chapter's in there, and the damn
          machine's jammed.

                     CHUCK
          Let's take a look.

He lifts up the cover.

                     KELLY
          How was Russia?

                     CHUCK
          Cold.

                     KELLY
          Don't overwhelm me with details, you know
          how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?

                     CHUCK
          I thought I did.

He pries up one feeder, then another.

                     CHUCK
          Got to follow the paper path here.

                     KELLY
          Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia
          didn't turn out well?

But Chuck doesn't want to talk.  He's focused on the machine.

                     CHUCK
          Used to you could fix these yourself.

She pulls him out of the machine.  He has toner on his
fingers.

                     KELLY
          Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          What do you want me to say?  That I
          thought I'd done a great job but it all
          turned to shit?  That I might as well
          have gone sailing for all the good I did?

                     KELLY
          Yeah, tell me.  Tell me all of it.

He suddenly looks really tired.

                     KELLY
          You don't even know what time it is.
          What day it is.

He turns to the Xerox in frustration.

                     CHUCK
          And I can't fix this damn machine.

She looks at him.

                     KELLY
          Come on.

INT.  KELLY'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

A tiny cubicle with a door.  She closes it, takes some paper
towels out of the desk, wipes his fingers.

                     KELLY
          We're on the deck of the ketch, the air's
          soft, the water's clear as crystal...

She licks the last bit of toner off his fingers.

                     CHUCK
          That's carcinogenic.

She ignores that, stays with the fantasy.

                     KELLY
          We're covered with suntan lotion and
          sweat.  Our skin is so hot, it's
          glowing...

And she comes closer to him.

                     KELLY
          We could take a swim.

She's really close now.

                     CHUCK
          On the other hand we could not take a
          swim...

They squiggle themselves onto the desk.

INT.  LAB - NIGHT

Someone kicks the door shut.  Now the figures are in
silhouette, lit by the light in the office.

And then the light goes out.

EXT.  FEDEX OFFICES - NEXT MORNING

A nondescript office park near the airport.  No sign.
Chuck's car screeches into the parking lot.  He jumps out,
glances at this watch, and heads for the building at a run.

INT.  EXECUTIVE CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

A large room dominated by an animated MAP OF THE WORLD.
Lights at various locations blink and flash.  Above the map
are a large Sign saying "Here Today, Gone Tomorrow" and two
huge digital Clocks -- one keeping time, the other a
countdown clock for that day's package sort at the SuperHub.

The operations team of FedEx sits around a large table.  Each
has on a headset.  BECCA TWIGG, the business-like senior vice
president of Operations, addresses questions to a man --
COLIN PARKER-BOWLES, the European operations manager -- on a
LARGE TV SCREEN in front of her.  "London" is superimposed on
the screen.

                     BECCA
          So why was Milan late, Colin?

                     COLIN
          One of the race horses coming from
          Ireland got colic and had to be off-
          loaded in Brussels.  That put the Jumbo
          15, six hours late into Charles De
          Gaulle.  Customs had difficulty locating
          the dutiable items...

Colin continues as Chuck, out of breath, slips under the
screen and heads for the one remaining vacant seat -- across
from Stan.  Next to Stan is MAYNARD GRAHAM, an MBA systems
man.  Becca addresses a question over to Stan.

                     BECCA
          Stan, can we get P&A down to work with
          Milan customs?

                     STAN
          We're already on it.

                     BECCA
          Good.  And let's look at our live animal
          policy.  I don't think the income stream
          justifies delaying IP product, especially
          at Christmas.

Colin disappears.  A red light goes on.  Becca pushes a
button.  Another face comes on the screen.  "Oakland" appears
under the face.

                     BECCA
          Stand by, Benson, we're still wrapping up
          foreign.

She turns pointedly to Chuck.

                     BECCA
          Chuck, thanks for joining us.  Status?

Chuck swallows nervously, tries to talk matter-of-factly.

                     CHUCK
          Becca, as you know St. Petersburg was
          consistently running late by six to ten
          hours -- sometimes a full day or more.  I
          replaced the station manager.  We
          identified inefficiencies and worked out
          a quality improvement plan I believe can
          be met.

                     MAYNARD
          You replaced the station manager with a
          driver.  A local with no knowledge of our
          systems.

                     BECCA
          Shouldn't you have brought in someone
          from Memphis?  Russia is priority one.

                     MAYNARD
          James Pottinger is available.

The process is being ripped out of Chuck's hands.  He
struggles to get an answer.

                     STAN
          He's a numbers cruncher.  Chuck's done
          all the right things here...

Stan is doing his best to back up Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          Jim's a terrific financial man, no
          question.  But we can't always parachute
          in from Memphis.  We've got to build up
          our local staff.

                     MAYNARD
          We've got to improve foreign on-time,
          that's what we've got to do.  If this new
          guy's so good, how come the very first
          plane he sent missed the connection in
          Paris?

Maynard knows how to go for the jugular.  Everyone looks at
Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          We're building a new team here.  We got
          every package on the truck for the first
          time ever.  Success is the best teacher.

                     MAYNARD
          I don't call missing the plane a success.

Everyone looks at Chuck.

EXT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - DAY - LATE THAT AFTERNOON

Chuck lugs a big package up to the door, knocks on it.  Kelly
opens the door.

                     KELLY
          Merry Christmas eve.

                     CHUCK
          Not if you work for FedEx.

INT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - DAY

Chuck enters as they keep talking.  Her house is cozy but
also where she works.  There's a computer, specimen jars, and
some terrariums with frogs inside.  A Christmas tree with
packages under it.

                     KELLY
          You break four million packages last
          night?

In the b.g. one of the packages by the Christmas tree is
starting to shake on its own.

                     CHUCK
          Four four.  A record.

                     KELLY
          You don't seem too happy about it.

                     CHUCK
          Ah, the staff meeting could have gone
          better.

                     KELLY
          Let me guess, Russia came up?

Chuck's attention goes to the tree.

                     CHUCK
          One of those packages just moved.

The package turns over, something darts out.  It's a puppy,
with a bow around its neck.

                     KELLY
          Merry Christmas.

Chuck bends down to see the puppy.

                     CHUCK
          Hey, look at you.

                     KELLY
          I figure, if we could take care of a
          puppy, we could, you know, take care
          of --

A baby, she wants to say, but that's going a little fast so
she catches herself.  Chuck picks the puppy up.

                     CHUCK
          He is a cute thing.

                     KELLY
          He's your cute thing.

                     CHUCK
          I can't even keep fish alive.

                     KELLY
          A puppy's got a little more personality
          than a fish.

                     CHUCK
          And for you --

Chuck hands over his present.

                     KELLY
          So do good things come in large packages?

Kelly opens Chuck's present -- a very large box.

It's a piece of luggage.

                     CHUCK
          You know, for when you travel.

                     KELLY
          For when I travel?

She can't believe it.  It's the exact opposite of what she
wanted.

                     KELLY
          You should have got me something that
          shows you want us to be together, not
          apart.

Chuck is flummoxed.  Women read so much into things.

                     CHUCK
          I wasn't sending a message.  I though
          you'd like it.

Chuck's beeper goes off.

                     KELLY
          You should have got me a ring.

He checks the number.

                     CHUCK
          I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow
          down at the Hub.

                     KELLY
          A ring.  I wanted a ring.

                     CHUCK
          You did?

She nods.  What to do?

                     CHUCK
          Look, I love the puppy.  I love you.  But
          I have to go.

                     KELLY
          You can't go now.

                     CHUCK
          I have to.

                     KELLY
          You want to.

Chuck picks up the puppy.

                     CHUCK
          What should we call him?  Or is it her?
          How about Jango?

Kelly is having one of those moments when everything comes
clear.

                     KELLY
          This isn't working out.

                     CHUCK
          We're a little emotional here.  It's
          Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.

                     KELLY
          "We're" not over-reacting.

                     CHUCK
          Could you watch Jango?

                     KELLY
          No.

                     CHUCK
          I can't take him to work.

He hands her the puppy.

                     CHUCK
          We'll talk about it when I come back.
          It'll all be fine.  Really.

This is not a happy woman he is leaving behind.

EXT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - HOUSE LATER

It's dark now.  Chuck returns.  The stars are putting on an
amazing show, but he doesn't notice as he heads for the door.

INT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

Chuck enters.  The tree and the presents under it are gone.

                     CHUCK
          Kelly?  Kelly?

No answer, nothing but the sound of Jango, who begins yelping
in the kitchen.

INT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck picks up Jango, who is barricaded in the kitchen with
some food, some water, and some wet newspapers.

                     CHUCK
          There.  There.  Easy now.

EXT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

Holding Jango, Chuck walks out into the back yard.

                     CHUCK
          Kelly?

A fire still smolders.  The packages have burned.  The tree
is a blackened mess.

Chuck stares at it.

EXT.  CHUCK'S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING

Chuck gets into his car, puts Jango on the front seat next to
him.  Pulls out of the driveway.

EXT.  ARKANSAS HIGHWAY - DAY

Chuck is in his car, with the dog on his lap.

EXT.  FARM HOUSE - DAY

Chuck's car drives up to a typical Arkansas farm house.  His
MOM is setting some Christmas tree lights around the door.
Chuck gets out of the car.  There's a large wet spot on the
front of his pants.

                     MOM
          What happened to your pants?

                     CHUCK
          Mom, meet Jango.

Chuck displays the puppy.

EXT.  FARM HOUSE - SHED - DAY

Chuck works on an old tractor in the shed.  Some small legs
appear in his vision, then a small face.  This is AMANDA, his
niece.

                     AMANDA
          Dinner's ready.

INT.  FARM HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Around the table are Chuck's brother ROGER, his wife MARY,
Amanda, and her TWO BROTHERS.  Mom brings in the turkey,
places it on the table, sits down.  They all hold hands and
bow their heads.

                     MOM
          Chuck?

Chuck hesitates just a moment.

                     CHUCK
          Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts,
          which we are about to receive, from thou
          bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.

                     ROGER
          Let's eat.

EXT.  FARM HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY

The children burst out the door, shrieking, chased by Jango.

INT.  FARM HOUSE - DAY

The grown-ups are cleaning up after Christmas dinner.  The
scene moves between the table, the kitchen counter, and the
refrigerator.  It's an old-fashioned kitchen, simply
furnished.

                     MARY
          How's Kelly?

                     CHUCK
          Great.

                     ROGER
          Thought you were going to bring her.

                     CHUCK
          So did I.

                     MOM
          It seemed like she had such a good time
          last time.

                     CHUCK
          It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.

                     MARY
          Jennifer's still down at the post office.
          And she's still got that crush on you.

                     ROGER
          And she's still got those --

                     MARY
          Roger.

                     ROGER
          You should have stuck around.

This is an old, sore subject.

                     CHUCK
          Look, I help take care of the place.  You
          got my check, didn't you Mom?

                     MOM
          That new roof, that's your doing.

                     ROGER
          You're just allergic to farming, that's
          what dad said.  Can't stand to be alone.
          Can't stand to be in one place.  Can't
          stand the sight of...blood.

He drops the turkey giblets into the trash.

                     MARY
          Roger's going to put chickens in here.

Chuck can't believe this.

                     CHUCK
          Come on Roger, this is dad all over
          again.  You already did beefalo,
          chinchillas, and what was that, ostrich?
          They chased Mom around the yard, sprained
          her hip.

Mom goes to the freezer and takes out some frozen
strawberries.

                     MOM
          It wasn't that bad, dear.

                     MARY
          You can't make a living out of this
          place.  We tried.

                     CHUCK
          But chickens?

                     ROGER
          Sixty three pounds consumed per capita,
          up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to
          pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No
          religious taboos.  You don't see your
          Hindus and your Muslims boycotting
          poultry.

                     CHUCK
          True enough.  No sacred chickens nowhere,
          so far as I know.

                     MOM
          Roger's working at Tyson's now.

Mom mashes the block of frozen strawberries with a fork to
separate the strawberries from the ice.

                     CHUCK
          Really?

                     ROGER
          Come on down to the plant.  It's state of
          the art.  We're doing for chickens what
          FedEx did for the delivery business.

                     CHUCK
          Just don't count 'em before they hatch.

Roger grins at him.  This is just how they are.

                     ROGER
          I'll try to remember that.

                     MOM
          Dessert.

They all sit down.  Mom brings the slushy frozen strawberries
to the table, squirts on some Reddi-whip.  Looks pointedly at
Chuck.

                     MOM
          Speaking of hatching, I could sure use
          some more grandchildren.

Not a timely topic with Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          Mom, this is a farm.  We've got real
          strawberries growing outside, we've got
          real cream.

                     MOM
          Oh no, the prodigal son's home.  We bring
          out the store bought.

Chuck takes a bite, winces a little as the cold strawberries
hit his teeth.

EXT.  MOM'S HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY

Chuck fixes the drain pipe while Mom prunes the rose bushes
around the porch.

                     CHUCK
          Maybe I should take a few days off.
          Roger's working now, you could use some
          help around here...

                     MOM
          Don't you even think about it.

                     CHUCK
          The place is falling apart.

                     MOM
          I'm doing fine.

She looks pointedly at Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.

                     MOM
          There's settled folks, and there's
          nomads.  You're just not a settled folk.
          You never belonged here.

Chuck finishes the drain pipe.  Gives it a thunk with his
finger.

                     CHUCK
          Come on inside, Mom.  You've had a long
          day.

INT.  FARM HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

In his boyhood room, we see Chuck's laptop, which is hooked
up to the internet FedEx homepage.  All around him are models
of boats and planes, maps, pictures of far-off places.  The
room of a boy who always fantasized about getting away.

Chuck is beside it, slumped down on the desk.  Asleep.

EXT.  FARM HOUSE - DAY

His mom waves to him as Chuck drives away.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY

Chuck enters his office, on the go.  His assistant LESLIE is
waiting for him.

                     CHUCK
          I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.

                     LESLIE
          And how was your Christmas?

                     CHUCK
          Terrific.  Yours?

She nods, used to this.

                     CHUCK
          And get me in to the dentist.  My tooth's
          acting up.

Stan enters.

                     STAN
          Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten
          in operations.

                     CHUCK
          Right.
               (to Leslie)
          Get me everything on Indonesia, New
          Guinea, all the way to Australia.

INT.  OPERATIONS ROOM - MINUTES LATER

Chuck, Leslie, Stan and another executive from the meeting
named DICK are gathered around the TV screen.  A squawk box
is on the table.

                     CHUCK
          Kamal?  Kamal?  Can you hear us?

The box squawks.  The TV screen rolls an imperfect image.

                     DICK
          Can't we get this working?

A Technician is fiddling with the TV set.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Trying.

                     CHUCK
          Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear
          us?

                     VOICE (SQUAWK BOX)
          Kamal is not here.

                     CHUCK
          Who is this?  Where is Kamal?

                     VOICE (SQUAWK BOX)
          It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.

                     CHUCK
          What's going on down there?

                     VOICE (SQUAWK BOX)
          Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.

                     CHUCK
          Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?

The squawk box hums and crackles.  Nothing.  Chuck turns to
the Technician.

                     STAN
          We got Telex, e-mail?

                     TECHNICIAN
          Sure.  Just not getting any answers.

Chuck turns to Leslie.

                     CHUCK
          When's the next Jumbo?

                     LESLIE
          The regular flight is scheduled for oh
          three hundred tomorrow.

                     CHUCK
          Anything else?

                     LESLIE
          There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an
          hour, goes through Sydney.

                     STAN
          Maybe you should get your ducks lined up
          first.

Chuck looks over at Stan.

                     CHUCK
          Call Operations.  Get me on it.

And Stan is impressed.

EXT.  CHUCK'S HOUSE - DAY

Chuck leaves with his bag over his shoulder and the puppy
under his arm.

EXT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - DAY - MINUTES LATER

Kelly opens the door.  Chuck is there with the puppy.

                     KELLY
          That's your dog.

                     CHUCK
          It's our dog.  It belongs to us.

                     KELLY
          There isn't any us.

                     CHUCK
          Yes there is.

Kelly can't stay mad.

                     KELLY
          I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a
          little carried away.

                     CHUCK
          No, it was great.  Maybe a little
          overkill --

                     KELLY
          I burned the Christmas tree.

She's half-laughing, half-wanting-to-cry.

                     KELLY
          Why didn't you come over, get mad at me,
          tell me what a stupid bitch I was.

                     CHUCK
          I guess I hadn't thought through how I
          felt.

                     KELLY
          What, you were going to come over the
          next day all calm and say, Kelly that
          really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're
          mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.

                     CHUCK
          Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get
          back.

                     KELLY
          Don't even start.

And then it hits her.

                     KELLY
          Get back?  From where?

                     CHUCK
          Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.

She stares at him for a long moment, then at the puppy.

                     KELLY
          Give him to me.

He hands her the dog.

                     KELLY
          Chuck, you're breaking my heart.

                     CHUCK
          A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?

                     KELLY
          Go on.  We'll be fine.  I'll feed Jango
          to the frogs.

She kisses the puppy.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

Chuck enters the cockpit, where two different pilots are
going through their checklists.  Chuck repeats his familiar
patter.

                     CHUCK
          Al -- gotta be something wrong with our
          physicals, you keep getting certified to
          fly.  John, aren't you worried?

                     JOHN
          I disconnected his controls.  He only
          thinks he's flying.

Chuck settles into his seat.

                     CHUCK
          You're on your way home, Al?

Al has an Australian accent.

                     AL
          Right.  Down home, down under.

                     CHUCK
          We're on time, right?

                     AL
          On time, Chuck.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT - HOURS LATER

Settled into the jump seat, Chuck finishes up his notes on
his PowerBook and begins his flight ritual.

He puts in his ear plugs and takes out his Valium.  He
swallows one, then thinks, and swallows two more.  Then he
turns on his Walkman to the Rolling Stones, puts the mask
over his eyes, and, as usual, goes to sleep.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

The plane is SHAKING badly.  HEAR frantic, garbled radio
talk.  Chuck stirs, struggles to his feet, drowsy and
drugged.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - CHUCK'S POV

Everything is hazy, out of focus, as it was in his earlier
drugged condition.  But this is real haze.  SMOKE.  And the
cabin also TWISTS and TILTS.

Chuck tries to steady himself against the wall.  This is
nightmarish.  Is this really happening?

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - CHUCK'S POV - COCKPIT

The pilots wrestle with the controls.  They have their life
jackets on.  John glances back at Chuck, his face floating in
a cloud of fear.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck struggles to put on his life jacket.  The plane is
VIBRATING VIOLENTLY.  He can't get the straps straight.  He
is KNOCKED against one wall, then another, then to the floor.

Chuck tries to blow on the mouth tubes for his life jacket.
Can't do it!  Puff.  Puff.  Shit!  John motions frantically
for Chuck to pull on the automatic inflators on his jacket.
Chuck fumbles for them.

Huge palettes shift and groan, one BREAKS FREE, banging
violently against the side of the plane, spilling out its
boxes.  Then it swings and KNOCKS Chuck on the head!  He goes
down!

INT.  GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

A CONTROLLER mans the global operations desk.  His SUPERVISOR
stands behind him, sipping some coffee.  The mood is eerily
calm.  An assistant moves Plane Locator Cards on a giant
board.

                     CONTROLLER
          Jumbo 14 is overdue in Sector K.

                     SUPERVISOR
          Where are they?

Another CONTROLLER tracks a giant computer screen.

                     CONTROLLER 2
          Somewhere east of Port Moresby.  Guam is
          getting a signal but no location.  Maybe
          the GPS is out.

The signal flashes, but is strangely still compared to the
others, which are moving.

EXT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

The giant plane PLUMMETS down from the sky.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

Chuck is semi-conscious and bleeding from the head.  John
pulls the inflators on Chuck's life jacket, which fills with
a WHOOSH!, sending Chuck's arms out to the sides.  Al
struggles with the LIFE RAFT.  It's all blurred, frantic,
terrifying.

EXT.  PACIFIC - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

The plane hits the ocean with a CRASH and a WAVE of water.

INT.  GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

The Controller is speaking mechanically into the microphone.

                     CONTROLLER
          Guam, I need a fix on Jumbo 14.

EXT.  PACIFIC - NIGHT

Shrouded with fog and surrounded by debris, the tail of the
big plane slowly SINKS beneath the angry, storm-driven waves.

EXT.  PACIFIC - DAY

A life raft is tossed on dark, storm-driven seas.  Inside it,
semi-conscious, Chuck hangs on.

EXT.  PACIFIC - NIGHT

We catch glimpses of the yellow lift raft in the dark as the
storm continues.

EXT.  BEACH - EARLY MORNING

The storm has ended.  Waves lap gently on a beach cut like a
scallop out of a rocky shore.  On the beach we see scattered
FEDEX BOXES.  And we see, face-down, half-buried in sand, a
MAN IN A SUIT and a life jacket.

Chuck.

The tide gently rocks him, laps at his face.  He chokes.
Slowly he gets to his knees.  Vomits seawater, big heaves.
He rolls over, sits down.  Dazed.  Still confused.  Where am
I?  What happened?

Chuck's first instinct is to check the time.  He looks at his
watch, taps it in frustration.

Then he looks around, and we look with him.

CHUCK'S POV - BEACH

The fog has thinned.  We can see palm groves and mangrove
thickets leading back into a thickly wooded valley climbing
up a steep, rocky hillside.  The rocks on the opposite point
end in a barren ridge.  Clouds hide the top of the hill.

ON CHUCK

as he takes in his surroundings.  He licks his lips.  He's
thirsty.  But something he sees is even more important.  We
stay with him as he WALKS.  He comes to a FEDEX PACKAGE in
the sand, picks it up, brushes off the sand, walks farther.
He picks up another package.

EXT.  BEACH - WIDE

Chuck walks down the beach, picking up FedEx packages,
leaving a trail of footprints in the sand.  Ahead of him we
notice a package decorated with ANGEL WINGS.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT MORNING

Chuck has made a neat stack of FedEx boxes under some palm
trees at the rim of the beach.  He examines the Angel Wing
drawing with passing curiosity, then puts it on the stack.

Chuck takes off his life jacket, sits down in the shade,
makes himself comfortable, and waits.

EXT.  BEACH - SUNSET

Chuck is still waiting.  He's a systems man, and the system
isn't working.

                     CHUCK
          All right, guys.  I'm here.  Check the
          GPS, get moving.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

The full moon shines a ghostly light on the beach.  Trees
cast moon-shadows on the sand.  Chuck seems very, very alone.

We HEAR from the dark thickets a STRANGE NOISE.  Rustling in
the leaves.  Something crashing in the trees, or is it a
wave?  A jolt of adrenaline courses through Chuck's body.  He
lurches to his feet.

We HEAR the noises again.  Chuck edges toward the rocks at
the barb of the hook.  Keeping his eye on the thicket, he
bends down and picks up a stone.  His first weapon.

In the rocks he finds a piece of driftwood.  He picks it up
in his other hand.  He backs between two rocks and stands
facing the thicket, every sense alert.  A cloud passes over
the moon.  The shadow streaks across Chuck's anxious face.

EXT.  BEACH - MORNING

The morning TIDE is coming in.  We follow the tide as it laps
amidst the rocks and finds Chuck, staring out to sea.  The
empty sea.

                     CHUCK
          Where the fuck are you?

But now he is really thirsty.  We WALK with Chuck up the
beach.

Beneath the palms he sees a couple of coconuts.  He picks one
of them up and studies it.  It's heavy, almost the size of a
volleyball.  How to get in it?

He throws it down on a rock.  The coconut just bounces off.
He wedges the coconut between two rocks, then throws a rock
down on it.  It bounces off.  He throws down a bigger rock.
It smashes on the rocks and chips.  Chuck picks up the rock.
OW!  Where the rock had chipped the edge is sharp.  It cuts
him.

                     CHUCK
          Sonofabitch.

The blood stains the rock a bright red.  Chuck sucks on his
finger, then he gets an idea -- the same idea primitive man
first got when he discovered stone tools.

He picks up the rock, test the edge.  Sharp -- really sharp.
He throws another rock down, but it doesn't break.  He picks
up another rock and strikes the first one.  Then again,
harder.  And again.  A large flake shoots off.  This edge is
even sharper.

He has a knife.

OPENING THE COCONUT - SERIES OF SHOTS

Chuck uses the stone knife to saw at the coconut.  No luck.

Chuck clumsily sharpens a stick with the sharp rock.

Chuck brings the sharpened stick down hard on the coconut,
but the stick slides off, sending the coconut rolling away.

Chuck positions the stick, pointed end up, in a hole, then
SLAMS the coconut down hard on it.  Success!  The green nut
of the coconut splits.  The brown inner nut is free!  He
smashes the nut with a rock, but -- OW!  -- he hits his hand!
Chuck licks his fingers, but he is so thirsty there's no more
saliva.  He smashes again.  The shell breaks to smithereens.
Coconut milk splashes everywhere.

                     CHUCK
          That was smart, really smart.

Rotating a nut along its axis and carefully moving his
fingers out of the way, he SMASHES the nut again.  The shell
splits!  The precious liquid splashes out.  Left inside is a
swallow or two, which Chuck laps up eagerly.  The milky white
liquid dribbles down his face.

                     CHUCK
          Ahhh.

EXT.  BEACH - SUNRISE

Chuck squints at the ocean.  His sunburn is bad -- his lips
are cracked.  A stack of broken coconut shells is beside him.
No one's there -- again.

                     CHUCK
          Maybe the GPS malfunctioned.  That Korean
          airliner did.

Clouds scud in front of the sun.  Beyond the reef the waves
are high and churning.  Chuck can see them pound onto the
reef.

                     CHUCK
          Okay, do the math.  Maybe they know where
          you are within, say 500 miles.  That's a
          circle with an area of, uh, pi r squared.
          So, uh, 250,000 times three point one
          four, that's about 800,000 square miles.
          Three times the size of Texas.

This sinks in.  Then Chuck gets an idea.

                     CHUCK
          They could use a satellite.

But even that doesn't give him much hope.

                     CHUCK
          Say each satellite photo is 30 feet
          square, that's uh...fuck it...billions
          and billions of photos.

That sinks in.

                     CHUCK
          Aw, someone will come.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

Chuck sleeps by the coconuts.  The tide is coming in.  Chuck
stirs, gets up, staggers over to a palm tree to relieve
himself.

He stares idly out at the moonlight on the waves.  Then not
so idly.  Something's out there, something floating on the
tide.

                     CHUCK
          What the hell?

EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck splashes into the gentle surf, reaches the dark object.

It's a body.  Chuck turns it over.  It's Al, one of the
pilots, his face gray and waterlogged and very dead.

                     CHUCK
          Oh Jesus.

EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck drags the body up on the beach and then collapses,
exhausted.  He sits by it, staring at it.

                     CHUCK
          I'm so sorry, Al.  So sorry.

EXT.  BEACH - MORNING   

Chuck has almost finished a grave in the sand back of the
palm trees.  He's been digging with a piece of driftwood
sharpened with his stone knife.

He drags the body into the pit.  Stares down at it.  That
could be me.

                     CHUCK
          Got to cover Al up.

He wants to say more, can't.  He scoops some sand over the
body.

                     CHUCK
          Got to cover Al up.

He scoops in some more sand.  It's eerily like burying the
tropical fish in his back yard.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

With a rock Chuck hammers a crude driftwood marker into the
sand.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY

As Chuck sits on the beach, he half-sings, half-talks "Yellow
Submarine" very quietly to himself.

                     CHUCK
          We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow
          submarine...

He looks over at the deep woods and down to the rocky point.
Comes to a decision.  He takes a drink of coconut, picks up
his club and a coconut, sticks the stone knife in his pants.
He's ready to go.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck climbs over the rocks and disappears out of sight.
He's still half-singing to himself.

                     CHUCK
          Yellow submarine.  We all live in a
          yellow submarine...

EXT.  ISLAND - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck's way is blocked by rocks and jungle.  He hesitates.
He picks up a rock and THROWS IT to scare away all those bad
things.  It crashes into the ferns and palm trees.  He takes
a step into the jungle.

EXT.  JUNGLE - MINUTES LATER

Chuck struggles through a dense thicket beneath a jungle
canopy.  Vines and creepers reach out toward him.  There is
no path, nothing to show him where to go.

EXT.  JUNGLE - HALF HOUR LATER

Chuck climbs through a tangle of vines and ferns.  He takes a
drink from the coconut he is carrying.  The last drink.

                     CHUCK
          Bad idea.  Should have saved some.

He throws away the husk.  He looks up, but the only sunlight
reaching him is dappled from the canopy above him.

EXT.  ISLAND - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck emerges onto a ridge that leads to a summit.  He climbs
across a rocky lava field covered with scrub lichen and low
ferns, soil dark as coffee beans, his way crossed by steep
gullies that cut like dark fingers into the lava.

The lava field narrows, forcing Chuck closer to the sea.  He
passes a series of CAVES, their mouths dark and mysterious
and scary.  He gives them a wide berth.

EXT.  ISLAND - CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER

The land narrows to a ledge that stretches across a high
cliff perched over the ocean.  Beyond this rock bridge the
path smoothes out to a summit.

Chuck stares at the narrow bridge, then down at the waves
breaking on the rocks far below.  To get any view, he will
have to cross the bridge.  He's thirsty.  The late afternoon
sun is hot.

                     CHUCK
          Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did
          you enjoy the play?

Hugging the wall of the cliff, taking each step with great
caution, he sets out across the bridge.

EXT.  ISLAND - CLIFF

Step by step, Chuck negotiates the narrow bridge.  He reaches
a flume of polished basalt which cuts across the ledge like a
slide in a water park -- except this flume ends high above
the waves.  Chuck tries to step across it, can't quite, tries
one foot first, then the other.

                     CHUCK
          Shit!

He looks back, but that seems even scarier.

                     CHUCK
          Got to get there.  Got to see.  C'mon...
          c'mon.  Don't be such a wuss.  Be bold.

He looks down at the ocean beneath him, closes his eyes, and
jumps.  It's only a few feet, but he's breathing hard when he
lands on the other side.  He hugs the rocks, getting his
breath.

EXT.  ISLAND SUMMIT - SUNSET - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck looks to each point on the compass.  He is on an
ISLAND, small, inhospitable, without sign of habitation or
anything human.  On three sides the waves break against
steep, hostile cliffs.  A reef encloses the cove where he
came from.

                     CHUCK
          No way on.  No way off.

Chuck stares out to sea in every direction.  Nothing.

                     CHUCK
          This is bad.  Really, really bad.

The last rays of sun hit his face.  The ocean turns a deep
reddish gold.

EXT.  CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER

Going down is even scarier.  It's dusk and the light is flat
and gray.  Chuck stares at the ledge.

                     CHUCK
          Come on.  Crawl if you have to.

Chuck crawls on his hands and knees across the rock bridge.

EXT.  ROCKY SLOPE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck stumbles over the rocks.  The caves look ominous and
primal.

EXT.  EDGE OF JUNGLE - NIGHT

It's getting dark now.  The jungle seems impenetrable, the
dark wood of fable.  Chuck hesitates, then plunges into it.

EXT.  JUNGLE - NIGHT MINUTES LATER

The moon has just begun to rise, casting eerie light into the
jungle.  The shadows reach out to grab Chuck, then real
branches and vines tug at him.  He heads into thick
blackness.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT - LATER

Chuck emerges around the rocks.  He reaches the stack of
familiar FedEx boxes -- Ahh, home!  He's breathing hard, from
both fear and exertion.

                     CHUCK
          Got to drink.  Got to drink something.

With his last strength he opens a coconut on the stick.  He
bangs hard on the shell and gulps down the milk.  He stares
at the stack of FedEx boxes.  What could be inside?  He
reaches out and touches one.

                     CHUCK
          They don't belong to you.

Responsibility gets the better of necessity, and he takes his
hand away.

EXT.  BEACH - MORNING

Face red from the sun, Chuck hacks at a palm frond with his
stone knife.  He saws the palm frond off near the base,
leaving it about a foot long.

                     CHUCK
          Got to have shade.  Got to have a hat.

He ties the loose fibers into a sort of circle, then sets it
upon his head.  It looks amazingly like some sort of
primitive cap.

He grabs a couple of FedEx boxes and heads for the beach.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck finishes the P on H E L P, which he has spelled out
with the FedEx boxes on the beach.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY - LATER

Chuck scrambles down a ravine.  He kneels down and feels the
ground.  It is dry, completely dry.

EXT.  LAVA SLOPE - DAY

Chuck traverses the slope, determined to find water.

A FLAT ROCK - LATER

With a puddle of dirty water trapped in a tiny hollow.
Suddenly Chuck flops down into frame.  He tries to scoop up
some water in his hands, but he just splashes it around.  He
licks his fingers.  Then he gets down on his stomach and laps
up the water with his tongue.  Like an animal.

In the bottom of the small depression is some fine mud.  He
rubs it on his reddened face and across his burned lips.

                     CHUCK
          Oh, God.  Thank you.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

Chuck lies in darkness, his eyes reflecting the moon.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY

Chuck is drenched in sweat.  He is at the bottom of a hole
six feet deep.  He takes one last dig with the flat stick,
then licks the moist clay that sticks to it.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck breaks open another coconut and gulps down the milky
liquid.  With a stone knife he digs in the shell for some of
the meat, but it's dry and chewy and fibrous.  He spits it
out, then lies back on the sand and stares at the first
stars.  Half sings to himself.

                     CHUCK
          You deserve a break today...

He is desperately thirsty.  Hunger gnaws at him.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY - LATER

Holding a sharpened stick, Chuck wades in the shallows at low
tide, looking for fish.  It's difficult to keep his balance.
Suddenly a shadow flashes by, glinting in the morning
sunlight.  Chuck hurls the spear, which ricochets off the
water and floats away.

Chuck plunges into the water after the fish with his bare
hands.  The fish reverses direction.  Chuck leaps after it
and goes under.  He comes up spluttering, on his hands and
knees in the shallows.

Suddenly a whole school of fish swims by him, moving in
unison, like one creature, splitting around Chuck like
mercury.  He grabs at them desperately.  Nothing.

                     CHUCK
          Damn fish!

On some rocks he sees clusters of limpets.  He takes a rock
and tries to dislodge one, but it smashes into a soggy mess.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Discouraged, he sits down on the beach and gets his breath.

Idly, Chuck takes out his wallet.  The money is soaked.  He
lays it out to dry.  He finds a PHOTOGRAPH OF KELLY, soaked
and mushy.

He tries to smooth it out.  For a moment he is overcome.  His
face tightens, his eyes get moist.  He stares out to sea.

                     CHUCK
          Wait a minute.  Wait just a minute.

He picks up his wallet again and takes out a credit card.

EXT.  BEACH - MINUTES LATER

Chuck wades in the water, stops by a rock covered with
limpets.  He uses a CREDIT CARD to scrape off a limpet.

                     CHUCK
          Don't leave home without it.

With his finger, he prods around in the mucous-like meat,
then tilts up the shell and we see the gooey gray stuff slide
off the shell into his mouth.

                     CHUCK
          Yuck.

He starts to spit it out.  Tries to make himself like it.

                     CHUCK
          Yumm.

And he swallow it.

EXT.  BEACH - SUNSET

Chuck sits in the shade of a palm tree surrounded by a pile
of smashed coconut husks and a stack of limpet shells.  He
checks his watch for a moment.

                     CHUCK
          Got to get this fixed.

But what's the point?  Everything that was so valuable before
is useless now.

EXT.  JUNGLE - LATER

Chuck digs yet another hole.  He chants to himself, almost
delusionally.

                     CHUCK
          Water, water, everywhere, water, water
          everywhere...

Covered in sweat, desperate and exhausted, he throws down his
wooden spade.

                     CHUCK
          Where's the water on this fucking island?

He lies on his back, breathing hard.  Pulls his hat over his
eyes.

                     CHUCK
          Just rest a minute.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY - LATER

Chuck is lying in the hole.  We find his feet.  Slowly water
is oozing out of the clay, a puddle is building around his
toes.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY - LATER

Chuck's eyes snap awake.  He looks down at his feet.  There's
a pool of muddy water there.  He dips his hand in it, touches
a finger to his lips to be sure he's not dreaming.

He grabs his sharpened stone, begins to attack the clay.

                     CHUCK
          Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

EXT.  BEACH - SUNSET

Chuck carefully makes marks on a palm tree with his rock
knife.  One for each day.  Very neat.  Very precise.  Very
Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          Let's see, I waited two days.
               (makes marks)
          Then I buried Al.
               (slowly makes another mark)
          Al.  You never made it home, buddy.  Then
          American Express got me those clam
          things...
               (makes another mark)
          I dug all those damn holes, the clouds
          over the moon...
               (makes more marks)
          And today, the historic discovery of H,
          Two, Oh.
               (makes a tenth mark and
                underlines it)
          Ten days.  Shit.

For a moment, he feels the weight of his isolation.  Then he
allows himself a deep breath.  There is order now, after all.
Time is under control.

EXT.  CLIFF - DAY

Very carefully, but standing this time, Chuck makes his way
across the ledge.

EXT.  SUMMIT - DAY

He emerges on the top, takes a drink from a hand-made
canteen, and looks in all directions.  Again, he sees nothing
but ocean.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

He resumes his efforts at fishing.  A shape scuttles raggedly
beneath him.

                     CHUCK
          A crab, it's a crab.

He freezes, holding his spear motionless.  Then he jabs at
the crab -- misses!  The crab scurries away toward the rocks.

                     CHUCK
          Dammit!

Chuck splashes after it, stabbing as he goes, falling,
getting up, stabbing again.

Suddenly one stab feels different.  Chuck carefully lifts up
the spear.  On the end is a squirming crab.

                     CHUCK
          I did it.  I did it!

He walks carefully with it to the beach.  Lowering the spear,
he lets the crab slip off.  It darts toward the water.  Chuck
heads it off, trying to avoid the snapping claws.

He kicks it back toward the beach, then slams a rock down on
it.  He twists off a crab claw, expecting to see flaky white
meat.  But a crab has an exoskeleton.  The flesh simply pours
out, like mucous.

                     CHUCK
          Jesus.

This is too much.  He needs the next step, from the raw to
the cooked.  The crucial next step from primitive man to the
beginnings of civilization.

EXT.  PALM GROVE SERIES OF SHOTS - TRYING TO MAKE FIRE

Chuck rubs two sticks together.  Nothing.

Chuck positions a makeshift drill in a hole he has scooped
out in a piece of driftwood.  He spins the drill with great
effort.  Nothing.

                     CHUCK
          Stupid fucking thing!

He quits, exhausted.  He looks at his hands.  They are raw
and blistered.  He feels like Job.

                     CHUCK
          I don't know what I did, God, but
          whatever is was, I am really, really
          sorry.  You hear me?  Really sorry.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck emerges from the jungle and walks to the edge of the
ocean.  He dips his blistered hands into the sea water, then
looks over at the FedEx boxes that spell out H E L P.

                     CHUCK
          Don't have a choice, do I?

He walks over and picks a few boxes up from the P.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - DAY

With his stone knife and spear to help him.  Chuck begins to
open the FedEx boxes.  Chuck rips open the end of one box and
shakes it.  Out tumble some videotapes.  Chuck looks at them:
what good are they?

Chuck tears another box open.  Out slide some legal papers
covered with Post-its.

In quick cuts, we see him dump out computer memory boards,
some designer dresses, flowers, a pair of roller blades, a
script with a red cover -- which he never reads.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

By now he has taken all the boxes in the P.  Only H E L
remains.  He pauses to let the irony of that sink in, then
collects more boxes.  He is even more exhausted.

EXT.  PALM GROVE

Two boxes remain.  One is the box with Angel Wings.  Chuck
sets it aside.  He opens the other box.  Out tumbles a
DOCTOR'S BAG.  Chuck can't believe it.  He opens the bag.
It's full of great stuff.  Medicine.  A scalpel.  A saw.

                     CHUCK
          Okay.  Okay now.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - LATER

Hands bandaged, Chuck tries to strike a spark on the roller
blade wheel housing.  Tries over and over.  Nothing.

He takes a long drink from his canteen, and flinches.  His
tooth is starting to hurt.  He fishes some Tylenol out of the
surgeon's bag and takes two.

EXT.  OTHER SIDE OF ISLAND - DAY

Chuck picks some berries and gingerly tries them.  They're
not bad.  He eats more.  Then more.  What a relief.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

Chuck lies on his palm fronds, groaning and holding his
stomach.  He drags himself to his knees, crawls a few feet,
and throws up in great, violent heaves.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Still looking a little green, Chuck marks another day on his
tree calendar.

EXT.  SUMMIT

He stares out to sea.  Nothing.

EXT.  WELL - DAY

Chuck lies on his belly and drinks from the well, which has
filled with water.  Then he washes his face and splashes
water over his neck.  The surface of the well stills,
bringing CHUCK'S REFLECTION into focus.  He stares at
himself.

Very carefully Chuck shaves with the surgeon's scalpel.

Chuck checks out his new appearance in the water.  Much
better.  A clean start now.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY

He sits in front of his failed efforts to make fire.

                     CHUCK
          You're not getting it hot enough.  Got to
          hold the heat.  Got to hold the heat.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck carefully shaves some tinder.  Puts it under a piece of
bamboo split lengthwise with a notch cut across it.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck uses a bamboo stick to try to make friction in the
split half of the bamboo.  He saws back and forth with all
his might, pressing it down in the groove.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck gives one last saw with his bamboo and stops, utterly
defeated.  It's all too much.

                     CHUCK
          Sonofabitch!

He starts to rub again.  He breathes hard, sweat pours off
his face.  He is really going for it, what the hell!  A tiny
wisp of smoke appears!  Chuck saws with even more energy.

                     CHUCK
          Come on.  Come on.

The smoke increases.  Chuck rips away the bamboo, grabs the
nest of shavings, and blows on it frantically.  The smoke
flickers and dies.  Chuck can't believe it.

                     CHUCK
          No.  No.  No.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

Chuck lies in his bed of palm fronds, shivering.  He looks up
at the stars, which blaze furiously.

                     CHUCK
          That's the big dipper...Orion...or is
          that the Southern Cross...?  Kelly would
          know.

And he misses her so much.  A shower of meteors streaks
across the sky, as if the very heavens are raining down on
Chuck.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck readies his two sticks of bamboo again and begins
sawing with tremendous energy.  He smells something.  Is it
smoke?  He pulls off the log and looks eagerly at the nest of
tinder.  There's nothing there.

                     CHUCK
          Dammit!

He replaces the log and starts wearily to saw again.

TIME CUT

The sun has moved in the sky.  Chuck is still sawing.  Again
the smoke appears.  Again sweat pours from his face.  The
smoke increases.  He saws even harder.  His breath comes in
anguished gulps.  Smoke is curling up now.  Chuck tears away
the bamboo, picks up the nest of kindling, and blows on it
gently.  The smoke increases.

He blows some more.  A fragile crimson spark appears.

                     CHUCK
          Careful now, careful...

He gently places the nest of shavings in the kindling, then
blows on it with utmost care, as if he were holding life
itself.  He shreds his money and business cards over the tiny
flame.

Suddenly, the evening breeze lifts the nest out of the
kindling.  Desperate, Chuck grabs it.  Trying to shield it
with his body, he grabs some palm fronds and jams them into
the sand, trying to make a windbreak.  They rustle and shake
and blow over.

The wind blows harder.  Chuck jams some rocks in a circle to
make an eddy.  But the fire is out.  No words now, just a
loud, primal groan of pure despair.

And then, into his vision floats...smoke.

Chuck looks down.  A wisp of smoke curls up from the nest of
tinder!  Chuck blows on it gently.  Suddenly a tiny tongue of
flame flickers and catches on the kindling!

                     CHUCK
          Yes!  Yes!  Yes!

He feeds in some more twigs, more tinder.  The flames lick
out, catch, grow.

                     CHUCK
          If I ever forgot to thank you God, and I
          am sure I did, thank you now.

EXT.  BEACH - WIDE - NIGHT

The fire burns on the beach.  Chuck rushes about, piling on
driftwood.

EXT.  BEACH - CLOSER

Chuck darts into the jungle and returns dragging a huge log.
He throws it on the fire.  We see his face in the light of
the fire.  He is exultant.  He dances.  He sings at the top
of his lungs.  Papa-ooo-mow-mow!

Chuck throws another huge log on the fire.  Papa-papa-papa-
oooo!  The log splutters and explodes, sending up a huge
shower of sparks that climb and sparkle in the
darkness...until they merge with the stars.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - MORNING

Chuck makes a mark on the tree.  Around it he carves a flame
-- the day he mastered fire.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - LATER THAT MORNING

Chuck sharpens his spear with his stone knife.  Then he
sticks it in the flame to harden it, pulls it out, checks it,
scrapes some more.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck wades in the water with his spear.  Suddenly he stabs
it down.  A crab is on the end.

EXT.  BEACH - HALF HOUR LATER

Chuck removes a crab from out of the fire and breaks a
steaming crab claw.  Chuck takes a bite of the flaky white
meat.  Ahhh.  It tastes great.  He takes another bite -- and
flinches.

                     CHUCK
          Damn tooth!

He fumbles for his Tylenol and takes two pills.

EXT.  SUMMIT - SUNSET

Chuck stands on the summit, looking in all directions.  Then,
something on the island brings Chuck's eyes back from their
distant focus on the horizon.  From down on the beach,
beneath the palm grove, there curls a thin column of smoke.
Chuck lets a bit of pride creep into his face as he sees it.
He kneels down and begins to build a signal fire.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT - LATER

Chuck curls up in his bed of palm fronds.  The fire burns.
Around it is a large stack of crab shells.  He stares into
the fire.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - MORNING

Chuck makes another mark on the tree.  He has circled the
tree with marks several times now.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Using a safety pin and some suturing thread, Chuck fishes
carefully.  Suddenly he jerks his hand back.  On the end is a
flopping fish.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - DAY

Chuck takes a cooked fish off the fire and mixes it with some
breadfruit.  He eats the soft mixture, chewing carefully, but
his tooth hurts even worse.  There are only a few Tylenol
tablets left.  He carefully cuts one in half and swallows it.

EXT.  SUMMIT - AFTERNOON

Chuck arrives with the wood for the night.  He stares out to
sea as usual, but this time he sees something different.

WHALES.  He sees whales.  Leaping.  Broaching.  Spouting.
Water pouring off fins and flukes.  Moving.  Going somewhere.

                     CHUCK
          Beautiful.  So beautiful.

Chuck stares at them, stares until the ocean darkens and he
can see them no more.  It's late now.

Leaving, he takes one last look, as he always does.  And
another remarkable sight greets his eyes.  There, on the
horizon, just below the evening star, is a...LIGHT.  He
stares at it, fixed.

                     CHUCK
          A star.  It's a star.

But then he stares at it really hard.

                     CHUCK
          It's a ship.

EXT.  WOODS - TREE - NEXT DAY

A tree shakes and moves, quivers...

                     CHUCK
          Timberrr!

...then slowly falls with a CRASH!

                     CHUCK
          I heard that...

Chuck holds his surgeon's saw over the stump.  He walks to
another tree and begins to saw his way into the trunk.

EXT.  BEACH - SERIES OF SHOTS

Up above the high tide line, Chuck lashes a log to a row of
five logs already joined with vines.

                     CHUCK
          No more waiting.  Take action.

Chuck sews several designer dresses together with needle and
suturing thread for a sail.

                     CHUCK
          That's right.  Take action.

He cuts bamboo for the mast.  He carves driftwood for an oar.

He fills gourds with water, stores breadfruit and coconut as
he sings "Fly Me to the Moon" to himself.

He ties the sail to the mast and extends it with a bamboo
boom lashed on with palm fiber and video tape.  He ties on
the doctor's kit and the FedEx box with the angel wings.

He examines his handiwork:  a finished raft.

He brings out his old life preserver and puts it on, then
grabs hold of one corner of the raft to pull it down to the
beach.  It doesn't budge.  He tries to pull it again.
Nothing.  He leans his back into it and pushes with his legs.
Nothing.  He collapses on the beach, his breath coming in
heaves.

                     CHUCK
          How could I be so stupid?

He bangs himself on the head, over and over.

                     CHUCK
          Stupid, stupid, stupid.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - NIGHT

Chuck throws new firewood on the dwindling fire.  It comes
back to life.  Meteors streak again across the sky.  He
stares at the indifferent stars.  The moon is almost full.
Shadows of palm trees sway on the sand.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

Chuck stands by the edge of the water, which shimmers in the
reflected light of the fire.  A wave come in, licks at his
toes.  Lifts up a coconut husk, sweeps it gently out.  Chuck
watches, gets an idea.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

He begins to dig in the sand by the raft.  He grabs the oar
and digs faster, making a trench up to where the raft is.

EXT.  BEACH - MORNING

The rising tide floods water into the trench.  Chuck rocks
the raft back and forth.  It floats!  As the wave recedes, it
takes the raft with it.  Chuck has to run beside it.

CHUCK TRYING TO ESCAPE - MONTAGE

Over and over, we see Chuck capsize at the reef.  The first
time he has a bandage on his leg.  He tries everything --
different rafts, different approaches, but each time the
ocean spits him back.

EXT.  LAGOON - DAY

Defeated and utterly exhausted, Chuck swims back from his
latest failure.  He wades back ashore with the FedEx box and
throws it on the ground by the palm tree.  He has tried so
hard to escape, so incredibly hard, done everything humanly
possible and beyond.  He rips off his life preserver, throws
it into the underbrush, then collapses on the beach.

                     CHUCK
          You're too low in the water.  Too damn
          low.

Chuck's shoulders begin to shake, as he is racked with deep
sobs of despair.

And then he throws his head back and lets forth, from deep
inside himself, a SCREAM of rage and anger and pain.  The
Scream pierces the indifferent natural sounds of the island,
the rustling of the breeze, the lulling rhythm of the waves.
It is powerful, disturbing, primal.

The breeze picks up.  Behind Chuck, the palm trees begin to
sway.  The tide is reaching up toward the beach.  The waves
crash louder.  The palm trees sway even more.

Chuck picks up some wet sand and rubs it on his body.

                     CHUCK
          Dust thou art -- that's for damned sure
          -- and unto dust shalt thou return.

A few DROPS OF RAIN begin to fall, splashing on Chuck and
sizzling in the fire.

Chuck looks up:  clouds have obscured the sun.  The wind
blows harder.  The rain falls harder, streaking the sand
Chuck had rubbed on his body.  STEAM sizzles out of the fire.

Chuck looks up, disbelieving.  The bottom falls out of the
heavens -- monsoon rain, more rain than you have ever seen
before.  A long wave rolls up, its frothy fingers reaching
for the fire.

Forget the raft!  Forget despair!  The fire could go out!
This is disaster!

                     CHUCK
          Shit!

He springs into action.  Chuck grabs an empty FedEx box.
With his wooden shovel he frantically SCOOPS SOME COALS out
of the fire as the rain HISSES and POUNDS at them.  He slides
the coals into the FedEx box, grabs some sticks of driftwood
and sets off on a run.

EXT.  WOODS - DAY

Chuck runs through the woods, slipping and stumbling.  Vines
grab at him.  The rain is so thick he can hardly see.

EXT.  WOODS - MINUTES LATER

Chuck bursts out of the woods into the lava field.  Smoke
pours out of the FedEx box.  The coals are about to burn
through!

EXT.  LAVA FIELD - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck stumbles up the slippery rocks, dragging the smoking
box.  His face is drenched, desperate.

EXT.  CAVE - DAY - MINUTES LATER

Chuck tumbles into the cave just as the coals burn through
the FedEx box.

Using the remains of the box, he desperately tries to scoot
the coals into a dry spot.

One by one, THE PRECIOUS COALS GO OUT.

Dripping water off his hands and face, he pushes a few
together with his fingers, ignoring the burns.

                     CHUCK
          Please...please...please...

He stomps on the driftwood and saws at it with his knife.  He
places this kindling on the coals.  They sputter and sizzle.
Barely catch.  He fans them with the box.  A tiny flicker
catches, then starts to grow.

                     CHUCK
          Firewood.  I need firewood.

SERIES OF SHOTS

On the beach, Chuck desperately gathers more firewood in the
driving monsoon.  He can barely see.  Driven by the storm,
the waves are licking at the palm grove.

He runs through the woods.  Branches whip at his face.  Roots
tear at his feet, tripping him.

He stumbles up the lava field.  Sliding.  Struggling.  Barely
able to breathe, the rain is so strong.

INT.  CAVE - DAY

He dumps the firewood on the floor of the cave.  But where
the fire had flickered, there is only a pile of wet black
ashes.

THE FIRE IS OUT.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck lies on the floor of the cave, shivering in the
darkness as the rain falls.  His fire is out, his tooth is
killing him, he can't escape.

EXT.  CAVE - NEXT DAY

Chuck emerges from the cave.  The rain has stopped.  This is
the absolute lowest.  His face reflects his pain and despair.
He's trapped.  It's hopeless.  Everything he tried to build
is gone.

EXT.  LEDGE - DAY

Chuck slowly walks out on the ledge.  He stares down at the
waves breaking on the jagged rocks far below.

He lets go one hand.  Then lets go the other.  He is barely
balanced.  It looks like a wisp of breeze would blow him
right off.  He slides one foot to the very lip of the
precipice.

Suddenly his foot slips!

Instinctively he turns into the cliff, grabs for a hold!  One
hand reaches for a nubbing of rock, slips off!  The other
closes, his fingers straining to hold him.

He breathes in deep gasps.  He had wanted to end it, come so
close.

                     CHUCK
          What the fuck are you doing?

His deepest instinct was to survive.  And that is what he is
going to do.

                     CHUCK
          Hang on.  Just hang on.

Slowly he pulls himself back from the edge.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck walks aimlessly down the beach, feeling the burden of
starting over.  The beach is littered with seaweed and
flotsam, bits of rope, plastic bottles.  He picks up a
plastic bottle.  That will come in handy.

The Chuck sees a SOCCER BALL with "Wilson" stamped on it in
big black letters.

He picks it up, holds it, tosses it up in the air.  Then he
kicks it, then kicks it again, then runs down the beach,
trying to kick it and keep it out of the water.  Feeling joy
again, even here.

INT.  CAVE - THAT DAY

The sun is setting on his darkened cave.  The soccer ball
sits in the corner by the black cold ashes of what was once
his fire.

Chuck carves a bit of coconut meat, takes a bite and winces
as the meat hits his sore tooth.  He tosses the shell on a
small new pile of shells.

Chuck shakes out the last half Tylenol tablet.  He puts the
tablet in his mouth, then takes a sip out of his coconut
canteen.  When the water hits his tooth that hurts too.

INT.  CAVE - MORNING

Chuck mixes a mash of breadfruit and coconut.  He tries to
pack the tooth with the mash, but it's so sensitive that even
this hurts.  He pounds the floor of the cave in frustration.

INT.  CAVE - LATER

Chuck holds a stone chisel and his hammer stone.  He
positions the chisel against his inflamed tooth.  But the
thought of what he is about to do is too frightening.  He
lowers the chisel.

                     CHUCK
          Shit.  Shit.  Shit.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck tries to fill his mouth with sea water.  The pain is so
great his eyes water.

                     CHUCK
          Whoo, pig.  Sooey!

He falls back in the water and floats there, looking up at
the sky.

INT.  CAVE - LATER

Determined, Chuck hold the stone chisel again.  He raises it
slowly to his mouth and picks up the hammer stone.

                     CHUCK
          No pain, no gain.

He brings the hammer down hard on the chisel!  The screen
goes BLACK as Chuck's SCREAM continues UNDER.

FADE IN:

EXT.  OCEAN - SUNRISE - THREE YEARS LATER

The sky takes on the first colors of the day.  The ocean is
still dark, but a few waves catch the first light.  The
sunrise touches the summit, moves down the cliff, then lights
the cove.  On the screen superimpose:

                     "1000 DAYS LATER"

REFLECTION - WATER

A spear shimmers in the calm morning water.  Attached to the
spear is a man, standing completely still.

ON CHUCK

We move up out of the reflection to the real man.  His legs
are scarred.  The remnants of a dress wrap around his middle.
A stone knife on a neatly mounted haft is stuck in a belt
made of videotape and woven fiber.  Necklaces of shark's
teeth and shells hang from his neck.  His hair is long.  A
coconut frond hat is on his head.

The hand wrapped around the spear is scarred and brown as a
berry.  It holds the spear perfectly still.  The watch is
gone.

We come around slowly until we see Chuck's face.  The eyes
say it all.  They stare out with a survivor's intensity,
staring at the water, unblinking.  This is the man who used
to splash futilely about in the water trying to fish.

This is the FedEx man who was plugged into the tumult of
activity and energy, surrounded by technology and human
activity at its most intense, devoted to making seconds
count.  Now he is utterly alone, and utterly still.

And now he has all the time in the world.

Suddenly, without an once of wasted motion, he shoots the
spear forward at a low angle.  It quivers, stuck on the
bottom.  He pulls it out with a practiced twist.  On the end
is a struggling fish.

But this isn't a thrill anymore.  It's another day at the
office.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY

Chuck makes a mark on a palm tree.  He has completely covered
three other trees with marks.  It sinks in how long he has
been here.

EXT.  JUNGLE - LATER

Chuck carries the fish back from the beach.  Now there is a
well-worn trail.

INT.  CAVE - THAT AFTERNOON

Chuck enters with the fish.  We are greeted with the well-
ordered lair of a primitive stone-age man.

Clam shell spirals weave in and out around the fire hole.
Strips of eel jerky and fish hang drying from racks.

Tools are lined up neatly:  digging sticks, stone hammers and
saws, spears neatly hafted onto shafts, drills, awls.  Bits
and pieces of feathers, skins, bones, rags, leaves -- are all
neatly arranged.  Strings and cords hang from hooks.  Coconut
bowls and cooking rocks form a small kitchen.  A raincoat and
rain-hat woven of palm fronds is neatly draped over a frame.

Evocative pieces of driftwood decorate the room.  A wind
chime of obsidian flakes sways gently.  The watch hangs on a
stick.

The Angel Box has the place of honor on one side.  On the
other side the Wilson soccer ball rests on a throne of rocks.
Seaweed has been placed on the ball as hair.  Clam shells
have been stuck on for eyes, other shells form a mouth.  A
tube shell and conch form a pipe.

INT.  CAVE - FIRE - NIGHT

The fish are being smoke under a palm frond.  Eel skins hang
from sticks, roasting.  Chuck sits by the fire, hafting a
stone knife onto a wooden haft.

He ties some fiber to a stick, then braids it into string,
using both hands and his mouth for the three strands.

He ties the string tightly around the shaft.  He does his
work automatically.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT - LATER

Chuck eats some fish and some mashed breadfruit.  He chews
each bite, his eyes in distant focus.  The firelight flickers
on his face.

EXT.  CLIFF - SUNRISE

Chuck carries firewood up to the summit.  He mechanically
adds wood to the fire.  As he does so, something out to sea
catches his eye.  He stops and stands up.

CHUCK'S POV - WHALES

WHALES broach out past the rocky point.  Spouts of water
shoot into the air.

ON CHUCK

As he watches them, a light comes back into his eyes.  He
grins.  There's a big gap where his teeth had been.  He turns
and strides down the hill.

EXT.  CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER

He heads across the rock bridge that once had so terrified
him, without losing stride.  It's second nature now.

INT.  CAVE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck enters the cave, picks up the ball and heads out.

EXT.  SUMMIT - EVENING

The signal fire burns.  A spectacular cloudy sunset lights up
the sky.  Chuck sits with Wilson on the summit, a bowl of
mashed breadfruit in one hand, a bowl of roasted eel skin in
another.

As Chuck watches the sunset unfold, watches the whales going
by in the darkened water, he takes some roasted eel chips,
dips them into the breadfruit paste, and offers one to
Wilson.  His voice is flat, monotonal.

                     CHUCK
          Chips?  Dip?

But Wilson declines.

                     CHUCK
          No?

He takes a big crunchy bite.

                     CHUCK
          Another fucking day in paradise.

PULL BACK as the sun goes down and Chuck reaches into the
bowl again and dips an eel skin chip in the dip.

EXT.  ROCKY LEDGE - NIGHT - LATER

Torch in one hand, Wilson in the other, Chuck walks across
the rocky ledge.  He passes the flume without even noticing.

Suddenly his shoe breaks!  It's sandal made of woven yucca
leaves.

He bends down and fixes it, then heads on down the ledge.

EXT.  LEDGE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck makes a casual leap, a leap he has made hundreds of
times, but this time the sandal comes loose.  It catches on a
rock, and CHUCK FALLS!

His hands are cut and bruised.  He tries to get up, can't.
Chuck sits back and examines his foot.  His fingers come back
covered with blood.  He reaches out to steady himself, and
leaves a HANDPRINT OF BLOOD on the rock.

INT.  CAVE - LATER

Chuck wraps his foot in bandages.

INT.  CAVE - LATER

Chuck's face is sweaty.  He looks down at his foot.  It is
red, swollen, infected.  He stands up, tries to put some
weight on it.  The pain is intense.

Chuck sticks the scalpel onto some coals to sterilize it.  He
holds it over his foot, takes a breath, then jabs in into the
wound.  The pain is intense.  Chuck passes out.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck stirs, takes a drink, weakly tosses on another log, and
collapses back on the floor.

INT.  CAVE - DAY

Chuck wakes up, trembling, shaking, wet with sweat.  He
staggers up.  His shadow sways on the wall of the cave.  He
struggles to get another log on the fire.  He squints at his
only companion, the soccer ball.

                     CHUCK
          Help me, Wilson...

He collapses again.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck stirs and squints his eyes.  He takes a drink of water.
He is feeling better.  He puts another log on the fire and
slowly begins to chew on some breadfruit and dried fish.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck slowly wades into the water, favoring his injured foot.
But something feels different.  He glances around.  What is
it?  And then he sees something, perhaps the worst possible
sight.

CHUCK'S POV - SAIL

A SAIL is moving steadily away from the island.

CHUCK

Throws down the spear and waves his arms.

                     CHUCK
          No!  Wait!  Come back!

He runs into the water and starts to swim.  He is so weak,
however, he can only make a few strokes.  He tries to yell as
he swims...

                     CHUCK
          Wait!  Wait!

Choking and weak, he turns back and drags himself up on the
beach.  In the b.g., the sail dwindles into the distance.

EXT.  SUMMIT - LATER

Chuck struggles to the top of the hill.  His fire has been
extinguished by the rain.  In the distance, far against the
horizon, he sees a sail -- or is it a cloud?  The whiteness
shimmers against the horizon.  Chuck squints.  Whatever it
was, it is gone.  Above him some contrails from jets mark the
sky.

Furious, he kicks his signal fire, scattering the burnt-out
coals.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY

Chuck makes a new mark on his calendar tree.  Then he stops.
He CUTS an angry big line under the last mark, then hacks
away at the palm tree, slashing it with the stone knife,
ripping and marking through all his dates.  Finally the stone
knife breaks in two.  Chuck drops the broken half and catches
his breath.

EXT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck enters the cave.  No signal fires burn.  The island is
dark.

EXT.  SUMMIT - DAY

Chuck stands on the summit, staring out to sea.  Nothing, not
even a contrail, not even a whale spout.

EXT.  CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER

He is on his way down, suddenly he sees something and stops.
It's the HANDPRINT, the bloody handprint, his own handprint.

He slowly extends his hand and covers it, then pulls it away.
Traces it with his fingers.

INT.  CAVE - DAYS LATER

Chuck has the beginnings of an artist's studio.  Several
large clam shells hold paint.  A few egg shells are lined up.
Brushes have been made from roots and feathers.

Chuck covers his hand with paint and makes a handprint on the
wall of the cave.  He stands back and looks at it.

INT.  CAVE - DAY

He chews some berries, then holds his hand against the wall
of the cave and spits a dark blue mist around it.  When he
takes his hand away, the silhouette of his handprint remains.

INT.  CAVE - DAY

With the Angel Wing Box as a model, Chuck dips one of his
feather brushes in paint, and make a tentative line on the
wall of the cave.  He works hesitantly, rubs off a line,
tries again.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck is finishing his first figure, a crude portrait of a
man -- himself?  Hard to tell.  He examines his work.  He
takes some shells and sticks them on as eyes.

Chuck picks up Wilson, thinks.

                     CHUCK
          You old airhead, you need a makeover.

He takes some charcoal out of his fire and draws eyebrows on
the ball.  Then, he mashes some berries, dips his fingers in
the juice, and makes lips.  He sticks shells on with clay for
eyes.  Then he looks at the face.

                     CHUCK
          Wilson, you bad!

He sits back and regards his companion.  He gestures around
the cave at the new paintings.

                     CHUCK
          What do you think?

But Wilson doesn't have an opinion.

                     CHUCK
          You don't share much, do you?

Idly Chuck takes down the Angel Box.

                     CHUCK
          I guess I know how Kelly felt.

For a long time he studies the wings on it.  With a stick, he
tries to draw a similar wing on the dusty floor of the cave.
Dissatisfied, he wipes it away.  He looks at the Angel Box.

Casually he reaches over and cuts it open with a stone knife.
Inside he finds two bottles of green salsa.  And a letter.

He reads over it.

                     CHUCK
          You said our life was a prison.  Dull.
          Boring.  Empty.  I can't begin to tell
          you how much that hurt.  I don't want to
          lose you.  I'm enclosing some salsa, the
          verde you like.  Use it on your sticky
          rice and think of home.  Then come home
          -- to me.  We'll find the spice in our
          lives again.  Together.  I love you.
          Always.  Bettina.

Visibly moved, Chuck puts down the letter.

                     CHUCK
          He never got it.

EXT.  ISLAND - DAY

The monsoon pours down.  Wind whips the palm trees.  The
waves are gray and angry, tearing at the beach.

INT.  CAVE - DAY

As the rain pours down outside, Chuck studies the sodden,
ruined photograph of Kelly, which is really only a gray mess.

                     CHUCK
          She's probably found someone else.  I
          would have.

Chuck dips his finger into one of the bowls of colors and
streaks it slowly across his face.  To exorcise his
loneliness, he will paint on the most expressive canvas there
is:  his own body.

CHUCK PAINTING HIMSELF - MONTAGE

Close-up on scarred fingers, as they paint on Chuck's face
and body.  Color on skin.  Tight dramatic shots of Chuck
being transformed.

Chuck takes white paint and covers his hand.  Then he presses
it into his chest and makes a handprint.  He draws a yellow
spiral on his leg, then takes red and makes jagged lightning
bolts on his chest on either side of the hand.

WATER

Shimmers in a gourd.  Chuck's face swims into focus.  It has
been painted white.  Looking at himself in the reflection, he
dots on blue stars with dark blue from squid ink.

EXT.  CAVE - LATER

The rains have stopped.  The island is washed bright and
green.

ON CHUCK

As he stands up in the cove.  His face is white with blue
stars.  Handprints circle his torso, flanked by red lightning
bolts.  Braided cords circle his biceps.  Bone necklaces hang
from his neck.  Feathers jut out from his hair.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY

Chuck goes from tree to tree, making handprints along his
path.  Chuck was here.  This is his mark.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - DAY

He covers the calendar trees with handprints.  Then stops.
Sees something.  Eyes fixed on the beach, he walks toward the
shoreline.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck emerges from the palm trees, and now we see what he had
seen.

A FIFTY-FIVE GALLON OIL DRUM.

And another one.  TWO.  Chuck stares at the barrels.

                     CHUCK
          Hello.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck sits staring at the oil drums.  It's almost as if he is
hesitating to take advantage of them.  That he may not want,
really, to leave now.

Then his inner struggle ends.

                     CHUCK
          What the hell are you waiting for?

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Filled with determination, Chuck rolls a barrel up the beach.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Using a palm tree as a fulcrum, Chuck hauls hard on a rope
made of vines, pulling the barrel up off the beach.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY

Chuck throws aside palm leaves, revealing...the remains of
his raft.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck is drawing with a purpose now.  And we see what he is
working on.  The plans for a raft.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck is making a list of what he needs.  He works intently.

                     CHUCK
          Canteens.  Sea anchor.  Got to weave
          rope.  Spears.  A sail.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY

Chuck lashes the barrels onto the raft.  Checks the knots.
Lashes more rope.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

He sews dresses together with handmade fiber string.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

He weaves videotape together to form a sea anchor.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck digs a channel toward the raft.

INT.  CAVE - DAY

Chuck constructs a water collection device with some FedEx
boxes, some plastic weighted with a stone.  Explains it to
Wilson.

                     CHUCK
          Now I'm hoping that if this is airtight
          I'll get condensation down here, a cup or
          so a day.  If I'm careful it should be
          enough.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck writes on the wall.

                     CHUCK
          If I never return, know that here lived
          Chuck Noland for four years.  I drew
          these paintings.  I made these marks.
          And then I took my fate in my own hands
          and set forth to save myself, God
          willing.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck loads the raft, which rocks gently in the cove.  He has
a sail made of designer dresses sewn together with fiber
thread.  A sea anchor secured by videotape woven together
into a rope.  Plastic bottles filled with water.  A signal
kite made of FedEx paper.

Then comes the FedEx box with the angel wings.  Then Wilson.

                     CHUCK
          Wilson, my main man.  Time to go.

And he gently leads the raft into the lagoon.

                     CHUCK
          Wonder what odds Stan would give me on
          this.  I'd say 90-10.  Against.

He jumps onto the raft, begins to paddle out toward where the
surf crashes onto the reef.

EXT.  LAGOON - DAY

Waves break against the reef.  With his paddles Chuck
maneuvers the raft toward the cut in the reef.  Boom!  The
wave crashes, the water surges through the cut, then recedes
with a whoosh.

Chuck watches, times the waves, paddles like mad.  He's
committed.  SCRAPE goes the first barrel, then the second,
riding the receding wave.  He's out!

But the next wave is already surging forward.  It smashes the
raft against the reef!  Coconuts and foodstuffs hurtle off
the raft!

The barrels cushion the impact.  The raft tilts, spins, but
stays outside the reef!  The ropes holding the jugs of water
break!  The water sweeps overboard!

The wave recedes again.  Chuck recovers, paddles with all his
strength, and then he's clear of the breakers!

For a long moment he floats on the rollers, getting his
breath.

The water jugs float away, carried by the waves back into the
lagoon.  Chuck could go back and get them.  If he were being
prudent, he definitely would.

But he's out.  He might never get back out again.

He stares at the lagoon and the receding water jugs.  Then he
stares at the island.  Goodbye to all that.

                     CHUCK
          Wilson, we're out of here.

He turns and begins raising the sail.

EXT.  OCEAN - WIDE - MINUTES LATER

Powered by its multicolored makeshift sail, trailing its
gently flapping signal kite of FedEx paper, the raft slowly
moves away from the island, out toward the open ocean.

And we pull back until the ocean swallows the tiny raft and
then we TILT DOWN AND...

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY - FOUR WEEKS LATER

The ocean again, low.  The raft floats into frame.  A trace
of a breeze flaps the signal kite, which barely stays aloft,
its rope frayed and tattered.  The still is set up in the
middle, plastic with a rock weighting down the center.

Chuck is gaunt, his clothes rotted.

He lies looking over the side of the raft, spear in one hand,
staring intently at the water.

Dorados swim like specters, flashing and darting.  Chuck
stabs with his spear.  Stabs again.

                     CHUCK
          Slow down, damn you!

Exhausted, he sinks back to the raft.  Two Dorados leap into
the air ahead of him.

Chuck tries to stare again into the water.  He spots another
fish, a flash of silver under the surface.

Chuck struggles to his feet, raises his spear.  SPLAT!
Something strikes him in the chest, almost knocking him into
the water.

On the raft we see flashes of silver and green and blue.  A
FLYING FISH.  Chuck dives at it, catches it, loses it.

                     CHUCK
          Catch it catch it catch it --

He catches it again just as it almost flops over the side.

EXT.  RAFT - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck sucks the juice out of the head.  He chews meat off the
tiny rib bones.

Chuck is in the stage of malnutrition, vitamin deprivation,
salt insufficiency, and exposure where the personality splits
and becomes external.  Like all castaways, he has
conversations with the two sides of himself.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Save some for tomorrow.

                     BADCHUCK
          Catch another fish tomorrow.

BadChuck wins.  Chuck keeps eating.  He stares up at the sun,
which beats down unmercifully.

EXT.  RAFT - DAY - LATER

The raft drifts.  Chuck has taken down the sail and rigged it
as a canopy.  Drenched with sweat, Chuck lies on the raft,
trying to sleep.  He dabs at some sores that are ulcerating
his body and won't let him get comfortable.  Plus, there's a
chaffing, squeaking sound.  He looks around for the source.

We see it with him.  One of the ropes is frayed and about to
break.  If it does, the logs will come apart from the floats.

                     BADCHUCK
          Shit!  Shit!  Shit!

                     GOODCHUCK
          Stay calm, identify the problem.
          Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix
          rope.

                     BADCHUCK
          With what?  There's nothing to fix it
          with.  This rope comes undone, you're
          going to drown.

                     GOOD CHUCK
          Just get up and fix it.

                     BADCHUCK
          Too tired.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Get up.

                     BADCHUCK
          Feels so good to lie here.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Get up, damn you.

Chuck comes to his knees.  Then sinks back down.

                     BADCHUCK
          Can't.  Need water.

                     GOODCHUCK
          You've had today's water.

                     BADCHUCK
          Thirsty.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Come on, shape up, get going, you can do
          it.

                     BADCHUCK
          No water, no work.

Chuck tries another tack.  Sweet reason.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Okay look, I know you're tired, I know
          you're thirsty, but give it one more
          shot, you've just got to do a little
          more.

                     BADCHUCK
          Do too much, I'll die.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Do too little you'll die.

                     BADCHUCK
          Going to die anyway.

That stops GoodChuck for a moment.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Okay, look have an extra swallow.

He holds up the pathetic little jar with its few teaspoons of
murky water.

                     BADCHUCK
          No more water, you said.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Take it.

                     BADCHUCK
          No.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Take it, damn it.

                     BADCHUCK
          No.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the
          damn water.

Slowly Chuck gets up, lifts up the water jar, and takes a
swallow.  Then another.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Stop.  Enough.

Then another.

EXT.  RAFT - DAY - LATER

Chuck works to braid a new rope.  He is focused,
concentrating as hard as he can, but everything is slow and
hard and he's weak and clumsy.  He tests the rope, but it
doesn't hold.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Think.  Got to use something else.

He gets an idea, starts to pull the signal kite in.

                     BADCHUCK
          If they can't see you, what's the point?

                     GOODCHUCK
          Survive today, that's the point.

The kite rope is much thinner than the rope he had used to
tie the logs, but it's all he has.  He ties the log with the
kite rope.  Exhausted, he lies back down.

EXT.  RAFT - NIGHT

The moon is full.  The waves cast off shadows on the ocean.
Chuck is staring into the sky, trying to find a star to
navigate by.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too
          far south.

                     BADCHUCK
          You don't know where you are.  You missed
          the shipping lanes.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Moon's too bright.

We hear the fraying sound again.

EXT.  RAFT - DAY

Chuck saws at the outer log with his stone knife.  Across the
water comes a storm.  We can see it like a waterfall moving
toward us.

                     BADCHUCK
          You're putting off the inevitable.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I'm putting it off.

He looks at the deteriorating rope, at the rotting sail.

                     BADCHUCK
          That's what's happening to you.

Chuck pushes the outer log away, then takes the loose rope
and begins to lash it around the center logs.

                     BADCHUCK
          You're rotting away.

The raft is rocking.  The waves are stronger.  It's hard to
tie the logs together.

Rain falls like a sheet on Chuck.

                     BADCHUCK
          Get water!

                     GOODCHUCK
          Fix raft first.

                     BADCHUCK
          Water water water --

Chuck works frantically in the rain, trying to tie the rope.
Finally he does.

Then he scrambles for his water collecting funnel, struggles
to pull it up.  One corner is stuck and collapses.
Desperately he rights it, pulls the funnel up.

Drops begin to run down the sides and collect in the jar.
Soaked, Chuck stares at the water as it rises.

Then the rain stops.

We see the line of rain recede away from Chuck, spattering
the ocean.  But all around him the ocean is calm again.

And out comes the sun.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

The raft floats on quiet seas.  The sky is blue, with few
high cirrus clouds so motionless they seem pasted on.

Chuck lies on the raft, sick and weak.

Suddenly, from the depths beside him, silently rises a huge
shape.

A SPERM WHALE, still mainly submerged.  The blow hole is near
Chuck, wet and pulsing like giant lips.  The eye of the whale
is only a few feet away.  It looks upon Chuck out of an
intelligence deep and alien.

He slowly comes to his knees and stares at it.

The blow hole opens and WHOOSH, out shoots a geyser of fine
spray which settles on Chuck in a mist.

The whale rises farther, dwarfing the raft.  From the whale
comes a deep sound like a foghorn.

Startled, Chuck jumps back, rocking the raft.  He catches
himself, slowly reaches out and touches the whale.

The whale blows again, drenching Chuck in more spray.

Chuck touches the whale again.

                     GOODCHUCK
          You like that?

Very slowly it drifts along with the raft.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Lost your mate?

We look right into the whale's eye.  Beneath the surface we
can see the huge jaws open and close.

                     GOODCHUCK
          You're beautiful.  Marry me.

                     BADCHUCK
          You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the
          raft.

Very slowly the whale moves ahead of the raft, its vast body
passing Chuck.

                     GOODCHUCK
          No, don't go.  Look, I've got fish.

Chuck rips a fillet off the line and throws it in front of
the whale, which ignores it.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Please don't dive.  Please.

The whale slowly sinks, then suddenly arches its huge back
and heads straight for the bottom.

For a moment, all that remains are the flukes, black and
vertical against the dark blue sky.  With one swoop, those
flukes could destroy Chuck and his raft.  But they don't do
anything except slowly sink.

Then it is gone.

We are on Chuck's face as he stares at where the whale had
been, the surface marked only by a ring of concentric ripples
that reach out and gently rock the raft.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

Chuck checks the water.  It is green and full of floaties.
It looks awful.  He takes the jug, puts it to his mouth, and
drinks.  Instantly he throws up back into the jug, barely
keeps from dropping it.

                     BADCHUCK
          Look what you've done.

He dips his hand into the ocean, splashes some sea water on
his face, splutters it out, then licks his lips.  He is so
thirsty.

He looks at the water jug, full now with his own vomit, turns
away, begins to work on the sea anchor again.

But the work makes him even thirstier.  He looks at the jug
again.

Picks it up.  Takes a long drink.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

The fish return.  Chuck gets up with his spear, then puts it
down.

                     BADCHUCK
          What are you doing?

                     GOODCHUCK
          Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't
          kill my friends anymore.

                     BADCHUCK
          You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or
          you die.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Why do they have to die for me?

                     BADCHUCK
          They'd eat you if they could.  They're
          laughing at you.  Listen.

Chuck listens.  Doesn't hear anything.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Got to eat.

Chuck picks up the spear, stabs it, misses.

Suddenly he has a fish on the end of the spear.  It
struggles, he scoops it onto the raft, brutally pounds on its
head, twists the stone knife into its spine.  The struggling
stops.

Chuck looks at the dead fish and begins to sob.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I am so sorry.

He cries uncontrollably.  As he cries he cuts off the head,
pulls out the eyeballs, and eats each one.  Then he sucks the
marrow out of the head.

Then takes the heart and eats that.  Then eats the liver.

As he is chewing, he cuts the meat into strips.

When he is done, he takes the backbone, breaks it, and sucks
on it.

Fish scales shine in his hair, blood covers his chest.

EXT.  OCEAN - NIGHT

The raft rocks gently.  Chuck looks up.  The strips of fish
are glowing.  So is the deck where he killed the fish.

He reaches out to touch the fish strips.  His hand is glowing
too.

                     CHUCK
          I'm an angel.

Suddenly he sees other lights.  A ship.  A ship is out there.
And he hears it, a humming in deep register.

He waves his hands.  He yells.

                     CHUCK
          Here!  Here!

His voice cracks, we can barely hear it over the ocean.

The lights move on.

                     CHUCK
          No...no...no...

His raft is rocked by the wake, rocked hard.  Chuck is thrown
into the water!

He comes to the surface, sputtering.  Where is the raft?

He looks one way, then another.  Darkness.

This is the worst.

He turns again in the water.  There, dimly, he can see the
glow from the fish he killed.  The glow saves his life.

He swims toward it.

He pulls himself back on the raft.

He lies there exhausted, the glow from the phosphorescence
casting a greenish light on his face.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

Clouds are building up.  In the distance lightning flashes.
The clouds come closer.

Little bits of electricity jump off the mast.  Saint Elmos
fire jumps around Chuck's hand.

Fascinated, he holds out his hand.  The fire jumps from his
hand to the mast.

Suddenly lightning shoots from the sky and strikes the ocean!
A huge spout of water explodes like a depth charge.  The
CRACK is intense, then rolls away.

Chuck stares, then realizes the danger and throws himself
down on the raft.  Suddenly a wall of rain sweeps over him
and the ocean begins to roll.  The thunder is deafening.
Lightning flashes bursts through the rain.

                     CHUCK
          Sea anchor!  Let out the sea anchor!

Frantic, Chuck lets out the sea anchor as the raft scuds down
a huge wave.  The anchor catches, slowing the raft so that it
rides the wave down.

The waves come at him high as houses.  The raft rides up one
side, then plunges down the next.

All Chuck can do is hold on.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

The storm has passed.  The raft floats on big dark rollers.

We hear the chirping and squeaking of dolphins.  They come
close to the raft.  Chuck watches them play.  Then realizes
they are chasing his fish.  They drive them along, into the
path of another dolphin, who darts in and rips into the
dorado, turning the water around the raft into churning,
bloody foam.

                     CHUCK
          Stop!

He takes his oar and begins beating the water.  The killing
continues.

                     CHUCK
          You fucking murderers!

Suddenly the water is still.  One dolphin sticks its head out
of the water and stares at Chuck, squeaking.

Another dolphin lifts its head up, then another.  They squeak
to each other, clearly communicating and talking about Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          I know you're talking about me!

He splashes the water with his oar.

They dive, then jump into the air, squeaking as they go.

                     CHUCK
               (very softly)
          Take me with you.

They're gone.

                     CHUCK
          Why me?  Why me, God?

He begins to laugh.

                     BADCHUCK
          Listen to this, Wilson.
               (deep voice: God)
          Because you piss me off.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

Chuck tries to stretch with some simple yoga.  Each movement
takes forever.

He rolls over onto his stomach and tries to do a pushup.  He
can't.  Collapses onto the raft.

                     BADCHUCK
          You're falling apart.

Tries to do another pushup.  Can't.

                     BADCHUCK
          First you eat your fat, then you eat your
          muscle.

He rolls over.

                     BADCHUCK
          Then you eat your mind.

He looks at the ocean.  They're in a line of garbage, a thick
slick of debris dumped off of ships.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Roll on you deep and dark blue ocean
          roll.

He closes his eyes.  After a minute they come open.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I'm late, I'm late, for a very important
          date.

They slowly close again.

                     BADCHUCK
          I'm lost.  Goodbye.

                     GOODCHUCK
          No!

His eyes come open again.

                     BADCHUCK
          Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean
          would feel so good, the water's so soft
          and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.

                     GOODCHUCK
          You quitter you quitter you quitter.

                     BADCHUCK
          The sea is lovely, dark and deep.

                     GOODCHUCK
          But I have promises to keep.
               (rolls over)
          And miles to go before I sleep.
               (props himself up)
          And miles to go before I sleep.
               (purpose now)
          Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.

                     BADCHUCK
          Use the sail for a sea anchor and you
          won't move.

                     GOODCHUCK
          If I don't have a sea anchor I'll
          capsize.

                     BADCHUCK
          Die tomorrow or die today.

He hums Beethoven's fifth.  BA BA BA BUM.

                     BADCHUCK
          That's death knocking, knocking on your
          door.  Crazy little woman come knocking,
          knocking at my front door...

                     GOODCHUCK
          Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other
          people get through a lot worse.

                     BADCHUCK
          Yeah, sure, what?

He hums to himself, begins to sing, Beatles.

                     BADCHUCK
          I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink...

He pulls in the loose sea anchor rope, which is covered with
barnacles.

He scrapes the barnacle off the rope into the water jug, then
sips it.

The sun is setting, huge rays shoot out across the sky.

Out of the empty ocean the Dorados suddenly appear, leaping
flashes of silver right by the raft.

One Dorado swims right by the raft, broadside.

Chuck looks at it, uncomprehending.  Then slowly reaches for
his spear.

                     GOODCHUCK
          What?  Are you sacrificing yourself for
          me?

Carefully he comes to his feet, then shoots the spear into
the fish.

Flapping and struggling, it lands on the deck.  Chuck pounces
on it.

EXT.  RAFT - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

He cuts it open.  The other Dorados ram the raft in fury,
like a lynch mob.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Damn it!  I had to do it!

The banging continues.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I'm sorry!

He concentrates on his work, then sits back on his heels in
amazement.  There's another fish inside.  He holds that fish
up, stares at it, then cuts it open.

There's a smaller fish inside it.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I know there's a moral here, God, but
          right now I'm just going to eat.

He pops out an eyeball, then another, and crunches them
between his teeth.

He takes the heart and liver, starts to eat, then stops.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Forgot to say grace.  Sorry Mom.

He struggles to remember.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts and
          Christ and the bounty about to receive,
          or something...amen.

He eats them.

EXT.  RAFT - NEXT MORNING

Chuck splashes sea water on his face.  Adjusts the water
still.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Please don't leak.  Please.

Chuck picks up the smallest fish.  It's half digested.  He
washes it in the ocean, trigger fish come up and nibble at
his fingers.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Don't look at me.  It was that Dorado.

He cuts the small fish and hangs it on the stays.

                     GOODCHUCK
          You know, Wilson, every now and then we
          should say thank you.  Thank you God.

                     BADCHUCK
          Thank you for fucking up my life.

Suddenly something bumps the raft.  Hard.  Then again.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Not again.

Fins cut the water.  SHARKS.  A big hammerhead bumps the
raft.  BadChuck hums the theme from "Jaws."  Chuck takes his
spear stabs at the shark.

                     BADCHUCK
          He's going to get you, going to get
          you...

Another one circles in, bumps the raft.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Get away from me!

The shark circles again, that big hammerhead like a
nightmare.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Get him get him get him.

He stabs at it with his spear.  He might as well have stabbed
concrete.  The shark circle, Chuck stabs again.

But the shark is gone.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Where are you?  Where are you?

Stabs again and again at the empty ocean.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Stop!  You're using energy.  Move slowly.
          Be patient.

Chuck kneels, wavering, on the raft.  The ocean is calm.

Suddenly, BUMP.  The raft tilts.

Chuck hangs on.

Then a shark appears, just out of spear range.  Its lifeless
black eyes seem to stare right through Chuck.

If the Dorado was a gift from God, this is a message from
Hell.

Then the shark is gone.

EXT.  RAFT - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck lies back on the raft.  He is humming.

                     BADCHUCK
          What are you smiling about?  They'll be
          back.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody
          Hotel.  With Kelly.

He smiles at the thought.

                     GOODCHUCK
          The music ends.  We go back to the table.
          The waiters have brought dinner.  New
          York Strip with Bordelaise Sauce.
          Mushrooms in brown gravy.  Roasted
          potatoes with garlic and rosemary.  Green
          Beans with almonds.  Fresh biscuits and
          cornbread, dripping with butter.  A nice
          salad with ranch dressing.  A jumbo
          shrimp cocktail.

Thinks about that, it spoils the picture.

                     GOODCHUCK
          No shrimp.
               (then)
          We eat.

He closes his eyes.  This is the greatest fantasy.

                     GOODCHUCK
               (as the waiter)
          For dessert, we have pecan pie a la mode,
          we have a double chocolate cake with
          creme anglaise, we have a nice pear
          torte, fresh key lime pie, or perhaps if
          you care to wait a few minutes, a grand
          marnier souffle?

Chuck thinks over the options, thinking of each one.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Why, bring them all, bring them all.

He rolls over.  There, square in his vision, is a ship, its
form coming in and out of a low haze.

Chuck jumps to his feet.  Waves.  Screams.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Here!  Over here!

The ship moves on.  We can see the decks the rigging, the
vastness of it.

Chuck realizes he is naked.  Struggles to pull on the remains
of his pants finally holds them like a diaper with one hand
as he continues to wave.

On the ship no one is to be seen.  It is a spooky sight.

The big tanker moves on.

We are on Chuck's face.  Passed up again.

Then he realizes what is about to happen.  He throws out the
sea anchor.

He throws himself onto the raft and grips it as tight as he
can, wiggles his feet into the ropes.

                     CHUCK
          Oh, shiiiittt!

Then comes the wake of the ship.  It rocks the raft like a
piece of flotsam.  The raft rides high up on the wave, then
shoots down it, but the sea anchor holds, and the raft slows
and rides along with the wave.

And then the sea is calm again.

Slowly Chuck sinks to his knees.  His hand lets loose his
pants.

He lies down on the raft and imagines the conversation with
the ship's captain.

                     CHUCK
          Permission to come aboard, sir.

                     CHUCK/CAPTAIN
          Permission granted.

                     CHUCK
          May I ask, where are you bound?

                     CHUCK/CAPTAIN
          San Francisco.  And you?

                     CHUCK
          As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco
          myself.

                     CHUCK/CAPTAIN
          Would you do us the honor of joining us?
          We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork
          chops and gravy, cranberries, baked
          potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh-
          baked bread, apple pie...

                     CHUCK
          No please, join me.  Some sundried fish
          strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to
          munch on.

The depression comes back again.

                     BADCHUCK
          They're never going to see you.  You're
          just another piece of trash in the ocean.

                     GOODCHUCK
          They're on autopilot.

                     BADCHUCK
          They're always on autopilot.  Or else
          it's night, or you're in the sun, or
          you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll
          never see you.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Damn it!  Don't be so negative!

Chuck picks up Wilson.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Wilson, what's your story?

He holds Wilson close to his chest.

                     BADCHUCK
          I float.  You sink.  End of story.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I'm serious.  I'm always going on about
          me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.

                     BADCHUCK
          It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Shut up.

He lies on the raft and holds Wilson close.

We move up until we see --

EXT.  OCEAN - AERIAL - EVENING

Chuck lying curled up on the raft, Wilson cradled in his
arms, and all around the vast empty ocean.

EXT.  OCEAN - NEXT MORNING

Chuck slowly wakes up.  Sets Wilson aside.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Don't shirk, don't procrastinate, don't
          be lazy.  We're okay today.  We're okay
          today.

And the other Chuck begins to laugh.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Shut up.

The laughter goes on.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Shut the fuck up!  I mean it.

He stands up and checks the horizon.

                     GOODCHUCK
          What's so damn funny?

                     BADCHUCK
          You are.

Suddenly Chuck sees something on the horizon.  A bank of
clouds.  A cone of -- land.

He squints, stares again.  The clouds part.  It looks like --
his island.

Chuck doesn't know whether to feel joy or despair.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Jesus.

                     BADCHUCK
          Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage.

Chuck squints.

                     GOODCHUCK
          It's real.

                     BADCHUCK
          Nothing out there but ocean.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Let's get a second opinion.  Wilson?
          What do you see?

Chuck picks up the soccer ball, holds it up, and stares out
at...ocean.

EXT.  RAFT - DAY - LATER

Chuck slowly writes on the sail.

                     CHUCK
          Chuck Noland.  Born October 8, 1958.
          Died -- pick a date -- July 11, 1998.
          And now the epitaph.  Met deadlines.
          Kept appointments.  Lost without a trace.

He sits back, looks at the mock headstone.

                     BADCHUCK
          What did it matter if FedEx was five
          minutes late one day?  The next day we
          just start over again.

                     GOODCHUCK
          It matters.  We do the best we can,
          that's all we have.

                     BADCHUCK
          Then we've just got shit.

He goes on writing.

                     CHUCK
          I am writing this to remind myself to
          live a better life.  If I am lost,
          perhaps you who find this will be
          instructed to live a better live
          yourself.  Live each day.  Love your
          children.  Don't take anyone for granted.

                     BADCHUCK
          Is that it?  Life is a fucking Disney
          movie?

The waves begin to grow, the ocean turns a slate gray.  Far
above him, great frigate birds circle.  Suddenly one dives on
a booby which has caught a fish.  The great frigate bird
swoops all around the booby until, panicked, it drops the
fish, which plummets toward the sea.

With a graceful dive, the huge bird grabs the fish and then
soars up on a thermal, high into the sky.

Lightning flashes back and forth across the horizon, which is
turning black and dark.  Thunder rolls.

EXT.  RAFT - NIGHT

The raft goes up and down huge waves.  Every few seconds
lightning flashes, illuminating the raft and Chuck holding
desperately to it, his eyes wild with fear.

EXT.  RAFT - MORNING

The waves continue.  Chuck holds on, his face pale.

                     BADCHUCK
          You can't make it.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY - LATER

The sky clears.  The waves are still big.  The fish are back.
And then come the sharks, cutting through the water.  Chuck
can't get up to get his spear, he just has to watch as blood
darkens the water.

And then the sharks are gone.

Chuck comes to his knees slowly, then a big wave hits.
Wilson is swept into the ocean!

For a moment Chuck is uncomprehending.  He watches as Wilson
slowly floats away.

                     CHUCK
          Please, no sharks.

Then he dives in to the water!  Swims frantically after
Wilson.

Wilson floats away from him.  He swims, but he's so weak.
Finally he gets to Wilson.  He reaches out, but only pushes
the ball farther away.

It bobs on the waves.  Chuck treads water, exhausted.

Where is the raft?

                     CHUCK
          Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.

Then he turns back the other way.  The raft has drifted by
him.  He can go after Wilson, or he can go after the raft.

                     CHUCK
          Shit!  Wilson!

He swims toward the raft, barely moving.  No matter how hard
he swims, the raft seems to recede from him.

Finally he reaches it, hangs on the side, breathing hard,
choking, crying.

He struggles to pull himself on board.

But he is weak, so weak.  He can't do it.

Summoning some primitive reserve of strength, he tries again.
This time he slides on.

He lies on the raft, panting.

Then with all his strength he pulls himself to his feet,
holds on to the mast, scans the ocean for Wilson.

                     CHUCK
          Wilson!

Nothing but waves.

This is too much.  Chuck starts to cry.

EXT.  RAFT - DAY - LATER

Chuck takes a swallow of water, washes it around in his
mouth, then swallows.  With his wet tongue he licks his
cracked lips.

The sun breaks through the clouds.

With what strength he has left, Chuck raises the canopy,
fastens it.

He sits in the meager shade, his head between his knees.

Closes his eyes.  Just for a minute.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY - LATER

A different sort of shadow crosses Chuck's face.  He opens
his eyes.

There, riding right beside his raft, is a ship, a huge rusty
tanker.  Someone shouts down in a language we don't
understand.

Chuck sits up, can't believe it.  Struggles to cover himself.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY - LATER

Chuck is lifted up the rusted steel side of the boat in a
Jacob's ladder.

EXT.  SHIP - DAY - LATER

Chuck steps on board, can't support himself.

The crew gathers around.  None of them speak English, but
there is a spontaneous outburst of human connection.

One man brings some water.  Another a blanket.  Another some
warm tea.

Chuck sits there, shivering now.

                     CHUCK
          Thank you.  Oh thank you.

Deliriously happy.  Delirious.

INT.  U.S. NAVAL HOSPITAL - HAWAII

A cavernous hanger-sized ward brightly lit and filled with
row upon row of hospital beds, each with its table, side
chair, and lamp, each with a stainless steel bedpan and
neatly folded sheets and blankets stacked ready to use, and
each completely empty.

Except for one.

And on that bed we see Chuck, in a blue hospital gown.  An IV
drips into his arm.  He plays idly with the remote control of
the bed.  He raises the head, then the foot.  He pushes
another button and the knee rest bends the bed again.

A DOCTOR enters, carrying a thick chart.  Chuck gives him a
big manic grin.  Malcolm MacDowell in "A Clockwork Orange."

                     CHUCK
          My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?

                     DOCTOR
          Under the circumstances your overall
          health is good.  Those salt water boils
          you picked up on the raft are ulcerated,
          but they're healing nicely.

He checks his blood work records.

                     DOCTOR
          Hemoglobin's 10.8 -- you're anemic,
          that's why we're giving you iron.
          Potassium's low -- we're giving you an
          electrolyte solution with your IV.
          Sodium's over 150, way too high.  You may
          experience swelling in your extremities
          as you rehydrate and discharge the salt.
          In spite of your dietary deficiencies
          there's no sign of mental deterioration.

Chuck has been trying not to laugh.  Now he can't stop
himself.

                     DOCTOR
          What's so funny.

Chuck can't seem to help laughing at everything.

                     CHUCK
          Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still
          ache?

                     DOCTOR
          Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency.
          Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the
          above.

                     CHUCK
          All I ate was fish.  That's solid
          protein.

                     DOCTOR
          Protein digestion is very costly in water
          usage.

                     CHUCK
          Which I didn't have.

                     DOCTOR
          And fish are very low in fat, which is
          energy inefficient.  So you're going to
          burn up your own cells no matter how much
          you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and
          pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C,
          so you didn't get scurvy.

Chuck laughs again.

                     CHUCK
          I am one lucky guy.

                     DOCTOR
          Your body chemistry and your exposure to
          the elements would normally lead to
          irritability, depression, anxiety,
          periods of self-reproach.  It's almost
          like schizophrenia.  Different sides of
          your personality might come to life,
          speak out, act out.

                     CHUCK
          But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now.

He starts to laugh again.

                     DOCTOR
          If you say you are.

                     CHUCK
          I most definitely say I am.

                     DOCTOR
          Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the
          Vietnam POW syndrome with you.

Chuck stifles his laughter.

                     CHUCK
          Yes, yes he did.

                     DOCTOR
          You are aware of the potential
          disruptiveness on your loved ones when
          you return to your old life?

                     CHUCK
          Not to mention on me.

The laughter again.  Unsettling.

                     DOCTOR
          You sure you don't want some counseling?

Chuck gives his biggest smile.

                     CHUCK
          Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on
          the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be
          back, I can't tell you.  I just want out
          of here.

                     DOCTOR
          Well, when that IV runs out, you're
          through with us.  Just the dentist
          tomorrow.

INT.  HOSPITAL - NIGHT - LATER

Rolling his IV, Chuck walks very slowly out of the ward.
Every step is an effort.

INT.  PHONE CUBICLE - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

A small windowless room with only a desk and a phone, lit by
a fluorescent lamp.  Chuck is listening to the phone ring.

Kelly answers.

                     KELLY (V.O.)
          Hello.

Chuck is overcome for a moment, can't say a word.

                     KELLY (V.O.)
          Hello?  Hello?

For some reason he can't keep himself from laughing.  He
covers the mouthpiece and laughs.

And then we hear a dial tone, harsh, mechanical, final.

EXT.  PHONE CUBICLE - MINUTES LATER

We can see Chuck inside, staring at the phone.

INT.  PHONE CUBICLE - MINUTES LATER

We hear a faint persistent hum.  Chuck looks around, trying
to locate the sound.  He looks up, focuses on the fluorescent
light, that background sound he can no longer tune out, then
picks up the phone again.

EXT.  PHONE CUBICLE

Stan answers the phone.

                     STAN (V.O.)
          Hello?

                     CHUCK
          Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...

The laughter again.

                     STAN (V.O.)
          Whoever you are, you are one sick fucker.

And again we hear the dial tone.

INT.  PHONE CUBICLE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck's on the phone again.

                     CHUCK
          Two Valium and the Rolling Stones.  That
          ring a bell?

There's a long silence.  Then we hear Stan's voice.

                     STAN (V.O.)
          God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!

                     CHUCK
          It's me.

                     STAN (V.O.)
          You're fucking dead!

                     CHUCK
          I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I
          recall, you're the sick fucker.

Chuck begins to laugh, a little too loud, a little too
shrill.  He's on a high.

EXT.  HAWAII - BEACH RESTAURANT

A terrace by the ocean.  Tables filled with diners.  Food
being delivered by waiters.  So simple, eating.  So taken for
granted.

At one table sits Chuck, dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and
shorts, with a half-dozen plates in front of him.  He
gestures to the waiter.  Bring me more.  It all tastes so
damned good.

Behind him is the ocean.  Chuck doesn't glance at it.

INT.  DENTIST - NEXT DAY

An attractive DENTAL TECHNICIAN with an Australian accent
cleans Chuck's teeth with an ultrasound device.  She's close,
very close.  Chuck looks up at her.  She looks really good.
She smiles at him, then touches the gap where he knocked out
his tooth.

                     TECHNICIAN
          You sure you don't want to have the
          implant done here?  We do quite good
          work.

Chuck shakes his head:  no.  She scrapes behind his front
teeth.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Hmmm, you do have such a lot of tarter
          behind these front incisors.  A little
          wider, please.

Chuck opens his mouth even further.  The technician talks on
in the self-absorbed way dental technicians sometimes do,
that constant babble of human contact which Chuck has not
heard for four years.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Anyway, so the second prosthetic foot
          worked better, but he still couldn't
          drive his new Cortina, it being a
          standard shift, if you follow me.

Chuck nods.  I follow you.

                     TECHNICIAN
          But would he hear of me driving him
          around?  Not on your bloody life.  Rinse
          please.

Chuck does.  Stan bursts into the room.

                     STAN
          Chuck!  God damn!

Chuck struggles out of the chair.

                     STAN
          God damn.  God damn.  God damn.

They are both almost overcome.  Stan holds Chuck by the
shoulders and looks at him.

                     STAN
          You're alive, you're fucking alive!

Chuck laughs, thrilled to see Stan.

                     CHUCK
          I beat the odds!

                     STAN
          You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!

                     TECHNICIAN
          I still need to floss you.

Stan notices the technician.

                     STAN
          Hello.

                     CHUCK
          This is Amber.  Her boyfriend lost his
          foot in a shark attack.

He says this with an absolute straight face, holding back the
laughter with great effort.  Instantly there's this
connection again between him and Stan.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Ex-boyfriend.

                     STAN
          Really.

And he and Chuck make eye contact and we see a glimpse of
their shared unspoken irony.

                     STAN
          Uh, there's somebody out here who wants
          to see you.

Chuck stares sharply at him.  Kelly?  Stan nods, but there's
something he wants to say.

                     STAN
          She thought you were dead.  We all did.

That's not all Stan wants to say.  But Chuck is limping out
the door.

INT.  DENTIST - WAITING ROOM

Typical dentist waiting room.  Chairs, tropical fish tanks,
magazines, a few waiting patients...and Kelly, looking
nervous.

Slowly and painfully Chuck enters.  He's quite a sight.  She
stands up.  There's a long moment where they look at each
other.

Then she comes into his arms.  Holds him tight.  She's part
laughing, part crying.

                     KELLY
          I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

                     CHUCK
          Hey...hey...it's okay!

Chuck is happy, he's still riding the high.

                     KELLY
          You're so thin.  Am I hurting you?

Well, maybe a little, but who cares?  He hasn't been hugged
or barely touched in so long.

                     CHUCK
          No...no...feels good...

She disengages, looks at him with that old smile.

                     KELLY
          Right back, you said you'd be right back.

                     CHUCK
          A few things came up.  Or went down.

He meets her gaze, looks her over with a smile.

                     CHUCK
          You look...wonderful.  I like your hair.

He notices the ring on her hand.

                     KELLY
          I got married.

                     CHUCK
          I thought you might have.

                     KELLY
          I would never --

                     CHUCK
          I know.

                     KELLY
          If I'd known you were alive --

                     CHUCK
          I would have done the same thing.

His responses come so quick.  Chuck seems blissfully sure of
himself.

                     KELLY
          I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One
          day Gary was there.  He took care of
          everything.  He took care of me.  I was a
          mess.

                     CHUCK
          You have any children?

Kelly nods.

                     CHUCK
          Got a picture?

Kelly fishes for a photo, shows it to Chuck.  It's a little
girl with a dog.

                     KELLY
          Her name's Hannah.

                     CHUCK
          Is that Jango?

                     KELLY
          No, this is Jack.  Jango was hit by a UPS
          truck.  Can you believe it?

Chuck laughs.  It is funny, sort of.

                     CHUCK
          Life's just one big joke after another.

Stan appears, takes in the scene.  The few patients waiting
are edged into the corners, trying to look occupied with
something else.

                     STAN
          How about we go somewhere else?

                     CHUCK
          Want to see my raft?

EXT.  HAWAII - DAY

Chuck's raft sits up on a dock.  Kelly stands staring at it.
How small and fragile it looks.

                     STAN
          This stinks really bad.

                     CHUCK
          You should have smelled me.

Stan examines the ropes around the logs.

                     STAN
          Cool ropes.

                     CHUCK
          I braided them.

                     STAN
          Must have taken a hell of a long time.

                     CHUCK
          Time I had lots of.

Kelly points at something on the raft.

                     KELLY
          What's that?

                     CHUCK
          That's my sea anchor.  My second one.
          Made it out of part of the sail.  It
          keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In
          theory.
               (picks up his still)
          And this, this I used to collect water.
          About half a cup a day.

He's not feeling sorry for himself.  It's just a fact.

                     STAN
          You were how long on this?

                     CHUCK
          Forty-three days.

They look at the tiny raft.  It speaks for itself.

                     KELLY
          All that time I waited to go on a cruise,
          and you went without me.

                     CHUCK
          Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.

Kelly notices the sail, sees the writing on it.

                     KELLY
          What's that, written on the sail?

                     CHUCK
          My epitaph.

Kelly reads it to herself.  Her eyes are moist.

                     CHUCK
          Bad body chemistry.  Made me a little
          morbid.  But I'm all over that now.

And he seems really to believe it.

                     STAN
          I'll be at the car.
               (to Kelly)
          Take you to the airport.

And he leaves.

                     KELLY
          I buried you, Chuck.  They had to pry my
          fingers off your coffin.

This interests Chuck to no end.

                     CHUCK
          There was a coffin?

                     KELLY
          Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.

                     CHUCK
          What was inside?

                     KELLY
          Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo
          pig sooey hat, some pictures of that
          ketch you wanted.

                     CHUCK
          That about sums it up.

                     KELLY
          Maybe now's when you tell me about it.

                     CHUCK
          The plane went down.  My friends died.  I
          washed up on an island.  Then I found
          these barrels, built the raft, and here I
          am.

                     KELLY
          Yeah?

                     CHUCK
          The tide came in, the tide went out.  I
          survived.  That's the headline.  I
          survived.

                     KELLY
          Don't overwhelm me with the details.
               (she smiles remembering)
          You know how I hate that.

He tries to put it into words, isn't quite sure how.

                     KELLY
               (gently)
          Come on.  Try.

                     CHUCK
          Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for
          granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff.
          Live each day like it's your last.

                     KELLY
          So simple to say, so hard to do.

                     CHUCK
          Not when you have no choice.

Kelly looks down at the raft.  It's so small.

                     KELLY
          You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand
          it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged
          into something.

                     CHUCK
          I didn't know what really being alone
          was.  No one back here does.

He has something more to say.  She waits.

                     CHUCK
          We're not meant to be alone.  Not like
          that.  Share life, that's what came to me
          out there.  Be with someone.

And that's the point, isn't it?  We are social animals.  No
man is an island.

                     KELLY
          This is so unfair.

                     CHUCK
          That's what I told the fish I caught.
          But I ate them anyway.

And the laughter comes again.  Kelly grins, embarrassed, a
little worried.

                     KELLY
          You okay?

                     CHUCK
          Great.  Really.

She stares at his face, reaches out, touches it again, this
time with great tenderness.

He nods, her touch feels so good.

A wave of emotion comes over her:  pity?  love?

                     KELLY
          What will you do?

                     CHUCK
          I don't know.  I really don't know.

We hear a distant beep-beep, discrete as a car horn can be.

                     KELLY
          I've got to get back to Memphis.
          Hannah's babysitter has finals.

                     CHUCK
          It means a lot...that you came.

                     KELLY
          I had to come.  To be sure you were okay.

They hold each other.  For a long time.

                     KELLY
          I love you, Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          You too.

                     KELLY
          I'm so glad you're alive.

Chuck grins.

                     CHUCK
          You too.

Then she heads for the waiting car.  Chuck stands by his
raft, watching her go.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

Chuck and Stan ride on the plane.  Chuck is coming down off
his survival high.  He has the Angel Wing FedEx package with
him.

                     STAN
          When I first showed up, I thought you'd
          lost your fucking marbles.

                     CHUCK
          I never thought it would end.  Then it
          did.  It was so great to be saved, I
          couldn't stop laughing.

Stan pulls a flask out of his bag.

                     STAN
          You need a drink.

Stan takes two glasses from his bag, rests them on a FedEx
container, and pours the whiskey.

                     CHUCK
          For years my only drinking buddy was a
          soccer ball.  Wilson.

Stan hoists his glass.

                     STAN
          To Wilson.

                     CHUCK
          To Wilson.

Now's when Stan gets to the question he's been wanting to
ask, that Kelly wanted to know, that we all want to know.

                     STAN
          So, what's it all about?

Chuck stares at him.

                     STAN
          You've been over the line and you came
          back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!

                     CHUCK
          Hallelujah.

Stan looks over at him.

                     STAN
          I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big
          picture, the words in neon...

                     CHUCK
          What's it all about?  It's about being so
          thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to
          suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what
          it's about.

Stan sits back, repulsed but relieved.

                     STAN
          Do what it takes.  That's what I always
          told you.

He pours another drink.

                     STAN
          To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a
          joke.

                     CHUCK
          To life.

                     STAN
          That's all there is.

                     CHUCK
          Believe me I know.

He takes a sip of his drink, just savoring it, thinking.

                     CHUCK
          But it's not being bold or being in the
          game or rolling the dice.

All those things Stan used to tell him.

                     CHUCK
          When I was going crazy, on the raft, I'd
          argue with myself about everything.
          Because everything had a price.  To get
          anything -- a sip of water, a little
          corner of shade, an hour's sleep -- I had
          to let go of something else.  And then I
          could never get it back.

He thinks some more.

                     CHUCK
          You don't win or lose.  You win and lose.

He looks out the window.

                     CHUCK
          You win and lose.

And Chuck has.  Big time.

EXT.  MEMPHIS AIRPORT - NIGHT

A FedEx MD-11 lands.

EXT.  MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - MOMENTS LATER

The MD-11 taxis up.  As usual, the SuperHub is a frenzy of
activity.  A loading crew stands ready, forklifts poised.
Even this plane carries packages.

PHIL STEELE, the chairman of FedEx, Leslie, Becca, Dick, and
other executives wait on a special podium near the gangway.
Everyone looks different -- older, a mustache here, a
thickening around the belly there.

Behind a barrier a cluster of cameras film the scene.

The plane cuts its engine.  The stairs are rolled out.
Forklifts and gangways move forward.  Cargo doors open.
Chuck appears in the door.  He holds the FedEx Package and a
small travel bag.

Chuck blinks against the lights and the glare.  Stan is right
by him.  Everyone bursts into APPLAUSE AND CHEERING.

After four years of total solitude this is completely
overwhelming.

                     STAN
          Smile.

Chuck smiles.

                     STAN
          Wave.

And Chuck waves.  He's overwhelmed by all the input.  Stan
steers Chuck down the steps as the cheers continue.

At the bottom of the steps Roger steps forward.  The two
brothers embrace each other.  After a moment Roger
disengages.  Mary gives Chuck a hug.

                     MARY
          Oh Chuck --

                     CHUCK
          Where's Mom?

                     ROGER
          Waiting for you.  At the farm.  This was
          too much --

He looks around at the crowds.

                     CHUCK
          Tell me about it.

Stan nudges Chuck.  Time to go to the podium.

                     ROGER
          Glad you made it, big brother.

Stan and Chuck head for the podium.  All the loaders and
operators and package scanners begin to applaud.  Chuck
smiles, then laughs, getting into the emotion.  He keeps up
an almost indecipherable babble underneath the cheering.
Occasionally he sees someone he knows.

                     CHUCK
          Wow.  Thank you.  Great.  Thank you.
          Hey, Rasheed, how you doing?  Thank you
          all.

EXT.  SUPERHUB - WIDE

Chuck makes his triumphant way through this amazing
collection of cheering people like Moses parting the Red Sea.

EXT.  SUPERHUB - PLATFORM

With a big smile Phil Steele holds out his hand to Chuck.

                     STEELE
          Welcome home.

He steps to the microphone and addresses the SuperHub.

                     STEELE
          This is an extraordinary moment.  And it
          should be marked in an extraordinary way.
          With something we have never done since
          this company was founded.
               (pause)
          Stop the line!

EXT.  SUPERHUB - SERIES OF SHOTS

All over the SuperHub, belts come to a halt.  Forklifts stop.
Tracking stations shut down.  The vast flow of packages is
suddenly still.  The incredible din of activity is suddenly
quiet.  The stillness and the silence are unexpected and
palpable.  Thousands of workers stop as well, staring either
up at Chuck directly or at his image on video screens.  We
hear Phil's voice piped in.

EXT.  SUPERHUB - PLATFORM

Phil holds a plaque.

                     STEELE
          Four years ago we placed this plaque in
          honor of Charles Noland, and two just
          like it in honor of Al Morris and John
          Durham, the two brave pilots who went
          down with him.

As he talks, we stay on Chuck, who is taking in this amazing
scene, not really listening.

                     STEELE
          Chuck endured years of hardship and
          loneliness.  Like Lazarus, Chuck has come
          back from the dead.  Chuck, this is your
          family, all of us.  So it gives me great
          pleasure...to take this plaque...and to
          present it to our long lost son.  Welcome
          home.

He hands the plaque to Chuck.  Chuck acknowledges the cheers
of the crowd.

                     CHUCK
          Thank you.  Thank you very much...

Everyone applauds.

                     CHUCK
          Give me a minute.  I've spent four years
          looking out at an empty ocean.

He laughs, a short brittle laugh, composes himself.

                     CHUCK
          It's all so -- big.  You never think
          you'll miss -- all this.  But I did.  I
          really, really did.  And I missed all of
          you.

He looks over at the hub.

                     CHUCK
          You've added some new belts, and what's
          that?

He points at some high tech equipment on the edge of the
shed.

                     STAN
          Digital laser readers.

                     CHUCK
          Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.

He looks around at everyone, doesn't know what else to say.

                     CHUCK
          I've never heard it this quiet.
          Shouldn't you all be getting back to
          work?

The tension is broken.  Everyone laughs.  Phil Steele motions
with his hand.  Let it be done.

ANOTHER ANGLE - WIDE

The vast, incredible machinery creaks to a start.  Everyone
shakes Chuck's hand as he leaves the podium.

As he heads for the car, REPORTERS shout questions.

INT.  CAR - MEMPHIS FREEWAY

We are assaulted by a surge of light, motion, activity.
Snaking lines of traffic in both directions, big overpasses,
the city rising beyond.

Stan drives with a certain aggressiveness.  Chuck looks out
at the traffic, at all the activity, at the vast intricate
anthill of humanity going everywhere and nowhere.

                     CHUCK
          Take your time.

                     STAN
          What?

                     CHUCK
          That's what it's about.

                     STAN
          Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get
          it.

He swerves into another lane.

                     CHUCK
          Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it.
          Live it.

                     STAN
          Deep, real deep.

He grins, cuts across to the exit.

                     STAN
          So where to?  The office?  The hotel?
          The beach?

Chuck stares at him.  Are you kidding?

                     STAN
          What, then?

                     CHUCK
          Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.

                     STAN
               (re: the package)
          You want that delivered, we'll deliver
          it.  That's what we do.

                     CHUCK
          I need to do it.

                     STAN
          Finish what you started.  You haven't
          changed, Chuck.  It's still you.

Right.

                     CHUCK
          You want to help, help me find the woman
          who sent this.

INT.  OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY

Stan and Chuck are in the office of a TECHNICIAN who is
working away at his computer.  The Technician pulls the bar
code from the Angel Wing FedEx box up on his computer screen.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts
          to tape storage, which is okay because we
          access it through the CPC.  Here it is.
               (gestures at computer map)
          Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku.
          Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a
          real road warrior.  This package was
          Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account
          after this package.  No forwarding
          addresses after K.L.

                     CHUCK
          What about the sender?

                     TECHNICIAN
          Sure.  Bettina Peterson.  Marfa, Texas.
          Let's run a current check.

He works some keys, waits.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville,
          North Carolina, then...canceled her
          account.

                     CHUCK
          Can you find her?

                     TECHNICIAN
          You're looking at a Level III search.
          For your Level III, you gotta have E-4
          authorization.  I don't have it.

                     STAN
          I do.

He holds out a badge.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Okay, let's let it rip.

He starts to pull up the data.

                     CHUCK
          Thanks.  For everything.

                     STAN
          No sweat.

EXT.  CHUCK'S MOTEL - THAT NIGHT

Chuck leaves the motel, the Angel Box under his arm.  He ties
it into a pannier on the side of a bicycle.

EXT.  MEMPHIS - CHICKASAW GARDENS - NIGHT

Chuck sneaks up to a craftsman cottage and stands by a tree
with a swing on it.  Inside we see Kelly making dinner for
her husband, who plays with their daughter.  For a moment
Chuck watches through the window, and we watch with him.
Then the dog begins to bark.

EXT.  CEMETERY - NIGHT

Chuck walks through the cemetery late at night.  He comes to
his gravestone, stares for a long moment at the inscription,
then takes out a spray can of paint and puts a HANDPRINT on
it.

He gets back on his bicycle and rides away.

EXT.  HIGHWAY - DAY

Chuck rides his bicycle down a road leading into the South.

EXT.  FREEWAY - DAY

Chuck negotiates an overpass crossing an Interstate Highway.
Headed in both directions, cars whoosh by beneath him.

EXT.  HIGHWAY - DUSK - LATER

Chuck rides down a narrow road, shrouded in mist.  Moss drips
from the trees reaching over the road.  A car goes by.  Then
another, their lights like halos in the fog.  It's a mystical
scene, a passage.

EXT.  ARKANSAS - NIGHT

Chuck gets off his bicycle in the rain and walks toward a
roadside cafe.

INT.  CAFE - NIGHT

Chuck draws on a paper place mat as he waits for his meal at
a counter.  Above the counter the television plays.

                     ANNOUNCER
          And here's more from Dingo Dodd, our
          Australian correspondent, on the
          extraordinary story of Chuck Noland, the
          modern Robinson Crusoe.

The waitress sets a plate down in front of Chuck, turns to
watch.

On the TV we see an Australian correspondent standing on
Chuck's beach.

                     DINGO DODD
          Shark infested waters!  A deserted
          island!  Surrounded by reefs!  Accessible
          only by helicopter!  For four years Chuck
          Noland survived here alone, eating fish,
          coconuts and clams, his only companion a
          soccer ball.

Chuck is staring at the screen, seeing his cave, seeing all
those years.

                     DINGO DODD
          I'm now in Chuck's cave where he passed
          the lonely nights, painting on the walls
          like some prehistoric caveman.  What did
          Chuck feel?  These paintings tell the
          story, but only Chuck knows what they
          mean.  And he's not talking.

On the screen we see a photograph of Chuck.

The waitress looks over at Chuck.  The other clients look at
him too.

                     CHUCK
          Check, please.

The waitress comes over.

                     WAITRESS
          No charge, honey.  But could you just
          sign that place mat for me?

Chuck looks down at his doodling.  Hesitates.  Then signs his
name.

INT.  TYSON'S CHICKEN - ARKANSAS - DAY

Thousands of chicken carcasses hanging on hooks circle
through the huge processing plant, a vast structure on the
scale of the SuperHub or the Hospital.

Chuck's Mom, dressed in white with a hairnet, enters a
windowed office in the b.g.  Through the window we see her
hug Chuck.

INT.  TYSON'S CHICKEN - OFFICE - ARKANSAS - DAY

We are in the office now.  Chuck's Mom's eyes are moist.

                     CHUCK
          When'd you start working here?

                     MOM
          Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing
          anything, and -- but you're back, you're
          really back.  I would have come to
          Memphis, but --

                     CHUCK
          I wanted to come here.

INT.  FRAME HOUSE - ARKANSAS - DAY

Chuck eats a Southern fried drumstick.  The table is full of
home-cooked food.

                     MOM
          Have some more potato salad.

Chuck gestures, no, I'm full.  She puts down the spoon.

                     CHUCK
          That was great, Mom, just great.

He looks around the house, everything in its place.  His
mother has been here for forty years.  There's a big crack
running down from the ceiling.

                     CHUCK
          I've got all this back pay coming.  Why
          don't you let me get you a place in town?

                     MOM
          This is my home.  I'm part of the
          wallpaper.

She studies him for a moment.

                     MOM
          You miss it, don't you?  You miss that
          island.

He does, but that's not it entirely.

                     CHUCK
          Miss that island?  Mom, come on.

She looks at him.  She knows her boy.

                     MOM
          What a journey you've had.  It seems more
          than a person should have to bear.

                     CHUCK
          The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it.
          I'm just wondering where it will take me
          next.

She looks at him, thinks about this.

                     MOM
          Remember the family motto.  In time.  It
          will come to you, in time.

EXT.  ARKANSAS - DAY

Chuck rides away from the small neat frame house, down a
country lane with trailers up on blocks.

EXT.  GULF COAST - DAY

Chuck leaves a cheap motel as the sun comes up.

EXT.  MISSISSIPPI GULF COAST - DAY - LATER

Chuck rides on a ferry, the wind blowing his face.  The sky
is gray and drizzly.  He smells the salt water.  Watches the
waves.

EXT.  GAS STATION - DAY

Chuck asks for directions.  A kid in baggy pants and no shirt
points him down the road.

EXT.  GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck pulls some clothes out of his saddle bags.

EXT.  GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck emerges from the restroom wearing a FedEx shirt and
shorts.

EXT.  BEACH HOUSE - HOUR LATER

A classic beach house.  Sand dunes, stilts.  Carrying the
Angel Wing Box under his arm, Chuck checks the address in his
hand.  Mounts the steps.  A light mist falls.  You can see
the Gulf behind the house, gray and moody.

A WOMAN, BETTINA, answers the door -- THE woman from the
beginning.  She wears cut-off jeans and a blue work shirt
covered with paint.  There's a tattoo on her ankle.

                     CHUCK
          FedEx for Bettina Peterson.

The woman stares in disbelief at the package she hasn't seen
in years and never expected to see again.

                     BETTINA
          Where did you get that?

Chuck displays a FedEx badge.

                     CHUCK
          Charles Noland.  FedEx Special Projects.

Bettina notices Chuck's bicycle.

                     BETTINA
          You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so
          late.

                     CHUCK
          There was an unavoidable delay.

Bettina stares at the package, her own memories coming back.

                     BETTINA
          Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You
          never gave up.

                     CHUCK
          No.

She holds the box and studies him for a long moment.
Something -- the look on his face, the extraordinary
reappearance of this long-lost package -- makes her curious.

                     BETTINA
          You know what happened to this?

                     CHUCK
          As much as anybody.

                     BETTINA
          Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.

                     CHUCK
          Okay.  Sure.

She lets Chuck in the door.

INT.  HOUSE - DAY

Ladders.  Scaffolds.  Huge paintings are everywhere.
Paintings of wings and angels -- like the package.  Chuck
stares at them.  Bettina watches Chuck stare.

                     BETTINA
          I've got some coffee on.  Would you like
          some?

INT.  KITCHEN - LATER

Bettina pours some coffee.  The package sits in the counter.
Some magazines are spread around, including a People Magazine
with Chuck's photograph on the cover.

                     CHUCK
               (takes a sip)
          It's good.

They smile awkwardly at each other.  She starts to open it.

                     BETTINA
          Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten
          wet.

                     CHUCK
          Possible.  So you did those wings?

                     BETTINA
          Yeah.  A long time ago.

                     CHUCK
          They're harder to do than they look.

                     BETTINA
          Oh?  You've tried?

                     CHUCK
          Well, I do a little drawing --

She's opened the package.  She pulls out the bottles of salsa
and the letter.

                     CHUCK
          Our apologies that it never made it to
          the recipient.

                     BETTINA
          He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry
          I ever married him.

There is a moment where neither knows what to say.

                     BETTINA
          You look familiar.

Her eyes start to register recognition.  She glances at the
magazine with Chuck's picture on it.  She picks it up.

                     BETTINA
          I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They
          are... You're a gifted artist.  You're
          into something very powerful.  Primal.
          Truly.

                     CHUCK
          Well, not really, I --

                     BETTINA
          You are.  Yes you are.
               (so many things she wants to
                say)
          What gave you the idea to paint on that
          cave?

Chuck thinks about that.  After a moment, he grins.

                     CHUCK
          To tell you the truth -- you did.

                     BETTINA
          Do you...have any more packages to
          deliver?

                     CHUCK
          No.  that was the last one.

                     BETTINA
          Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.

Chuck sits back on the couch, taking in the sight of the
ocean in the light rain.  He looks over at all the canvases,
the easel, the palettes.  The wind rustles the palm trees
around the house.  The surf crashes and rustles.  Familiar
sounds.  Island sounds.

He relaxes a little.  Maybe the package with the wings was a
sign, he kept it all these years precisely for this.  Then
there's a sound of a truck in the driveway.

The engine cuts off.  There are steps on the porch.  The door
opens.  A tanned muscular MAN in neatly kept work clothes
comes in, hangs a tool belt on a hook by the door.

He looks at Chuck with a relaxed, even stare, as if seeing a
man in a FedEx uniform sitting on his couch is not an unusual
occurrence.

                     MAN
          Hey.

                     CHUCK
          Hey.

                     BETTINA (O.S.)
          In here!

The Man nods at Chuck, goes into the kitchen.  We are on
Chuck's face.  Who's this?  We hear muffled laughter from
inside.

EXT.  BEACH HOUSE - HOUR LATER

Arms around each other, the Man and the Woman say goodbye to
Chuck.  In the front yard is a panel truck painted with two
angel wings.  The Man grins at Chuck, an easy, friendly grin.

                     MAN
          Come back anytime.  Coffee's always on.
          Don't even have to bring us a package.

                     CHUCK
          That was my last one.

Bettina hands Chuck a sheet of paper.

                     BETTINA
          The list of paints and brushes I did for
          you.

He takes it, not exactly sure he wants it.

                     BETTINA
          Keep painting.  Promise me.

                     CHUCK
          Sure.

EXT.  BEACH HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck rides his bicycle away, along the shore.

EXT.  BEACH - MINUTES LATER

Chuck rides along the beach.  Up ahead we see a FedEx truck.

EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck gets off his bike as a female FEDEX DRIVER puts chocks
under the wheels, which have stuck in the sand.

                     CHUCK
          Need some help?

                     DRIVER
          You bet I do.  High tide comes right up
          to this road.

EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck pushes on the truck as the driver gives it gas.  The
truck slowly pulls back onto the pavement.

EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

The Driver gets out of the truck with a grin.  She has an
open, friendly face.  There's an instant connection between
them.

                     DRIVER
          Hey, thanks.  I'd never have got that out
          by myself.

Looks at his uniform.  At the bike.

                     DRIVER
          You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?

                     CHUCK
          No.

Where is he from, anyway?

                     CHUCK
          I used to drive one of those.  A long
          time ago.

                     DRIVER
          Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You
          want a lift?  I've just got one more
          pickup.

                     CHUCK
          Sure.

He picks up his bike.

INT.  FEDEX TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

The FedEx truck makes its way down the beach, Chuck in his
uniform, the Driver in hers.  Two FedEx people in a truck.
The Driver looks over at Chuck.

                     DRIVER
          You're Chuck Noland.

                     CHUCK
          Yeah.

                     DRIVER/ERICA
          I knew it!  You're a legend!  Mr.
          Robinson Crusoe.

                     CHUCK
          Well --

                     ERICA
          I knew I recognized you.  My name's
          Erica.

They smile at each other.  Then she smiles a little more.

                     ERICA
          Did you really steal a crippled kid's
          bicycle to make your deliveries, or is
          that just some bullshit story?

                     CHUCK
          I didn't steal it, and he wasn't
          crippled.

Erica laughs.

                     ERICA
          Otherwise it's completely true.

And that makes Chuck laugh, really laugh, for the first time.

                     CHUCK
          Yeah, completely.

She looks over at him with a grin.

                     ERICA
          What brings you out to the sticks?

                     CHUCK
          Had a package to deliver.

                     ERICA
          You?  Personally?

                     CHUCK
          I had it on the island with me.

                     ERICA
          Must be a story there.

There's a connection building here, effortlessly.

EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

We are wide on the beach, watching the truck move along the
water, kicking up wisps of sand.

                     CHUCK (V.O.)
          Yeah, a long one.

                     ERICA (V.O.)
          I've got lots of time.

                     CHUCK (V.O.)
          So do I.

The truck goes down the beach and then turns inland, away
from the ocean.  Away from all that.

                     CHUCK (V.O.)
          So do I.

And we pull back, taking in the sweep of the beach, the
estuaries, and the green forest stretching back into America.

The end is the beginning.

FADE OUT.
CAST AWAY

                                               THIRD DRAFT

                                               March 13, 1998




FADE IN:

EXT.  MARFA, TEXAS - 1993 - WIDE - DAY

The Texas plains, horizon to horizon, nothing but the browns
and ochres of earth and the blue and violet of the sky.  The
sheer scope of it sinks in:  the blank slate of nature, the
absence of man.  On the screen superimpose:

                    MARFA, TEXAS, 1993.

CREDITS BEGIN.

A plume of dust comes into frame.  The dust is from a TRUCK,
orange and white and violet, with "FedEx" blazoned across the
side.

The truck turns into a collection of ramshackle World War II
era Quonset huts and outbuildings.  Around the outbuildings
are large sculptures of wood and metal.

EXT.  QUONSET HUT - DAY

The door is opened by a WOMAN in her late twenties.  Hair
pulled back, casual, an artist.  She hands the DRIVER a FedEx
BOX which is decorated with a drawing of two ANGEL WINGS.
The Driver has a hand-held computer; a portable printer
dangles from his belt.

The Driver scans the package with his hand-held computer,
prints out a label and sticks it on the Box, ready to go.
But something on the box catches her eye.  She wants it back.
He glances at his watch.  She draws RINGS around the Wings,
uniting them.  She gives the box to the Driver, then hands
him a cup of coffee.  They've done this before.

He takes a sip of the coffee, then runs for the truck.  He
jumps in and heads back onto the plains.

EXT.  FEDEX OFFICE - MIDLAND/ODESSA - NIGHT - HOURS LATER

The Driver jams the distinctive Angel Wing Box on top of a
dolly and loads it into a CONTAINER with clear plastic sides.
A female Loader slaps a large bar code label on the
container, scans it, then pulls the container across a belt
of rollers onto a larger truck.  The doors of the truck
close.  The latch slams down.

A forklift hoists the container to the cargo doors of a 737.

EXT.  MEMPHIS AIRPORT SUPERHUB - NIGHT

The 737 lands.

EXT.  SUPERHUB - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

One of a seemingly endless line of FedEx planes, our 737
taxis to a gate at the FedEx SUPERHUB.  The Hub is a vast
living organism -- loud, complex, overwhelming, as much a
symbol of modern life as was the factory in Modern Times.

Five thousand people work in a frenzy of interconnected
activity inside three vast hangers brightly lit.  Hundreds of
forklifts and cargo-pullers dart about, their headlights
crisscrossing like a laser show.

Loaders quickly roll the container onto a FORKLIFT.

INT.  MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - NIGHT

The forklift speeds inside one of the hangers to a LOADING
BELT, where our Box is spilled into a Mississippi River of
packages, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of them, all shapes and
sizes, from shoe boxes to engine blocks.  Large mechanical
arms divert the immense flow of Workers at dozens of
stations.  The packages surge and move.

The Workers place the packages label-side-up on new belts,
where they're scanned by laser readers.  Picking up speed our
Box is shunted across the acres of interlocking belts.

The Box ends up in a much larger CONTAINER labeled CDG.

EXT.  MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - NIGHT

A forklift lifts the Container to a door on a giant MD-11.

INT.  GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT

A jumbled room jammed with computers and dominated by a HUGE
WALL GRAPHIC that charts hundreds of airplanes.  An Operator
moves a yellow strip labeled Jumbo 12 across the board.

EXT.  CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - DAY

SERIES OF SHOTS

The giant place touches down in Paris.  The Angel Wing Box
moves quickly on another belt and disappears into another
CONTAINER, which is loaded onto still another AIRPLANE.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG AIRPORT, RUSSIA - NIGHT

The plane lands.  The container is unloaded down a belt.  We
see our Angel Box.  Directly in front of it is a DENTED BOX.

INT.  ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICE, RUSSIA

SERIES OF SHOTS

Night.  The manic activity has come to a dead stop.  Our two
Boxes sit on a table in a corner not far from a small
Christmas tree.

Daylight now.  YURI, a Supervisor, saunters over, picks up
the Angel Box, sees an attractive co-worker, puts it down.

Night again.  A cat walks by the table where our two Boxes
have come to rest.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICE - DAY

A FedEx truck pulls out of the warehouse.  The walls of the
warehouse are covered with graffiti.  The streets are slushy,
the buildings blanketed in snow.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG - DAY

The Driver sits in the truck drinking tea.  He takes a last
sip, sighs, gets out with the Angel Box.  Walks slowly toward
an APARTMENT HOUSE.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG APARTMENT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

A beautiful young RUSSIAN WOMAN opens the door.  A young
AMERICAN MAN comes up behind her, signs the form and takes
the Angel Box.  We see Christmas decorations inside.  The
woman puts her arms around him as the door closes.

                     RUSSIAN WOMAN (O.S.)
               (accented English)
          It's pretty.  Who is it from?

                     AMERICAN MAN (O.S.)
          My wife.

We stay with the Driver as he ambles back toward the truck.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

The Driver has just delivered the Dented Box to ALEKSEI,
Russian Businessman, who closes the door of a Czarist-era
building.  Aleksei checks his watch, picks up the phone.

EXT.  FEDEX OFFICES - MANILA - DAY

CHUCK NOLAND, early thirties, walks along a line of brightly
colored jitneys, each bearing the FedEx logo.  With him is a
Filipino FedEx SUPERVISOR wearing a guayabera.  Chuck
glistens with a thin layer of sweat.

                     CHUCK
          My guess is we're talking fuel filters
          here, Fernando.  The gas is dirty, these
          jitneys get in the mountains, their
          engines cut out.

                     FERNANDO
          That could lose us half an hour.

                     CHUCK
          Easy.  Each way.

His beeper goes off.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - MANILA - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck is on the phone.

                     CHUCK
          So it finally turned up...

Chuck hesitates for a moment, then looks at his watch.

                     CHUCK
          I'll catch the sweep tonight.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

Strapped into the jump seat behind the pilots, Chuck sleeps
with a mask over his eyes.  On his lap are some travel
brochures.  We see sailboats, we see the Florida keys.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICES - DAY

Christmas in Russia.  Snow everywhere.  Brightly colored
lights.  Chucks gets out of a Volga with Aleksei.  He has a
bag over his shoulder, the dented package under one arm.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - DAY

The staff has assembled near the loading dock.  Yuri the
station manager stands in front, occasionally catching the
eye of the attractive woman.  Chuck displays the FedEx box.

                     CHUCK
          It took this test package thirty-two
          hours to get from Seattle to St.
          Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand
          miles.  And then it took forty-one hours
          to get from our warehouse in St.
          Petersburg to here, a distance of,
          what --

                     ALEKSEI
          Six kilometers.  Four miles.

                     CHUCK
          So how are we going to get this place
          shaped up?

There's a muttered chorus of answers.

                     CHUCK
          There's only one way.  We have to work
          together.  Every one of us depends on
          everyone else.  If one package is late,
          we are all late.  If one truck misses the
          deadline, we all miss the deadline.
          Let's start by taking a look around.

Chuck leads his team through the sorting area.  Yuri squeezes
right next to him, ostentatiously carrying a clipboard.
Chuck stops.

                     CHUCK
          Here, this table is too far from the
          wall.  Packages can slip down...like...
               (pulls out a package from
                behind a table)
          ...this.

He hefts the package, as if trying to guess what's inside.

                     CHUCK
          What could be in here?  Let's say one of
          you sent it.  Could be the closing papers
          on your dacha, could be a toy for your
          grandson's birthday, could be a kidney to
          keep your mother alive.  I don't think
          you want your mother's kidney to end up
          behind a table.

The Sorter shoves the table against the wall.  Yuri says
something to the Translator.

                     TRANSLATOR
          He says they have been very busy.  It is
          hard to get good employees.  He is sure
          you understand.

Wrong answer:  Chuck glances sharply at Yuri.  Aleksei
appears with a cellular phone.

                     ALEKSEI
          Phone call.  Malaysia.

Chuck takes the phone, opening his BAG as he does so.

                     CHUCK
          Kamal?  Right.  I'm getting them.

He pulls out a set of blueprints and tacks them to a bulletin
board as he talks.

                     CHUCK
          I'm looking at the blueprints of K.L.
          right now.  The belts are too small for
          the sorters.  Yeah, sometimes you never
          see what's right in front of your face.
          Look, it's --

Chuck keeps an eye on what is going on in the warehouse.
Then he notices something over by one of the trucks.

                     CHUCK
               (to a loader)
          Hold it!  Hazardous material needs its
          own container!
               (back on the phone)
          -- three in the afternoon there, right?
          That gives you five hours until the sweep
          comes through.  Do the sort by hand
          tonight, then put in a new feeder belt,
          say a twenty-four incher.  Yes, overtime
          is authorized.

He hangs up the phone.  He turns to the crew.

                     CHUCK
          I'm going out on every route, I'm going
          to work every job here, until I know
          enough to help you.  That's it.

The crew disperses back to work.  Chuck and Aleksei walk
toward the office.  They've done this before.  Chuck lets a
corner of his command persona slip.

                     ALEKSEI
          It's bad.

                     CHUCK
          Worse than Warsaw.

                     ALEKSEI
          Nobody remembers that.

                     CHUCK
          The failures they remember.  It's the
          successes they forget.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

A FedEx truck pulls out of the FedEx office.  Chuck is
inside.  He notices the graffiti on the walls.

INT.  TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck rides next to LEV, the driver, a serious sort.  The
Translator squats on some boxes between them, trying to keep
his balance.

                     CHUCK
          You sorted your packages before you left.
          None of the other drivers did.

The Translator and Lev exchange a few words.

                     TRANSLATOR
          He says he wants to be organized.  Do
          packages in order.

Chuck looks at Lev with respect.  Right answer.

                     CHUCK
          So how come the other drivers haven't
          left yet?

The Translator asks Lev, who looks at him as if he is crazy,
then snorts an answer.  The Translator blushes.

                     TRANSLATOR
          He says -- he is a very rude fellow --

                     CHUCK
          Tell me exactly what he said.

                     TRANSLATOR
          He says why don't his farts smell sweet?

Chuck grins.  Lev shrugs and says something else.

                     TRANSLATOR
          He says that's just the way it is.

                     CHUCK
          Lev -- it's Lev, right?  Listen, this is
          FedEx.  We don't have to accept the way
          it is.

EXT.  HOTEL - ST. PETERSBURG

A weary Chuck enters the hotel.  In the sky above him we see
the Northern Lights.  He doesn't even look up.

INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - LATER

Chuck is watching CNN on the television, working his
PowerBook, and holding the phone.

                     CHUCK
          No, keep trying.  A circuit's bound to
          open up.

He hangs up.

                     CHUCK
               (to himself)
          Those damn Northern Lights.

Just then the lights go off.  For a moment everything is
darkness.  Then a small light switches on.  Chuck has a
headlamp on.

He gets up, heads into the bathroom.  We stay in the bedroom.
After only a moment, the light reemerges.  It heads over to
his bag.  We go with it.

Chuck takes out a roll of toilet paper.  The guy is prepared
for anything.  He goes into the bathroom, closes the door.

The lights come back on just as the phone rings.

We hear scuffling sounds on the other side of the door.
Chuck charges out, holding up his pants.

Grabs the phone.

                     CHUCK
          Hello?  Great.  Try it.

He waits.  We hear an ANSWERING MACHINE.

                     KELLY (V.O.)
          This is Kelly, leave me a message and
          I'll call you back soon as I can.

This is not what Chuck wanted to hear.

                     CHUCK
          Kelly, damn, look, this is Chuck.  I'm
          going to be a little late.  Well, more
          than a little.  I had to go to Russia.
          Couldn't be helped.  Could you call and
          cancel the trip?  Look, we'll sail the
          Keys in March.  It's better then anyway.
          I'll be back before Christmas.  I
          promise.  I think.  I mean, I will.  I,
          uh --

He's stumbling over whether to say I love you.

                     CHUCK
          I miss you.

He gently hangs up the phone.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG - SERIES OF SHOTS

A surprised Yuri stands with the attractive assistant as
Chuck takes his clipboard away.

An even more surprised Lev stands by his truck as Chuck hands
the clipboard to him.

Chuck and the loaders clean off the graffiti.

Working alongside the sorters as the packages come in, Chuck
points out how to organize the inflow.

Chuck and Lev go over large maps of St. Petersburg with the
drivers.

INT.  FEDEX WAREHOUSE - ST. PETERSBURG - WEEK LATER

A big semi is being loaded with outgoing packages for the
airport run.  Aleksei, Chuck, Lev and the office executives
watch as containers are rolled on.

                     LEV
          We've never got all the trucks in on
          time.  Never.

Chucks looks at the clock.

                     CHUCK
          Only one still left?

                     LEV
          Route six.

Aleksei points at the big semi.

                     ALEKSEI
          If we don't send it now we may miss the
          connection in Paris.

The pressure in on.  Chuck looks around at his team.

                     CHUCK
               (to Aleksei)
          Give it five minutes.

EXT.  FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG - MINUTES LATER

The last truck rolls in.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG

The last truck enters and loading dock.  A few loaders move
toward it.  The executives all stand and watch.  But not
Chuck.  He's hands on.

                     CHUCK
          Let's go.

He heads toward the truck and begins pulling off packages.
All the other executives follow him.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG - MINUTES LATER

Led by Chuck, who works like a man possessed, they sort the
packages.

                     CHUCK
          That's Bermuda.  Bermuda is in the
          Memphis thru container.  No, Azores is
          Europe.

He gestures at a closed container.

                     CHUCK
          The Paris container.  Africa too.  Japan
          goes to Memphis.

Chuck is everywhere, setting the example.  The whole office
is energized, working together.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG - MINUTES LATER

They load the last container on the waiting truck.  Chuck
pounds the truck on the side.  Go.

The truck roars out of the loading dock.

Everyone takes a breath.  They are happy, proud.

                     LEV
          We did it.  All of them.

                     CHUCK
          Great job, everyone.  Remember, work
          together.  We are like a hand...

They've heard this before.  Lev holds up his hand just before
Chuck does.

                     LEV
          One finger, weak.  All fingers working
          together, strong.

This makes Chuck smile.

                     CHUCK
          You got it.

EXT.  CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - DAY

A FedEx MD-11 is being loaded with huge containers of
freight.  Chuck goes up the gangway next to the forklifts.

INT.  MD-11 - MOMENTS LATER

The pilots -- JACK and GWEN -- are going down their check
lists.  Chuck sticks his head in the cockpit.

                     CHUCK
          I absolutely, positively, have to get to
          Memphis overnight.

                     JACK
          Can't help you.  Try UPS.

                     CHUCK
          Jack -- gotta be something wrong with our
          physicals, you keep getting certified to
          fly.  Gwen, aren't you worried?

                     GWEN
          Terrified.

                     CHUCK
          We're on time, right?

                     JACK
          On time, Chuck.

Chuck hands Jack and Gwen small packages.

                     CHUCK
          Little present from the emerging
          republics.

Another FedEx Road Warrior named STAN gets on.  He and Chuck
are obviously old hands at this.

                     CHUCK
          What connects the world?  What makes it
          one?
               (they ignore him)
          We do.  FedEx.

                     GWEN
          You are such a lifer.

                     STAN
          What do you expect, from the guy who
          stole a kid's bicycle when his truck
          broke down?

                     CHUCK
          Borrowed.  I borrowed it.

The two of them strap in.

                     STAN
          How'd it go?

                     CHUCK
          Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one
          for a change.

He's finished a tough job.  He's relaxed and on his way home.
But Stan's his boss, and Stan's got bad news.

                     STAN
          I had to bump your plane last night.

Chuck can't believe it.

                     CHUCK
          You what?

                     STAN
          It was fifteen minutes late.

The plane begins to taxi.

                     CHUCK
          I checked the weather, you had the jet
          stream, you could have made it up.

                     STAN
          But I might not have.

                     CHUCK
          Jesus.  I got it working... You have no
          idea how hard it was... They're finally a
          team...

                     STAN
          I'm touched.

                     CHUCK
          You fucked us over.

                     STAN
          The point of FedEx, as I understand it,
          is to make the damn connection.

                     CHUCK
          I was making a point.

                     STAN
          What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let
          Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody
          down the line clean up your mess?

                     CHUCK
          Every person counts, every package
          counts, that's my point.

                     STAN
          You know what your problem is?  You just
          see the packages in front of you.  You
          don't see the big picture.

                     CHUCK
          Baloney.  I do see the damn "big
          picture."

EXT.  CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - NIGHT

The MD-11 takes off.

INT.  MD-11 - NIGHT

Chuck is focused on his PowerBook with the screen away from
us, Stan is doing tai chi amidst the FedEx containers.  It
feels a little surreal, all those containers surrounding
them.

Stan comes over, looks at the image on the computer.  It's a
sailboat with some technical specifications under it.

                     STAN
          I didn't know we had sailboats.

                     CHUCK
          It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.

                     STAN
          For all those vacation days you got
          coming.

Chuck doesn't look up.

                     CHUCK
          And never take.

                     STAN
          Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I
          couldn't risk being late into Memphis.

                     CHUCK
          Forget it.

                     STAN
          You know General McLelland, he wouldn't
          attack unless he had everything just
          right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him
          and said, General, if you're not going to
          use my army, could I borrow it for a
          while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant
          just said, let's go.

                     CHUCK
          I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with
          Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay
          attention.

                     STAN
          We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've
          got to be bold.  You always want all your
          ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100
          percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49.
          Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the
          dice.

                     CHUCK
          That's why you're a gambling man.

                     STAN
          That's why I'm running foreign and you're
          not.  That's why you're not married and I
          am.

                     CHUCK
          For the third time.

                     STAN
          Take the plunge, admit your mistakes,
          move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx,
          that's women, that's life.

Stan is so outrageous, Chuck can't help but laugh.

                     CHUCK
          You are one sick fucker.

                     STAN
          I'm trying to help you here.  There's
          Warsaw, there's this --

                     CHUCK
          This was nothing like Warsaw.  I held the
          truck then minutes, it's not that big a
          deal.

But apparently it is.

                     STAN
          Look, that kids' bike, that's a guy
          who'll do what it takes to get there on
          time.  Live up to your legend, that's all
          I'm saying.

Chuck reaches in his pocket, pulls out a bill.

                     CHUCK
          A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95
          percent in a month.

                     STAN
          Ninety five percent?  Just give me the
          money now.

                     CHUCK
          Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?

                     STAN
          We're on.

Chuck closes the PowerBook.

                     CHUCK
          Let's go off-line.

They both take out their Valium -- the price they pay for
being such road warriors.

                     CHUCK
          Two Valium...

Stan puts on his Walkman.

                     STAN
          And the Stones.  Got to be.

It's their ritual.  Chuck puts headphones from his Walkman
over his ears, puts a mask over his eyes and leans his head
back onto the headrest.  We hear the Rolling Stones.

EXT.  MEMPHIS AIRPORT - NIGHT - WIDE

The MD-11 arrives at its gate.  The cargo doors open.
Forklifts and a gangway roll up to the side.

INT.  MD-11 - NIGHT

Stan stands smiling over Chuck.

                     STAN
          Chuck.  Wake up Chuck.

Chuck pulls off the mask, takes out the earplugs.  He manages
a groggy grin.

                     STAN
          You gotta do your own delivery from here.

INT.  SUPERHUB - NIGHT

Chuck walks through the extraordinary nexus of speeding
packages that intersect in intricate paths above and around
him.  This is the beating center of the FedEx world, the
crossroads, the deep core where everything connects.  In his
still-drugged state it all seems weirdly psychedelic.  A
Christmas tree goes by, then a huge plastic Santa Claus, both
with shipping labels.

EXT.  CHICKASAW GARDENS - MEMPHIS - NIGHT

Chuck's car pulls into the driveway of a small cottage in an
older Memphis neighborhood.  The radio is playing the news.

INT.  CHUCK'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck drops his briefcase and his bag.  The place is a jumble
of clothes, papers, books, etc.  In the living room is a tank
of tropical fish.  The water looks a little green.  No
bubbles are coming from the filter.

Uh oh.

Chuck walks to the tank.  He tightens a piece of tape that
holds the power cord onto the filter, taps the filter with
his finger, once, twice...the bubbles start again.

                     CHUCK
          Damn thing.

But for a couple of fish floating on top of the tank it's too
late.

Chuck gets out his scoop and slowly skims them off.

                     CHUCK
          Sorry, I'm really sorry.

EXT.  CHUCK'S HOUSE - BACK YARD

Chuck digs a small hole in the back yard with a large kitchen
spoon.

Drops the dead fish in.

Fills the hole.

INT.  CHUCK'S HOUSE - LATER

The CD is playing.  Chuck lies in bed, switches on the TV.
This is no good.  He doesn't care how late it is, he's going
to find Kelly.

EXT.  MEMPHIS - NIGHT - LATER

Chuck drives in his car through the streets of Memphis.

EXT.  UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

Chuck pulls up to a lab building at Memphis State.

INT.  LAB - NIGHT

Two doctoral candidates are playing Doom on their computers
when Chuck walks in.

                     CHUCK
          You seen Kelly Frears?

One of them gestures toward a door.

                     GUY
          Xerox machine.

INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

Chuck makes his way in the semi-darkness past rack after rack
of specimens in bottles.

Ahead of him we see the flashing green light of a Xerox
machine.

INT.  XEROX ROOM

The light goes off.  KELLY leans over the machine, bangs on
it.

                     KELLY
          Sonofabitch!

                     CHUCK
          Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.

Surprised, Kelly turns to greet Chuck.

                     KELLY
          Chuck!  You're back!

She leaps into his arms.

                     KELLY
          Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium
          again?

                     CHUCK
          You smell like formaldehyde.

Kelly looks over at the Xerox.

                     KELLY
          My last chapter's in there, and the damn
          machine's jammed.

                     CHUCK
          Let's take a look.

He lifts up the cover.

                     KELLY
          How was Russia?

                     CHUCK
          Cold.

                     KELLY
          Don't overwhelm me with details, you know
          how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?

                     CHUCK
          I thought I did.

He pries up one feeder, then another.

                     CHUCK
          Got to follow the paper path here.

                     KELLY
          Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia
          didn't turn out well?

But Chuck doesn't want to talk.  He's focused on the machine.

                     CHUCK
          Used to you could fix these yourself.

She pulls him out of the machine.  He has toner on his
fingers.

                     KELLY
          Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          What do you want me to say?  That I
          thought I'd done a great job but it all
          turned to shit?  That I might as well
          have gone sailing for all the good I did?

                     KELLY
          Yeah, tell me.  Tell me all of it.

He suddenly looks really tired.

                     KELLY
          You don't even know what time it is.
          What day it is.

He turns to the Xerox in frustration.

                     CHUCK
          And I can't fix this damn machine.

She looks at him.

                     KELLY
          Come on.

INT.  KELLY'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

A tiny cubicle with a door.  She closes it, takes some paper
towels out of the desk, wipes his fingers.

                     KELLY
          We're on the deck of the ketch, the air's
          soft, the water's clear as crystal...

She licks the last bit of toner off his fingers.

                     CHUCK
          That's carcinogenic.

She ignores that, stays with the fantasy.

                     KELLY
          We're covered with suntan lotion and
          sweat.  Our skin is so hot, it's
          glowing...

And she comes closer to him.

                     KELLY
          We could take a swim.

She's really close now.

                     CHUCK
          On the other hand we could not take a
          swim...

They squiggle themselves onto the desk.

INT.  LAB - NIGHT

Someone kicks the door shut.  Now the figures are in
silhouette, lit by the light in the office.

And then the light goes out.

EXT.  FEDEX OFFICES - NEXT MORNING

A nondescript office park near the airport.  No sign.
Chuck's car screeches into the parking lot.  He jumps out,
glances at this watch, and heads for the building at a run.

INT.  EXECUTIVE CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

A large room dominated by an animated MAP OF THE WORLD.
Lights at various locations blink and flash.  Above the map
are a large Sign saying "Here Today, Gone Tomorrow" and two
huge digital Clocks -- one keeping time, the other a
countdown clock for that day's package sort at the SuperHub.

The operations team of FedEx sits around a large table.  Each
has on a headset.  BECCA TWIGG, the business-like senior vice
president of Operations, addresses questions to a man --
COLIN PARKER-BOWLES, the European operations manager -- on a
LARGE TV SCREEN in front of her.  "London" is superimposed on
the screen.

                     BECCA
          So why was Milan late, Colin?

                     COLIN
          One of the race horses coming from
          Ireland got colic and had to be off-
          loaded in Brussels.  That put the Jumbo
          15, six hours late into Charles De
          Gaulle.  Customs had difficulty locating
          the dutiable items...

Colin continues as Chuck, out of breath, slips under the
screen and heads for the one remaining vacant seat -- across
from Stan.  Next to Stan is MAYNARD GRAHAM, an MBA systems
man.  Becca addresses a question over to Stan.

                     BECCA
          Stan, can we get P&A down to work with
          Milan customs?

                     STAN
          We're already on it.

                     BECCA
          Good.  And let's look at our live animal
          policy.  I don't think the income stream
          justifies delaying IP product, especially
          at Christmas.

Colin disappears.  A red light goes on.  Becca pushes a
button.  Another face comes on the screen.  "Oakland" appears
under the face.

                     BECCA
          Stand by, Benson, we're still wrapping up
          foreign.

She turns pointedly to Chuck.

                     BECCA
          Chuck, thanks for joining us.  Status?

Chuck swallows nervously, tries to talk matter-of-factly.

                     CHUCK
          Becca, as you know St. Petersburg was
          consistently running late by six to ten
          hours -- sometimes a full day or more.  I
          replaced the station manager.  We
          identified inefficiencies and worked out
          a quality improvement plan I believe can
          be met.

                     MAYNARD
          You replaced the station manager with a
          driver.  A local with no knowledge of our
          systems.

                     BECCA
          Shouldn't you have brought in someone
          from Memphis?  Russia is priority one.

                     MAYNARD
          James Pottinger is available.

The process is being ripped out of Chuck's hands.  He
struggles to get an answer.

                     STAN
          He's a numbers cruncher.  Chuck's done
          all the right things here...

Stan is doing his best to back up Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          Jim's a terrific financial man, no
          question.  But we can't always parachute
          in from Memphis.  We've got to build up
          our local staff.

                     MAYNARD
          We've got to improve foreign on-time,
          that's what we've got to do.  If this new
          guy's so good, how come the very first
          plane he sent missed the connection in
          Paris?

Maynard knows how to go for the jugular.  Everyone looks at
Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          We're building a new team here.  We got
          every package on the truck for the first
          time ever.  Success is the best teacher.

                     MAYNARD
          I don't call missing the plane a success.

Everyone looks at Chuck.

EXT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - DAY - LATE THAT AFTERNOON

Chuck lugs a big package up to the door, knocks on it.  Kelly
opens the door.

                     KELLY
          Merry Christmas eve.

                     CHUCK
          Not if you work for FedEx.

INT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - DAY

Chuck enters as they keep talking.  Her house is cozy but
also where she works.  There's a computer, specimen jars, and
some terrariums with frogs inside.  A Christmas tree with
packages under it.

                     KELLY
          You break four million packages last
          night?

In the b.g. one of the packages by the Christmas tree is
starting to shake on its own.

                     CHUCK
          Four four.  A record.

                     KELLY
          You don't seem too happy about it.

                     CHUCK
          Ah, the staff meeting could have gone
          better.

                     KELLY
          Let me guess, Russia came up?

Chuck's attention goes to the tree.

                     CHUCK
          One of those packages just moved.

The package turns over, something darts out.  It's a puppy,
with a bow around its neck.

                     KELLY
          Merry Christmas.

Chuck bends down to see the puppy.

                     CHUCK
          Hey, look at you.

                     KELLY
          I figure, if we could take care of a
          puppy, we could, you know, take care
          of --

A baby, she wants to say, but that's going a little fast so
she catches herself.  Chuck picks the puppy up.

                     CHUCK
          He is a cute thing.

                     KELLY
          He's your cute thing.

                     CHUCK
          I can't even keep fish alive.

                     KELLY
          A puppy's got a little more personality
          than a fish.

                     CHUCK
          And for you --

Chuck hands over his present.

                     KELLY
          So do good things come in large packages?

Kelly opens Chuck's present -- a very large box.

It's a piece of luggage.

                     CHUCK
          You know, for when you travel.

                     KELLY
          For when I travel?

She can't believe it.  It's the exact opposite of what she
wanted.

                     KELLY
          You should have got me something that
          shows you want us to be together, not
          apart.

Chuck is flummoxed.  Women read so much into things.

                     CHUCK
          I wasn't sending a message.  I though
          you'd like it.

Chuck's beeper goes off.

                     KELLY
          You should have got me a ring.

He checks the number.

                     CHUCK
          I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow
          down at the Hub.

                     KELLY
          A ring.  I wanted a ring.

                     CHUCK
          You did?

She nods.  What to do?

                     CHUCK
          Look, I love the puppy.  I love you.  But
          I have to go.

                     KELLY
          You can't go now.

                     CHUCK
          I have to.

                     KELLY
          You want to.

Chuck picks up the puppy.

                     CHUCK
          What should we call him?  Or is it her?
          How about Jango?

Kelly is having one of those moments when everything comes
clear.

                     KELLY
          This isn't working out.

                     CHUCK
          We're a little emotional here.  It's
          Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.

                     KELLY
          "We're" not over-reacting.

                     CHUCK
          Could you watch Jango?

                     KELLY
          No.

                     CHUCK
          I can't take him to work.

He hands her the puppy.

                     CHUCK
          We'll talk about it when I come back.
          It'll all be fine.  Really.

This is not a happy woman he is leaving behind.

EXT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - HOUSE LATER

It's dark now.  Chuck returns.  The stars are putting on an
amazing show, but he doesn't notice as he heads for the door.

INT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

Chuck enters.  The tree and the presents under it are gone.

                     CHUCK
          Kelly?  Kelly?

No answer, nothing but the sound of Jango, who begins yelping
in the kitchen.

INT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck picks up Jango, who is barricaded in the kitchen with
some food, some water, and some wet newspapers.

                     CHUCK
          There.  There.  Easy now.

EXT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

Holding Jango, Chuck walks out into the back yard.

                     CHUCK
          Kelly?

A fire still smolders.  The packages have burned.  The tree
is a blackened mess.

Chuck stares at it.

EXT.  CHUCK'S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING

Chuck gets into his car, puts Jango on the front seat next to
him.  Pulls out of the driveway.

EXT.  ARKANSAS HIGHWAY - DAY

Chuck is in his car, with the dog on his lap.

EXT.  FARM HOUSE - DAY

Chuck's car drives up to a typical Arkansas farm house.  His
MOM is setting some Christmas tree lights around the door.
Chuck gets out of the car.  There's a large wet spot on the
front of his pants.

                     MOM
          What happened to your pants?

                     CHUCK
          Mom, meet Jango.

Chuck displays the puppy.

EXT.  FARM HOUSE - SHED - DAY

Chuck works on an old tractor in the shed.  Some small legs
appear in his vision, then a small face.  This is AMANDA, his
niece.

                     AMANDA
          Dinner's ready.

INT.  FARM HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Around the table are Chuck's brother ROGER, his wife MARY,
Amanda, and her TWO BROTHERS.  Mom brings in the turkey,
places it on the table, sits down.  They all hold hands and
bow their heads.

                     MOM
          Chuck?

Chuck hesitates just a moment.

                     CHUCK
          Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts,
          which we are about to receive, from thou
          bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.

                     ROGER
          Let's eat.

EXT.  FARM HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY

The children burst out the door, shrieking, chased by Jango.

INT.  FARM HOUSE - DAY

The grown-ups are cleaning up after Christmas dinner.  The
scene moves between the table, the kitchen counter, and the
refrigerator.  It's an old-fashioned kitchen, simply
furnished.

                     MARY
          How's Kelly?

                     CHUCK
          Great.

                     ROGER
          Thought you were going to bring her.

                     CHUCK
          So did I.

                     MOM
          It seemed like she had such a good time
          last time.

                     CHUCK
          It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.

                     MARY
          Jennifer's still down at the post office.
          And she's still got that crush on you.

                     ROGER
          And she's still got those --

                     MARY
          Roger.

                     ROGER
          You should have stuck around.

This is an old, sore subject.

                     CHUCK
          Look, I help take care of the place.  You
          got my check, didn't you Mom?

                     MOM
          That new roof, that's your doing.

                     ROGER
          You're just allergic to farming, that's
          what dad said.  Can't stand to be alone.
          Can't stand to be in one place.  Can't
          stand the sight of...blood.

He drops the turkey giblets into the trash.

                     MARY
          Roger's going to put chickens in here.

Chuck can't believe this.

                     CHUCK
          Come on Roger, this is dad all over
          again.  You already did beefalo,
          chinchillas, and what was that, ostrich?
          They chased Mom around the yard, sprained
          her hip.

Mom goes to the freezer and takes out some frozen
strawberries.

                     MOM
          It wasn't that bad, dear.

                     MARY
          You can't make a living out of this
          place.  We tried.

                     CHUCK
          But chickens?

                     ROGER
          Sixty three pounds consumed per capita,
          up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to
          pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No
          religious taboos.  You don't see your
          Hindus and your Muslims boycotting
          poultry.

                     CHUCK
          True enough.  No sacred chickens nowhere,
          so far as I know.

                     MOM
          Roger's working at Tyson's now.

Mom mashes the block of frozen strawberries with a fork to
separate the strawberries from the ice.

                     CHUCK
          Really?

                     ROGER
          Come on down to the plant.  It's state of
          the art.  We're doing for chickens what
          FedEx did for the delivery business.

                     CHUCK
          Just don't count 'em before they hatch.

Roger grins at him.  This is just how they are.

                     ROGER
          I'll try to remember that.

                     MOM
          Dessert.

They all sit down.  Mom brings the slushy frozen strawberries
to the table, squirts on some Reddi-whip.  Looks pointedly at
Chuck.

                     MOM
          Speaking of hatching, I could sure use
          some more grandchildren.

Not a timely topic with Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          Mom, this is a farm.  We've got real
          strawberries growing outside, we've got
          real cream.

                     MOM
          Oh no, the prodigal son's home.  We bring
          out the store bought.

Chuck takes a bite, winces a little as the cold strawberries
hit his teeth.

EXT.  MOM'S HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY

Chuck fixes the drain pipe while Mom prunes the rose bushes
around the porch.

                     CHUCK
          Maybe I should take a few days off.
          Roger's working now, you could use some
          help around here...

                     MOM
          Don't you even think about it.

                     CHUCK
          The place is falling apart.

                     MOM
          I'm doing fine.

She looks pointedly at Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.

                     MOM
          There's settled folks, and there's
          nomads.  You're just not a settled folk.
          You never belonged here.

Chuck finishes the drain pipe.  Gives it a thunk with his
finger.

                     CHUCK
          Come on inside, Mom.  You've had a long
          day.

INT.  FARM HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

In his boyhood room, we see Chuck's laptop, which is hooked
up to the internet FedEx homepage.  All around him are models
of boats and planes, maps, pictures of far-off places.  The
room of a boy who always fantasized about getting away.

Chuck is beside it, slumped down on the desk.  Asleep.

EXT.  FARM HOUSE - DAY

His mom waves to him as Chuck drives away.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY

Chuck enters his office, on the go.  His assistant LESLIE is
waiting for him.

                     CHUCK
          I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.

                     LESLIE
          And how was your Christmas?

                     CHUCK
          Terrific.  Yours?

She nods, used to this.

                     CHUCK
          And get me in to the dentist.  My tooth's
          acting up.

Stan enters.

                     STAN
          Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten
          in operations.

                     CHUCK
          Right.
               (to Leslie)
          Get me everything on Indonesia, New
          Guinea, all the way to Australia.

INT.  OPERATIONS ROOM - MINUTES LATER

Chuck, Leslie, Stan and another executive from the meeting
named DICK are gathered around the TV screen.  A squawk box
is on the table.

                     CHUCK
          Kamal?  Kamal?  Can you hear us?

The box squawks.  The TV screen rolls an imperfect image.

                     DICK
          Can't we get this working?

A Technician is fiddling with the TV set.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Trying.

                     CHUCK
          Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear
          us?

                     VOICE (SQUAWK BOX)
          Kamal is not here.

                     CHUCK
          Who is this?  Where is Kamal?

                     VOICE (SQUAWK BOX)
          It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.

                     CHUCK
          What's going on down there?

                     VOICE (SQUAWK BOX)
          Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.

                     CHUCK
          Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?

The squawk box hums and crackles.  Nothing.  Chuck turns to
the Technician.

                     STAN
          We got Telex, e-mail?

                     TECHNICIAN
          Sure.  Just not getting any answers.

Chuck turns to Leslie.

                     CHUCK
          When's the next Jumbo?

                     LESLIE
          The regular flight is scheduled for oh
          three hundred tomorrow.

                     CHUCK
          Anything else?

                     LESLIE
          There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an
          hour, goes through Sydney.

                     STAN
          Maybe you should get your ducks lined up
          first.

Chuck looks over at Stan.

                     CHUCK
          Call Operations.  Get me on it.

And Stan is impressed.

EXT.  CHUCK'S HOUSE - DAY

Chuck leaves with his bag over his shoulder and the puppy
under his arm.

EXT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - DAY - MINUTES LATER

Kelly opens the door.  Chuck is there with the puppy.

                     KELLY
          That's your dog.

                     CHUCK
          It's our dog.  It belongs to us.

                     KELLY
          There isn't any us.

                     CHUCK
          Yes there is.

Kelly can't stay mad.

                     KELLY
          I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a
          little carried away.

                     CHUCK
          No, it was great.  Maybe a little
          overkill --

                     KELLY
          I burned the Christmas tree.

She's half-laughing, half-wanting-to-cry.

                     KELLY
          Why didn't you come over, get mad at me,
          tell me what a stupid bitch I was.

                     CHUCK
          I guess I hadn't thought through how I
          felt.

                     KELLY
          What, you were going to come over the
          next day all calm and say, Kelly that
          really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're
          mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.

                     CHUCK
          Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get
          back.

                     KELLY
          Don't even start.

And then it hits her.

                     KELLY
          Get back?  From where?

                     CHUCK
          Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.

She stares at him for a long moment, then at the puppy.

                     KELLY
          Give him to me.

He hands her the dog.

                     KELLY
          Chuck, you're breaking my heart.

                     CHUCK
          A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?

                     KELLY
          Go on.  We'll be fine.  I'll feed Jango
          to the frogs.

She kisses the puppy.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

Chuck enters the cockpit, where two different pilots are
going through their checklists.  Chuck repeats his familiar
patter.

                     CHUCK
          Al -- gotta be something wrong with our
          physicals, you keep getting certified to
          fly.  John, aren't you worried?

                     JOHN
          I disconnected his controls.  He only
          thinks he's flying.

Chuck settles into his seat.

                     CHUCK
          You're on your way home, Al?

Al has an Australian accent.

                     AL
          Right.  Down home, down under.

                     CHUCK
          We're on time, right?

                     AL
          On time, Chuck.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT - HOURS LATER

Settled into the jump seat, Chuck finishes up his notes on
his PowerBook and begins his flight ritual.

He puts in his ear plugs and takes out his Valium.  He
swallows one, then thinks, and swallows two more.  Then he
turns on his Walkman to the Rolling Stones, puts the mask
over his eyes, and, as usual, goes to sleep.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

The plane is SHAKING badly.  HEAR frantic, garbled radio
talk.  Chuck stirs, struggles to his feet, drowsy and
drugged.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - CHUCK'S POV

Everything is hazy, out of focus, as it was in his earlier
drugged condition.  But this is real haze.  SMOKE.  And the
cabin also TWISTS and TILTS.

Chuck tries to steady himself against the wall.  This is
nightmarish.  Is this really happening?

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - CHUCK'S POV - COCKPIT

The pilots wrestle with the controls.  They have their life
jackets on.  John glances back at Chuck, his face floating in
a cloud of fear.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck struggles to put on his life jacket.  The plane is
VIBRATING VIOLENTLY.  He can't get the straps straight.  He
is KNOCKED against one wall, then another, then to the floor.

Chuck tries to blow on the mouth tubes for his life jacket.
Can't do it!  Puff.  Puff.  Shit!  John motions frantically
for Chuck to pull on the automatic inflators on his jacket.
Chuck fumbles for them.

Huge palettes shift and groan, one BREAKS FREE, banging
violently against the side of the plane, spilling out its
boxes.  Then it swings and KNOCKS Chuck on the head!  He goes
down!

INT.  GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

A CONTROLLER mans the global operations desk.  His SUPERVISOR
stands behind him, sipping some coffee.  The mood is eerily
calm.  An assistant moves Plane Locator Cards on a giant
board.

                     CONTROLLER
          Jumbo 14 is overdue in Sector K.

                     SUPERVISOR
          Where are they?

Another CONTROLLER tracks a giant computer screen.

                     CONTROLLER 2
          Somewhere east of Port Moresby.  Guam is
          getting a signal but no location.  Maybe
          the GPS is out.

The signal flashes, but is strangely still compared to the
others, which are moving.

EXT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

The giant plane PLUMMETS down from the sky.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

Chuck is semi-conscious and bleeding from the head.  John
pulls the inflators on Chuck's life jacket, which fills with
a WHOOSH!, sending Chuck's arms out to the sides.  Al
struggles with the LIFE RAFT.  It's all blurred, frantic,
terrifying.

EXT.  PACIFIC - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

The plane hits the ocean with a CRASH and a WAVE of water.

INT.  GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

The Controller is speaking mechanically into the microphone.

                     CONTROLLER
          Guam, I need a fix on Jumbo 14.

EXT.  PACIFIC - NIGHT

Shrouded with fog and surrounded by debris, the tail of the
big plane slowly SINKS beneath the angry, storm-driven waves.

EXT.  PACIFIC - DAY

A life raft is tossed on dark, storm-driven seas.  Inside it,
semi-conscious, Chuck hangs on.

EXT.  PACIFIC - NIGHT

We catch glimpses of the yellow lift raft in the dark as the
storm continues.

EXT.  BEACH - EARLY MORNING

The storm has ended.  Waves lap gently on a beach cut like a
scallop out of a rocky shore.  On the beach we see scattered
FEDEX BOXES.  And we see, face-down, half-buried in sand, a
MAN IN A SUIT and a life jacket.

Chuck.

The tide gently rocks him, laps at his face.  He chokes.
Slowly he gets to his knees.  Vomits seawater, big heaves.
He rolls over, sits down.  Dazed.  Still confused.  Where am
I?  What happened?

Chuck's first instinct is to check the time.  He looks at his
watch, taps it in frustration.

Then he looks around, and we look with him.

CHUCK'S POV - BEACH

The fog has thinned.  We can see palm groves and mangrove
thickets leading back into a thickly wooded valley climbing
up a steep, rocky hillside.  The rocks on the opposite point
end in a barren ridge.  Clouds hide the top of the hill.

ON CHUCK

as he takes in his surroundings.  He licks his lips.  He's
thirsty.  But something he sees is even more important.  We
stay with him as he WALKS.  He comes to a FEDEX PACKAGE in
the sand, picks it up, brushes off the sand, walks farther.
He picks up another package.

EXT.  BEACH - WIDE

Chuck walks down the beach, picking up FedEx packages,
leaving a trail of footprints in the sand.  Ahead of him we
notice a package decorated with ANGEL WINGS.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT MORNING

Chuck has made a neat stack of FedEx boxes under some palm
trees at the rim of the beach.  He examines the Angel Wing
drawing with passing curiosity, then puts it on the stack.

Chuck takes off his life jacket, sits down in the shade,
makes himself comfortable, and waits.

EXT.  BEACH - SUNSET

Chuck is still waiting.  He's a systems man, and the system
isn't working.

                     CHUCK
          All right, guys.  I'm here.  Check the
          GPS, get moving.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

The full moon shines a ghostly light on the beach.  Trees
cast moon-shadows on the sand.  Chuck seems very, very alone.

We HEAR from the dark thickets a STRANGE NOISE.  Rustling in
the leaves.  Something crashing in the trees, or is it a
wave?  A jolt of adrenaline courses through Chuck's body.  He
lurches to his feet.

We HEAR the noises again.  Chuck edges toward the rocks at
the barb of the hook.  Keeping his eye on the thicket, he
bends down and picks up a stone.  His first weapon.

In the rocks he finds a piece of driftwood.  He picks it up
in his other hand.  He backs between two rocks and stands
facing the thicket, every sense alert.  A cloud passes over
the moon.  The shadow streaks across Chuck's anxious face.

EXT.  BEACH - MORNING

The morning TIDE is coming in.  We follow the tide as it laps
amidst the rocks and finds Chuck, staring out to sea.  The
empty sea.

                     CHUCK
          Where the fuck are you?

But now he is really thirsty.  We WALK with Chuck up the
beach.

Beneath the palms he sees a couple of coconuts.  He picks one
of them up and studies it.  It's heavy, almost the size of a
volleyball.  How to get in it?

He throws it down on a rock.  The coconut just bounces off.
He wedges the coconut between two rocks, then throws a rock
down on it.  It bounces off.  He throws down a bigger rock.
It smashes on the rocks and chips.  Chuck picks up the rock.
OW!  Where the rock had chipped the edge is sharp.  It cuts
him.

                     CHUCK
          Sonofabitch.

The blood stains the rock a bright red.  Chuck sucks on his
finger, then he gets an idea -- the same idea primitive man
first got when he discovered stone tools.

He picks up the rock, test the edge.  Sharp -- really sharp.
He throws another rock down, but it doesn't break.  He picks
up another rock and strikes the first one.  Then again,
harder.  And again.  A large flake shoots off.  This edge is
even sharper.

He has a knife.

OPENING THE COCONUT - SERIES OF SHOTS

Chuck uses the stone knife to saw at the coconut.  No luck.

Chuck clumsily sharpens a stick with the sharp rock.

Chuck brings the sharpened stick down hard on the coconut,
but the stick slides off, sending the coconut rolling away.

Chuck positions the stick, pointed end up, in a hole, then
SLAMS the coconut down hard on it.  Success!  The green nut
of the coconut splits.  The brown inner nut is free!  He
smashes the nut with a rock, but -- OW!  -- he hits his hand!
Chuck licks his fingers, but he is so thirsty there's no more
saliva.  He smashes again.  The shell breaks to smithereens.
Coconut milk splashes everywhere.

                     CHUCK
          That was smart, really smart.

Rotating a nut along its axis and carefully moving his
fingers out of the way, he SMASHES the nut again.  The shell
splits!  The precious liquid splashes out.  Left inside is a
swallow or two, which Chuck laps up eagerly.  The milky white
liquid dribbles down his face.

                     CHUCK
          Ahhh.

EXT.  BEACH - SUNRISE

Chuck squints at the ocean.  His sunburn is bad -- his lips
are cracked.  A stack of broken coconut shells is beside him.
No one's there -- again.

                     CHUCK
          Maybe the GPS malfunctioned.  That Korean
          airliner did.

Clouds scud in front of the sun.  Beyond the reef the waves
are high and churning.  Chuck can see them pound onto the
reef.

                     CHUCK
          Okay, do the math.  Maybe they know where
          you are within, say 500 miles.  That's a
          circle with an area of, uh, pi r squared.
          So, uh, 250,000 times three point one
          four, that's about 800,000 square miles.
          Three times the size of Texas.

This sinks in.  Then Chuck gets an idea.

                     CHUCK
          They could use a satellite.

But even that doesn't give him much hope.

                     CHUCK
          Say each satellite photo is 30 feet
          square, that's uh...fuck it...billions
          and billions of photos.

That sinks in.

                     CHUCK
          Aw, someone will come.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

Chuck sleeps by the coconuts.  The tide is coming in.  Chuck
stirs, gets up, staggers over to a palm tree to relieve
himself.

He stares idly out at the moonlight on the waves.  Then not
so idly.  Something's out there, something floating on the
tide.

                     CHUCK
          What the hell?

EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck splashes into the gentle surf, reaches the dark object.

It's a body.  Chuck turns it over.  It's Al, one of the
pilots, his face gray and waterlogged and very dead.

                     CHUCK
          Oh Jesus.

EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck drags the body up on the beach and then collapses,
exhausted.  He sits by it, staring at it.

                     CHUCK
          I'm so sorry, Al.  So sorry.

EXT.  BEACH - MORNING   

Chuck has almost finished a grave in the sand back of the
palm trees.  He's been digging with a piece of driftwood
sharpened with his stone knife.

He drags the body into the pit.  Stares down at it.  That
could be me.

                     CHUCK
          Got to cover Al up.

He wants to say more, can't.  He scoops some sand over the
body.

                     CHUCK
          Got to cover Al up.

He scoops in some more sand.  It's eerily like burying the
tropical fish in his back yard.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

With a rock Chuck hammers a crude driftwood marker into the
sand.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY

As Chuck sits on the beach, he half-sings, half-talks "Yellow
Submarine" very quietly to himself.

                     CHUCK
          We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow
          submarine...

He looks over at the deep woods and down to the rocky point.
Comes to a decision.  He takes a drink of coconut, picks up
his club and a coconut, sticks the stone knife in his pants.
He's ready to go.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck climbs over the rocks and disappears out of sight.
He's still half-singing to himself.

                     CHUCK
          Yellow submarine.  We all live in a
          yellow submarine...

EXT.  ISLAND - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck's way is blocked by rocks and jungle.  He hesitates.
He picks up a rock and THROWS IT to scare away all those bad
things.  It crashes into the ferns and palm trees.  He takes
a step into the jungle.

EXT.  JUNGLE - MINUTES LATER

Chuck struggles through a dense thicket beneath a jungle
canopy.  Vines and creepers reach out toward him.  There is
no path, nothing to show him where to go.

EXT.  JUNGLE - HALF HOUR LATER

Chuck climbs through a tangle of vines and ferns.  He takes a
drink from the coconut he is carrying.  The last drink.

                     CHUCK
          Bad idea.  Should have saved some.

He throws away the husk.  He looks up, but the only sunlight
reaching him is dappled from the canopy above him.

EXT.  ISLAND - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck emerges onto a ridge that leads to a summit.  He climbs
across a rocky lava field covered with scrub lichen and low
ferns, soil dark as coffee beans, his way crossed by steep
gullies that cut like dark fingers into the lava.

The lava field narrows, forcing Chuck closer to the sea.  He
passes a series of CAVES, their mouths dark and mysterious
and scary.  He gives them a wide berth.

EXT.  ISLAND - CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER

The land narrows to a ledge that stretches across a high
cliff perched over the ocean.  Beyond this rock bridge the
path smoothes out to a summit.

Chuck stares at the narrow bridge, then down at the waves
breaking on the rocks far below.  To get any view, he will
have to cross the bridge.  He's thirsty.  The late afternoon
sun is hot.

                     CHUCK
          Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did
          you enjoy the play?

Hugging the wall of the cliff, taking each step with great
caution, he sets out across the bridge.

EXT.  ISLAND - CLIFF

Step by step, Chuck negotiates the narrow bridge.  He reaches
a flume of polished basalt which cuts across the ledge like a
slide in a water park -- except this flume ends high above
the waves.  Chuck tries to step across it, can't quite, tries
one foot first, then the other.

                     CHUCK
          Shit!

He looks back, but that seems even scarier.

                     CHUCK
          Got to get there.  Got to see.  C'mon...
          c'mon.  Don't be such a wuss.  Be bold.

He looks down at the ocean beneath him, closes his eyes, and
jumps.  It's only a few feet, but he's breathing hard when he
lands on the other side.  He hugs the rocks, getting his
breath.

EXT.  ISLAND SUMMIT - SUNSET - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck looks to each point on the compass.  He is on an
ISLAND, small, inhospitable, without sign of habitation or
anything human.  On three sides the waves break against
steep, hostile cliffs.  A reef encloses the cove where he
came from.

                     CHUCK
          No way on.  No way off.

Chuck stares out to sea in every direction.  Nothing.

                     CHUCK
          This is bad.  Really, really bad.

The last rays of sun hit his face.  The ocean turns a deep
reddish gold.

EXT.  CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER

Going down is even scarier.  It's dusk and the light is flat
and gray.  Chuck stares at the ledge.

                     CHUCK
          Come on.  Crawl if you have to.

Chuck crawls on his hands and knees across the rock bridge.

EXT.  ROCKY SLOPE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck stumbles over the rocks.  The caves look ominous and
primal.

EXT.  EDGE OF JUNGLE - NIGHT

It's getting dark now.  The jungle seems impenetrable, the
dark wood of fable.  Chuck hesitates, then plunges into it.

EXT.  JUNGLE - NIGHT MINUTES LATER

The moon has just begun to rise, casting eerie light into the
jungle.  The shadows reach out to grab Chuck, then real
branches and vines tug at him.  He heads into thick
blackness.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT - LATER

Chuck emerges around the rocks.  He reaches the stack of
familiar FedEx boxes -- Ahh, home!  He's breathing hard, from
both fear and exertion.

                     CHUCK
          Got to drink.  Got to drink something.

With his last strength he opens a coconut on the stick.  He
bangs hard on the shell and gulps down the milk.  He stares
at the stack of FedEx boxes.  What could be inside?  He
reaches out and touches one.

                     CHUCK
          They don't belong to you.

Responsibility gets the better of necessity, and he takes his
hand away.

EXT.  BEACH - MORNING

Face red from the sun, Chuck hacks at a palm frond with his
stone knife.  He saws the palm frond off near the base,
leaving it about a foot long.

                     CHUCK
          Got to have shade.  Got to have a hat.

He ties the loose fibers into a sort of circle, then sets it
upon his head.  It looks amazingly like some sort of
primitive cap.

He grabs a couple of FedEx boxes and heads for the beach.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck finishes the P on H E L P, which he has spelled out
with the FedEx boxes on the beach.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY - LATER

Chuck scrambles down a ravine.  He kneels down and feels the
ground.  It is dry, completely dry.

EXT.  LAVA SLOPE - DAY

Chuck traverses the slope, determined to find water.

A FLAT ROCK - LATER

With a puddle of dirty water trapped in a tiny hollow.
Suddenly Chuck flops down into frame.  He tries to scoop up
some water in his hands, but he just splashes it around.  He
licks his fingers.  Then he gets down on his stomach and laps
up the water with his tongue.  Like an animal.

In the bottom of the small depression is some fine mud.  He
rubs it on his reddened face and across his burned lips.

                     CHUCK
          Oh, God.  Thank you.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

Chuck lies in darkness, his eyes reflecting the moon.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY

Chuck is drenched in sweat.  He is at the bottom of a hole
six feet deep.  He takes one last dig with the flat stick,
then licks the moist clay that sticks to it.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck breaks open another coconut and gulps down the milky
liquid.  With a stone knife he digs in the shell for some of
the meat, but it's dry and chewy and fibrous.  He spits it
out, then lies back on the sand and stares at the first
stars.  Half sings to himself.

                     CHUCK
          You deserve a break today...

He is desperately thirsty.  Hunger gnaws at him.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY - LATER

Holding a sharpened stick, Chuck wades in the shallows at low
tide, looking for fish.  It's difficult to keep his balance.
Suddenly a shadow flashes by, glinting in the morning
sunlight.  Chuck hurls the spear, which ricochets off the
water and floats away.

Chuck plunges into the water after the fish with his bare
hands.  The fish reverses direction.  Chuck leaps after it
and goes under.  He comes up spluttering, on his hands and
knees in the shallows.

Suddenly a whole school of fish swims by him, moving in
unison, like one creature, splitting around Chuck like
mercury.  He grabs at them desperately.  Nothing.

                     CHUCK
          Damn fish!

On some rocks he sees clusters of limpets.  He takes a rock
and tries to dislodge one, but it smashes into a soggy mess.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Discouraged, he sits down on the beach and gets his breath.

Idly, Chuck takes out his wallet.  The money is soaked.  He
lays it out to dry.  He finds a PHOTOGRAPH OF KELLY, soaked
and mushy.

He tries to smooth it out.  For a moment he is overcome.  His
face tightens, his eyes get moist.  He stares out to sea.

                     CHUCK
          Wait a minute.  Wait just a minute.

He picks up his wallet again and takes out a credit card.

EXT.  BEACH - MINUTES LATER

Chuck wades in the water, stops by a rock covered with
limpets.  He uses a CREDIT CARD to scrape off a limpet.

                     CHUCK
          Don't leave home without it.

With his finger, he prods around in the mucous-like meat,
then tilts up the shell and we see the gooey gray stuff slide
off the shell into his mouth.

                     CHUCK
          Yuck.

He starts to spit it out.  Tries to make himself like it.

                     CHUCK
          Yumm.

And he swallow it.

EXT.  BEACH - SUNSET

Chuck sits in the shade of a palm tree surrounded by a pile
of smashed coconut husks and a stack of limpet shells.  He
checks his watch for a moment.

                     CHUCK
          Got to get this fixed.

But what's the point?  Everything that was so valuable before
is useless now.

EXT.  JUNGLE - LATER

Chuck digs yet another hole.  He chants to himself, almost
delusionally.

                     CHUCK
          Water, water, everywhere, water, water
          everywhere...

Covered in sweat, desperate and exhausted, he throws down his
wooden spade.

                     CHUCK
          Where's the water on this fucking island?

He lies on his back, breathing hard.  Pulls his hat over his
eyes.

                     CHUCK
          Just rest a minute.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY - LATER

Chuck is lying in the hole.  We find his feet.  Slowly water
is oozing out of the clay, a puddle is building around his
toes.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY - LATER

Chuck's eyes snap awake.  He looks down at his feet.  There's
a pool of muddy water there.  He dips his hand in it, touches
a finger to his lips to be sure he's not dreaming.

He grabs his sharpened stone, begins to attack the clay.

                     CHUCK
          Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

EXT.  BEACH - SUNSET

Chuck carefully makes marks on a palm tree with his rock
knife.  One for each day.  Very neat.  Very precise.  Very
Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          Let's see, I waited two days.
               (makes marks)
          Then I buried Al.
               (slowly makes another mark)
          Al.  You never made it home, buddy.  Then
          American Express got me those clam
          things...
               (makes another mark)
          I dug all those damn holes, the clouds
          over the moon...
               (makes more marks)
          And today, the historic discovery of H,
          Two, Oh.
               (makes a tenth mark and
                underlines it)
          Ten days.  Shit.

For a moment, he feels the weight of his isolation.  Then he
allows himself a deep breath.  There is order now, after all.
Time is under control.

EXT.  CLIFF - DAY

Very carefully, but standing this time, Chuck makes his way
across the ledge.

EXT.  SUMMIT - DAY

He emerges on the top, takes a drink from a hand-made
canteen, and looks in all directions.  Again, he sees nothing
but ocean.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

He resumes his efforts at fishing.  A shape scuttles raggedly
beneath him.

                     CHUCK
          A crab, it's a crab.

He freezes, holding his spear motionless.  Then he jabs at
the crab -- misses!  The crab scurries away toward the rocks.

                     CHUCK
          Dammit!

Chuck splashes after it, stabbing as he goes, falling,
getting up, stabbing again.

Suddenly one stab feels different.  Chuck carefully lifts up
the spear.  On the end is a squirming crab.

                     CHUCK
          I did it.  I did it!

He walks carefully with it to the beach.  Lowering the spear,
he lets the crab slip off.  It darts toward the water.  Chuck
heads it off, trying to avoid the snapping claws.

He kicks it back toward the beach, then slams a rock down on
it.  He twists off a crab claw, expecting to see flaky white
meat.  But a crab has an exoskeleton.  The flesh simply pours
out, like mucous.

                     CHUCK
          Jesus.

This is too much.  He needs the next step, from the raw to
the cooked.  The crucial next step from primitive man to the
beginnings of civilization.

EXT.  PALM GROVE SERIES OF SHOTS - TRYING TO MAKE FIRE

Chuck rubs two sticks together.  Nothing.

Chuck positions a makeshift drill in a hole he has scooped
out in a piece of driftwood.  He spins the drill with great
effort.  Nothing.

                     CHUCK
          Stupid fucking thing!

He quits, exhausted.  He looks at his hands.  They are raw
and blistered.  He feels like Job.

                     CHUCK
          I don't know what I did, God, but
          whatever is was, I am really, really
          sorry.  You hear me?  Really sorry.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck emerges from the jungle and walks to the edge of the
ocean.  He dips his blistered hands into the sea water, then
looks over at the FedEx boxes that spell out H E L P.

                     CHUCK
          Don't have a choice, do I?

He walks over and picks a few boxes up from the P.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - DAY

With his stone knife and spear to help him.  Chuck begins to
open the FedEx boxes.  Chuck rips open the end of one box and
shakes it.  Out tumble some videotapes.  Chuck looks at them:
what good are they?

Chuck tears another box open.  Out slide some legal papers
covered with Post-its.

In quick cuts, we see him dump out computer memory boards,
some designer dresses, flowers, a pair of roller blades, a
script with a red cover -- which he never reads.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

By now he has taken all the boxes in the P.  Only H E L
remains.  He pauses to let the irony of that sink in, then
collects more boxes.  He is even more exhausted.

EXT.  PALM GROVE

Two boxes remain.  One is the box with Angel Wings.  Chuck
sets it aside.  He opens the other box.  Out tumbles a
DOCTOR'S BAG.  Chuck can't believe it.  He opens the bag.
It's full of great stuff.  Medicine.  A scalpel.  A saw.

                     CHUCK
          Okay.  Okay now.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - LATER

Hands bandaged, Chuck tries to strike a spark on the roller
blade wheel housing.  Tries over and over.  Nothing.

He takes a long drink from his canteen, and flinches.  His
tooth is starting to hurt.  He fishes some Tylenol out of the
surgeon's bag and takes two.

EXT.  OTHER SIDE OF ISLAND - DAY

Chuck picks some berries and gingerly tries them.  They're
not bad.  He eats more.  Then more.  What a relief.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

Chuck lies on his palm fronds, groaning and holding his
stomach.  He drags himself to his knees, crawls a few feet,
and throws up in great, violent heaves.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Still looking a little green, Chuck marks another day on his
tree calendar.

EXT.  SUMMIT

He stares out to sea.  Nothing.

EXT.  WELL - DAY

Chuck lies on his belly and drinks from the well, which has
filled with water.  Then he washes his face and splashes
water over his neck.  The surface of the well stills,
bringing CHUCK'S REFLECTION into focus.  He stares at
himself.

Very carefully Chuck shaves with the surgeon's scalpel.

Chuck checks out his new appearance in the water.  Much
better.  A clean start now.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY

He sits in front of his failed efforts to make fire.

                     CHUCK
          You're not getting it hot enough.  Got to
          hold the heat.  Got to hold the heat.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck carefully shaves some tinder.  Puts it under a piece of
bamboo split lengthwise with a notch cut across it.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck uses a bamboo stick to try to make friction in the
split half of the bamboo.  He saws back and forth with all
his might, pressing it down in the groove.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck gives one last saw with his bamboo and stops, utterly
defeated.  It's all too much.

                     CHUCK
          Sonofabitch!

He starts to rub again.  He breathes hard, sweat pours off
his face.  He is really going for it, what the hell!  A tiny
wisp of smoke appears!  Chuck saws with even more energy.

                     CHUCK
          Come on.  Come on.

The smoke increases.  Chuck rips away the bamboo, grabs the
nest of shavings, and blows on it frantically.  The smoke
flickers and dies.  Chuck can't believe it.

                     CHUCK
          No.  No.  No.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

Chuck lies in his bed of palm fronds, shivering.  He looks up
at the stars, which blaze furiously.

                     CHUCK
          That's the big dipper...Orion...or is
          that the Southern Cross...?  Kelly would
          know.

And he misses her so much.  A shower of meteors streaks
across the sky, as if the very heavens are raining down on
Chuck.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck readies his two sticks of bamboo again and begins
sawing with tremendous energy.  He smells something.  Is it
smoke?  He pulls off the log and looks eagerly at the nest of
tinder.  There's nothing there.

                     CHUCK
          Dammit!

He replaces the log and starts wearily to saw again.

TIME CUT

The sun has moved in the sky.  Chuck is still sawing.  Again
the smoke appears.  Again sweat pours from his face.  The
smoke increases.  He saws even harder.  His breath comes in
anguished gulps.  Smoke is curling up now.  Chuck tears away
the bamboo, picks up the nest of kindling, and blows on it
gently.  The smoke increases.

He blows some more.  A fragile crimson spark appears.

                     CHUCK
          Careful now, careful...

He gently places the nest of shavings in the kindling, then
blows on it with utmost care, as if he were holding life
itself.  He shreds his money and business cards over the tiny
flame.

Suddenly, the evening breeze lifts the nest out of the
kindling.  Desperate, Chuck grabs it.  Trying to shield it
with his body, he grabs some palm fronds and jams them into
the sand, trying to make a windbreak.  They rustle and shake
and blow over.

The wind blows harder.  Chuck jams some rocks in a circle to
make an eddy.  But the fire is out.  No words now, just a
loud, primal groan of pure despair.

And then, into his vision floats...smoke.

Chuck looks down.  A wisp of smoke curls up from the nest of
tinder!  Chuck blows on it gently.  Suddenly a tiny tongue of
flame flickers and catches on the kindling!

                     CHUCK
          Yes!  Yes!  Yes!

He feeds in some more twigs, more tinder.  The flames lick
out, catch, grow.

                     CHUCK
          If I ever forgot to thank you God, and I
          am sure I did, thank you now.

EXT.  BEACH - WIDE - NIGHT

The fire burns on the beach.  Chuck rushes about, piling on
driftwood.

EXT.  BEACH - CLOSER

Chuck darts into the jungle and returns dragging a huge log.
He throws it on the fire.  We see his face in the light of
the fire.  He is exultant.  He dances.  He sings at the top
of his lungs.  Papa-ooo-mow-mow!

Chuck throws another huge log on the fire.  Papa-papa-papa-
oooo!  The log splutters and explodes, sending up a huge
shower of sparks that climb and sparkle in the
darkness...until they merge with the stars.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - MORNING

Chuck makes a mark on the tree.  Around it he carves a flame
-- the day he mastered fire.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - LATER THAT MORNING

Chuck sharpens his spear with his stone knife.  Then he
sticks it in the flame to harden it, pulls it out, checks it,
scrapes some more.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck wades in the water with his spear.  Suddenly he stabs
it down.  A crab is on the end.

EXT.  BEACH - HALF HOUR LATER

Chuck removes a crab from out of the fire and breaks a
steaming crab claw.  Chuck takes a bite of the flaky white
meat.  Ahhh.  It tastes great.  He takes another bite -- and
flinches.

                     CHUCK
          Damn tooth!

He fumbles for his Tylenol and takes two pills.

EXT.  SUMMIT - SUNSET

Chuck stands on the summit, looking in all directions.  Then,
something on the island brings Chuck's eyes back from their
distant focus on the horizon.  From down on the beach,
beneath the palm grove, there curls a thin column of smoke.
Chuck lets a bit of pride creep into his face as he sees it.
He kneels down and begins to build a signal fire.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT - LATER

Chuck curls up in his bed of palm fronds.  The fire burns.
Around it is a large stack of crab shells.  He stares into
the fire.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - MORNING

Chuck makes another mark on the tree.  He has circled the
tree with marks several times now.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Using a safety pin and some suturing thread, Chuck fishes
carefully.  Suddenly he jerks his hand back.  On the end is a
flopping fish.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - DAY

Chuck takes a cooked fish off the fire and mixes it with some
breadfruit.  He eats the soft mixture, chewing carefully, but
his tooth hurts even worse.  There are only a few Tylenol
tablets left.  He carefully cuts one in half and swallows it.

EXT.  SUMMIT - AFTERNOON

Chuck arrives with the wood for the night.  He stares out to
sea as usual, but this time he sees something different.

WHALES.  He sees whales.  Leaping.  Broaching.  Spouting.
Water pouring off fins and flukes.  Moving.  Going somewhere.

                     CHUCK
          Beautiful.  So beautiful.

Chuck stares at them, stares until the ocean darkens and he
can see them no more.  It's late now.

Leaving, he takes one last look, as he always does.  And
another remarkable sight greets his eyes.  There, on the
horizon, just below the evening star, is a...LIGHT.  He
stares at it, fixed.

                     CHUCK
          A star.  It's a star.

But then he stares at it really hard.

                     CHUCK
          It's a ship.

EXT.  WOODS - TREE - NEXT DAY

A tree shakes and moves, quivers...

                     CHUCK
          Timberrr!

...then slowly falls with a CRASH!

                     CHUCK
          I heard that...

Chuck holds his surgeon's saw over the stump.  He walks to
another tree and begins to saw his way into the trunk.

EXT.  BEACH - SERIES OF SHOTS

Up above the high tide line, Chuck lashes a log to a row of
five logs already joined with vines.

                     CHUCK
          No more waiting.  Take action.

Chuck sews several designer dresses together with needle and
suturing thread for a sail.

                     CHUCK
          That's right.  Take action.

He cuts bamboo for the mast.  He carves driftwood for an oar.

He fills gourds with water, stores breadfruit and coconut as
he sings "Fly Me to the Moon" to himself.

He ties the sail to the mast and extends it with a bamboo
boom lashed on with palm fiber and video tape.  He ties on
the doctor's kit and the FedEx box with the angel wings.

He examines his handiwork:  a finished raft.

He brings out his old life preserver and puts it on, then
grabs hold of one corner of the raft to pull it down to the
beach.  It doesn't budge.  He tries to pull it again.
Nothing.  He leans his back into it and pushes with his legs.
Nothing.  He collapses on the beach, his breath coming in
heaves.

                     CHUCK
          How could I be so stupid?

He bangs himself on the head, over and over.

                     CHUCK
          Stupid, stupid, stupid.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - NIGHT

Chuck throws new firewood on the dwindling fire.  It comes
back to life.  Meteors streak again across the sky.  He
stares at the indifferent stars.  The moon is almost full.
Shadows of palm trees sway on the sand.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

Chuck stands by the edge of the water, which shimmers in the
reflected light of the fire.  A wave come in, licks at his
toes.  Lifts up a coconut husk, sweeps it gently out.  Chuck
watches, gets an idea.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

He begins to dig in the sand by the raft.  He grabs the oar
and digs faster, making a trench up to where the raft is.

EXT.  BEACH - MORNING

The rising tide floods water into the trench.  Chuck rocks
the raft back and forth.  It floats!  As the wave recedes, it
takes the raft with it.  Chuck has to run beside it.

CHUCK TRYING TO ESCAPE - MONTAGE

Over and over, we see Chuck capsize at the reef.  The first
time he has a bandage on his leg.  He tries everything --
different rafts, different approaches, but each time the
ocean spits him back.

EXT.  LAGOON - DAY

Defeated and utterly exhausted, Chuck swims back from his
latest failure.  He wades back ashore with the FedEx box and
throws it on the ground by the palm tree.  He has tried so
hard to escape, so incredibly hard, done everything humanly
possible and beyond.  He rips off his life preserver, throws
it into the underbrush, then collapses on the beach.

                     CHUCK
          You're too low in the water.  Too damn
          low.

Chuck's shoulders begin to shake, as he is racked with deep
sobs of despair.

And then he throws his head back and lets forth, from deep
inside himself, a SCREAM of rage and anger and pain.  The
Scream pierces the indifferent natural sounds of the island,
the rustling of the breeze, the lulling rhythm of the waves.
It is powerful, disturbing, primal.

The breeze picks up.  Behind Chuck, the palm trees begin to
sway.  The tide is reaching up toward the beach.  The waves
crash louder.  The palm trees sway even more.

Chuck picks up some wet sand and rubs it on his body.

                     CHUCK
          Dust thou art -- that's for damned sure
          -- and unto dust shalt thou return.

A few DROPS OF RAIN begin to fall, splashing on Chuck and
sizzling in the fire.

Chuck looks up:  clouds have obscured the sun.  The wind
blows harder.  The rain falls harder, streaking the sand
Chuck had rubbed on his body.  STEAM sizzles out of the fire.

Chuck looks up, disbelieving.  The bottom falls out of the
heavens -- monsoon rain, more rain than you have ever seen
before.  A long wave rolls up, its frothy fingers reaching
for the fire.

Forget the raft!  Forget despair!  The fire could go out!
This is disaster!

                     CHUCK
          Shit!

He springs into action.  Chuck grabs an empty FedEx box.
With his wooden shovel he frantically SCOOPS SOME COALS out
of the fire as the rain HISSES and POUNDS at them.  He slides
the coals into the FedEx box, grabs some sticks of driftwood
and sets off on a run.

EXT.  WOODS - DAY

Chuck runs through the woods, slipping and stumbling.  Vines
grab at him.  The rain is so thick he can hardly see.

EXT.  WOODS - MINUTES LATER

Chuck bursts out of the woods into the lava field.  Smoke
pours out of the FedEx box.  The coals are about to burn
through!

EXT.  LAVA FIELD - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck stumbles up the slippery rocks, dragging the smoking
box.  His face is drenched, desperate.

EXT.  CAVE - DAY - MINUTES LATER

Chuck tumbles into the cave just as the coals burn through
the FedEx box.

Using the remains of the box, he desperately tries to scoot
the coals into a dry spot.

One by one, THE PRECIOUS COALS GO OUT.

Dripping water off his hands and face, he pushes a few
together with his fingers, ignoring the burns.

                     CHUCK
          Please...please...please...

He stomps on the driftwood and saws at it with his knife.  He
places this kindling on the coals.  They sputter and sizzle.
Barely catch.  He fans them with the box.  A tiny flicker
catches, then starts to grow.

                     CHUCK
          Firewood.  I need firewood.

SERIES OF SHOTS

On the beach, Chuck desperately gathers more firewood in the
driving monsoon.  He can barely see.  Driven by the storm,
the waves are licking at the palm grove.

He runs through the woods.  Branches whip at his face.  Roots
tear at his feet, tripping him.

He stumbles up the lava field.  Sliding.  Struggling.  Barely
able to breathe, the rain is so strong.

INT.  CAVE - DAY

He dumps the firewood on the floor of the cave.  But where
the fire had flickered, there is only a pile of wet black
ashes.

THE FIRE IS OUT.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck lies on the floor of the cave, shivering in the
darkness as the rain falls.  His fire is out, his tooth is
killing him, he can't escape.

EXT.  CAVE - NEXT DAY

Chuck emerges from the cave.  The rain has stopped.  This is
the absolute lowest.  His face reflects his pain and despair.
He's trapped.  It's hopeless.  Everything he tried to build
is gone.

EXT.  LEDGE - DAY

Chuck slowly walks out on the ledge.  He stares down at the
waves breaking on the jagged rocks far below.

He lets go one hand.  Then lets go the other.  He is barely
balanced.  It looks like a wisp of breeze would blow him
right off.  He slides one foot to the very lip of the
precipice.

Suddenly his foot slips!

Instinctively he turns into the cliff, grabs for a hold!  One
hand reaches for a nubbing of rock, slips off!  The other
closes, his fingers straining to hold him.

He breathes in deep gasps.  He had wanted to end it, come so
close.

                     CHUCK
          What the fuck are you doing?

His deepest instinct was to survive.  And that is what he is
going to do.

                     CHUCK
          Hang on.  Just hang on.

Slowly he pulls himself back from the edge.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck walks aimlessly down the beach, feeling the burden of
starting over.  The beach is littered with seaweed and
flotsam, bits of rope, plastic bottles.  He picks up a
plastic bottle.  That will come in handy.

The Chuck sees a SOCCER BALL with "Wilson" stamped on it in
big black letters.

He picks it up, holds it, tosses it up in the air.  Then he
kicks it, then kicks it again, then runs down the beach,
trying to kick it and keep it out of the water.  Feeling joy
again, even here.

INT.  CAVE - THAT DAY

The sun is setting on his darkened cave.  The soccer ball
sits in the corner by the black cold ashes of what was once
his fire.

Chuck carves a bit of coconut meat, takes a bite and winces
as the meat hits his sore tooth.  He tosses the shell on a
small new pile of shells.

Chuck shakes out the last half Tylenol tablet.  He puts the
tablet in his mouth, then takes a sip out of his coconut
canteen.  When the water hits his tooth that hurts too.

INT.  CAVE - MORNING

Chuck mixes a mash of breadfruit and coconut.  He tries to
pack the tooth with the mash, but it's so sensitive that even
this hurts.  He pounds the floor of the cave in frustration.

INT.  CAVE - LATER

Chuck holds a stone chisel and his hammer stone.  He
positions the chisel against his inflamed tooth.  But the
thought of what he is about to do is too frightening.  He
lowers the chisel.

                     CHUCK
          Shit.  Shit.  Shit.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck tries to fill his mouth with sea water.  The pain is so
great his eyes water.

                     CHUCK
          Whoo, pig.  Sooey!

He falls back in the water and floats there, looking up at
the sky.

INT.  CAVE - LATER

Determined, Chuck hold the stone chisel again.  He raises it
slowly to his mouth and picks up the hammer stone.

                     CHUCK
          No pain, no gain.

He brings the hammer down hard on the chisel!  The screen
goes BLACK as Chuck's SCREAM continues UNDER.

FADE IN:

EXT.  OCEAN - SUNRISE - THREE YEARS LATER

The sky takes on the first colors of the day.  The ocean is
still dark, but a few waves catch the first light.  The
sunrise touches the summit, moves down the cliff, then lights
the cove.  On the screen superimpose:

                     "1000 DAYS LATER"

REFLECTION - WATER

A spear shimmers in the calm morning water.  Attached to the
spear is a man, standing completely still.

ON CHUCK

We move up out of the reflection to the real man.  His legs
are scarred.  The remnants of a dress wrap around his middle.
A stone knife on a neatly mounted haft is stuck in a belt
made of videotape and woven fiber.  Necklaces of shark's
teeth and shells hang from his neck.  His hair is long.  A
coconut frond hat is on his head.

The hand wrapped around the spear is scarred and brown as a
berry.  It holds the spear perfectly still.  The watch is
gone.

We come around slowly until we see Chuck's face.  The eyes
say it all.  They stare out with a survivor's intensity,
staring at the water, unblinking.  This is the man who used
to splash futilely about in the water trying to fish.

This is the FedEx man who was plugged into the tumult of
activity and energy, surrounded by technology and human
activity at its most intense, devoted to making seconds
count.  Now he is utterly alone, and utterly still.

And now he has all the time in the world.

Suddenly, without an once of wasted motion, he shoots the
spear forward at a low angle.  It quivers, stuck on the
bottom.  He pulls it out with a practiced twist.  On the end
is a struggling fish.

But this isn't a thrill anymore.  It's another day at the
office.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY

Chuck makes a mark on a palm tree.  He has completely covered
three other trees with marks.  It sinks in how long he has
been here.

EXT.  JUNGLE - LATER

Chuck carries the fish back from the beach.  Now there is a
well-worn trail.

INT.  CAVE - THAT AFTERNOON

Chuck enters with the fish.  We are greeted with the well-
ordered lair of a primitive stone-age man.

Clam shell spirals weave in and out around the fire hole.
Strips of eel jerky and fish hang drying from racks.

Tools are lined up neatly:  digging sticks, stone hammers and
saws, spears neatly hafted onto shafts, drills, awls.  Bits
and pieces of feathers, skins, bones, rags, leaves -- are all
neatly arranged.  Strings and cords hang from hooks.  Coconut
bowls and cooking rocks form a small kitchen.  A raincoat and
rain-hat woven of palm fronds is neatly draped over a frame.

Evocative pieces of driftwood decorate the room.  A wind
chime of obsidian flakes sways gently.  The watch hangs on a
stick.

The Angel Box has the place of honor on one side.  On the
other side the Wilson soccer ball rests on a throne of rocks.
Seaweed has been placed on the ball as hair.  Clam shells
have been stuck on for eyes, other shells form a mouth.  A
tube shell and conch form a pipe.

INT.  CAVE - FIRE - NIGHT

The fish are being smoke under a palm frond.  Eel skins hang
from sticks, roasting.  Chuck sits by the fire, hafting a
stone knife onto a wooden haft.

He ties some fiber to a stick, then braids it into string,
using both hands and his mouth for the three strands.

He ties the string tightly around the shaft.  He does his
work automatically.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT - LATER

Chuck eats some fish and some mashed breadfruit.  He chews
each bite, his eyes in distant focus.  The firelight flickers
on his face.

EXT.  CLIFF - SUNRISE

Chuck carries firewood up to the summit.  He mechanically
adds wood to the fire.  As he does so, something out to sea
catches his eye.  He stops and stands up.

CHUCK'S POV - WHALES

WHALES broach out past the rocky point.  Spouts of water
shoot into the air.

ON CHUCK

As he watches them, a light comes back into his eyes.  He
grins.  There's a big gap where his teeth had been.  He turns
and strides down the hill.

EXT.  CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER

He heads across the rock bridge that once had so terrified
him, without losing stride.  It's second nature now.

INT.  CAVE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck enters the cave, picks up the ball and heads out.

EXT.  SUMMIT - EVENING

The signal fire burns.  A spectacular cloudy sunset lights up
the sky.  Chuck sits with Wilson on the summit, a bowl of
mashed breadfruit in one hand, a bowl of roasted eel skin in
another.

As Chuck watches the sunset unfold, watches the whales going
by in the darkened water, he takes some roasted eel chips,
dips them into the breadfruit paste, and offers one to
Wilson.  His voice is flat, monotonal.

                     CHUCK
          Chips?  Dip?

But Wilson declines.

                     CHUCK
          No?

He takes a big crunchy bite.

                     CHUCK
          Another fucking day in paradise.

PULL BACK as the sun goes down and Chuck reaches into the
bowl again and dips an eel skin chip in the dip.

EXT.  ROCKY LEDGE - NIGHT - LATER

Torch in one hand, Wilson in the other, Chuck walks across
the rocky ledge.  He passes the flume without even noticing.

Suddenly his shoe breaks!  It's sandal made of woven yucca
leaves.

He bends down and fixes it, then heads on down the ledge.

EXT.  LEDGE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck makes a casual leap, a leap he has made hundreds of
times, but this time the sandal comes loose.  It catches on a
rock, and CHUCK FALLS!

His hands are cut and bruised.  He tries to get up, can't.
Chuck sits back and examines his foot.  His fingers come back
covered with blood.  He reaches out to steady himself, and
leaves a HANDPRINT OF BLOOD on the rock.

INT.  CAVE - LATER

Chuck wraps his foot in bandages.

INT.  CAVE - LATER

Chuck's face is sweaty.  He looks down at his foot.  It is
red, swollen, infected.  He stands up, tries to put some
weight on it.  The pain is intense.

Chuck sticks the scalpel onto some coals to sterilize it.  He
holds it over his foot, takes a breath, then jabs in into the
wound.  The pain is intense.  Chuck passes out.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck stirs, takes a drink, weakly tosses on another log, and
collapses back on the floor.

INT.  CAVE - DAY

Chuck wakes up, trembling, shaking, wet with sweat.  He
staggers up.  His shadow sways on the wall of the cave.  He
struggles to get another log on the fire.  He squints at his
only companion, the soccer ball.

                     CHUCK
          Help me, Wilson...

He collapses again.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck stirs and squints his eyes.  He takes a drink of water.
He is feeling better.  He puts another log on the fire and
slowly begins to chew on some breadfruit and dried fish.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck slowly wades into the water, favoring his injured foot.
But something feels different.  He glances around.  What is
it?  And then he sees something, perhaps the worst possible
sight.

CHUCK'S POV - SAIL

A SAIL is moving steadily away from the island.

CHUCK

Throws down the spear and waves his arms.

                     CHUCK
          No!  Wait!  Come back!

He runs into the water and starts to swim.  He is so weak,
however, he can only make a few strokes.  He tries to yell as
he swims...

                     CHUCK
          Wait!  Wait!

Choking and weak, he turns back and drags himself up on the
beach.  In the b.g., the sail dwindles into the distance.

EXT.  SUMMIT - LATER

Chuck struggles to the top of the hill.  His fire has been
extinguished by the rain.  In the distance, far against the
horizon, he sees a sail -- or is it a cloud?  The whiteness
shimmers against the horizon.  Chuck squints.  Whatever it
was, it is gone.  Above him some contrails from jets mark the
sky.

Furious, he kicks his signal fire, scattering the burnt-out
coals.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY

Chuck makes a new mark on his calendar tree.  Then he stops.
He CUTS an angry big line under the last mark, then hacks
away at the palm tree, slashing it with the stone knife,
ripping and marking through all his dates.  Finally the stone
knife breaks in two.  Chuck drops the broken half and catches
his breath.

EXT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck enters the cave.  No signal fires burn.  The island is
dark.

EXT.  SUMMIT - DAY

Chuck stands on the summit, staring out to sea.  Nothing, not
even a contrail, not even a whale spout.

EXT.  CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER

He is on his way down, suddenly he sees something and stops.
It's the HANDPRINT, the bloody handprint, his own handprint.

He slowly extends his hand and covers it, then pulls it away.
Traces it with his fingers.

INT.  CAVE - DAYS LATER

Chuck has the beginnings of an artist's studio.  Several
large clam shells hold paint.  A few egg shells are lined up.
Brushes have been made from roots and feathers.

Chuck covers his hand with paint and makes a handprint on the
wall of the cave.  He stands back and looks at it.

INT.  CAVE - DAY

He chews some berries, then holds his hand against the wall
of the cave and spits a dark blue mist around it.  When he
takes his hand away, the silhouette of his handprint remains.

INT.  CAVE - DAY

With the Angel Wing Box as a model, Chuck dips one of his
feather brushes in paint, and make a tentative line on the
wall of the cave.  He works hesitantly, rubs off a line,
tries again.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck is finishing his first figure, a crude portrait of a
man -- himself?  Hard to tell.  He examines his work.  He
takes some shells and sticks them on as eyes.

Chuck picks up Wilson, thinks.

                     CHUCK
          You old airhead, you need a makeover.

He takes some charcoal out of his fire and draws eyebrows on
the ball.  Then, he mashes some berries, dips his fingers in
the juice, and makes lips.  He sticks shells on with clay for
eyes.  Then he looks at the face.

                     CHUCK
          Wilson, you bad!

He sits back and regards his companion.  He gestures around
the cave at the new paintings.

                     CHUCK
          What do you think?

But Wilson doesn't have an opinion.

                     CHUCK
          You don't share much, do you?

Idly Chuck takes down the Angel Box.

                     CHUCK
          I guess I know how Kelly felt.

For a long time he studies the wings on it.  With a stick, he
tries to draw a similar wing on the dusty floor of the cave.
Dissatisfied, he wipes it away.  He looks at the Angel Box.

Casually he reaches over and cuts it open with a stone knife.
Inside he finds two bottles of green salsa.  And a letter.

He reads over it.

                     CHUCK
          You said our life was a prison.  Dull.
          Boring.  Empty.  I can't begin to tell
          you how much that hurt.  I don't want to
          lose you.  I'm enclosing some salsa, the
          verde you like.  Use it on your sticky
          rice and think of home.  Then come home
          -- to me.  We'll find the spice in our
          lives again.  Together.  I love you.
          Always.  Bettina.

Visibly moved, Chuck puts down the letter.

                     CHUCK
          He never got it.

EXT.  ISLAND - DAY

The monsoon pours down.  Wind whips the palm trees.  The
waves are gray and angry, tearing at the beach.

INT.  CAVE - DAY

As the rain pours down outside, Chuck studies the sodden,
ruined photograph of Kelly, which is really only a gray mess.

                     CHUCK
          She's probably found someone else.  I
          would have.

Chuck dips his finger into one of the bowls of colors and
streaks it slowly across his face.  To exorcise his
loneliness, he will paint on the most expressive canvas there
is:  his own body.

CHUCK PAINTING HIMSELF - MONTAGE

Close-up on scarred fingers, as they paint on Chuck's face
and body.  Color on skin.  Tight dramatic shots of Chuck
being transformed.

Chuck takes white paint and covers his hand.  Then he presses
it into his chest and makes a handprint.  He draws a yellow
spiral on his leg, then takes red and makes jagged lightning
bolts on his chest on either side of the hand.

WATER

Shimmers in a gourd.  Chuck's face swims into focus.  It has
been painted white.  Looking at himself in the reflection, he
dots on blue stars with dark blue from squid ink.

EXT.  CAVE - LATER

The rains have stopped.  The island is washed bright and
green.

ON CHUCK

As he stands up in the cove.  His face is white with blue
stars.  Handprints circle his torso, flanked by red lightning
bolts.  Braided cords circle his biceps.  Bone necklaces hang
from his neck.  Feathers jut out from his hair.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY

Chuck goes from tree to tree, making handprints along his
path.  Chuck was here.  This is his mark.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - DAY

He covers the calendar trees with handprints.  Then stops.
Sees something.  Eyes fixed on the beach, he walks toward the
shoreline.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck emerges from the palm trees, and now we see what he had
seen.

A FIFTY-FIVE GALLON OIL DRUM.

And another one.  TWO.  Chuck stares at the barrels.

                     CHUCK
          Hello.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck sits staring at the oil drums.  It's almost as if he is
hesitating to take advantage of them.  That he may not want,
really, to leave now.

Then his inner struggle ends.

                     CHUCK
          What the hell are you waiting for?

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Filled with determination, Chuck rolls a barrel up the beach.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Using a palm tree as a fulcrum, Chuck hauls hard on a rope
made of vines, pulling the barrel up off the beach.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY

Chuck throws aside palm leaves, revealing...the remains of
his raft.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck is drawing with a purpose now.  And we see what he is
working on.  The plans for a raft.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck is making a list of what he needs.  He works intently.

                     CHUCK
          Canteens.  Sea anchor.  Got to weave
          rope.  Spears.  A sail.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY

Chuck lashes the barrels onto the raft.  Checks the knots.
Lashes more rope.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

He sews dresses together with handmade fiber string.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

He weaves videotape together to form a sea anchor.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck digs a channel toward the raft.

INT.  CAVE - DAY

Chuck constructs a water collection device with some FedEx
boxes, some plastic weighted with a stone.  Explains it to
Wilson.

                     CHUCK
          Now I'm hoping that if this is airtight
          I'll get condensation down here, a cup or
          so a day.  If I'm careful it should be
          enough.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck writes on the wall.

                     CHUCK
          If I never return, know that here lived
          Chuck Noland for four years.  I drew
          these paintings.  I made these marks.
          And then I took my fate in my own hands
          and set forth to save myself, God
          willing.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck loads the raft, which rocks gently in the cove.  He has
a sail made of designer dresses sewn together with fiber
thread.  A sea anchor secured by videotape woven together
into a rope.  Plastic bottles filled with water.  A signal
kite made of FedEx paper.

Then comes the FedEx box with the angel wings.  Then Wilson.

                     CHUCK
          Wilson, my main man.  Time to go.

And he gently leads the raft into the lagoon.

                     CHUCK
          Wonder what odds Stan would give me on
          this.  I'd say 90-10.  Against.

He jumps onto the raft, begins to paddle out toward where the
surf crashes onto the reef.

EXT.  LAGOON - DAY

Waves break against the reef.  With his paddles Chuck
maneuvers the raft toward the cut in the reef.  Boom!  The
wave crashes, the water surges through the cut, then recedes
with a whoosh.

Chuck watches, times the waves, paddles like mad.  He's
committed.  SCRAPE goes the first barrel, then the second,
riding the receding wave.  He's out!

But the next wave is already surging forward.  It smashes the
raft against the reef!  Coconuts and foodstuffs hurtle off
the raft!

The barrels cushion the impact.  The raft tilts, spins, but
stays outside the reef!  The ropes holding the jugs of water
break!  The water sweeps overboard!

The wave recedes again.  Chuck recovers, paddles with all his
strength, and then he's clear of the breakers!

For a long moment he floats on the rollers, getting his
breath.

The water jugs float away, carried by the waves back into the
lagoon.  Chuck could go back and get them.  If he were being
prudent, he definitely would.

But he's out.  He might never get back out again.

He stares at the lagoon and the receding water jugs.  Then he
stares at the island.  Goodbye to all that.

                     CHUCK
          Wilson, we're out of here.

He turns and begins raising the sail.

EXT.  OCEAN - WIDE - MINUTES LATER

Powered by its multicolored makeshift sail, trailing its
gently flapping signal kite of FedEx paper, the raft slowly
moves away from the island, out toward the open ocean.

And we pull back until the ocean swallows the tiny raft and
then we TILT DOWN AND...

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY - FOUR WEEKS LATER

The ocean again, low.  The raft floats into frame.  A trace
of a breeze flaps the signal kite, which barely stays aloft,
its rope frayed and tattered.  The still is set up in the
middle, plastic with a rock weighting down the center.

Chuck is gaunt, his clothes rotted.

He lies looking over the side of the raft, spear in one hand,
staring intently at the water.

Dorados swim like specters, flashing and darting.  Chuck
stabs with his spear.  Stabs again.

                     CHUCK
          Slow down, damn you!

Exhausted, he sinks back to the raft.  Two Dorados leap into
the air ahead of him.

Chuck tries to stare again into the water.  He spots another
fish, a flash of silver under the surface.

Chuck struggles to his feet, raises his spear.  SPLAT!
Something strikes him in the chest, almost knocking him into
the water.

On the raft we see flashes of silver and green and blue.  A
FLYING FISH.  Chuck dives at it, catches it, loses it.

                     CHUCK
          Catch it catch it catch it --

He catches it again just as it almost flops over the side.

EXT.  RAFT - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck sucks the juice out of the head.  He chews meat off the
tiny rib bones.

Chuck is in the stage of malnutrition, vitamin deprivation,
salt insufficiency, and exposure where the personality splits
and becomes external.  Like all castaways, he has
conversations with the two sides of himself.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Save some for tomorrow.

                     BADCHUCK
          Catch another fish tomorrow.

BadChuck wins.  Chuck keeps eating.  He stares up at the sun,
which beats down unmercifully.

EXT.  RAFT - DAY - LATER

The raft drifts.  Chuck has taken down the sail and rigged it
as a canopy.  Drenched with sweat, Chuck lies on the raft,
trying to sleep.  He dabs at some sores that are ulcerating
his body and won't let him get comfortable.  Plus, there's a
chaffing, squeaking sound.  He looks around for the source.

We see it with him.  One of the ropes is frayed and about to
break.  If it does, the logs will come apart from the floats.

                     BADCHUCK
          Shit!  Shit!  Shit!

                     GOODCHUCK
          Stay calm, identify the problem.
          Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix
          rope.

                     BADCHUCK
          With what?  There's nothing to fix it
          with.  This rope comes undone, you're
          going to drown.

                     GOOD CHUCK
          Just get up and fix it.

                     BADCHUCK
          Too tired.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Get up.

                     BADCHUCK
          Feels so good to lie here.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Get up, damn you.

Chuck comes to his knees.  Then sinks back down.

                     BADCHUCK
          Can't.  Need water.

                     GOODCHUCK
          You've had today's water.

                     BADCHUCK
          Thirsty.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Come on, shape up, get going, you can do
          it.

                     BADCHUCK
          No water, no work.

Chuck tries another tack.  Sweet reason.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Okay look, I know you're tired, I know
          you're thirsty, but give it one more
          shot, you've just got to do a little
          more.

                     BADCHUCK
          Do too much, I'll die.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Do too little you'll die.

                     BADCHUCK
          Going to die anyway.

That stops GoodChuck for a moment.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Okay, look have an extra swallow.

He holds up the pathetic little jar with its few teaspoons of
murky water.

                     BADCHUCK
          No more water, you said.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Take it.

                     BADCHUCK
          No.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Take it, damn it.

                     BADCHUCK
          No.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the
          damn water.

Slowly Chuck gets up, lifts up the water jar, and takes a
swallow.  Then another.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Stop.  Enough.

Then another.

EXT.  RAFT - DAY - LATER

Chuck works to braid a new rope.  He is focused,
concentrating as hard as he can, but everything is slow and
hard and he's weak and clumsy.  He tests the rope, but it
doesn't hold.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Think.  Got to use something else.

He gets an idea, starts to pull the signal kite in.

                     BADCHUCK
          If they can't see you, what's the point?

                     GOODCHUCK
          Survive today, that's the point.

The kite rope is much thinner than the rope he had used to
tie the logs, but it's all he has.  He ties the log with the
kite rope.  Exhausted, he lies back down.

EXT.  RAFT - NIGHT

The moon is full.  The waves cast off shadows on the ocean.
Chuck is staring into the sky, trying to find a star to
navigate by.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too
          far south.

                     BADCHUCK
          You don't know where you are.  You missed
          the shipping lanes.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Moon's too bright.

We hear the fraying sound again.

EXT.  RAFT - DAY

Chuck saws at the outer log with his stone knife.  Across the
water comes a storm.  We can see it like a waterfall moving
toward us.

                     BADCHUCK
          You're putting off the inevitable.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I'm putting it off.

He looks at the deteriorating rope, at the rotting sail.

                     BADCHUCK
          That's what's happening to you.

Chuck pushes the outer log away, then takes the loose rope
and begins to lash it around the center logs.

                     BADCHUCK
          You're rotting away.

The raft is rocking.  The waves are stronger.  It's hard to
tie the logs together.

Rain falls like a sheet on Chuck.

                     BADCHUCK
          Get water!

                     GOODCHUCK
          Fix raft first.

                     BADCHUCK
          Water water water --

Chuck works frantically in the rain, trying to tie the rope.
Finally he does.

Then he scrambles for his water collecting funnel, struggles
to pull it up.  One corner is stuck and collapses.
Desperately he rights it, pulls the funnel up.

Drops begin to run down the sides and collect in the jar.
Soaked, Chuck stares at the water as it rises.

Then the rain stops.

We see the line of rain recede away from Chuck, spattering
the ocean.  But all around him the ocean is calm again.

And out comes the sun.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

The raft floats on quiet seas.  The sky is blue, with few
high cirrus clouds so motionless they seem pasted on.

Chuck lies on the raft, sick and weak.

Suddenly, from the depths beside him, silently rises a huge
shape.

A SPERM WHALE, still mainly submerged.  The blow hole is near
Chuck, wet and pulsing like giant lips.  The eye of the whale
is only a few feet away.  It looks upon Chuck out of an
intelligence deep and alien.

He slowly comes to his knees and stares at it.

The blow hole opens and WHOOSH, out shoots a geyser of fine
spray which settles on Chuck in a mist.

The whale rises farther, dwarfing the raft.  From the whale
comes a deep sound like a foghorn.

Startled, Chuck jumps back, rocking the raft.  He catches
himself, slowly reaches out and touches the whale.

The whale blows again, drenching Chuck in more spray.

Chuck touches the whale again.

                     GOODCHUCK
          You like that?

Very slowly it drifts along with the raft.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Lost your mate?

We look right into the whale's eye.  Beneath the surface we
can see the huge jaws open and close.

                     GOODCHUCK
          You're beautiful.  Marry me.

                     BADCHUCK
          You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the
          raft.

Very slowly the whale moves ahead of the raft, its vast body
passing Chuck.

                     GOODCHUCK
          No, don't go.  Look, I've got fish.

Chuck rips a fillet off the line and throws it in front of
the whale, which ignores it.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Please don't dive.  Please.

The whale slowly sinks, then suddenly arches its huge back
and heads straight for the bottom.

For a moment, all that remains are the flukes, black and
vertical against the dark blue sky.  With one swoop, those
flukes could destroy Chuck and his raft.  But they don't do
anything except slowly sink.

Then it is gone.

We are on Chuck's face as he stares at where the whale had
been, the surface marked only by a ring of concentric ripples
that reach out and gently rock the raft.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

Chuck checks the water.  It is green and full of floaties.
It looks awful.  He takes the jug, puts it to his mouth, and
drinks.  Instantly he throws up back into the jug, barely
keeps from dropping it.

                     BADCHUCK
          Look what you've done.

He dips his hand into the ocean, splashes some sea water on
his face, splutters it out, then licks his lips.  He is so
thirsty.

He looks at the water jug, full now with his own vomit, turns
away, begins to work on the sea anchor again.

But the work makes him even thirstier.  He looks at the jug
again.

Picks it up.  Takes a long drink.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

The fish return.  Chuck gets up with his spear, then puts it
down.

                     BADCHUCK
          What are you doing?

                     GOODCHUCK
          Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't
          kill my friends anymore.

                     BADCHUCK
          You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or
          you die.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Why do they have to die for me?

                     BADCHUCK
          They'd eat you if they could.  They're
          laughing at you.  Listen.

Chuck listens.  Doesn't hear anything.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Got to eat.

Chuck picks up the spear, stabs it, misses.

Suddenly he has a fish on the end of the spear.  It
struggles, he scoops it onto the raft, brutally pounds on its
head, twists the stone knife into its spine.  The struggling
stops.

Chuck looks at the dead fish and begins to sob.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I am so sorry.

He cries uncontrollably.  As he cries he cuts off the head,
pulls out the eyeballs, and eats each one.  Then he sucks the
marrow out of the head.

Then takes the heart and eats that.  Then eats the liver.

As he is chewing, he cuts the meat into strips.

When he is done, he takes the backbone, breaks it, and sucks
on it.

Fish scales shine in his hair, blood covers his chest.

EXT.  OCEAN - NIGHT

The raft rocks gently.  Chuck looks up.  The strips of fish
are glowing.  So is the deck where he killed the fish.

He reaches out to touch the fish strips.  His hand is glowing
too.

                     CHUCK
          I'm an angel.

Suddenly he sees other lights.  A ship.  A ship is out there.
And he hears it, a humming in deep register.

He waves his hands.  He yells.

                     CHUCK
          Here!  Here!

His voice cracks, we can barely hear it over the ocean.

The lights move on.

                     CHUCK
          No...no...no...

His raft is rocked by the wake, rocked hard.  Chuck is thrown
into the water!

He comes to the surface, sputtering.  Where is the raft?

He looks one way, then another.  Darkness.

This is the worst.

He turns again in the water.  There, dimly, he can see the
glow from the fish he killed.  The glow saves his life.

He swims toward it.

He pulls himself back on the raft.

He lies there exhausted, the glow from the phosphorescence
casting a greenish light on his face.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

Clouds are building up.  In the distance lightning flashes.
The clouds come closer.

Little bits of electricity jump off the mast.  Saint Elmos
fire jumps around Chuck's hand.

Fascinated, he holds out his hand.  The fire jumps from his
hand to the mast.

Suddenly lightning shoots from the sky and strikes the ocean!
A huge spout of water explodes like a depth charge.  The
CRACK is intense, then rolls away.

Chuck stares, then realizes the danger and throws himself
down on the raft.  Suddenly a wall of rain sweeps over him
and the ocean begins to roll.  The thunder is deafening.
Lightning flashes bursts through the rain.

                     CHUCK
          Sea anchor!  Let out the sea anchor!

Frantic, Chuck lets out the sea anchor as the raft scuds down
a huge wave.  The anchor catches, slowing the raft so that it
rides the wave down.

The waves come at him high as houses.  The raft rides up one
side, then plunges down the next.

All Chuck can do is hold on.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

The storm has passed.  The raft floats on big dark rollers.

We hear the chirping and squeaking of dolphins.  They come
close to the raft.  Chuck watches them play.  Then realizes
they are chasing his fish.  They drive them along, into the
path of another dolphin, who darts in and rips into the
dorado, turning the water around the raft into churning,
bloody foam.

                     CHUCK
          Stop!

He takes his oar and begins beating the water.  The killing
continues.

                     CHUCK
          You fucking murderers!

Suddenly the water is still.  One dolphin sticks its head out
of the water and stares at Chuck, squeaking.

Another dolphin lifts its head up, then another.  They squeak
to each other, clearly communicating and talking about Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          I know you're talking about me!

He splashes the water with his oar.

They dive, then jump into the air, squeaking as they go.

                     CHUCK
               (very softly)
          Take me with you.

They're gone.

                     CHUCK
          Why me?  Why me, God?

He begins to laugh.

                     BADCHUCK
          Listen to this, Wilson.
               (deep voice: God)
          Because you piss me off.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

Chuck tries to stretch with some simple yoga.  Each movement
takes forever.

He rolls over onto his stomach and tries to do a pushup.  He
can't.  Collapses onto the raft.

                     BADCHUCK
          You're falling apart.

Tries to do another pushup.  Can't.

                     BADCHUCK
          First you eat your fat, then you eat your
          muscle.

He rolls over.

                     BADCHUCK
          Then you eat your mind.

He looks at the ocean.  They're in a line of garbage, a thick
slick of debris dumped off of ships.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Roll on you deep and dark blue ocean
          roll.

He closes his eyes.  After a minute they come open.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I'm late, I'm late, for a very important
          date.

They slowly close again.

                     BADCHUCK
          I'm lost.  Goodbye.

                     GOODCHUCK
          No!

His eyes come open again.

                     BADCHUCK
          Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean
          would feel so good, the water's so soft
          and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.

                     GOODCHUCK
          You quitter you quitter you quitter.

                     BADCHUCK
          The sea is lovely, dark and deep.

                     GOODCHUCK
          But I have promises to keep.
               (rolls over)
          And miles to go before I sleep.
               (props himself up)
          And miles to go before I sleep.
               (purpose now)
          Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.

                     BADCHUCK
          Use the sail for a sea anchor and you
          won't move.

                     GOODCHUCK
          If I don't have a sea anchor I'll
          capsize.

                     BADCHUCK
          Die tomorrow or die today.

He hums Beethoven's fifth.  BA BA BA BUM.

                     BADCHUCK
          That's death knocking, knocking on your
          door.  Crazy little woman come knocking,
          knocking at my front door...

                     GOODCHUCK
          Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other
          people get through a lot worse.

                     BADCHUCK
          Yeah, sure, what?

He hums to himself, begins to sing, Beatles.

                     BADCHUCK
          I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink...

He pulls in the loose sea anchor rope, which is covered with
barnacles.

He scrapes the barnacle off the rope into the water jug, then
sips it.

The sun is setting, huge rays shoot out across the sky.

Out of the empty ocean the Dorados suddenly appear, leaping
flashes of silver right by the raft.

One Dorado swims right by the raft, broadside.

Chuck looks at it, uncomprehending.  Then slowly reaches for
his spear.

                     GOODCHUCK
          What?  Are you sacrificing yourself for
          me?

Carefully he comes to his feet, then shoots the spear into
the fish.

Flapping and struggling, it lands on the deck.  Chuck pounces
on it.

EXT.  RAFT - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

He cuts it open.  The other Dorados ram the raft in fury,
like a lynch mob.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Damn it!  I had to do it!

The banging continues.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I'm sorry!

He concentrates on his work, then sits back on his heels in
amazement.  There's another fish inside.  He holds that fish
up, stares at it, then cuts it open.

There's a smaller fish inside it.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I know there's a moral here, God, but
          right now I'm just going to eat.

He pops out an eyeball, then another, and crunches them
between his teeth.

He takes the heart and liver, starts to eat, then stops.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Forgot to say grace.  Sorry Mom.

He struggles to remember.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts and
          Christ and the bounty about to receive,
          or something...amen.

He eats them.

EXT.  RAFT - NEXT MORNING

Chuck splashes sea water on his face.  Adjusts the water
still.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Please don't leak.  Please.

Chuck picks up the smallest fish.  It's half digested.  He
washes it in the ocean, trigger fish come up and nibble at
his fingers.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Don't look at me.  It was that Dorado.

He cuts the small fish and hangs it on the stays.

                     GOODCHUCK
          You know, Wilson, every now and then we
          should say thank you.  Thank you God.

                     BADCHUCK
          Thank you for fucking up my life.

Suddenly something bumps the raft.  Hard.  Then again.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Not again.

Fins cut the water.  SHARKS.  A big hammerhead bumps the
raft.  BadChuck hums the theme from "Jaws."  Chuck takes his
spear stabs at the shark.

                     BADCHUCK
          He's going to get you, going to get
          you...

Another one circles in, bumps the raft.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Get away from me!

The shark circles again, that big hammerhead like a
nightmare.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Get him get him get him.

He stabs at it with his spear.  He might as well have stabbed
concrete.  The shark circle, Chuck stabs again.

But the shark is gone.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Where are you?  Where are you?

Stabs again and again at the empty ocean.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Stop!  You're using energy.  Move slowly.
          Be patient.

Chuck kneels, wavering, on the raft.  The ocean is calm.

Suddenly, BUMP.  The raft tilts.

Chuck hangs on.

Then a shark appears, just out of spear range.  Its lifeless
black eyes seem to stare right through Chuck.

If the Dorado was a gift from God, this is a message from
Hell.

Then the shark is gone.

EXT.  RAFT - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck lies back on the raft.  He is humming.

                     BADCHUCK
          What are you smiling about?  They'll be
          back.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody
          Hotel.  With Kelly.

He smiles at the thought.

                     GOODCHUCK
          The music ends.  We go back to the table.
          The waiters have brought dinner.  New
          York Strip with Bordelaise Sauce.
          Mushrooms in brown gravy.  Roasted
          potatoes with garlic and rosemary.  Green
          Beans with almonds.  Fresh biscuits and
          cornbread, dripping with butter.  A nice
          salad with ranch dressing.  A jumbo
          shrimp cocktail.

Thinks about that, it spoils the picture.

                     GOODCHUCK
          No shrimp.
               (then)
          We eat.

He closes his eyes.  This is the greatest fantasy.

                     GOODCHUCK
               (as the waiter)
          For dessert, we have pecan pie a la mode,
          we have a double chocolate cake with
          creme anglaise, we have a nice pear
          torte, fresh key lime pie, or perhaps if
          you care to wait a few minutes, a grand
          marnier souffle?

Chuck thinks over the options, thinking of each one.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Why, bring them all, bring them all.

He rolls over.  There, square in his vision, is a ship, its
form coming in and out of a low haze.

Chuck jumps to his feet.  Waves.  Screams.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Here!  Over here!

The ship moves on.  We can see the decks the rigging, the
vastness of it.

Chuck realizes he is naked.  Struggles to pull on the remains
of his pants finally holds them like a diaper with one hand
as he continues to wave.

On the ship no one is to be seen.  It is a spooky sight.

The big tanker moves on.

We are on Chuck's face.  Passed up again.

Then he realizes what is about to happen.  He throws out the
sea anchor.

He throws himself onto the raft and grips it as tight as he
can, wiggles his feet into the ropes.

                     CHUCK
          Oh, shiiiittt!

Then comes the wake of the ship.  It rocks the raft like a
piece of flotsam.  The raft rides high up on the wave, then
shoots down it, but the sea anchor holds, and the raft slows
and rides along with the wave.

And then the sea is calm again.

Slowly Chuck sinks to his knees.  His hand lets loose his
pants.

He lies down on the raft and imagines the conversation with
the ship's captain.

                     CHUCK
          Permission to come aboard, sir.

                     CHUCK/CAPTAIN
          Permission granted.

                     CHUCK
          May I ask, where are you bound?

                     CHUCK/CAPTAIN
          San Francisco.  And you?

                     CHUCK
          As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco
          myself.

                     CHUCK/CAPTAIN
          Would you do us the honor of joining us?
          We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork
          chops and gravy, cranberries, baked
          potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh-
          baked bread, apple pie...

                     CHUCK
          No please, join me.  Some sundried fish
          strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to
          munch on.

The depression comes back again.

                     BADCHUCK
          They're never going to see you.  You're
          just another piece of trash in the ocean.

                     GOODCHUCK
          They're on autopilot.

                     BADCHUCK
          They're always on autopilot.  Or else
          it's night, or you're in the sun, or
          you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll
          never see you.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Damn it!  Don't be so negative!

Chuck picks up Wilson.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Wilson, what's your story?

He holds Wilson close to his chest.

                     BADCHUCK
          I float.  You sink.  End of story.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I'm serious.  I'm always going on about
          me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.

                     BADCHUCK
          It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Shut up.

He lies on the raft and holds Wilson close.

We move up until we see --

EXT.  OCEAN - AERIAL - EVENING

Chuck lying curled up on the raft, Wilson cradled in his
arms, and all around the vast empty ocean.

EXT.  OCEAN - NEXT MORNING

Chuck slowly wakes up.  Sets Wilson aside.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Don't shirk, don't procrastinate, don't
          be lazy.  We're okay today.  We're okay
          today.

And the other Chuck begins to laugh.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Shut up.

The laughter goes on.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Shut the fuck up!  I mean it.

He stands up and checks the horizon.

                     GOODCHUCK
          What's so damn funny?

                     BADCHUCK
          You are.

Suddenly Chuck sees something on the horizon.  A bank of
clouds.  A cone of -- land.

He squints, stares again.  The clouds part.  It looks like --
his island.

Chuck doesn't know whether to feel joy or despair.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Jesus.

                     BADCHUCK
          Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage.

Chuck squints.

                     GOODCHUCK
          It's real.

                     BADCHUCK
          Nothing out there but ocean.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Let's get a second opinion.  Wilson?
          What do you see?

Chuck picks up the soccer ball, holds it up, and stares out
at...ocean.

EXT.  RAFT - DAY - LATER

Chuck slowly writes on the sail.

                     CHUCK
          Chuck Noland.  Born October 8, 1958.
          Died -- pick a date -- July 11, 1998.
          And now the epitaph.  Met deadlines.
          Kept appointments.  Lost without a trace.

He sits back, looks at the mock headstone.

                     BADCHUCK
          What did it matter if FedEx was five
          minutes late one day?  The next day we
          just start over again.

                     GOODCHUCK
          It matters.  We do the best we can,
          that's all we have.

                     BADCHUCK
          Then we've just got shit.

He goes on writing.

                     CHUCK
          I am writing this to remind myself to
          live a better life.  If I am lost,
          perhaps you who find this will be
          instructed to live a better live
          yourself.  Live each day.  Love your
          children.  Don't take anyone for granted.

                     BADCHUCK
          Is that it?  Life is a fucking Disney
          movie?

The waves begin to grow, the ocean turns a slate gray.  Far
above him, great frigate birds circle.  Suddenly one dives on
a booby which has caught a fish.  The great frigate bird
swoops all around the booby until, panicked, it drops the
fish, which plummets toward the sea.

With a graceful dive, the huge bird grabs the fish and then
soars up on a thermal, high into the sky.

Lightning flashes back and forth across the horizon, which is
turning black and dark.  Thunder rolls.

EXT.  RAFT - NIGHT

The raft goes up and down huge waves.  Every few seconds
lightning flashes, illuminating the raft and Chuck holding
desperately to it, his eyes wild with fear.

EXT.  RAFT - MORNING

The waves continue.  Chuck holds on, his face pale.

                     BADCHUCK
          You can't make it.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY - LATER

The sky clears.  The waves are still big.  The fish are back.
And then come the sharks, cutting through the water.  Chuck
can't get up to get his spear, he just has to watch as blood
darkens the water.

And then the sharks are gone.

Chuck comes to his knees slowly, then a big wave hits.
Wilson is swept into the ocean!

For a moment Chuck is uncomprehending.  He watches as Wilson
slowly floats away.

                     CHUCK
          Please, no sharks.

Then he dives in to the water!  Swims frantically after
Wilson.

Wilson floats away from him.  He swims, but he's so weak.
Finally he gets to Wilson.  He reaches out, but only pushes
the ball farther away.

It bobs on the waves.  Chuck treads water, exhausted.

Where is the raft?

                     CHUCK
          Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.

Then he turns back the other way.  The raft has drifted by
him.  He can go after Wilson, or he can go after the raft.

                     CHUCK
          Shit!  Wilson!

He swims toward the raft, barely moving.  No matter how hard
he swims, the raft seems to recede from him.

Finally he reaches it, hangs on the side, breathing hard,
choking, crying.

He struggles to pull himself on board.

But he is weak, so weak.  He can't do it.

Summoning some primitive reserve of strength, he tries again.
This time he slides on.

He lies on the raft, panting.

Then with all his strength he pulls himself to his feet,
holds on to the mast, scans the ocean for Wilson.

                     CHUCK
          Wilson!

Nothing but waves.

This is too much.  Chuck starts to cry.

EXT.  RAFT - DAY - LATER

Chuck takes a swallow of water, washes it around in his
mouth, then swallows.  With his wet tongue he licks his
cracked lips.

The sun breaks through the clouds.

With what strength he has left, Chuck raises the canopy,
fastens it.

He sits in the meager shade, his head between his knees.

Closes his eyes.  Just for a minute.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY - LATER

A different sort of shadow crosses Chuck's face.  He opens
his eyes.

There, riding right beside his raft, is a ship, a huge rusty
tanker.  Someone shouts down in a language we don't
understand.

Chuck sits up, can't believe it.  Struggles to cover himself.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY - LATER

Chuck is lifted up the rusted steel side of the boat in a
Jacob's ladder.

EXT.  SHIP - DAY - LATER

Chuck steps on board, can't support himself.

The crew gathers around.  None of them speak English, but
there is a spontaneous outburst of human connection.

One man brings some water.  Another a blanket.  Another some
warm tea.

Chuck sits there, shivering now.

                     CHUCK
          Thank you.  Oh thank you.

Deliriously happy.  Delirious.

INT.  U.S. NAVAL HOSPITAL - HAWAII

A cavernous hanger-sized ward brightly lit and filled with
row upon row of hospital beds, each with its table, side
chair, and lamp, each with a stainless steel bedpan and
neatly folded sheets and blankets stacked ready to use, and
each completely empty.

Except for one.

And on that bed we see Chuck, in a blue hospital gown.  An IV
drips into his arm.  He plays idly with the remote control of
the bed.  He raises the head, then the foot.  He pushes
another button and the knee rest bends the bed again.

A DOCTOR enters, carrying a thick chart.  Chuck gives him a
big manic grin.  Malcolm MacDowell in "A Clockwork Orange."

                     CHUCK
          My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?

                     DOCTOR
          Under the circumstances your overall
          health is good.  Those salt water boils
          you picked up on the raft are ulcerated,
          but they're healing nicely.

He checks his blood work records.

                     DOCTOR
          Hemoglobin's 10.8 -- you're anemic,
          that's why we're giving you iron.
          Potassium's low -- we're giving you an
          electrolyte solution with your IV.
          Sodium's over 150, way too high.  You may
          experience swelling in your extremities
          as you rehydrate and discharge the salt.
          In spite of your dietary deficiencies
          there's no sign of mental deterioration.

Chuck has been trying not to laugh.  Now he can't stop
himself.

                     DOCTOR
          What's so funny.

Chuck can't seem to help laughing at everything.

                     CHUCK
          Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still
          ache?

                     DOCTOR
          Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency.
          Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the
          above.

                     CHUCK
          All I ate was fish.  That's solid
          protein.

                     DOCTOR
          Protein digestion is very costly in water
          usage.

                     CHUCK
          Which I didn't have.

                     DOCTOR
          And fish are very low in fat, which is
          energy inefficient.  So you're going to
          burn up your own cells no matter how much
          you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and
          pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C,
          so you didn't get scurvy.

Chuck laughs again.

                     CHUCK
          I am one lucky guy.

                     DOCTOR
          Your body chemistry and your exposure to
          the elements would normally lead to
          irritability, depression, anxiety,
          periods of self-reproach.  It's almost
          like schizophrenia.  Different sides of
          your personality might come to life,
          speak out, act out.

                     CHUCK
          But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now.

He starts to laugh again.

                     DOCTOR
          If you say you are.

                     CHUCK
          I most definitely say I am.

                     DOCTOR
          Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the
          Vietnam POW syndrome with you.

Chuck stifles his laughter.

                     CHUCK
          Yes, yes he did.

                     DOCTOR
          You are aware of the potential
          disruptiveness on your loved ones when
          you return to your old life?

                     CHUCK
          Not to mention on me.

The laughter again.  Unsettling.

                     DOCTOR
          You sure you don't want some counseling?

Chuck gives his biggest smile.

                     CHUCK
          Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on
          the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be
          back, I can't tell you.  I just want out
          of here.

                     DOCTOR
          Well, when that IV runs out, you're
          through with us.  Just the dentist
          tomorrow.

INT.  HOSPITAL - NIGHT - LATER

Rolling his IV, Chuck walks very slowly out of the ward.
Every step is an effort.

INT.  PHONE CUBICLE - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

A small windowless room with only a desk and a phone, lit by
a fluorescent lamp.  Chuck is listening to the phone ring.

Kelly answers.

                     KELLY (V.O.)
          Hello.

Chuck is overcome for a moment, can't say a word.

                     KELLY (V.O.)
          Hello?  Hello?

For some reason he can't keep himself from laughing.  He
covers the mouthpiece and laughs.

And then we hear a dial tone, harsh, mechanical, final.

EXT.  PHONE CUBICLE - MINUTES LATER

We can see Chuck inside, staring at the phone.

INT.  PHONE CUBICLE - MINUTES LATER

We hear a faint persistent hum.  Chuck looks around, trying
to locate the sound.  He looks up, focuses on the fluorescent
light, that background sound he can no longer tune out, then
picks up the phone again.

EXT.  PHONE CUBICLE

Stan answers the phone.

                     STAN (V.O.)
          Hello?

                     CHUCK
          Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...

The laughter again.

                     STAN (V.O.)
          Whoever you are, you are one sick fucker.

And again we hear the dial tone.

INT.  PHONE CUBICLE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck's on the phone again.

                     CHUCK
          Two Valium and the Rolling Stones.  That
          ring a bell?

There's a long silence.  Then we hear Stan's voice.

                     STAN (V.O.)
          God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!

                     CHUCK
          It's me.

                     STAN (V.O.)
          You're fucking dead!

                     CHUCK
          I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I
          recall, you're the sick fucker.

Chuck begins to laugh, a little too loud, a little too
shrill.  He's on a high.

EXT.  HAWAII - BEACH RESTAURANT

A terrace by the ocean.  Tables filled with diners.  Food
being delivered by waiters.  So simple, eating.  So taken for
granted.

At one table sits Chuck, dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and
shorts, with a half-dozen plates in front of him.  He
gestures to the waiter.  Bring me more.  It all tastes so
damned good.

Behind him is the ocean.  Chuck doesn't glance at it.

INT.  DENTIST - NEXT DAY

An attractive DENTAL TECHNICIAN with an Australian accent
cleans Chuck's teeth with an ultrasound device.  She's close,
very close.  Chuck looks up at her.  She looks really good.
She smiles at him, then touches the gap where he knocked out
his tooth.

                     TECHNICIAN
          You sure you don't want to have the
          implant done here?  We do quite good
          work.

Chuck shakes his head:  no.  She scrapes behind his front
teeth.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Hmmm, you do have such a lot of tarter
          behind these front incisors.  A little
          wider, please.

Chuck opens his mouth even further.  The technician talks on
in the self-absorbed way dental technicians sometimes do,
that constant babble of human contact which Chuck has not
heard for four years.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Anyway, so the second prosthetic foot
          worked better, but he still couldn't
          drive his new Cortina, it being a
          standard shift, if you follow me.

Chuck nods.  I follow you.

                     TECHNICIAN
          But would he hear of me driving him
          around?  Not on your bloody life.  Rinse
          please.

Chuck does.  Stan bursts into the room.

                     STAN
          Chuck!  God damn!

Chuck struggles out of the chair.

                     STAN
          God damn.  God damn.  God damn.

They are both almost overcome.  Stan holds Chuck by the
shoulders and looks at him.

                     STAN
          You're alive, you're fucking alive!

Chuck laughs, thrilled to see Stan.

                     CHUCK
          I beat the odds!

                     STAN
          You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!

                     TECHNICIAN
          I still need to floss you.

Stan notices the technician.

                     STAN
          Hello.

                     CHUCK
          This is Amber.  Her boyfriend lost his
          foot in a shark attack.

He says this with an absolute straight face, holding back the
laughter with great effort.  Instantly there's this
connection again between him and Stan.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Ex-boyfriend.

                     STAN
          Really.

And he and Chuck make eye contact and we see a glimpse of
their shared unspoken irony.

                     STAN
          Uh, there's somebody out here who wants
          to see you.

Chuck stares sharply at him.  Kelly?  Stan nods, but there's
something he wants to say.

                     STAN
          She thought you were dead.  We all did.

That's not all Stan wants to say.  But Chuck is limping out
the door.

INT.  DENTIST - WAITING ROOM

Typical dentist waiting room.  Chairs, tropical fish tanks,
magazines, a few waiting patients...and Kelly, looking
nervous.

Slowly and painfully Chuck enters.  He's quite a sight.  She
stands up.  There's a long moment where they look at each
other.

Then she comes into his arms.  Holds him tight.  She's part
laughing, part crying.

                     KELLY
          I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

                     CHUCK
          Hey...hey...it's okay!

Chuck is happy, he's still riding the high.

                     KELLY
          You're so thin.  Am I hurting you?

Well, maybe a little, but who cares?  He hasn't been hugged
or barely touched in so long.

                     CHUCK
          No...no...feels good...

She disengages, looks at him with that old smile.

                     KELLY
          Right back, you said you'd be right back.

                     CHUCK
          A few things came up.  Or went down.

He meets her gaze, looks her over with a smile.

                     CHUCK
          You look...wonderful.  I like your hair.

He notices the ring on her hand.

                     KELLY
          I got married.

                     CHUCK
          I thought you might have.

                     KELLY
          I would never --

                     CHUCK
          I know.

                     KELLY
          If I'd known you were alive --

                     CHUCK
          I would have done the same thing.

His responses come so quick.  Chuck seems blissfully sure of
himself.

                     KELLY
          I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One
          day Gary was there.  He took care of
          everything.  He took care of me.  I was a
          mess.

                     CHUCK
          You have any children?

Kelly nods.

                     CHUCK
          Got a picture?

Kelly fishes for a photo, shows it to Chuck.  It's a little
girl with a dog.

                     KELLY
          Her name's Hannah.

                     CHUCK
          Is that Jango?

                     KELLY
          No, this is Jack.  Jango was hit by a UPS
          truck.  Can you believe it?

Chuck laughs.  It is funny, sort of.

                     CHUCK
          Life's just one big joke after another.

Stan appears, takes in the scene.  The few patients waiting
are edged into the corners, trying to look occupied with
something else.

                     STAN
          How about we go somewhere else?

                     CHUCK
          Want to see my raft?

EXT.  HAWAII - DAY

Chuck's raft sits up on a dock.  Kelly stands staring at it.
How small and fragile it looks.

                     STAN
          This stinks really bad.

                     CHUCK
          You should have smelled me.

Stan examines the ropes around the logs.

                     STAN
          Cool ropes.

                     CHUCK
          I braided them.

                     STAN
          Must have taken a hell of a long time.

                     CHUCK
          Time I had lots of.

Kelly points at something on the raft.

                     KELLY
          What's that?

                     CHUCK
          That's my sea anchor.  My second one.
          Made it out of part of the sail.  It
          keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In
          theory.
               (picks up his still)
          And this, this I used to collect water.
          About half a cup a day.

He's not feeling sorry for himself.  It's just a fact.

                     STAN
          You were how long on this?

                     CHUCK
          Forty-three days.

They look at the tiny raft.  It speaks for itself.

                     KELLY
          All that time I waited to go on a cruise,
          and you went without me.

                     CHUCK
          Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.

Kelly notices the sail, sees the writing on it.

                     KELLY
          What's that, written on the sail?

                     CHUCK
          My epitaph.

Kelly reads it to herself.  Her eyes are moist.

                     CHUCK
          Bad body chemistry.  Made me a little
          morbid.  But I'm all over that now.

And he seems really to believe it.

                     STAN
          I'll be at the car.
               (to Kelly)
          Take you to the airport.

And he leaves.

                     KELLY
          I buried you, Chuck.  They had to pry my
          fingers off your coffin.

This interests Chuck to no end.

                     CHUCK
          There was a coffin?

                     KELLY
          Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.

                     CHUCK
          What was inside?

                     KELLY
          Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo
          pig sooey hat, some pictures of that
          ketch you wanted.

                     CHUCK
          That about sums it up.

                     KELLY
          Maybe now's when you tell me about it.

                     CHUCK
          The plane went down.  My friends died.  I
          washed up on an island.  Then I found
          these barrels, built the raft, and here I
          am.

                     KELLY
          Yeah?

                     CHUCK
          The tide came in, the tide went out.  I
          survived.  That's the headline.  I
          survived.

                     KELLY
          Don't overwhelm me with the details.
               (she smiles remembering)
          You know how I hate that.

He tries to put it into words, isn't quite sure how.

                     KELLY
               (gently)
          Come on.  Try.

                     CHUCK
          Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for
          granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff.
          Live each day like it's your last.

                     KELLY
          So simple to say, so hard to do.

                     CHUCK
          Not when you have no choice.

Kelly looks down at the raft.  It's so small.

                     KELLY
          You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand
          it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged
          into something.

                     CHUCK
          I didn't know what really being alone
          was.  No one back here does.

He has something more to say.  She waits.

                     CHUCK
          We're not meant to be alone.  Not like
          that.  Share life, that's what came to me
          out there.  Be with someone.

And that's the point, isn't it?  We are social animals.  No
man is an island.

                     KELLY
          This is so unfair.

                     CHUCK
          That's what I told the fish I caught.
          But I ate them anyway.

And the laughter comes again.  Kelly grins, embarrassed, a
little worried.

                     KELLY
          You okay?

                     CHUCK
          Great.  Really.

She stares at his face, reaches out, touches it again, this
time with great tenderness.

He nods, her touch feels so good.

A wave of emotion comes over her:  pity?  love?

                     KELLY
          What will you do?

                     CHUCK
          I don't know.  I really don't know.

We hear a distant beep-beep, discrete as a car horn can be.

                     KELLY
          I've got to get back to Memphis.
          Hannah's babysitter has finals.

                     CHUCK
          It means a lot...that you came.

                     KELLY
          I had to come.  To be sure you were okay.

They hold each other.  For a long time.

                     KELLY
          I love you, Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          You too.

                     KELLY
          I'm so glad you're alive.

Chuck grins.

                     CHUCK
          You too.

Then she heads for the waiting car.  Chuck stands by his
raft, watching her go.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

Chuck and Stan ride on the plane.  Chuck is coming down off
his survival high.  He has the Angel Wing FedEx package with
him.

                     STAN
          When I first showed up, I thought you'd
          lost your fucking marbles.

                     CHUCK
          I never thought it would end.  Then it
          did.  It was so great to be saved, I
          couldn't stop laughing.

Stan pulls a flask out of his bag.

                     STAN
          You need a drink.

Stan takes two glasses from his bag, rests them on a FedEx
container, and pours the whiskey.

                     CHUCK
          For years my only drinking buddy was a
          soccer ball.  Wilson.

Stan hoists his glass.

                     STAN
          To Wilson.

                     CHUCK
          To Wilson.

Now's when Stan gets to the question he's been wanting to
ask, that Kelly wanted to know, that we all want to know.

                     STAN
          So, what's it all about?

Chuck stares at him.

                     STAN
          You've been over the line and you came
          back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!

                     CHUCK
          Hallelujah.

Stan looks over at him.

                     STAN
          I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big
          picture, the words in neon...

                     CHUCK
          What's it all about?  It's about being so
          thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to
          suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what
          it's about.

Stan sits back, repulsed but relieved.

                     STAN
          Do what it takes.  That's what I always
          told you.

He pours another drink.

                     STAN
          To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a
          joke.

                     CHUCK
          To life.

                     STAN
          That's all there is.

                     CHUCK
          Believe me I know.

He takes a sip of his drink, just savoring it, thinking.

                     CHUCK
          But it's not being bold or being in the
          game or rolling the dice.

All those things Stan used to tell him.

                     CHUCK
          When I was going crazy, on the raft, I'd
          argue with myself about everything.
          Because everything had a price.  To get
          anything -- a sip of water, a little
          corner of shade, an hour's sleep -- I had
          to let go of something else.  And then I
          could never get it back.

He thinks some more.

                     CHUCK
          You don't win or lose.  You win and lose.

He looks out the window.

                     CHUCK
          You win and lose.

And Chuck has.  Big time.

EXT.  MEMPHIS AIRPORT - NIGHT

A FedEx MD-11 lands.

EXT.  MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - MOMENTS LATER

The MD-11 taxis up.  As usual, the SuperHub is a frenzy of
activity.  A loading crew stands ready, forklifts poised.
Even this plane carries packages.

PHIL STEELE, the chairman of FedEx, Leslie, Becca, Dick, and
other executives wait on a special podium near the gangway.
Everyone looks different -- older, a mustache here, a
thickening around the belly there.

Behind a barrier a cluster of cameras film the scene.

The plane cuts its engine.  The stairs are rolled out.
Forklifts and gangways move forward.  Cargo doors open.
Chuck appears in the door.  He holds the FedEx Package and a
small travel bag.

Chuck blinks against the lights and the glare.  Stan is right
by him.  Everyone bursts into APPLAUSE AND CHEERING.

After four years of total solitude this is completely
overwhelming.

                     STAN
          Smile.

Chuck smiles.

                     STAN
          Wave.

And Chuck waves.  He's overwhelmed by all the input.  Stan
steers Chuck down the steps as the cheers continue.

At the bottom of the steps Roger steps forward.  The two
brothers embrace each other.  After a moment Roger
disengages.  Mary gives Chuck a hug.

                     MARY
          Oh Chuck --

                     CHUCK
          Where's Mom?

                     ROGER
          Waiting for you.  At the farm.  This was
          too much --

He looks around at the crowds.

                     CHUCK
          Tell me about it.

Stan nudges Chuck.  Time to go to the podium.

                     ROGER
          Glad you made it, big brother.

Stan and Chuck head for the podium.  All the loaders and
operators and package scanners begin to applaud.  Chuck
smiles, then laughs, getting into the emotion.  He keeps up
an almost indecipherable babble underneath the cheering.
Occasionally he sees someone he knows.

                     CHUCK
          Wow.  Thank you.  Great.  Thank you.
          Hey, Rasheed, how you doing?  Thank you
          all.

EXT.  SUPERHUB - WIDE

Chuck makes his triumphant way through this amazing
collection of cheering people like Moses parting the Red Sea.

EXT.  SUPERHUB - PLATFORM

With a big smile Phil Steele holds out his hand to Chuck.

                     STEELE
          Welcome home.

He steps to the microphone and addresses the SuperHub.

                     STEELE
          This is an extraordinary moment.  And it
          should be marked in an extraordinary way.
          With something we have never done since
          this company was founded.
               (pause)
          Stop the line!

EXT.  SUPERHUB - SERIES OF SHOTS

All over the SuperHub, belts come to a halt.  Forklifts stop.
Tracking stations shut down.  The vast flow of packages is
suddenly still.  The incredible din of activity is suddenly
quiet.  The stillness and the silence are unexpected and
palpable.  Thousands of workers stop as well, staring either
up at Chuck directly or at his image on video screens.  We
hear Phil's voice piped in.

EXT.  SUPERHUB - PLATFORM

Phil holds a plaque.

                     STEELE
          Four years ago we placed this plaque in
          honor of Charles Noland, and two just
          like it in honor of Al Morris and John
          Durham, the two brave pilots who went
          down with him.

As he talks, we stay on Chuck, who is taking in this amazing
scene, not really listening.

                     STEELE
          Chuck endured years of hardship and
          loneliness.  Like Lazarus, Chuck has come
          back from the dead.  Chuck, this is your
          family, all of us.  So it gives me great
          pleasure...to take this plaque...and to
          present it to our long lost son.  Welcome
          home.

He hands the plaque to Chuck.  Chuck acknowledges the cheers
of the crowd.

                     CHUCK
          Thank you.  Thank you very much...

Everyone applauds.

                     CHUCK
          Give me a minute.  I've spent four years
          looking out at an empty ocean.

He laughs, a short brittle laugh, composes himself.

                     CHUCK
          It's all so -- big.  You never think
          you'll miss -- all this.  But I did.  I
          really, really did.  And I missed all of
          you.

He looks over at the hub.

                     CHUCK
          You've added some new belts, and what's
          that?

He points at some high tech equipment on the edge of the
shed.

                     STAN
          Digital laser readers.

                     CHUCK
          Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.

He looks around at everyone, doesn't know what else to say.

                     CHUCK
          I've never heard it this quiet.
          Shouldn't you all be getting back to
          work?

The tension is broken.  Everyone laughs.  Phil Steele motions
with his hand.  Let it be done.

ANOTHER ANGLE - WIDE

The vast, incredible machinery creaks to a start.  Everyone
shakes Chuck's hand as he leaves the podium.

As he heads for the car, REPORTERS shout questions.

INT.  CAR - MEMPHIS FREEWAY

We are assaulted by a surge of light, motion, activity.
Snaking lines of traffic in both directions, big overpasses,
the city rising beyond.

Stan drives with a certain aggressiveness.  Chuck looks out
at the traffic, at all the activity, at the vast intricate
anthill of humanity going everywhere and nowhere.

                     CHUCK
          Take your time.

                     STAN
          What?

                     CHUCK
          That's what it's about.

                     STAN
          Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get
          it.

He swerves into another lane.

                     CHUCK
          Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it.
          Live it.

                     STAN
          Deep, real deep.

He grins, cuts across to the exit.

                     STAN
          So where to?  The office?  The hotel?
          The beach?

Chuck stares at him.  Are you kidding?

                     STAN
          What, then?

                     CHUCK
          Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.

                     STAN
               (re: the package)
          You want that delivered, we'll deliver
          it.  That's what we do.

                     CHUCK
          I need to do it.

                     STAN
          Finish what you started.  You haven't
          changed, Chuck.  It's still you.

Right.

                     CHUCK
          You want to help, help me find the woman
          who sent this.

INT.  OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY

Stan and Chuck are in the office of a TECHNICIAN who is
working away at his computer.  The Technician pulls the bar
code from the Angel Wing FedEx box up on his computer screen.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts
          to tape storage, which is okay because we
          access it through the CPC.  Here it is.
               (gestures at computer map)
          Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku.
          Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a
          real road warrior.  This package was
          Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account
          after this package.  No forwarding
          addresses after K.L.

                     CHUCK
          What about the sender?

                     TECHNICIAN
          Sure.  Bettina Peterson.  Marfa, Texas.
          Let's run a current check.

He works some keys, waits.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville,
          North Carolina, then...canceled her
          account.

                     CHUCK
          Can you find her?

                     TECHNICIAN
          You're looking at a Level III search.
          For your Level III, you gotta have E-4
          authorization.  I don't have it.

                     STAN
          I do.

He holds out a badge.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Okay, let's let it rip.

He starts to pull up the data.

                     CHUCK
          Thanks.  For everything.

                     STAN
          No sweat.

EXT.  CHUCK'S MOTEL - THAT NIGHT

Chuck leaves the motel, the Angel Box under his arm.  He ties
it into a pannier on the side of a bicycle.

EXT.  MEMPHIS - CHICKASAW GARDENS - NIGHT

Chuck sneaks up to a craftsman cottage and stands by a tree
with a swing on it.  Inside we see Kelly making dinner for
her husband, who plays with their daughter.  For a moment
Chuck watches through the window, and we watch with him.
Then the dog begins to bark.

EXT.  CEMETERY - NIGHT

Chuck walks through the cemetery late at night.  He comes to
his gravestone, stares for a long moment at the inscription,
then takes out a spray can of paint and puts a HANDPRINT on
it.

He gets back on his bicycle and rides away.

EXT.  HIGHWAY - DAY

Chuck rides his bicycle down a road leading into the South.

EXT.  FREEWAY - DAY

Chuck negotiates an overpass crossing an Interstate Highway.
Headed in both directions, cars whoosh by beneath him.

EXT.  HIGHWAY - DUSK - LATER

Chuck rides down a narrow road, shrouded in mist.  Moss drips
from the trees reaching over the road.  A car goes by.  Then
another, their lights like halos in the fog.  It's a mystical
scene, a passage.

EXT.  ARKANSAS - NIGHT

Chuck gets off his bicycle in the rain and walks toward a
roadside cafe.

INT.  CAFE - NIGHT

Chuck draws on a paper place mat as he waits for his meal at
a counter.  Above the counter the television plays.

                     ANNOUNCER
          And here's more from Dingo Dodd, our
          Australian correspondent, on the
          extraordinary story of Chuck Noland, the
          modern Robinson Crusoe.

The waitress sets a plate down in front of Chuck, turns to
watch.

On the TV we see an Australian correspondent standing on
Chuck's beach.

                     DINGO DODD
          Shark infested waters!  A deserted
          island!  Surrounded by reefs!  Accessible
          only by helicopter!  For four years Chuck
          Noland survived here alone, eating fish,
          coconuts and clams, his only companion a
          soccer ball.

Chuck is staring at the screen, seeing his cave, seeing all
those years.

                     DINGO DODD
          I'm now in Chuck's cave where he passed
          the lonely nights, painting on the walls
          like some prehistoric caveman.  What did
          Chuck feel?  These paintings tell the
          story, but only Chuck knows what they
          mean.  And he's not talking.

On the screen we see a photograph of Chuck.

The waitress looks over at Chuck.  The other clients look at
him too.

                     CHUCK
          Check, please.

The waitress comes over.

                     WAITRESS
          No charge, honey.  But could you just
          sign that place mat for me?

Chuck looks down at his doodling.  Hesitates.  Then signs his
name.

INT.  TYSON'S CHICKEN - ARKANSAS - DAY

Thousands of chicken carcasses hanging on hooks circle
through the huge processing plant, a vast structure on the
scale of the SuperHub or the Hospital.

Chuck's Mom, dressed in white with a hairnet, enters a
windowed office in the b.g.  Through the window we see her
hug Chuck.

INT.  TYSON'S CHICKEN - OFFICE - ARKANSAS - DAY

We are in the office now.  Chuck's Mom's eyes are moist.

                     CHUCK
          When'd you start working here?

                     MOM
          Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing
          anything, and -- but you're back, you're
          really back.  I would have come to
          Memphis, but --

                     CHUCK
          I wanted to come here.

INT.  FRAME HOUSE - ARKANSAS - DAY

Chuck eats a Southern fried drumstick.  The table is full of
home-cooked food.

                     MOM
          Have some more potato salad.

Chuck gestures, no, I'm full.  She puts down the spoon.

                     CHUCK
          That was great, Mom, just great.

He looks around the house, everything in its place.  His
mother has been here for forty years.  There's a big crack
running down from the ceiling.

                     CHUCK
          I've got all this back pay coming.  Why
          don't you let me get you a place in town?

                     MOM
          This is my home.  I'm part of the
          wallpaper.

She studies him for a moment.

                     MOM
          You miss it, don't you?  You miss that
          island.

He does, but that's not it entirely.

                     CHUCK
          Miss that island?  Mom, come on.

She looks at him.  She knows her boy.

                     MOM
          What a journey you've had.  It seems more
          than a person should have to bear.

                     CHUCK
          The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it.
          I'm just wondering where it will take me
          next.

She looks at him, thinks about this.

                     MOM
          Remember the family motto.  In time.  It
          will come to you, in time.

EXT.  ARKANSAS - DAY

Chuck rides away from the small neat frame house, down a
country lane with trailers up on blocks.

EXT.  GULF COAST - DAY

Chuck leaves a cheap motel as the sun comes up.

EXT.  MISSISSIPPI GULF COAST - DAY - LATER

Chuck rides on a ferry, the wind blowing his face.  The sky
is gray and drizzly.  He smells the salt water.  Watches the
waves.

EXT.  GAS STATION - DAY

Chuck asks for directions.  A kid in baggy pants and no shirt
points him down the road.

EXT.  GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck pulls some clothes out of his saddle bags.

EXT.  GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck emerges from the restroom wearing a FedEx shirt and
shorts.

EXT.  BEACH HOUSE - HOUR LATER

A classic beach house.  Sand dunes, stilts.  Carrying the
Angel Wing Box under his arm, Chuck checks the address in his
hand.  Mounts the steps.  A light mist falls.  You can see
the Gulf behind the house, gray and moody.

A WOMAN, BETTINA, answers the door -- THE woman from the
beginning.  She wears cut-off jeans and a blue work shirt
covered with paint.  There's a tattoo on her ankle.

                     CHUCK
          FedEx for Bettina Peterson.

The woman stares in disbelief at the package she hasn't seen
in years and never expected to see again.

                     BETTINA
          Where did you get that?

Chuck displays a FedEx badge.

                     CHUCK
          Charles Noland.  FedEx Special Projects.

Bettina notices Chuck's bicycle.

                     BETTINA
          You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so
          late.

                     CHUCK
          There was an unavoidable delay.

Bettina stares at the package, her own memories coming back.

                     BETTINA
          Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You
          never gave up.

                     CHUCK
          No.

She holds the box and studies him for a long moment.
Something -- the look on his face, the extraordinary
reappearance of this long-lost package -- makes her curious.

                     BETTINA
          You know what happened to this?

                     CHUCK
          As much as anybody.

                     BETTINA
          Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.

                     CHUCK
          Okay.  Sure.

She lets Chuck in the door.

INT.  HOUSE - DAY

Ladders.  Scaffolds.  Huge paintings are everywhere.
Paintings of wings and angels -- like the package.  Chuck
stares at them.  Bettina watches Chuck stare.

                     BETTINA
          I've got some coffee on.  Would you like
          some?

INT.  KITCHEN - LATER

Bettina pours some coffee.  The package sits in the counter.
Some magazines are spread around, including a People Magazine
with Chuck's photograph on the cover.

                     CHUCK
               (takes a sip)
          It's good.

They smile awkwardly at each other.  She starts to open it.

                     BETTINA
          Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten
          wet.

                     CHUCK
          Possible.  So you did those wings?

                     BETTINA
          Yeah.  A long time ago.

                     CHUCK
          They're harder to do than they look.

                     BETTINA
          Oh?  You've tried?

                     CHUCK
          Well, I do a little drawing --

She's opened the package.  She pulls out the bottles of salsa
and the letter.

                     CHUCK
          Our apologies that it never made it to
          the recipient.

                     BETTINA
          He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry
          I ever married him.

There is a moment where neither knows what to say.

                     BETTINA
          You look familiar.

Her eyes start to register recognition.  She glances at the
magazine with Chuck's picture on it.  She picks it up.

                     BETTINA
          I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They
          are... You're a gifted artist.  You're
          into something very powerful.  Primal.
          Truly.

                     CHUCK
          Well, not really, I --

                     BETTINA
          You are.  Yes you are.
               (so many things she wants to
                say)
          What gave you the idea to paint on that
          cave?

Chuck thinks about that.  After a moment, he grins.

                     CHUCK
          To tell you the truth -- you did.

                     BETTINA
          Do you...have any more packages to
          deliver?

                     CHUCK
          No.  that was the last one.

                     BETTINA
          Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.

Chuck sits back on the couch, taking in the sight of the
ocean in the light rain.  He looks over at all the canvases,
the easel, the palettes.  The wind rustles the palm trees
around the house.  The surf crashes and rustles.  Familiar
sounds.  Island sounds.

He relaxes a little.  Maybe the package with the wings was a
sign, he kept it all these years precisely for this.  Then
there's a sound of a truck in the driveway.

The engine cuts off.  There are steps on the porch.  The door
opens.  A tanned muscular MAN in neatly kept work clothes
comes in, hangs a tool belt on a hook by the door.

He looks at Chuck with a relaxed, even stare, as if seeing a
man in a FedEx uniform sitting on his couch is not an unusual
occurrence.

                     MAN
          Hey.

                     CHUCK
          Hey.

                     BETTINA (O.S.)
          In here!

The Man nods at Chuck, goes into the kitchen.  We are on
Chuck's face.  Who's this?  We hear muffled laughter from
inside.

EXT.  BEACH HOUSE - HOUR LATER

Arms around each other, the Man and the Woman say goodbye to
Chuck.  In the front yard is a panel truck painted with two
angel wings.  The Man grins at Chuck, an easy, friendly grin.

                     MAN
          Come back anytime.  Coffee's always on.
          Don't even have to bring us a package.

                     CHUCK
          That was my last one.

Bettina hands Chuck a sheet of paper.

                     BETTINA
          The list of paints and brushes I did for
          you.

He takes it, not exactly sure he wants it.

                     BETTINA
          Keep painting.  Promise me.

                     CHUCK
          Sure.

EXT.  BEACH HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck rides his bicycle away, along the shore.

EXT.  BEACH - MINUTES LATER

Chuck rides along the beach.  Up ahead we see a FedEx truck.

EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck gets off his bike as a female FEDEX DRIVER puts chocks
under the wheels, which have stuck in the sand.

                     CHUCK
          Need some help?

                     DRIVER
          You bet I do.  High tide comes right up
          to this road.

EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck pushes on the truck as the driver gives it gas.  The
truck slowly pulls back onto the pavement.

EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

The Driver gets out of the truck with a grin.  She has an
open, friendly face.  There's an instant connection between
them.

                     DRIVER
          Hey, thanks.  I'd never have got that out
          by myself.

Looks at his uniform.  At the bike.

                     DRIVER
          You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?

                     CHUCK
          No.

Where is he from, anyway?

                     CHUCK
          I used to drive one of those.  A long
          time ago.

                     DRIVER
          Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You
          want a lift?  I've just got one more
          pickup.

                     CHUCK
          Sure.

He picks up his bike.

INT.  FEDEX TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

The FedEx truck makes its way down the beach, Chuck in his
uniform, the Driver in hers.  Two FedEx people in a truck.
The Driver looks over at Chuck.

                     DRIVER
          You're Chuck Noland.

                     CHUCK
          Yeah.

                     DRIVER/ERICA
          I knew it!  You're a legend!  Mr.
          Robinson Crusoe.

                     CHUCK
          Well --

                     ERICA
          I knew I recognized you.  My name's
          Erica.

They smile at each other.  Then she smiles a little more.

                     ERICA
          Did you really steal a crippled kid's
          bicycle to make your deliveries, or is
          that just some bullshit story?

                     CHUCK
          I didn't steal it, and he wasn't
          crippled.

Erica laughs.

                     ERICA
          Otherwise it's completely true.

And that makes Chuck laugh, really laugh, for the first time.

                     CHUCK
          Yeah, completely.

She looks over at him with a grin.

                     ERICA
          What brings you out to the sticks?

                     CHUCK
          Had a package to deliver.

                     ERICA
          You?  Personally?

                     CHUCK
          I had it on the island with me.

                     ERICA
          Must be a story there.

There's a connection building here, effortlessly.

EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

We are wide on the beach, watching the truck move along the
water, kicking up wisps of sand.

                     CHUCK (V.O.)
          Yeah, a long one.

                     ERICA (V.O.)
          I've got lots of time.

                     CHUCK (V.O.)
          So do I.

The truck goes down the beach and then turns inland, away
from the ocean.  Away from all that.

                     CHUCK (V.O.)
          So do I.

And we pull back, taking in the sweep of the beach, the
estuaries, and the green forest stretching back into America.

The end is the beginning.

FADE OUT.
CATCH ME IF YOU CAN

           BLACK AND WHITE FOOTAGE FROM 1978 

                         MUSIC UP:
          A simple GAME SHOW SET -- one long desk-that houses four
          "CELEBRITY PANELISTS," a small pulpit with attached microphone
          for the host, BUD COLLYER, who walks through the curtain to
          the delight of the audience. Bud bows and waves to the
          celebrities -- ORSON BEAN, KITTY CARLISLE, TOM POSTON, and
          PEGGY CASS.

                         BUD COLLYER
          Hello, panel, and welcome everyone
          to another exciting day on "To Tell
          The Truth." Let's get the show
          started.

          THE CURTAIN STARTS TO RISE
          BRIGHT LIGHTS SHINE on the faces of THREE MEN who walk toward
          center stage. All thre n wear identical AIRLINE PILOT
          UNIFORMS, each with m; c ng blue blazers and caps.
          (cont' d)
          Gentleman, please state
          your names.

                         PILOT #1
          My name is Frank Abagnale Jr.
          THE PILOT IN THE MIDDLE steps forward.

                         PILOT #2
          My name is Frank Abagnale Jr.
          THE THIRD PILOT does the same.

                         PILOT #3
          My name is Frank Abagnale Jr.
          Bud smiles, grabs a piece of paper.

                         BUD COLLYER
          Panel, listen to this one.
          (he starts to read)
          My name is Frank Abagnale Jr, and
          some people consider me the worlds
          greatest imposter.

                         (READING)
          From 1964 to 1966 I successfully
          impersonated an airline pilot for
          Pan Am Airlines, and flew over two
          million miles for free. During that
          time I was also the Chief Resident
          Pediatrician at a Georgia hospital,
          the Assistant Attorney General for
          the state of Louisiana, and a
          Professor of American History at a
          prestigious University in France. By
          the time I was caught and sentenced
          to prison, I had cashed over six
          million dollars in fraudulent checks
          in 26 foreign countries and all fifty
           states, and I did it all before my
           18th birthday. To this day, I am the
           only teenager ever to have been placed
          on the FBI' s most wanted list.
          My name is a Abagna l e Jr.
          Warm applause as the THREE MEN walk behind
          a desk that faces the pa They all sit down at exactly
          the same time.

          BUD COLLY (cont'd )
          Okay, panel, you have ork cut
          out for you. Kitty Carl , you
          have the first question.

                         KITTY CARLISLE
          Imposter number one, how many years
          were you in prison?

                         PILOT #1
          I served two years in France, and
          five years in Atlanta, Georgia.

                         KITTY CARLISLE
          Imposter number two, I find all this
          very fascinating. Who was it that
          finally caught you?

          SLOWLY PUSH IN ON THE PILOT IN THE MIDDLE --
          A thin smile across his lips as he faces the panel -- his
          manicured hands out in front of him on the desk -- his back

          2 EXT. - PAPIGONE MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON. - MARSEILLE - NIGHT 2 


           SUPER: MARSEILLE, FRANCE DECEMBER 25, 1967
           A heavy rain falls on JOE SHAPE, 40's, who wears a black hat
          and holds a black umbrella as he bangs on the window of a
          small GUARDHOUSE in front of a LARGE GATED PRISON. Joe is
          sneezing as he holds up an IDENTIFICATION CARD TO THE GUARD.

                         JOE SHAPE
          Joe Shaye, FBI.

          3 INT. - PAPIGONE PRISON WARDEN'S OFFICE. - DAY 3 

          Joe is walking down a long corridor inside the prison,
          struggling to close his umbrella as he faces WARDEN GARREN
          and TWO GUARDS.

                         JOE SHAPE
          I have orders see a prisoner named
          Abagnale, t e his statement and
          solicit a c n ^ n so I can prepare
          for tomorrow' tladition.
          Joe takes a roll of CASH out of h` ocket, casually slips
          the money to the Warden.

                         JOE SHAPE
          If I give you another twenty, will
          you turn up the heat in here?

          4 INT. - PAPIGONE PRISON - FRANK'S CELL/CORRIDOR. - DAY 4 

          Warden Garren is leading Joe down a small, isolated corridor
          just off the main floor. They pass CEMENT DOORS with metal
          SLIDE HOLES and numbers taped to the front. There are no
          bars or windows in this area, and complete silence. Garren
          stops at the last cell and opens the SLIDE HOLE.

                         WARDEN GARREN
          Don't pass him anything through the

                         HOLE-
          Garren walks off, and Joe immediately starts to smile, looking
          around for a long BEAT as he stares at the cell door.

          house at home?
          Joe tries to control his excitement as he kneels down and
          looks through the metal slide hole.

          THROUGH THE HOLE

          5 INT. - PAPIGONE PRISON - FRANK'S CELL. - NIGHT 5 

          WE SEE FRANK ABAGNALE JR., his face partially hidden in the
          dim cell, which gets its only light from a hanging bulb.
          Frank is lying on the cement floor, his back up against the
          far wall. He wears only a pair of underwear and clutches a
          torn blanket.

                         JOE SHAYE
          Jesus, Frank, you look terrible. I
          heard about French prisons, but this
          is positively barbaric.
          WE HEAR a sound come fr)dthe cell, and then heavy coughing.
          JO,E YE (cont ' d)
          That doesn' t o d(rr4ood. I have a
          little cold my
          Help me.

                         JOE SHAYE
          Help you? Yes, I'll help you, Frank.

                         N
          Why do you think I've been fighting
          to have you extradited. Why do you
          think I came to take you home? Do
          you know that 21 other countries
          want'you in their prisons? I saw the
          list -- Egypt was on there. Who the
          hell goes to Egypt to write bad
          checks?

                         FRANK
          I'm sick... please...

                         JOE SHAYE
          Don't worry, Frank, you just have to
          make it through one more night. And
          then tomorrow I'll help you onto a
          plane, clean you up, and put you in
          a cell for the next twenty-five years.

          His face covered by a beard and matted black hair. Frank
          closes his eyes and starts to cough.

          Help me, please. I can't breathe...

          OUTSIDE THE CELL
          Joe listens to Frank, who is coughing so hard he starts to
          choke.

          THE CELL DOOR IS THROWN OPEN
          Frank is being dragged across the floor by Warden Garren and
          a second GUARD, each holding an arm as they drag Frank's
          emaciated six-foot frame through the halls. Joe Shaye jogs
          behind the guards.

                         JOE SHAYE
          He's not breathing. I think he

          A small, empty room with four empty hospital beds. Frank is
          lifted onto one of the beds, his legs and arms flailing out
          to the sides, kicking a thin curtain out from the wall.

                         JOE SHAYE
          What's happening to him?
          Garren and the Guard quickly move toward a sink, where they
          start to wash their hands.
          JOE SHAYE (cont'd)
          What are you doing?

          ASSISTANT WARDEN GARREN
          Washing off the lice.

                         JOE SHAYE-
          He can't breath. You have to call a
          doctor.

          STANT WARDEN GARREN
          The doctor p fnl'sf in the morning.
          You can't just t him die. I have
          orders from the Embassy!
          This man is going t tradited
          to the United State am holding
          you responsible if ant happens!
          Suddenly Garren looks past Shaye -- eyeing the curtain that
          partially encloses Frank's bed. Garren slowly moves toward
          the curtain, pushes it open.

          FRANK IS GONE

          CLOSE ON GARREN
          drawing his gun and sprinting out the open door of the
          infirmary, yelling in French for the Guard to follow. Joe
          Shaye stands motionless, staring down in horror at the empty
          bed.

          legs toward the main door.
          As Frank makes his way past a row of cheering prisoners, he
          trips and falls, his body too weak to run as he starts to
          crawl across the prison floor.
          Joe and Garren easily catch up to him, Garren quickly kneeling
          down and holding his gun against Frank's head --cocking the
          weapon. Frank stops crawling, rolls over on his back and
          smiles up at Joe Shaye.

          The New Rochelle Rotary Club has a
          history that goes back to 1859. In
          all those years, we have only inducted
          a handful of deserving men as lifetime
          members, an honor that has seen 187
          names enshrined on the wall of honor.
          Tonight, we make it 188. So please

          Two little mice fell in a bucket of
          cream. The first mouse quickly gave
          up and drowned, but the second mouse
          wouldn't quit. He struggled so hard,

          Laughter from the men in the room as Frank continues.
          FRANK SR. (cont'd)
          I stand here today humbled by the
          presence of Mayor Allen, and our

          most of all, I am honored to see my

          but tonight you have made me royalty.
          And for this, I am eternally grateful.

          So they cram two hundred soldiers
          into this tiny social hall, and the
          first person to walk on stage is
          your mother. And she starts to
          dance...
          Paula steps away from Frank, and she starts to dance a ballet,
          smiling as she tries to remember the steps.

          It had been months since we had even
          seen a woman, and here's this blonde
          angel on stage -- and the men are
          literally holding their breath. And
          I turned to my buddies, and I said..

          Open your books to chapter eight,
          read quietly to yourselves.
          The classroom door swings open, and a frail, confused TEACHER
          walks in and motions to Frank.

                         TEACHER
          Are you subbing for Roberta?

          They sent for me -- they said they

          a class field trip to a French bread
          factory in Trenton. Do you see the

          Frank Sr. and Paula seem a bit confused.

                         PAULA
          This is our fault, Principal Evans.
          Frank had been at Buckley since he
          was a little boy. We had to take him
          out for personal reasons, away from
          his friends -- you know how kids
          are. He's all alone here.

          hearing to determine who you are
          going to live with after the divorce.
          Your mother and father are leaving
          this decision up to you. For the
          record, I would like to praise both
          parents for showing such confidence
          in their son, who they believe will
          make the best decision for himself
          and his family.

          Caribbean Air will be expanding our
          routes next year to include most of
          the East coast. I'm thinking we'll
          need several thousand badges.

                         POLAROID SALESMAN
          As you can see, we make the I.D.
          badges for almost every major airline.

                         POLAROI
          That's Pan Am. Would o' Qke the

          My boss wanted me to bring back an
          actual I.D. badge, not a brochure.

                         POLAROID SALESMAN
          That's no problem, Mister Anderson.
          We make all the badges right here
          with this equipment.

          Frank is walking through KENNEDY AIRPORT, his authentic PAN
          AM I.D. BADGE secured to the front of his uniform. He walks
          up to an EASTERN AIRLINES ticket counter and smiles at the

          TICKET AGENT.

                         FRANK
          Hello. I'm a Pan Am co-pilot and I'd
          like to fly on your two-thirty to
          Miami.

          EASTERN TICKET AGENT
          You want to dead-head to Miami?

                         FRANK
          Yes. Dead-head.
          Frank hands the AGENT his I.D. BADGE and Mulligan's FAA
          license, which has been cropped at the top where Mulligan's
          name used to be. She barely glances at either-

           MARCI, a cute 27-year-old EASTERN STEWARDESS with short blonde
          hair and glasses, stands at the front of the plane smiling
          at Frank -- who holds out his pink boarding slip.

                         MARCI
          Are you my dead-head?

          Frank is led into the cockpit by Marci, trying not to react
          to the intensity of the tiny space. He immediately looks
          around for the jump-seat -- or any seat -- but sees nothing.

                         MARCI
          Frank, this is Captain Oliver. That's
          John Paxton, the Co-Pilot, this is

          Go ahead and take a seat, Frank,
          we're about to push.
          Frank continues to search for the JUMP SEAT, the panic
          starting to show on his face as Marci reaches her hand around
          to the back of the cockpit door and pulls down the small

          There you go. Would you like a drink

          Frank quickly sits in the jump-seat, his hands shaking as he
          tries to strap himself in.

                         FRANK

           a silent scream as the plane lift f, banking left as it
          shoots out over Manhattan.
          Frank is staring out the cockpit window in disbelief, the
          way all kids do the first time they ride in a plane.

          73 INT. - EASTERN 707. - LATER IN FLIGHT 73

          Frank walks through the COCKPIT DOOR, sees Marci preparing
          drinks at the beverage station.

           Frank is lying on top of Marci -- losing his virginity --
          not moving -- just staring down at her with a bizarre look
          on his face. The lights are low, the radio is on.

          John Doe 2172 is a paperhanger who
          started on the East Coast. During
          the last few weeks 2172 has developed
          a new form of check fraud, which I'm
          calling "the float". Next slide.
          The slide doesn't change.

          The remote thing is broken.
          You'll have to do it by hand.
          Joe reaches in and turns the slide.
          JOE SHAYE (cont'd)
          What he's doing is opening checking
          accounts all over the country, then
          changing the micker ink routing
          numbers on the bottom of those checks.

                         CLOSE ON
          THE FACES OF THE FIVE FBI AGENTS, looking bored as they all
          listen to Joe, having no idea what he's talking about. Some
          of the agents are yawning, while other are doodling at their
          desks.
          JOE SHAYE (cont'd)
          This is a map of the 12 branches of
          the U.S. Federal Reserve. The optical
          scanners at t bank read the numbers
          on the bott a check -- then

          The East Coast branches are numbered
          seven through twelve, the midwest
          four, five, and six...

          SPECIAL AGENT WILKES
          You mean to say that those numbers
          on the bottom of a check actually
          mean something?

                         JOE SHAYE
          Yes. And if you change a number one
          to a number nine -- a check cashed
          in New York won't be sent to the
          East Coast Reserve -- but will be re-
          routed all the way to California.
          The bank won't know the check has
          bounced for two weeks, which means

           this guy can stay in one place --
          rob the same banks over and over.
          The AGENTS literally scratch their heads, trying to follow.

          SPECIAL AGENT WILKES
          And this is why you called for an
          emergency briefing? Because of a
          couple of bounced checks?
          Laughter from the other Agents as Joe tries to smile.

                         JOE SHAYE
          Sean, I was hoping to get-some back-
          up on this.

          if you had so much fun working

          I didn't transfer. I was demoted.
          (off Joe's look)
          Demoted is the wrong word. It was
          more like-punished. I screwed up
          in the field.

                         JOE SHAYE
          What about you, Mr. Fox? Did you
          fuck up in the field and get punished?

                         FOX
          No. I've never worked in the field
          before. I was in the L.A. public
          relations office, but we were shut
          down after the riots.

          Joe approaches the front desk of the motel, where the OWNER

          He's been here two weeks, written
          lots of checks. The one that bounced

          Joe. Joe stares at the check for a BEAT, slowly starts to
          smile.

          Joe stares at Wilkes, slowly stands and heads for the door.
          He's about to leave when he turns and looks back at Wilkes.

          SPECIAL AGENT WILKES

          You think you're gonna get me again,
          don't you? You'd love for me to send
          twenty agents out on Christmas Eve

          The same reason the Yankees always
          win. Nobody can keep their eyes off
          the pinstripes.

                         JOE SHAYE
          The Yankees win because they have
          Mickey Mantle.

          Maybe there's a reason he didn't

          Have you been to New Orleans before,
          Doctor?

          And please, call me Frank.

                         ROBERT
          Frank, would you like to say grace?
          Frank stares at Brend ah her parents, who bow their heads.
          He hesitates for a B T, WE SEE that he has no idea how
          to say grace.

          Two little mice fell in a bucket of
          cream. The first mouse gave up and
          drowned, but the second mouse
          struggled so hard that he churned
          that cream into butter -- and he
          walked out. Amen.
          They all lift their heads, clearly impressed. Robert turns
          to Frank and smiles.

                         CAROL
          Amen. That was beautiful.
          Frank turns to Brenda, gives her a wink.

          Right. That's very good, Sir.

                         ROBERT
          It's just a hobby. Every Sunday night
          I go into the garage, pretend I'm an
          artist. Sometimes I stay in there
          for hours, hiding from the world,
          making a fool out of myself.

                         FRANK
          No, Sir. You are an artist.

          about getting back into law.

                         ROBERT

          or a doctor?

                         FRANK
          Before I went to medical school I
          passed the bar in California. I

          to try my hand at pediatrics.

                         ROBERT

          There's no perforated edge, which
          means this check was hand cut, not
          fed. The paper is double bonded,
          much too heavy for a check. The ink
          is raised against my fingers instead
          of flat.
          Frank brings the check to his nose, sniffs it.

          This doesn't smell like micker. It's'

A1   EXT.   PEARL STREET BRIDGE- NIGHT                               A1

     CLOSE ON...   A BRONZE PLAQUE which reads, "PEARL STREET
     BRIDGE."

     ON THE BRIDGE... RAIN POURS DOWN. An SUV steers out of
     control and CRASHES into a STALLED OUT VEHICLE.

     It's quiet NOW, EXCEPT FOR THE INCESSANT pounding rain.    IN
     THE DISTANCE, police lights approach.

                                                        SMASH CUT TO:

1    EXT.   PEARL STREET BRIDGE - NIGHT                              1

     THROUGH A TELEVISION CAMERA... The image is GRAINY and
     FRENETIC. A HEAVY RAIN POURS DOWN on a MELEE OF ACTIVITY.

     POLICE CARS block either end, their LIGHTS ignite the sky in
     a dizzying RED and BLUE design. The attention centers on...

     The SUV and the CRASHED VEHICLE lay in the middle of the
     bridge. A MAN, 30's, madness on his face, his right hand
     holds a HOSTAGE, a woman, 20's, racked with fear, tight to
     his body. His left holds a GUN!

     Two DETECTIVES, slowly approach the Man.   ONLY SEE THE
     DETECTIVES FROM BEHIND.

     A News Reporter, KAREN CROSS, 30's, blond with energy to
     burn, shields herself from the rain, steps in front of the
     camera...

                          KAREN CROSS
                ... Police on scene are approaching
                the suspect. They're at the center of
                the Bridge now.

     The Man waves his gun wildly, screams at the Detectives.     The
     Hostage, tears streaming down her face, SCREAMS OUT!

                                                     FADE TO BLACK.

     SUDDENLY...   THREE GUN SHOTS, almost simultaneously, RING
     OUT!

                We have shots fired. Shots have been
                fired... Both the suspect and his
                hostage are down... Police are moving
                in... Oh my God.

2    INT.   LIVING ROOM - CONNERS APARTMENT - NIGHT                 2

     A loft apartment, scarcely furnished, except for BOOKS,
     HUNDREDS OF THEM, fill stacks of shelves. Hearing but not
     watching the television, METICULOUSLY preparing a GIN AND
     TONIC, is...

     DETECTIVE QUENTIN CONNERS, a grizzled, intense veteran. His
     charisma, which he has in spades, gets him into as much
     trouble as it gets him out of. At present a somber mood.
     The shadows from the rain stream down Conners's face.

     IN THE GLASS'S REFLECTION... The TV Report plays. (NOTE:
     most of, if not all, of the TV report will in reflection.)

                          KAREN CROSS (OS)
                After a two month investigation, Det.
                Jason York has been relieved of duty
                for his role in the Pearl Street Bridge
                shooting deaths of Lisa ReAnn and John
                Curtis. Key testimony against York
                came from Det. Bernard Callo, who was
                on scene that night. The Seattle
                Police Department is handing this case
                over to the King County District
                Attorney's office. Criminal charges
                are expected.

3    ON A TELEVISION SCREEN--                                       3

     The IMAGE cuts to an earlier interview with... CAPTAIN
     MARTIN JENKINS, 50's, chronically tired and unsympathetic.

                          JENKINS
                In a civilized society, the men and
                women entrusted with serving and
                protecting the community are to be held
                accountable just like everyone else.
                Simply put... Just because you are a
                cop, doesn't mean laws don't apply to
                you. This is no longer the wild, wild
                west.

3A   EXT.   KING COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY (THROUGH TV CAMERA)      3A

     KAREN CROSS stands on the steps, a PHOTO of Conners appears.

                This same review board last week found
                Quentin Conners, Det. York's partner,
                "not responsible" for the same
                shooting. He remains on suspension
                without pay.

3B   INT.   LIVING ROOM - CONNERS APARTMENT - NIGHT                    3B

     Conners turns off the TV, lays the remote next to a PHOTO of
     Conners and a YOUNG WOMAN (TEDDY) during happy times. He
     stares at the photo, finishes his drink.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

4    EXT.   SEATTLE - DAY - ESTABLISHING                               4

     A COOL, CRISP Pacific Northwestern day. MOUNT RAINIER looms
     in the distance. The SPACE NEEDLE overlooks downtown. While
     the sun shines now, the OVERCAST SKY on the horizon
     FORESHADOWS AN IMPENDING STORM. In the heart of the city...

5    EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                               5

     An IMPRESSIVE STRUCTURE on a BUSY CITY CORNER. TRAFFIC,
     street and pedestrian, go about their business.

     ACROSS THE STREET...   A BLACK TRUCK screeches to a stop.

6    INT.   BLACK TRUCK - DAY                                          6

     LORENZ, 40's, sits behind the steering wheel. His EYES cold,
     merciless. He's joined by FOUR OTHER MEN, ALL BLACK CLAD -
     HEAVILY ARMED with BODY ARMOR!

     Lorenz stares out at the bank, a last moment of peace.
     Simultaneously, ALL FOUR DOORS OPEN and...

7    EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                               7

     Lorenz and the Black Clad exit, quickly cross the street,
     heading for the bank! Each carries a LARGE BLACK BAG.

7A   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                             7A

     PATRONS in line, wait impatiently. A SECURITY GUARD in the
     corner yawns. TELLERS count out cash, access accounts on
     COMPUTERS.

     GRAINY SECURITY CAMERA IMAGES depict an average, business
     day. THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM.

     Lorenz and the Black Clad arrive at the doors.     They RAISE
     THEIR MASKS and...

8    INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                             8

     Off the CROOKED EYEBROW of a BANK TELLER...

     AT THE FRONT DOORS--

     The BLACK CLAD STORM THE BANK! Four of the Black Clad move
     into position. Lorenz stands center stage. Gun in hand, he
     aims at the ceiling, PULLS the trigger... BAM! A GUNSHOT
     RINGS OUT!

                          LOREN
                Drop to the floor! Slowly! No sudden
                moves!
                    (to the Tellers)
                You! Hands on heads, drop to your
                knees. Now! Do it!

     PATRONS and TELLERS HIT THE GROUND, TERRIFIED!     Lorenz is in
     COMPLETE and UTTER CONTROL.

     BLACK CLAD #4 and #3 keep watch on the tellers behind the
     counters! One on one side, one on the other.

     BLACK CLAD #2 ushers people out of side offices, gun-points
     them into the lobby!

     BLACK CLAD #1 races upstairs, gathers people from the 2nd
     level, forces them downstairs.

     From the corner of Lorenz's eye...      The SECURITY GUARD's hand
     creeps toward his gun.

                          LORENZ
                That... you don't want to do.

     The Security Guard reluctantly obeys. BLACK CLAD #1 DISARMS
     the Guard, then GUN BUTTS HIM over the head! The Guard
     drops, unconscious! CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES scream out.

     Black Clad #1 rips keys from the Guard's belt, tosses them to
     Black Clad #2!

                           LORENZ
                Y'all picked the wrong day not to use
                the ATM.
                    (Beat)
                You will not be harmed if you do

                 take your chances if you choose not to
                 listen.

      BLACK CLAD #2, keys in hand, flies across the counter,
      carrying a large duffel bag... Heading to the vaults!

                           LORENZ
                 No one will say I didn't give you a
                 choice.

9     INT.   SAFETY DEPOSIT VAULT - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK            9

      Black Clad #2 arrives, drops his bag, unzipping...

                           BLACK CLAD #2
                     (into his headset)
                 I'm in.

10    INT.   THE LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                       10

      Lorenz gets the message, finds THE BANK MANAGER cowering
      behind his desk.

                           LORENZ
                 You, up.
                     (the Bank Manager obeys)
                 You understood what I just said?

                              BANK MANAGER
                 Yes.

                           LORENZ
                 Your security system, you can
                 electronically lock all entrances...

                            BANK MANAGER
                 Yes.   Right-right away.

                           LORENZ
                 With that attitude, you and I are going
                 to get along famously. Now go.

      The Bank Manager nods nervously.

      BLACK CLAD #4 holds open his bag. He strides by the
      CUSTOMERS who deposit CELLPHONES, PAGERS, inside.

10A   INT.   BANK MANAGER'S OFFICE                                10A

      The Bank Manager taps on his computer keyboard.

                              BANK MANAGER
                 It's done.     We're locked down.

      Lorenz nods.

10B   INT.   THE LOBBY--                                           10B

      BLACK CLAD #1 flips the "BANK CLOSED" sign around.

11    INT.   MOTEL BEDROOM - DAY                                       11

      Jenkins fastens his cufflinks.   In the bed behind him...

      HEATHER "TEDDY" GALLOWAY, 30's, normally a force to reckon
      with, appears vulnerable with only a sheet wrapped around
      her.

                           JENKINS
                 Have you seen my watch?

      Teddy gestures to the night stand. Jenkins retrieves the
      watch. He also slides his WEDDING RING back on. This ain't
      love, this is a relationship of convenience.

      Jenkins slips on his jacket, secures his tie and, after one
      last check in the mirror...

                           JENKINS
                 This was fun. You should get out of
                 bed. You'll be late for work.

      And with that, Jenkins exits. Teddy waits for the door to
      close, then collapses back onto the bed.

12    INT.   SAFETY DEPOSIT VAULT - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK             12

      PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES line the walls, connect all the safety
      deposit boxes together! BLACK CLAD #2, takes cover, readies
      the detonation device and...

                           BLACK CLAD #2
                     (into his headset)
                 Fire in the hole.

      He FLIPS A SWITCH and... KA-BOOM!    AN EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH
      THE VAULT!

13    INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                            13

      A PILLOW OF SMOKE BLOWS into the lobby! Lorenz stands
      UNFLINCHING. The explosion was expected.

      BEHIND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WINDOWS--

      An EAGER TELLER, 30's, seizes the moment.    He reaches up and
      PRESSES THE SILENT ALARM BUTTON!

        SHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004         7.


      BLACK CLAD #4 turns just in time to see it, quickly FIRES his
      weapon! The Eager Teller slumps against the wall, BLEEDS
      profusely from his neck, not dead yet.

      Lorenz hustles over to Black Clad #4.

                           LORENZ
                 What do you think you're doing?

                           BLACK CLAD #4
                 Fucker pushed the alarm.

      Lorenz GLARES DISGUSTEDLY at his accomplice.

                            LORENZ
                 It would've made more sense to shoot
                 him before he pushes the fucking alarm.
                 Not after.
                     (looks at the Eager Teller)
                 Jesus.

      Lorenz levels, very calmly, his weapon at the Eager Teller's
      head and...

                           LORENZ
                 And... If you're going to do something.
                     (FIRES his weapon!)
                 Do it right.

      The Eager's Teller's body keels over, dead.    Lorenz checks
      his watch... 9:26 a.m.

                           LORENZ
                     (into microphone)
                 Alarm's tripped. We're on a clock.
                     (to Black Clad #4)
                 Get these people out of the way.

      There's not enough soap on the planet for Teddy to feel
      clean. Doubt and fear present on her face. She turns off
      the water, and steps out... when she does HER PAGER, off
      screen, chimes!

15    INT.   MOTEL BEDROOM - DAY                                      15

      Teddy, a towel wrapped around her, picks up the pager.   The
      number: 911. She picks up the TELEPHONE, dials.

      OFFICERS fly out, shotguns out!

      HELICOPTERS circle. NEWS VANS speed onto the scene as the
      CROWDS builds. Standing in the center of things...

      DETECTIVE BERNIE CALLO, 40's, a stern, by-the-book cop. Not

      POV OF LORENZ - Callo approaches the Tech Van.

      Lorenz peeks through the curtains.       A phone pressed between
      his shoulder and ear.

      He places a VOICE MODULATOR over the phone's mouthpiece (this
      will leave his voice sounding LIFELESS and DISTORTED to those
      on the receiving end).

     Callo arrives at the POLICE TECH VAN.    So state-of-the-art
     NASA is green with envy.

     BRENDAN DAX, 30's, the techno-wizard, with headphones on,

                We have them on the line.

     Dax presses a series of buttons.

                Who am I speaking with?

                          LORENZ
                No questions. It's time to set the
                rules. I am in complete control of
                this facility. No one gets in or out
                without my say and I will execute every
                last man, woman and child in here if my
                needs are not met. Do not test me.
                Today, I am a man of zero patience.

                          CALLO
                I'm listening.

                          LORENZ
                See if you can't screw this up,
                Detective... I have but one demand.
                One and only demand.

20   INT.   CONNERS APARTMENT - DAY                                   20

     Conners wears a T-shirt and some sweats, opens his
     refrigerator, grabs a bottle of water. When he closes the
     door... He notices Jenkins and a YOUNG DETECTIVE on his
     deck.

     Conners crosses, opens the door for Jenkins and DETECTIVE
     SHANE DEKKER, late-20s. Dekker's all business when it comes
     to being a cop. Green, but eager to prove himself. After a
     long beat...

                          CONNERS
                Do you have a warrant?

                    JENKINS
          I need to speak to you, Quentin.

                    CONNERS
          There's where your shit out of luck
          because I don't need to speak to you.

                    JENKINS
          It's important.

Conners and Jenkins trade serious stares. Conners finally
relents. Jenkins and Dekker enter. Dekker notices - THE
STACKS AND STACKS OF BOOKS.

                    JENKINS
          Quentin, this is Detective Shane Dekker.

                     CONNERS
          Huh? You don't look like much of a
          Detective.

                     DEKKER
          Funny. I was going to say the same
          about you.

                      CONNERS
          Charming.

                    JENKINS
          Shane just transferred in from Tacoma.      His
          father...

                    CONNERS
          Save your breath. I really don't care.

Before Jenkins can respond, from the bedroom, a TALL, BLOND
WOMAN, 20s, emerges, COMPLETELY NUDE.

The men WATCH as the Woman, PAYING THEM NO ATTENTION,
retrieves a bottle of water from the fridge, then returns to
the bedroom. No words spoken at all. After the moment has
passed...

                    CONNERS
          Why don't we can the chit-chat.    Get to
          what's on your mind.

                    JENKINS
          We've got a hostage situation, American
          National Bank. The sonsabitches said
          they wouldn't talk to anyone but you.

                      CONNERS
          No shit?

                     JENKINS
          No shit.   I need you to do this.

                    CONNERS
          Why should I?

                    DEKKER
          Because people's lives are at stake.
          That takes priority over your ego.

                    CONNERS
              (to Jenkins; re: Dekker)
          You may want to put a leash on him.
              (beat; thinks)
          Saying I did want to help... I'm still
          suspended or did that slip your mind?

                    JENKINS
          The commissioner's office has ordered
          me to reinstate you. As of now, you're
          back on the force.

                    CONNERS
          Just like that?

                     JENKINS
          Just like that.
              (beat)
          I won't, however, unleash you alone.

                    CONNERS
          Always a catch.

                    JENKINS
          Shane, here, is your new partner.
          Consider him a younger version of me,
          looking over your shoulder, watching
          every move you make.

The idea of a new partner doesn't sit well with Conners.

                    JENKINS
          Don't think I endorse this. If it were
          my call, you'd be with your partner...

                    CONNERS
          You mean ex-partner.

                    JENKINS
          ... On the unemployment line with him.

                    CONNERS
          For a moment there, I thought you
          cared.

                I care about those innocent people down
                there. I hope to God someone hasn't
                made a monumental mistake letting you
                back in.

                          CONNERS
                I appreciate the words of encouragement
                and the confidence you have in me. I
                look forward to the continuing,
                positive relationship we've shared in
                the past.

     A SWAT TRUCK pulls up, the BACK DOORS FLY OPEN!     SWAT exit in
     a flurry, race into position.

     Amidst the commotion... JENKINS' CAR navigates the scene,
     stops next to... KAREN CROSS immediately recognizes Conners,
     orders her CAMERAMAN to center on him.

     Conners, Dekker and Jenkins climb out of the car, head
     towards the crime scene, when...

                Detective Conners? Detective, can we
                have a few words?

     Conners turns, recognizes Karen.    Relishing the moment...

                          CONNERS

Conners, Dekker and Jenkins arrive, FIND Teddy, her hair
still wet, with her partner, DET. VINCENT DURANO, 40's, a
middle of the road, never out on a limb type cop.

Callo looks on, the RAGE boiling inside of him.

                    CONNERS
          Teddy, Vincent...
              (completely ignores Callo)
          ... Nice to see you both.

                    JENKINS
          Conners has been reinstated to full
          active duty. It's his scene.

This info comes as a surprise.   Especially to Callo.

                    CALLO
          The last hostage situation this guy
          headed, an innocent civilian died.

                    CONNERS
          I was not responsible...

                    CALLO
          You never are. That girl would be
          alive today if it weren't for your
          cowboy antics. You destroy lives.

                    CONNERS
          Fuck you. Look who's talking about
          destroying lives.

                    JENKINS
          Decision's been made, Bernie.

                    CALLO
          I was first on scene and I have seniority.
              (pleads)
          Don't do this, Martin.

                    JENKINS
          We'll talk about it later.   Take a hike.

                     CALLO
              (beat)
          Fine. I'll watch this train wreck from
          home.

Callo exits.

          I'm going to miss him.

                SWAT, because of the special
                circumstances will defer to Conners.
                He's in charge.

                          VINCENT
                First time I've heard SWAT defer to
                anyone.

                          JENKINS
                    (pulls aside Conners)
                Second chances don't come around often.
                Don't blow it.

     Jenkins skeptically eyes Conners before stepping away.     He
     motions for Dekker to walk with him.

                          JENKINS
                Anything questionable happens today,
                you let me know.

                          DEKKER
                Yes, Captain.

     Out of earshot, Conners watches Dekker and Jenkins.

                          TEDDY
                Looks like you got yourself a baby-
                sitter.

     Conners glares at Teddy out the corner of his eye, then
     dismisses the comment.

     Conners, Dekker, Teddy and Vincent hover behind the first

                We have approximately four to seven,
                heavily armed men holding an

29   EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                             29

     Conners and company gather outside of the Police Tech Van.
     Dekker pulls a pad and a pen, prepares to take notes.

     Dax sits, headphones donned, records the entire conversation.

                          CONNERS

     Dekker writes, "Lorenz."

                          CONNERS
                Okay, Lorenz, how are we doing in there?
                Can we get you anything? Food, medical
                supplies. We heard an explosion.

                          LORENZ
                Everyone who matters is fine. Of course,
                I would've preferred not having the
                authorities involved at all. We weren't
                planning to be here this long. But, since
                Seattle's finest needs a presence on the
                scene, I'm glad it's you.

          My fame proceeds me.

                     LORENZ
          Don't be flattered. I needed someone
          who's been through the experience
          before. Hopefully this time it will go
          better for all involved. I plan on
          living a full, long and rich life. I
          didn't, however, expect them to find
          you so quickly. I thought you were
          suspended.

Dekker writes, "In The Know," on his pad.

                    CONNERS
          I was, but I'm back.   You're
          information's old.

                    LORENZ
          You never get what you pay for.
              (back to business)
          You want to know about the hostages?
          How many and are they okay?

Dekker scribbles, "Pro".

                    CONNERS
          Yes.

                     LORENZ
          Approximately forty, they're fine,
          considering. All except one. We had a
          situation.

                    CONNERS
          Someone's dead?

                    LORENZ
          Theory... put to practice isn't always
          perfect. Can't expect to keep the
          hostages in check if a bad deed goes
          unpunished or they may... randomly
          decide to revolt. Chaos... has some
          order to it.
              (Conners drifts in thought)
          Detective? Are you still with me?

Teddy SNAPS her fingers. That gets Conners attention.
There's a new intensity to his demeanor.

          What else will I be looking for?

                for you and your colleagues to pack up
                and go home?

                          CONNERS
                Safe to say.

                          LORENZ
                Stay by the phone.    I'll contact you
                shortly.

                Lorenz...

                          LORENZ
                Don't worry, I have no plans until
                sunrise tomorrow, so hunker down. It's
                going to be a long one.

                Wait, we're talking here...

                Patience, Detective. We don't want
                another Pearl Street Bridge, do we?

     Conners's thrown by the mention of Pearl Street Bridge.
     Lorenz abruptly HANGS UP.

                He's off.

30A   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                       30A

      Black Clad #1 and #4 remove from their bag - ropes, pulleys,
      an iron spike and hammer. #1 also removes... a spear-gun.

      #1 connects the rope to a spear. FIRES the spear into the
      wall above the bank's front windows! He snags a 2nd spear,
      repeats.

31    POLICE TECH VAN--                                               31

      The Detectives huddle.   Impatience level high.

                 He's not picking up.

                 Try again.

      Dax, humbled, does as ordered.

                     (glances about)
                 Where's our fearless Captain?

                           DEKKER
                 Went uptown to brief the Commissioner.

                           CONNERS
                 So you're here in his place.

      Conners fumbles with the wrapper, but eventually sticks
      another piece of gum in his mouth. Teddy notices.

                           CONNERS
                 Nicotine gum.

                           TEDDY
                     (shock)
                 You quit smoking?

                           CONNERS
                 Caffeine, too, if you must know.
                     (Another shock)
                 What? A man's capable of change.

                           TEDDY
                 A man, yes. You...     I'm not so sure.

                    CONNERS
          Don't worry, I still have a vice or two.

                    DAX
          Fifteen rings.    No answer.

                    CONNERS
          Try again in five.

                    TEDDY
          What are they doing in there?

                    VINCENT
          Wasting our time.

Time. The word rings in Conners's head.     He starts to put it
together.

                    CONNERS
          Precisely. He knows police protocol,
          not to mention the shit in our own
          precinct. He's disguising his voice,
          means he's got a record and has done
          this before. He's heavily armed and
          well-connected. He knows he's
          surrounded. He hasn't asked for a
          damned thing. He drops that hint about
          sunrise, prepping us for a long wait.
          He's buying time. Why?

                    VINCENT
              (brainstorming)
          To figure out his next move.    He wasn't
          expecting us.

                    DEKKER
          No, he wasn't expecting you. He said,
          he thought you were still suspended.

                    CONNERS
          Probably thought it would take the
          whole day for you to find me. Giving
          him the time he needs.

                    TEDDY
          He's stalling.

                    DEKKER
          He almost has what he came for.

Conners nods, eyes Dekker as if for the first time.

 SHOOTING SCRIPT                MARCH 15, 2004       20.


                    CONNERS
          Or... he's got what he came for and he's
          waiting for his ticket out of here.
              (the decision)
          We're going in.

                    TEDDY
          What?

                     CONNERS
          The bank has three points of entry.
          Teddy and Vincent, take a SWAT Team,
          head to the West side. We'll have the
          SWAT Commander take the East. Dekker,
          you're with me. Where is the SWAT
          Commander?

                    VINCENT
          I'll find him.

Vincent leaves Conners with Dekker and Teddy.

                    TEDDY
              (to Conners; concern)
          That's a big call, Quentin.   Thought
          about what you're doing?

                    CONNERS
          You questioning me, Teddy?

                    TEDDY
          Unfortunately... yeah.

                    CONNERS
          I question how you can fuck that
          asshole and still manage to look in the
          mirror.

                    TEDDY
          I'm not going to get into this now.
          And you're one to talk. I hear...

                    CONNERS
              (interrupting)
          The hostages are in imminent danger.
          They've confessed to killing someone, an
          automatic murder one charge - that's a
          life sentence, maybe a needle for all of
          them. So why keep witnesses around to
          testify? Longer we wait, the greater the
          risk. We need to go in. Now.

      SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004             21.


                          TEDDY
                    (beat; then relents)
                Okay.

     Even Dekker seems to agree with that theory. Vincent arrives
     with the SWAT COMMANDER, 40's, a former Navy SEAL with a
     "Don't FUCK with me" attitude.

                          SWAT COMMANDER
                I got snipers up top and ten soldiers
                on the ground.

                          CONNERS
                What's the best way in?

                          SWAT COMMANDER
                Tear gas, blow the doors...

                           CONNERS
                Hold on. No explosives. I got forty
                civilians in there, too great a chance.    Any
                other way?

                          SWAT COMMANDER
                There's no pussy way in. The doors are
                locked electronically from the inside.
                We ain't getting in without force.

                          CONNERS
                    (beat; thinks)
                What if we cut the power? That will
                disable the system and we can open the
                locks manually, come in that way?

                          SWAT COMMANDER
                    (thinks; concedes)
                That'll work.

                          CONNERS
                So we'll take the pussy way, Commander.
                We cut the power and go in at 11:15
                sharp!

                                                          TIME CUT TO:

32   EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - 11:13 AM - DAY                     32

     SNIPERS ON ROOFTOPS ready their weapons.    SWAT TEAM moves
     into position, cover all bank entrances.

     AT THE TECH VAN--

     Conners and Dekker slip into bulletproof vests.     Teddy,
     Vincent and the SWAT Commander arrive.

                            TEDDY
                  The bank's equipped with emergency
                  generators, which once the power's
                  down, will kick back on in
                  approximately 3-6 minutes.

                            CONNERS
                  It will be over before that.
                  Commander, your men in position?

                            SWAT COMMANDER
                  Standing by.

                            CONNERS
                  I will call for the power to be cut.
                  Once down, wait for my signal and
                  enter. No one moves until I give the
                  "go", understood?

       They all nod.    They're ready.

                            CONNERS
                  You have done this before, right?
                  Wait... I don't want to know.

33     INT.   SIDE OFFICES - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                    33

       VARIOUS SHOTS of HOSTAGES. It's quiet, until... Black Clad
       #1 and #4 burst, grab TWO RANDOM HOSTAGES, drag them out!
       They put up some fight, but quickly concede.

       The hostages sit shaking, crying...    Scared beyond belief.

     Instantly...   EVERYTHING BLACKS OUT!   LIGHTS, COMPUTERS, etc.

     THE HOSTAGES grab each other TIGHTLY.   PANIC evident.   Lorenz
     and the Black Clad calmly react.

      Black Clad #3 FLIPS A SWITCH. Suddenly, a canister attached
      to the pulleys race up the ropes! The HOSTAGES have their
      feet yanked out from under them, then shoot INTO THE AIR!

      They SMASH THROUGH A GLASS HANDRAIL ON THE SECOND FLOOR,
      then...

                Round up all the hostages, anyone that
                comes out, grab'em!

     Conners glares at Dekker.

                          CONNERS
                    (to the second)
                The rest of you, come with us.

     The OFFICERS rush to protect the HOSTAGES, pull them to
     safety. CAMERA CREWS and REPORTERS pounce on the
     opportunity.

     Conners and Dekker lead the charge inside, guns drawn.

51   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                              51

     EMERGENCY LIGHTS BURN! GLASS CRACKLES UNDER FOOT as Conners,
     Dekker and the Officers move through. Caution with each
     step.

     The lobby's clear.   Conners pulls the Officers close.

                          CONNERS
                    (whispers; to Dekker)
                We split up.
                    (whispers; to the officers)
                You two with him. You two with me.
                    (to Dekker)
                Check the back.

     Dekker nods, leads his group away.      Conner proceeds...

52   BEHIND THE COUNTERS--                                              52

     Nothing. Conners spots a DOOR in the back marked, "Bank
     Employees Only."

53   THE VAULT--                                                        53

     Dekker checks it out, but it's empty. The remnants of the
     explosion remain. Suddenly... THE GENERATORS ROAR TO LIFE!
     THE POWER BLINKS BACK ON!

     Dekker jumps, startled by the sudden blast of lights.

54    EMPLOYEE'S ONLY OFFICE--                                       54

      ALL THE LIGHTS COME UP, as...   Conners KICKS IN THE DOOR,
      but... It's empty.

55    A BANK CORRIDOR--                                              55

      Dekker leads his group. His heart POUNDING THROUGH HIS
      CHEST. His Gun up and ready. Suddenly...

      A NOISE up ahead... He bares down, takes a DEEP BREATH,
      carefully proceeds until... Teddy and Vincent emerge. Teddy
      EXHALES, lowers her weapon. So does Dekker.

55A   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                        55A

      Conners strides out from behind the counters...

                           CONNERS
                     (to Vincent)
                 See anyone come your way?

                            VINCENT
                 No.   No one went by me.

      The SWAT COMMANDER approaches holding a couple of the BLACK
      MASKS, some BLACK BODY ARMOR.

                           SWAT COMMANDER
                 Detectives... We found these.

      Conners takes one of the masks in his hands.

                           CONNERS
                 We let them walk right past us.

      Dekker, Teddy, the SWAT Commander, Officers, Vincent and the
      SWAT Team stand in the middle of the lobby, STUNNED.
      Conners, his anger SIMMERS TO A BOIL, until finally...

                            CONNERS
                 SHIT!

                                                         TIME CUT TO:

56    EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - 11:48 AM - DAY                 56

      An OFFICER unfurls a FRESH ROLL of "POLICE: CAUTION" TAPE
      around the scene. Still mayhem, but gradually coming under
      control.

      Police interview HOSTAGES, so do REPORTERS. PARAMEDICS
      administer oxygen. Two CORONERS load the EAGER TELLER's body
      into their truck.

     Vincent, covered in debris, confers with Conners.

                          VINCENT
                We got the one Teller dead, the two
                that were strung up are alive, but in
                critical condition. A few SWAT
                incurred 2nd degree burns, but that's
                the worst of it. Now, depending on who
                you talk to... there was anywhere from
                five to nine perps. And nobody got a
                good look at any of'em, wore their
                masks the whole time. Dax is rounding
                up the security tapes now. That should
                give us a firm number.

                          CONNERS
                I want background checks on every
                hostage. They're all suspects until
                they're not.

                          VINCENT
                You don't think one of them's still
                here?

                          CONNERS
                After this, nothing would surprise me.

58   EXT.   TECH VAN - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                58

     Dax pulls cables, power cords, etc., getting set to go inside
     with them. Dekker approaches.

                          DEKKER
                Excuse me... I need to listen to the
                conversation between Lorenz and Conners
                again?

                          DAX
                It'll have to wait.

                            DEKKER
                How long?

                           DAX
                Hour.   Maybe more.

                          DEKKER
                    (too long)
                Show me how to play it myself?

                Look, this isn't how it works. I don't
                take orders from you. I don't know you
                and NO ONE touches my stuff. You're
                going to have to wait.

     Dax gets his shit, starts to go. Dekker waits, then proceeds
     into the van. Dax turns, notices.

59   INT.   TECH VAN                                              59

     Dekker inspects the equipment, when...

                          DAX
                What the hell are you doing?

                          DEKKER
                Along with whatever they stole and this
                war zone they left behind... A man's
                dead, and the killers are running free.
                I don't have time to wait.
                    (looks at the equipment)
                I'll figure it out. Thanks for your
                help.

     A CAR PULLS UP... Jenkins steps out. Stares out over the
     scene, the mess. He's a volcano ready to erupt.

61   INT.   SECURITY ROOM - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                61

     A SERIES OF EIGHT BLACK AND WHITE VIDEO MONITORS... as we
     rewind. SEVEN of the eight show recorded images of the bank.
     The eighth shows only STATIC. Dax sits in front of the
     monitors. Conners stands nearby.

                          CONNERS
                    (re: the eighth monitor)
                What's with this one?

                          DAX
                That's the camera in the vault.      It
                blew in the first explosion.

     The SEVEN DIFFERENT MONITORS all begin in sync.

     ON SCREEN... TIMECODE burns in the corner. The HOSTAGES are
     dragged across the LOBBY, where the Black Clads hook them up
     to the pulleys. The Black Clads get into position.

     Conners CAREFULLY scrutinizes the images.

     ON SCREEN... THE TIMECODE CLOCK:    Hits "11:15:00 AM" and...
     STATIC FILLS THE SCREENS!

                          DAX
                That's when you cut the power.

                          CONNERS
                So we can't ID them.

                          DAX
                There's a four minute, fifty-two second
                gap, before the image returns. But...

                          CONNERS
                They're long gone by then.
                    (beat; thinks)
                Go to the head of the tapes, from when
                they first went in. Document each move
                they've made for the two hours they
                were inside.

                          DAX
                You got it. Hey... Awful lotta news
                cameras outside. Maybe one got a look
                at them coming out?

                          CONNERS
                    (good idea)
                Have Vincent check it out.

     Teddy enters...

     Dekker listens through HEADPHONES makes notes as he goes.

                    (beat; stern)
                What does that mean?

                Theory... put to practice isn't always
                perfect. Can't expect to keep the

                unpunished or they may... randomly
                decide to revolt. Chaos... has some
                order to it.

     Dekker, hits STOP, then REWIND.     He checks his...

     IN HIS NOTEBOOK--

     Several words and phrases fill the page. "Lorenz, sunrise,
     Pro Theory, 40 hostages, Theory, Randomly Revolt, and Chaos."

     DEKKER studies the words intently, figuring something out.
     He presses PLAY on the DAT machine.

                          LORENZ (VO)

     Conners, Jenkins and Teddy converse with AGENT VICTOR DOYLE,

                fortune in the past. But for better of
                worse... he is an ally to the United
                States. The Prince keeps a safe
                deposit box in twenty institutions

                    AGENT DOYLE (cont'd)
          across the country. Along with this
          bank, he also had a box at Eastern
          Federal Savings in Charlotte, North
          Carolina, which was hit last month.
          Same M.O.

                    TEDDY
          What was in the box?

                    BANK MANAGER
          We don't keep records. The boxes are
          private. Since 9/11, we screen for
          live tissue, viruses or explosives, but
          if it passes those tests, we don't ask.

                    CONNERS
          This is all real fascinating shit, but
          what about the money? Bank robbers
          still like cash, don't they?

                    BANK MANAGER
          The cash drawers don't appear touched.
          Neither does the cash vault.

                    TEDDY
          So they broke into a bank and didn't
          steal any money?

Odd glances all about.

                    AGENT DOYLE
          We believe the Prince's box was the
          target. We're trying to reach him now.

                       JENKINS
          Thank you.

Agent Doyle and the Bank Manager leave.

                     JENKINS
          Helluva come back, Conners. Are you
          familiar with the term franchise-sized

          Depends, are we talking about your sex
          life? Because I've heard shortcomings.

                    JENKINS

                 That's not fair. It was by the book.
                 Everything was according to standard
                 procedure.

      Jenkins ignores Teddy.

                           CONNERS
                 You came to me. I didn't ask for this.

                           JENKINS
                 Commissioner's office is scrambling to
                 cover their ass. They need a
                 scapegoat... And I have zero problems
                 serving you up.

                           CONNERS
                 You wanted this to happen.

                           JENKINS
                 No. But if it had to happen to
                 somebody.

      Jenkins exits.

                 I think this Lorenz was trying to tell
                 us something.

                 You don't say.

                           DEKKER
                 The way he spoke... he paused before
                 certain words. Have you ever heard of
                 the Chaos Theory?

                    DEKKER
          Edward Lorenz invented the Chaos Theory
          in the 1960's. It's the study of
          phenomena that appear random, but in
          fact have an element of regularity
          which can be described mathematically.

                    CONNERS
              (confused)
          Try that again?

                    DEKKER
          Pretty much... initial state of events
          may seem unrelated and random, but
          eventually patterns emerge and in the
          end all the pieces fit together.

The Waitress refills Conners' coffee, lays down the check.

                    WAITRESS
          Anything else, officers?

                    CONNERS
          That'll be all.
              (to Dekker)
          You're a College boy. Which one?
          Someplace I've heard of or one of those
          inbred state schools no one's heard of?

                    CONNERS
          Not exactly Princeton, but not bad.
          How did you end up on the force?

                    DEKKER
          It's kind of the family business.

                    CONNERS
          Family business? What, your Dad, Dad's
          Dad and so on and so back?

Dekker squirms when it comes to revealing personal info.

                    DEKKER
          Do we really need all this "get to know
          you" crap? Couple hours ago you didn't
          give a shit.

                    CONNERS
          You've grown on me. Besides, I am
          entrusting my life to you. I should
          know something about you. I would

                    CONNERS (cont'd)
          think you'd like to know a little
          something about me.

                    DEKKER
          I know about you, Detective.      Everyone
          does.

                    CONNERS
          You don't say that with much
          enthusiasm.

                    DEKKER
          Not much to be enthusiastic about.

Conners reaches his limit.      Time to put him in place.

                    CONNERS
          Listen, my reputation often proceeds me.
          You, however, have no reputation; a fact I
          need to deal with. After you've been
          through the shit I have, then you can judge
          me. Now... we can try to work together,
          make the best of a bad situation or we can
          compare Dick sizes all day... Up to you.
          But since this is your first day here...
          today... mine's bigger.

                    VINCENT (VO)
              (over radio)
          Conners, come in?

Both men hold steely stares on one another.     Until...

                (into radio)
          Go.

                    VINCENT (VO)
          Got something you'll want to see.

Conners drops a TEN DOLLAR BILL on the table.

                    CONNERS
          Lastly... I don't like the Pac-10.
          It's overrated. I'm an Ivy League guy.

Conners gets up, heads for the door.

Dekker, humbled, scoops up Conners's ten, puts it in his
wallet and drops a twenty down on the table, slides out of
the booth.

66    EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                              66

      Conners, Dekker and Teddy approach a NEWS TRUCK. Vincent
      stands with Karen Cross and her CAMERAMAN who sports TWO
      BLACK EYES AND A BLOODY NOSE.

                 Detective... Can't keep away from me,
                 can you?

      Conners ignores her, but Dekker doesn't.   He gives her the
      ONCE OVER. She notices, smiles.

                            VINCENT
                 Watch.

      He points to a monitor in the van, presses PLAY.

      A SHAGGY BROWN HAIRED MAN, 40's, with a MOUSTACHE and an

67   EXT.   BIKER BAR - LOWER CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD - 1:13 PM - DAY        67

     The streets are quiet. A ROW OF HARLEY DAVIDSONS park in
     front. Above the bar, a small, lower class apartment
     complex.

68   INT.   HALLWAY - LOWER CLASS APARTMENT                             68

     TWO POLICE OFFICERS along with Conners, Dekker, Teddy and
     VINCENT position themselves by the APARTMENT. Vincent knocks
     his fist on the door...

                          VINCENT
                Gina, it's the police.    Open up.

     There's no response.   But SOUNDS can be heard on the opposite
     side of the door.

                          VINCENT
                    (Pounds louder)
                We can hear you.

     Again no response.   It's quiet.    Too quiet.

                    (to Vincent; low)
                Step back. Clear the door.     Now.

     Just as Vincent does...

     BAM! A GUNSHOT BLOWS APART THE DOOR!     Fired from the inside
     of the apartment!

     BAM! BAM! BAM! The BLASTS KEEP COMING!          Everyone's pinned
     down, on the defensive.

     A WOMAN SCREAMS FROM INSIDE THE APARTMENT!

     Dekker gathers himself together.

     Conners TURNS INTO THE OPEN DOORWAY, FIRES A FULL CLIP INTO
     THE APARTMENT!

      A THIN LAYER OF SMOKE hovers.     But that's all.    Nobody in
      sight.

70    IN THE APARTMENT HALLWAY--                                          70

      Conners steps inside, just as he reaches the living room...

      BAM!   ANOTHER BLAST!    This one FROM THE BEDROOM!

      Conners DROPS TO THE FLOOR, falls back into the kitchen!

                              TEDDY

      Dekker passes the kitchen door, looks in on Conners.

                 You hit?

      Dekker looks inside the bedroom, doesn't see Richards.     He
      takes one step inside when...

      GINA, 20's, Latino, wearing only a pair of red panties with
      NO BRA, runs up behind Dekker and JUMPS ON HIS BACK, FISTS
      FLYING!

      Dekker pushes her down, aims his gun at her.

                               DEKKER
                  Stay down!

      DEKKER hops onto the fire escape, hoofs down the iron stairs.

      Richards... drops to the pavement.      Heads for the street.

      DEKKER, a flight from the bottom, realizes his disadvantage
      and HURLS himself over the rail! Hits the ground HARD,
      WIPES OUT!

      Jumps up, shaking it off.    STAYS IN PURSUIT!

77    EXT.   BIKER BAR - LOWER CLASS APARTMENT - DAY                       77

      Dekker races around the corner...    A FORD F-350 SPINS the
      corner. Targeting DEKKER!

      Dekker jerks out his Glock.    FIRES!

      BULLETS RICOCHET OFF THE GRILL, SPARKS FLY! Windshield
      spiderwebs. But this train ain't slowing down.

      The F-350 swerves, clips a Harley.

      Dekker JUMPS before impact, bounces off the hood and rolls
      away.

      The truck hits the street, speeds away.

      Dekker, grimacing through the pain, scrapes himself off the
      pavement. Dekker's eyes dance... spot THE HARLEYS.

      The Slow Vehicle skids to a stop! Dekker's hog, cuts inside,
      between the vehicle and the sidewalk, rips into the alley.

      Richards fishtails down the alley. Barely maintaining

      Richards barrels out of the alley, through the intersection
      and into another alley. Opposing traffic skids out. ANGRY
      DRIVERS let him have it.

      Dekker skids sideways, steers around the blockage.     Catches
      sight of...

      DOWN THE BLOCK...   A PATROL CAR speeds down Hastings Street.

      Dekker revs the engine, maneuvers around the ANGRY DRIVERS
      and follows Richards into the SECOND ALLEY!

      Richards races, checks the rearview mirror...      Dekker's Hog
      closing in.

      UP AHEAD...   The alley exits onto RICHARDS STREET.

      Richards approaches the mouth of the alley, just as A STREET
      CLEANER appears, starts to block the exit.

      Richards STAMPS ON THE ACCELERATOR, speeds through the small
      opening, just past the Street Cleaner!

      Dekker's not so lucky. Sees the Street Cleaner too late...
      Lays out the hog and rolls just as... The Hog slides into
      the Street Cleaner!

78E   I/E   RICHARDS' TRUCK/ STREET INTERSECTION/ PATROL CAR - DAY 78E

      Dekker gets up, looks down the street, SEES...

      Richards getting away, speeds down the street, through
      another intersection, when...

      CRASH! Conners, in a patrol car, plows into the rear of the
      truck, spinning it around.

      Dekker races towards the crash site.

      Conners climbs out of the car.

      Richards shakes his head, clearing it. Blood squirts from
      his mouth. He sees, through the windshield, Conners coming
      for him. He scrambles for his handgun, looks up to see
      Conners, but he's not there. Richards turns as...

      Conners appears in the Driver's side window, grabs the back
      of Richards' head and SLAMS it into the steering wheel!
      Again!

      Conners reaches inside, grabs the handgun.   As Dekker
      arrives...

                           RICHARDS

          eight. Done some time for possession,
          has two kids... Am I interrupting?

                       CONNERS
          No.

                       TEDDY
          Excuse me.

Teddy exits.

                    DEKKER
          Gina claims she doesn't know anything
          about a bank robbery.

                    CONNERS
          Of course she doesn't.   Vincent!

Vincent trudges out of the kitchen.

                    CONNERS
          Have'em put Ms. Lopez in interrogation
          one and turn the A/C on full. Leave
          her alone and cold. Let me know when
          her nipples can cut glass.

                    VINCENT
          Will do.
              (To Dekker)
          Detective... I didn't realize when we
          first met who you were. I worked with
          your father. It was only for a brief
          time when I first got outta the
          academy, but it was an honor.

                    CONNERS
              (surprised)
          Your father was Harry Dekker?

                    VINCENT
          I wish it could've been for longer.

                       DEKKER
          Thanks.

Vincent exits. Conners looks at Dekker in a new light.
Dekker starts away, until...

                   (new subject)
               That was some fancy riding.    You have a
               bike?

                         DEKKER
               Used to, but I sold it.
                   (shows his scrape on his arm)
               They're dangerous.

     MARNIE ROLLINS, 20's, a CSI OFFICER, wears gloves, pokes her
     head in the room.

                         MARNIE
               Detectives. Ready for you.

80   THE BEDROOM--                                                    80

     TWO LARGE SUITCASES rest OPEN on the bed.   Marnie prepares a
     report.

                         CONNERS
               Somebody going on a trip?

                         MARNIE
               Looks like it, don't it?

                         CONNERS
               Marnie, you're looking well.

                         MARNIE
               Heard you were back, Conners... and
               keep dreaming.

     Marnie gives DEKKER an amorous glance, which he returns.

                          MARNIE
                    (to Dekker)
               You, on the other hand... I gotta bike
               myself. Maybe we can go for a ride
               sometime? Or maybe I can just ride
               you.

     Conners looks at both of them.

                         CONNERS
               Can we get back to work?

                         MARNIE
               We got passports, sun tan lotion,
               Bermuda shorts, thong bikini, hopefully
               hers and this...

She opens a LARGE DUFFEL BAG. Conners and Dekker look inside
the bag... It's FULL OF CASH! All denominations.

                    DEKKER
          Must be a fifty large there easy.    His
          cut?

                    MARNIE
          You'd think, right?

                      DEKKER
          It's not?

                    MARNIE
          Don't put words in my mouth, but...
          Two things jump out here. First, each
          bank branch has their own money bands.
          This is not American National's. After
          a little checking, it belongs to
          Pacific Savings of Seattle.

                    DEKKER
          That sounds familiar.

                    MARNIE
          It should. Four months ago, a half
          million dollars was stolen in an armed
          robbery there. Just a smash-n-grab
          job. They caught the guys a day later,
          recovering about $400,000. Those guys
          have been in lock up since and their
          trial's still pending. Which leads us
          to point number two. Do you smell
          that?

                    DEKKER
              (smells the bills; grimaces)
          What is it?

                    MARNIE
          When evidence is taken in, any physical
          contact might affect the ability to
          lift prints, so, to mark it, we now
          spray a scented solution directly on
          the bill.

                    CONNERS
          Is that new?

                    MARNIE
          Wave of the future.   Gotta keep up with
          the times, Conners.

                           DEKKER
                 So this money's not from our bank.

                           MARNIE
                 No. This is the money from the Pacific
                 Savings job and our evidence room.
                     (smiling; to Dekker)
                 Now... For a list of things you can
                 put in my mouth.

81   INT.   HALLWAY - LOWER CLASS APARTMENT - DAY                   81

     Conners and Dekker confer with Teddy and Vincent.

                           CONNERS
                 Do you remember who headed up the
                 Pacific Savings case?

                           TEDDY
                 I think it was Callo.    Why?

                              CONNERS
                 No reason.     Just thinking out loud.

82   I/E    CONNERS'S CAR/ CITY STREETS - DAY                       82

     Conners and Dekker head back to the police station.   It's
     quiet between these two, until...

                           CONNERS
                 When you said it was your "family
                 business" I didn't think... I guess I
                 just didn't connect the dots.

                           DEKKER
                 Don't worry about it.

                           CONNERS
                 Your father was a hero.

                           DEKKER
                 Yes he was.

                           CONNERS
                 At first I thought maybe you were
                 related to the Captain.

                            DEKKER
                 No.   No relation.

                           CONNERS
                 The Captain, he just kind of
                 "discovered" you. Through the academy,

                          DEKKER
                Something like that.

                          CONNERS
                That's how he found me.

     This surprises Dekker.

                          CONNERS
                Maybe we're not as different as you
                think.

83   INT.   INTERROGATION ROOM - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT         83

     A small, cold room with a large mirror along the WEST WALL.

     Gina sits at the table, shivering. Her breath visible, so
     are her nipples through a WHITE, SEATTLE P.D. T-SHIRT.
     Conners paces around her like a CIRCLING SHARK. Dekker's in
     the corner, observing.

                          CONNERS
                We found the money.

                          GINA
                That money was Dwayne's...

                          CONNERS
                That money came from our evidence room.

                          GINA
                I told you. I don't know nothing about
                a bank robbery. Whatever Damon was
                into, I didn't know!

                          CONNERS
                So, where were you going?

                           GINA
                Me!?   I didn't do nothing!

                    CONNERS
              (frustrated)
          It's "I didn't do anything." "Didn't
          do nothing" is a double negative,
          infers the positive. The grammar in
          this country sucks.

                    GINA
          Then I didn't do ANY-thing!

Conners takes a seat next to Gina.    His EYES BURN through
her.

                    CONNERS
          This isn't going away. You want to
          walk out of here, you tell me
          something... now.

                    GINA
          I swear I don't know. Now I'm done
          talking. I want a lawyer.

Dekker lowers his head.    Disappointed.

                    CONNERS
          You sure that's what you want?

                    GINA
          Yeah.

                    CONNERS
          Fine. Then it's two phone calls I'll
          make. The first will be to the public
          defender's office. The second to
          children's services.

                    GINA
          What?

Suddenly Gina's bravado disappears.    Suddenly a scared and
lonely girl.

                    CONNERS
          It's simple... if you insist on a
          lawyer, I take your kids.

                    GINA
          No.

                    CONNERS
          Not like you cared about them anyway.
          You were ready to fly the coop with
          "Shit-for-brains."

                No.   You can't do that.

                          CONNERS
                I can and I will.

                           GINA
                Don't.

                          CONNERS
                Tell me what I want to know!

     Dekker stares incredulously at Conners.

                          GINA
                    (broken)
                I don't know anything.     Please don't
                take my kids. Please.

     Conners stares into Gina's eyes. She's telling the truth.
     Conners wraps his coat around Gina's shoulders.

                          CONNERS
                Get her some coffee...     Something hot.

                You believe her?

                          CONNERS
                I think for the first time in that

                You had to know, once she asked for a
                lawyer anything she told us would have
                been inadmissable.

                          CONNERS
                Who would've known? It would've been
                my word against hers. Who do you think

     AT THE FRONT COUNTER--

     Conners and Dekker wait. No one's working at present.
     Dekker peers inside, anxiously looking for someone.

     Dekker RINGS the service bell.

     Finally... HARRY HUME, 50's, the cop on watch, limps to the
     desk. Crotchety, with an overgrown belly, Frank's seen
     better days. There's no love loss between Harry and Conners.

                           CONNERS
                    (cold)
                Buzz us in.

                    (colder)
                You gotta sign first.

     Conners and Dekker scribble their signatures down.

                          HARRY
                I heard you were back. Kinda liked not
                having you around, Conners.

     Harry takes the clipboard, examines it until satisfied.   Then
     reluctantly BUZZES them in.

                          CONNERS
                Have another donut, Frankie.

     Dekker and Conners proceed inside. They walk ALONG THE VAST

                You'd have to have some major

                Like I said... No one takes anything
                out of here, unless they sign for it.

                             CONNERS
                So what...     He showed you a warrant?
                What?

                          HARRY
                He must've.

                          CONNERS
                You don't remember?

                          HARRY
                You know how many times someone signs
                shit in and out? I see the same guys
                all the time. I can't remember one
                instance two weeks ago. But if his
                signature's there, that means he signed
                for it. Take it up with him!

86   INT.   CAPTAIN JENKINS'S OFFICE - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT      86

     Jenkins listens as Conners and crew brief the situation.

                          CONNERS
                The money from Richards's place traced
                back to the Pacific Savings heist a few
                months ago, a case Callo headed up.

                          TEDDY
                Callo signed the money out of evidence
                two weeks ago.

                            JENKINS
                How much?

                            TEDDY
                $433,000.

                          VINCENT
                If it's Callo, it would explain how
                they knew police protocol and how our
                department operates.

                          TEDDY
                Also explains why he was so pissed this
                morning about being replaced by
                Conners. He wanted to be the point so
                everything went according to plan.

                          CONNERS
                He doesn't need another reason to be
                pissed at me.

                          JENKINS
                What about motive?    Do we have one?

                          VINCENT
                Pressure might've been getting to him.
                He's been getting the cold shoulder
                from cops since he testified about
                Pearl Street Bridge.

                           JENKINS
                No.   Don't buy that.

                           TEDDY
                    (beat)
                He was also getting divorced.

     This is news to everyone.

                          TEDDY
                About a month ago, he told me he and
                his wife might be splitting. Asked if
                I knew a lawyer who wouldn't clean him
                out. I didn't think it was this bad.

                          JENKINS
                    (conflicted)
                Bernie Callo is a first rate cop.     A
                boy scout. This doesn't make any
                sense.

                          CONNERS
                They never do, Captain.

                          JENKINS
                Don't act like you're not enjoying
                this, Conners. I know what you think
                of him.

                          CONNERS
                Doesn't matter what I think.      Facts
                here speak for themselves.

                          DEKKER
                No they don't. We haven't asked the
                question... Why, if Callo's involved,
                don't they ask for him at the bank?
                    (points to Conners)
                They asked for you.

     All eyes find Conners.   Then, Jenkins' PHONE RINGS...

                          JENKINS
                    (answering the phone)
                Jenkins.

                                                          TIME CUT TO:

87   EXT.   BERNIE CALLO'S HOME - 4:18 PM - DAY                       87

     The small home in a RURAL AREA is now COMPLETELY SURROUNDED
     by COP CARS.

88   INT.   BERNIE CALLO'S HOME                                       88

     A typical family-themed home. FAMILY PICTURES adorn the
     walls. Everything in its right place. Except for... MRS.
     CALLO, 40's, sits in the kitchen SOBBING. Police encircle
     her.

     In the center of the Living Room... BERNIE CALLO LIES DEAD,
     a bullet wound right between the eyes.

      SHOOTING SCRIPT                MARCH 15, 2004           54.


     SEVERAL UNIFORMED OFFICERS and CSI OFFICERS muddle through
     every nook and cranny of the tiny home. Conners, Teddy and
     Dekker are led around by a UNIFORMED OFFICER...

                          OFFICER AT CALLO HOUSE
                Wife came home approximately forty-five
                minutes ago. Found him here. None of
                the neighbors heard anything. There's
                no forced entry and no one saw anyone
                fleeing the scene.

     Vincent enters from the basement carrying a LARGE BOX.

                          VINCENT
                Blueprints from the bank, schematics,
                pictures... Also, about a dozen
                internet articles on the Saudi Prince.
                Found it behind the furnace.

     Conners nods.

                          DEKKER
                Well, that's it, right?

     Suddenly... THE HOUSE TELEPHONE RINGS! Everyone peers
     around. After the second ring, the ANSWERING MACHINE PICKS
     UP...

                          CALLO (VO)
                You've reached the Callo residence.   No
                one can get to the phone right now.
                Please leave a message.

     Then...   After the TONE...

                          LORENZ (VO)
                    (from the machine)
                Detective Conners... Are you there?

     Conners and everyone turns, listens.

     INTERCUT WITH:

89   INT.   DARK BEDROOM - NIGHT                                    89

     Lorenz stares ahead, transfixed by something.

                          LORENZ
                Are you connecting the dots? Are you
                putting it together? Is the pattern
                emerging? They wouldn't punish you,
                but I will.

     Conners GRABS the phone...

                Vengeance will be mine, Detective.

                          CONNERS
                Then come and get me you piece of shit.

     Lorenz smiles, hangs up.   He resumes staring at the wall in
     front of him.

90   EXT.   BERNIE CALLO'S HOME - DAY                                 90

     Dekker leans back against the car, Conners approaches...

                          CONNERS
                What they told Callo was the plan and what
                the plan really was may be two different
                things. Clearly this wasn't part of a plan
                Callo would've agreed with.

                          DEKKER
                You'd think a cop would be smarter.

                          CONNERS
                As cops we come across every temptation
                in the book. Money, drugs, power.
                We'd all like to think we can resist
                any urge, but... We're not saints.

                          DEKKER
                So, Callo was involved and now they're
                dragging you into it. Why?

                          CONNERS
                Man said he wanted vengeance.

                          DEKKER
                Piss anyone off lately?

                           CONNERS
                Me?

     Both can't help but smile.      Jenkins walks up.

                          JENKINS
                I just got off the phone with Agent
                Doyle. After the Charlotte break in,
                the Prince withdrew all his possessions
                from every safe deposit box in this
                country.

        SHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004       56.


                            DEKKER
                  Let me get this straight, they didn't
                  touch the cash or the safe deposit
                  boxes. So, they... break into a bank,
                  blow it up, and steal nothing?
                      (to Conners)
                  Still make sense to you?

                            CONNERS
                  Nothing about today makes sense.

       Dekker watches as BERNIE CALLO's body is loaded into the
       Coroner's vehicle. Teddy assists MRS. CALLO into a police
       car. Vincent carries the box of evidence from the home.

       Dekker's mind works overtime, then...

                             DEKKER
                  "Return to the earth now if your mind
                  is troubled and your heart is
                  uncertain. For it is by returning to
                  the beginning that we can clearly see
                  the path."

       Conners and Jenkins share a confused look.

                            CONNERS
                      (to Jenkins)
                  Don't look at me, he's your find.

                            JENKINS
                  Say that again, Detective?

                            DEKKER
                  We go back to where this all started.
                  We go to the bank.

91     EXT.   SEATTLE - 6:08 PM - NIGHT                              91

       The sun SINKS below the horizon.

       As night settles, POLICE and EMT workers are still on site.

92     INT.   SECURITY ROOM - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                 92

       Dekker and Conners watch as Dax operates.

                            DAX
                  The tapes confirm five bad guys, but
                  since the vault cam blew in the
                  explosion what they did in there was a
                  mystery.

 SHOOTING SCRIPT                MARCH 15, 2004             57.


ON A COMPUTER MONITOR - The EIGHT SECURITY CAMERA ANGLES
appear.

ON THE MULTIPLE SCREENS... Just as in the opening, Lorenz
leads this crew through the bank. Immediately the group
splits up. IN THE VAULT... One of the Black Clads arrives
and radios in.

                    DAX
          I've been through these tapes twenty
          times already and nothing...

                      CONNERS
          Shutup.

MONITOR #5... IN THE VAULT, Black Clad #2 fires the
explosives! The image goes to STATIC.

                    DEKKER
          Wait, hold on a second.   Did you see it?

                      DAX
          See what?

                    DEKKER
          Go back a little.

                      CONNERS
          What?

                    DEKKER
          Notice the camera angles, they're all
          fixed. They don't rotate or pan.

Dax rewinds, to before the explosion...

                    DEKKER
          There. Stop. Play it. Look closely,
          camera five, the vault cam, dominates
          our attention because of the explosion.
          But while that's happening, check out
          Camera two, customer service.

ON SCREEN... Several BANK EMPLOYEES cower to the Black Clad.
Suddenly, another Black Clad DISAPPEARS UNDERNEATH THE
SECURITY CAMERA.

                    DAX
          Where'd he go?

ON SCREEN... As the EXPLOSION GOES OFF, CAMERA #2 PANS AWAY
FROM THE CUSTOMER SERVICE SECTION, TOWARDS THE LOBBY.

                He moved it. Changed the angle.    He
                didn't want us to see something.

                           DEKKER
                What's in that corner they didn't want
                us to see?

     Dax rewinds the tapes again, before the camera was moved and
     FREEZES FRAME ON: a lone COMPUTER TERMINAL in the corner.

93   INT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                                 93

     AT THE COMPUTER TERMINAL... A FORENSICS TECHNICIAN, 30's,
     carefully dusts the computer keyboard for fingerprints.

     Dekker and Conners look on.

                          DEKKER
                Are you at all concerned that there's
                some whacko out there looking to get
                you?

                          CONNERS
                If I worried about every threat made
                against me, I'd never leave the house.

     The Technician turns on a BLACK LIGHT and... FINGERPRINTS
     APPEAR ALL OVER THE KEYBOARD!

     Conners looks to Dekker, impressed.

                          CONNERS
                    (to the technician)
                Those are priority one. If he's got a

                          FORENSICS TECHNICIAN
                I'm on my way.

                          CONNERS
                Dax, can you hack in there and find out

     The ITALIAN RESTAURANT HOST, 50's, jolly with a thick accent,
     greets Conners and Dekker.

                Detective, where you been? Much too
                long. Sit, sit. I give you best table
                in house. It'll just be the two?

                Wonderful, wonderful. Who's this young

                          CONNERS

                    (insulted)
                No wine?

                          CONNERS
                A little wine.

                          ITALIAN HOST
                That's better.

     They get to the table, Conners looks at it.

                          CONNERS
                Last time I was here, you said that
                table in the corner was the "best in
                the house."

                         ITALIAN HOST
               It was. Anywhere you sit becomes best
               table in house. Now relax, I bring you
               food.

95   LATER, STILL AT THE RESTAURANT--                               95

     A PIANO PLAYER recreates the sweet sounds of Italy.   PATRONS
     sing along. Eating, drinking and being merry.

     AT THE DETECTIVE'S TABLE--

     Vincent and Teddy have joined Conners and Dekker. A MOUNTAIN
     OF FOOD still remains. A COUPLE BOTTLES OF WINE have been
     consumed, empty plates and basket rolls spread about. The
     mood is happy, light. Not thinking about their day.

     Conners tells an anecdote, something that Teddy and Vincent
     have heard before, but don't care. Dekker watches the
     Detectives, admires in their closeness.

                         CONNERS
               Shane, what was that thing you said
               back at the house about "returning to
               the beginning path" or something?

                         DEKKER
               It's a Buddhist story.

                         CONNERS
               We're all ears.

                         DEKKER
               One day the Buddha found his heart in
               turmoil. So he retreats to the forest,
               to the earth, to the base of a great
               tree and, I'm paraphrasing, but... this
               elephant comes up and tells Buddha he
               doesn't like seeing him discouraged.

                         TEDDY
               He can talk to an elephant?

                         DEKKER
               He's the Buddha. He's attained the 6th
               level of consciousness. He's capable
               of communicating with plants, trees...
               even rocks.

                            VINCENT
               Rocks?

                            DEKKER
               You asked.

                       CONNERS
          Continue.

                    DEKKER
          The Buddha was troubled so he went back
          to where he came from, the beginning,
          to find the path, the answer. So when
          you hit a dead end, go back to the
          beginning to find your way. Or
          something like that.

                    CONNERS
          We have a genuine philosopher in our
          midst.

                    VINCENT
          You're a Buddhist?

                   DEKKER
          No. Just something I picked up along
          the way.

                    TEDDY
          But you're religious?

                    DEKKER
          Not particularly.

Conners stares curiously at his new partner.   Then excuses
himself to go to the men's room.

                    DEKKER
          You're all pretty tight.

                    TEDDY
          We've been through a lot together.

                    DEKKER
          I guess I just thought... I don't
          know. With all the trouble he's been
          in lately, coming back from suspension,
          everyone would treat him differently.

                    VINCENT
          You can't believe what you read or see
          on TV. If anything, our tie to Conners
          is stronger. He's one of the best.
          Even when things got pretty wild today
          and everyone else panicked, he was in
          control. That doesn't just happen.
          He's just that good.

                       TEDDY
          Excuse me.

     Teddy heads for the ladies room.

                          VINCENT
                What was the Buddha looking for?

                          DEKKER
                The divine in himself.

     Art's confused.    Dekker's cellphone rings.

                          DEKKER
                How long does it usually take to for
                fingerprints to be ID'd?

                          VINCENT
                Hours, maybe days.    We could be waiting
                a while.

                          DEKKER
                    (answering)
                Dekker./ Okay.
                    (Snapping the phone shut...)
                They got a match.

96   INT.   BY THE RESTROOMS - ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT             96

     LONG CURTAINS divide the rooms.

     Conners exits the men's room, Teddy appears and before a word
     can be spoken... SHE KISSES HIM HARD, PASSIONATELY ON THE
     LIPS. Conners gives in for just a moment. He breaks the
     embrace.

                          CONNERS
                What are you doing?

                          TEDDY
                I realized something today. Being
                around you, all that's happened...       I
                can't... I think I made a mistake.

                          CONNERS
                It's too late. You've made your
                choice. Live with it.

     This jab hurts Teddy and Conners knows it.     Dekker parts the
     curtains...

                          DEKKER
                We got a match.

     Teddy separates from Conners.

                You got a name?

                             DEKKER

97   INT.   CONNERS'S CAR - NIGHT                                 97

     Conners drives, Dekker reads Chris Lei's file. On top of the
     file is a MUGSHOT PHOTO of, "Lei, CHRIS". He's an early-30's
     Chinese-American with a "weasel factor" off the charts.

                          CONNERS
                Prick used to work for some big-time
                software company until they caught him
                dipping into the company's slush fund.
                They didn't want the publicity so they
                didn't press charges. Couple years
                later, he was busted for looting the
                pension plans of retired cops. For a
                genius... he's a fucking moron.

                          DEKKER
                This was your case. You and York. You
                made the bust. Why didn't it stick?

                          CONNERS
                His lawyer put us on trial. Said we
                were crooked, abusive, that we planted
                evidence... We were in the midst of
                the Pearl Street Bridge fallout. Jury
                bought it. They let him walk and we
                were the scapegoats.

                          DEKKER
                Was it true?

                           CONNERS
                The guy was guilty. He was scum. That

      The design is MODERN, FLAWLESS and COLD. Every room is
      equipped with VIDEO CAMERAS and MONITORS.

      ON THE MONITOR... The screen is divided into 16 small boxes
      showing the actions simultaneously throughout the house. Our
      concentration settles on BOX #7...

100   INT.   BEDROOM - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                         100

      CHRIS LEI, live and in the flesh, quickly stuffs belongings
      into a suitcase. He's nervous, tense. From the top drawer
      of his dresser, he grabs an armful of underwear, socks, dumps
      them into the suitcase.

      What Chris doesn't see...

      IN THE REFLECTION OF THE MIRROR ON THE DRESSER...   LORENZ!

101   EXT.   CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   101

102   INT.   COMPUTER ROOM - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                   102

      From his second floor window, Chris sees Conners and Dekker.

                 Shit.

      Chris turns, FINDS HIMSELF STARING DOWN A BARREL!

                           LORENZ
                 Fare thee well, Chris.

      Chris swallows, Lorenz pulls the trigger and...

      BAM! THE GUNSHOT ECHOES OUTSIDE. Conners and Dekker draw
      their weapons, quickly descend on the house!

      THE FRONT DOOR KICKS IN! Dekker and Conners cautiously
      enter. They move the way veteran partners would. No
      indications that these two just met today.

      The House is almost PITCH BLACK.

      Conners motions that he's going up, signals for Dekker to
      take the back of the house.

      Dekker steps from the back hallway into the DARKENED living

      LORENZ STEPS FROM THE DARKNESS.

108   INT.   COMPUTER ROOM - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                  108

      Conners moves from the hall, into the bedroom where he
      finds... Chris's dead Body. He checks for a pulse when he
      notices...

      ON THE MONITOR... Conners sees A SHADOWY FIGURE BEHIND
      Dekker!

109   INT.   LIVING ROOM - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                    109

      Dekker, oblivious to Lorenz's presence, continues on.    Heads
      for the front hallway.

      Lorenz raises his gun, narrows his sites on Dekker.

      Simultaneously... CONNERS DIVES, TACKLES DEKKER BEHIND the
      living room wall -- LORENZ OPENS FIRE, UNLOADS A FULL CLIP!

      An EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN, 30's, attends to Dekker's

      HANDCUFFS lock Richards to his bed. Richards is hooked up to
      an IV and a tube's up his nose. A HEART RATE MONITOR chimes
      rhythmically.

      Two UNIFORMED OFFICERS look on as Conners and Dekker enter.

                     (to the officers)
                 Take five, guys.

      The officers exit. Conners LOCKS the door, walks to the bed,
      leans over Richards.

                 May I?

      Conners concedes the floor.     Dekker addresses Richards.

                           DEKKER
                 You remember me, don't you?
                     (Damon gives an EVIL GLARE)
                 Thought so.

      Dekker turns his attention to Richards' IV, the tubes which
      carry medication into his body.

        SHOOTING SCRIPT                MARCH 15, 2004            68.


       From a nearby medicine cabinet, Dekker rummages around.

                            DEKKER
                  I was skiing about three years ago.
                  Aspen. Beautiful country. Ever been?
                  Never mind. I hit a mogul, landed on a
                  sheet of ice and slammed into a tree.
                  Broke myself up pretty bad. Kinda like
                  you did today. I was in a hospital bed
                  for three months. Had it not been
                  for... Here it is.
                      (he finds)
                  Morphine. Without this stuff, I
                  wouldn't have made it.

       Dekker fills a syringe with the entire bottle.

                            DEKKER
                  Now this IV drip administers a small
                  dosage every minute. Makes you feel
                  relaxed and calm. No pain. But...

       Dekker sticks the syringe needle tip into the IV bag.

                            DEKKER
                  If I were to inject this whole thing...
                  That would be all she wrote for Damon.

                            RICHARDS
                  You don't have the balls.

       Dekker PRESSES down on the syringe, just a little, but enough
       to go into the bag. Richards can't believe it.

                            DEKKER
                  This equipment malfunctions all the
                  time. Overdoses are quite common.
                  Besides, I don't think the DA's going
                  to launch a full-scale investigation
                  over a scum like you.

       Richards attempts to signal for a nurse, but Dekker pulls the
       call button away.

                            DEKKER
                  You don't have to tell us a damn thing.
                  Plead the fifth... roll the dice.

       Dekker SQUEEZES in some more, until...   Richards gives in,
       signals that he'll talk.

                  You fuckin' hypocrite. You give me
                  shit for my interrogating skills...
                  least I don't threaten them with a
                  lethal overdose.

       Dekker holds the empty vile up, hands it to Conners.

                            DEKKER
                  There's never been a single case in
                  recorded medical history of someone
                  overdosing on 200 milliliters of
                  saline.

       Conners checks the label, smiles.

                            DEKKER
                  Bend, not break. That's what you said,
                  right?

                  Lorenz's true identity is Scott Curtis.
                  He's wanted in connection to three
                  other bank robberies, extorsion and
                  kidnapping.

       Jenkins stands before Conners, Dekker, Teddy, Vincent and two

       KNIGHT, 50's.

                             JENKINS
                  He's also the brother of John Curtis,
                  the perp Conners shot at Pearl Street
                  Bridge.
                      (Moving on)
                  Richards testifies that he was hired by
                  Curtis to pull the bank job with a
                  dirty cop on the inside, Bernie Callo.
                  Curtis hoped that Conners would take
                  the fall for American National turning
                  ugly, disgracing him even further. We
                  also have the names of two more
                  accomplices, Lamar Galt and Xander
                  Harrington. Everyone was set to meet
                  tonight at ten and we have that

                  it doesn't take a rocket scientist to
                  know Curtis is eliminating his
                  accomplices. Doesn't matter what
                  Curtis told Galt and Harrington, he's

      normal.

                   Because he died on the job, he's a

                   still would've died. She had a chance

129   AROUND THE HOUSE--                                          129

      Conners, Dekker, Vincent, Teddy converge on the house.

                           CONNERS
                 We take them alive!

      They all rush inside...

      Conners and Dekker make their way up the stairs...

131   DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY--                                        131

      Teddy and Vincent head down the hall...

132   UPSTAIRS HALLWAY--                                          132

      Conners and Dekker move carefully. Conners points for Dekker
      to go in the other direction. Dekker obeys, slides down the
      other side of the hall.

133   IN THE KITCHEN--                                            133

      Teddy's on her toes.   She smells something, but keeps moving.

       ON THE FLOOR...    A trail of BLOOD leads to the DINING ROOM.

       Teddy signals to Vincent.   "That way."

134    FIRST BEDROOM--                                               134

       Conners enters, checks it out.

135    SECOND BEDROOM--                                              135

       Dekker stands outside the closet. He opens it quickly, but
       it's empty. Except for... On the far wall -- HUNDREDS OF
       PICTURES of Conners. The same shrine we saw Lorenz in front
       of earlier.

135A   DINING ROOM--                                                135A

       Vincent swings in from one entrance, Teddy the other.   She
       takes a cautious step out, when...

       BAM! A BULLET ZINGS PAST TEDDY - HITS THE WALL BESIDE HER
       HEAD!

       HARRINGTON, from the corner, takes aim again!

       VINCENT drops to the floor, aims through the dining room
       table legs and FIRES!

       THE BULLET TEARS INTO HARRINGTON'S SHIN!   He SCREAMS IN PAIN,
       DROPS TO THE FLOOR!

135B   FIRST BEDROOM--                                              135B

       Conners HEARS THE SHOTS, runs out of the room.

136    SECOND BEDROOM--                                              136

       So does Dekker.

136A   DINING ROOM--                                                136A

       Teddy moves in on Harrington.

                           TEDDY
                 Drop the gun!

       Harrington holds his gun UP AND OUT towards Teddy.   Is he
       aiming or surrendering?

                           TEDDY
                 Drop it now. Last warning.

       But he doesn't.

       down, dead.

       Conners and Dekker meet by the top of the stairs.

                              CONNERS
                 Teddy!?     What's happening?

       Vincent appears at the bottom of the stairs.

                           VINCENT
                 We got one down. He's dead.

138    UPSTAIRS HALLWAY/ STAIRCASE--                                    138

       Dekker and Conners share a look, disappointed.      But then
       something catches Conners's eye.

       BEHIND DEKKER...     a door OPENS...   LAMAR GALT AIMS HIS
       WEAPON!

                              CONNERS
                 GUN!

       GALT FIRES!

       Conners PUSHES DEKKER OUT OF THE WAY, just in the nick of
       time!

       DEKKER TUMBLES DOWN THE STAIRS!    Vincent breaks his fall.

       GALT FIRES AT CONNERS, until he's out of bullets.      He ducks
       back behind a door.

       Conners FIRES!   But did he hit anyone?     Conners pursues...

138A   AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS--                                   138A

       Dekker grabs his head, in pain, but okay.

138B   DINING ROOM--                                                   138B

       Teddy leans against the wall, spots A VENT...       A FLASH GOES
       BY!

139    UPSTAIRS BATHROOM--                                              139

       Conners creeps inside the partially open doorway. It's
       quiet, until... LAMAR GALT lunges, tackles Conners! His gun
       flies from his hands.

      Teddy's EYES fall to...

      ON THE FLOOR... next to the base of the door is a FUSE.         It
      runs from the wall into the vent.

      She follows it into THE KITCHEN.

      Vincent and Dekker get up.        Dekker looks upstairs...

                               DEKKER
                   Conners!

      Conners and Galt struggle. Conners PUNCHES Galt, sends him
      back! He then SLAMS Galt against the wall, Galt KNEES
      Conners in the gut.

      Galt goes for the gun, Conners KICKS out his legs from
      underneath him! But before Conners can get the upper hand,
      Galt fights back! The two continue...

       Conners HITS THE FLOOR HARD! Galt's head slams against the

       Conners leans over Galt, a giant GASH across his forehead,
       feels for a pulse. He's dead. Conners looks into the
       hallway, SEES THE FIRE!

                            DEKKER
                  Where's Conners?

       Dekker and Teddy look to the house, when...

                  No!   No, we have to go save him!

      No emotion evident.

      FIRE TRUCKS, POLICE CARS and EMERGENCY VEHICLES surround the
      house. The LIGHTS FLASH AN EERIE RED across the scene.
      FIREMEN try to extinguish the flames.

      Several NEWS TRUCKS have arrived, always after the story.

      A CORONER, 40's, zips shut a body bag. Inside the BADLY
      BURNT BODY of Detective Conners. The BADGE ON HIS BELT still
      visible. They load him into the truck.

      TEDDY, her face drained of life, stares at the truck. A
      Fireman walks behind them, back towards the fire truck.

                 Conners was right. We should've never
                 gone in. How many more mistakes can we
                 make in one day? He was eliminating
                 his accomplices. We thought he was

      Quiet, mostly dark.     A few fluorescent lights and a desk
      lamp...

      Dekker sits at Conners' desk. A somber moment, reflecting on

          I know what they were doing inside the
          bank.

DEKKER AND DAX--

Dax flips through the huge document.

                    DAX
          These are today's transaction records
          from the bank. An average day produces
          about 400 pages, give or take. Today,
          there were over 3,000 pages.

                     DEKKER
          Meaning?

                    DAX
          We've just witnessed the largest heist
          in history. Somewhere in the
          neighborhood of a billion dollars.

                    DEKKER
          Come again?

                    DAX
          It's a computer virus. "The Computer
          Virus." It randomly withdraws money
          from all the accounts and deposits it
          into the bad guys' account. If you
          check the transactions, no two
          withdrawal amounts are the same and
          none of'em are over $100. Most
          security systems work on the size of
          the money, not number of transactions.
          Wire out one million from a handful of
          accounts and red flags go up. Wire out
          a less than a hundred from ten million
          accounts, no flags.

                    DEKKER
          Where's the money now?

                    DAX
          I tried following one of the
          transactions. It took me an hour and
          when I finally had it... It went away.

                    DEKKER
          How is that possible?

                    DAX

                 temporarily, then transfers to another
                 account, then to another. It's never
                 in one place long enough to get an
                 accurate fix.

                           DEKKER
                 It's still moving the money around?

                           DAX
                 Yeah. Any deposit or withdrawal from
                 any bank doesn't usually go into affect
                 until the next business day. So it's
                 going to keep jumping around until it
                 clears at 9 AM tomorrow.

                     (realizes)
                 Or 6 AM Pacific time. Sunrise. So why
                 break in? If they're just wiring
                 money? Couldn't they do that from

      Dekker shuffles to his car, his cellphone rings.
      Answering...

       SHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004           83.


                            DEKKER
                 Dekker.

                           DISPATCH OFFICER (VO)
                 Detective Dekker, there's a call for
                 you. Says it's urgent.

                           DEKKER
                 Put it through.

                           LORENZ/ CURTIS (VO)
                 Good evening Detective. I just wanted
                 to compliment you on a fine day. You
                 were an unexpected adversary that was
                 most challenging.

                           DEKKER
                 It's not over yet.

                           LORENZ/ CURTIS (VO)
                 Wishful thinking.

                           DEKKER
                 No. My wish is to catch you. You're a
                 murderer. A cop killer at that.

                           LORENZ/ CURTIS (VO)
                 I didn't kill anyone who didn't deserve
                 it. Callo was insignificant and
                 Conners crossed me. In years to come
                 you'll thank me for getting rid of him
                 before he corrupted you.

                           DEKKER
                 I know about the money. You steal a
                 billion dollars... They will find you.

                           LORENZ/ CURTIS (VO)
                 A risk I'm willing to take. It's
                 almost sunrise. Fare thee well.

      Lorenz hangs up. Dekker surprisingly calm, hangs up the
      phone, heads back inside the station.

153   INT.   BULLPEN - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT          153

      Dekker at his desk, piles through mounds of paperwork.   Not
      sure what to look for, he goes through everything.

      His notes from the bank. The file on Galt, Harrington, Chris
      Lei. He even digs through Conners and finally... Callo's
      file.

      Jenkins heads for the exit.

                           JENKINS
                 You're still here?

                           DEKKER
                     (in complete work mode)
                 Callo's insignificant.

                             JENKINS
                 What?

                           DEKKER
                 That's what he said, Callo's
                 insignificant. But he wasn't.

                           JENKINS
                 What are you talking about?

                             DEKKER
                 Lorenz...    Curtis...   Called me.

                           JENKINS
                 He called you?

                           DEKKER
                 He said he didn't kill anyone who
                 didn't deserve it. He said Callo was
                 insignificant. But without Callo he
                 wouldn't have had the knowledge of our
                 department and...
                     (grabs a clipboard)
                 ... He wouldn't have had the front
                 money to hire the crew.

                           JENKINS
                 He was screwing with your head. Go
                 home, Shane. You did good today. Your
                 Dad would be proud. Get some sleep.
                 There will be more bad guys tomorrow.

      Jenkins exits.

      Dekker falls back into his chair. Then... discovers...
      Callo's file... The Property Room Sign-Out Sheet. The
      signatures.

154   INT.   INTERROGATION ROOM - SEATTLE P. D. - 1:43 AM        154

      Harry Hume, the evidence room cop, out of uniform, walks
      inside, sits across from... Dekker, already here, with two
      DIFFERENT FILES available to him.

                           HARRY
                 I was in bed already.     This couldn't
                 wait til morning.

 SHOOTING SCRIPT                MARCH 15, 2004          85.


                     DEKKER
              (cold)
          How did he come at you, Harry? It's
          the only thing that doesn't make sense.

                    HARRY
          What are you talking about?

                    DEKKER
          All day long we thought Callo was the
          dirty cop. All day long we were wrong.

Dekker slides some papers in front of Harry.

                     DEKKER
          That's the sign-out sheet from the
          evidence room. Here's one of Callo's
          reports. Here's another one... and
          another --

The SIGNATURES ARE DIFFERENT, but Harry doesn't even examine
them. He knows.

                    DEKKER
          They're not the same signature, Harry.
          They're not even close.

                    HARRY
              (shrugs it off)
          Maybe he had a cramp in his hand.    I
          don't know.

                    DEKKER
              (re: file #1)
          This is your file... You were
          reprimanded, a month ago after you
          confronted Callo at the courthouse.
          You punched him. That ring a bell?

                    HARRY
          And I'd do it again. Cops who testify
          against cops shouldn't be breathing the
          same air I do. There's a line you
          don't cross!

                    DEKKER
          So you set him up! You forged Callo's
          signature, you gave him the money and
          you helped him with his plan because
          you thought he got a raw deal at Pearl
          Street Bridge! Don't deny it, Harry
          cause I know.

                           HARRY
                 OF COURSE HE GOT A RAW DEAL AT PEARL

157   EXT.   PEARL STREET BRIDGE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK                157

      Images FLASH before our eyes...

      The RAIN POURS DOWN!   An SUV CRASHES into a STALLED-OUT
      VEHICLE.

      JOHN CURTIS (THE KIDNAPPER) crawls out of the SUV! He sees
      cop's lights approaching. He drags LISA REANN (THE VICTIM)
      out of the truck. A BRIGHT LIGHT (from a helicopter) strikes
      John in the eyes!

      LIGHTS!   EVERYWHERE BRIGHT!   It's all very BLINDING!

      COPS block both sides of the bridge!   TV REPORTERS AT EITHER
      END OF THE BRIDGE!

      John holds the gun up to Lisa's head as... OVER JOHN'S
      SHOULDER... CONNERS APPROACHES, GUN DRAWN!

      Lisa struggles, tears streaming down her face.

      A FLASH OF LIGHT ENVELOPS CONNERS!

      CLOSE ON... A GUN FIRES!

      John DROPS lifeless to the pavement.

                                                               BACK TO:

      Harry pounds the table...

                           DEKKER
                 You're helping a cop killer, Harry.
                 You're a year from pension. This is
                 how you want to go out?

                           HARRY
                 My conscience is clean.

                           DEKKER
                 This has been a very long, trying day.

                 phantom. Just when we have him... he
                 disappears. He's been two steps ahead
                 of Conners and me all day.

                           HARRY
                 Of course he has.   Who knows Conners
                 better than him?

                           DEKKER
                     (what?)
                 How the hell does Curtis know Conners
                 better than anyone?

      Harry goes silent.   Realizes he just let the cat out of the
      bag.

                           DEKKER
                     (realizes)
                 We're not talking about Curtis, are we,
                 Harry?
                     (still no response)
                 Who would know Conners better than
                 anyone? Who would you protect? And
                 who in your mind got the raw deal at

      IN REVERSE MOTION - JOHN CURTIS GETS UP... THE BULLET RE-

      REVEAL THE ENTIRE SCENE: LORENZ/ CURTIS STANDS NEXT TO
      CONNERS ON THE BRIDGE HOLDING A GUN.

      LORENZ/CURTIS IS YORK!

      NOW RESUME ACTION... Conners and York aim their guns at...
      John holds Lisa tight.

                           CONNERS
                 Drop the weapon. Let the girl go.

      John PUSHES the barrel of the gun TIGHTER into Lisa's temple.

                           YORK
                 That, you don't want to do.

      York narrows his aim on John Curtis.

                           JOHN CURTIS
                 One step closer and the girl dies.

      SIMULTANEOUSLY... YORK FIRES just as Lisa STRUGGLES, MOVES!
      The Bullet intended for John Curtis, HITS Lisa, kills her
      instantly.

      Lisa's body crumples to the ground.

      Conners and York look on in horror, knowing York's bullet
      felled an innocent.

      John turns to fire on the detectives...      Conners fires -
      KILLS John Curtis!

      John's body hits pavement.      RAIN POURS DOWN!

                           DEKKER
                 It was York who was the bad cop. He
                 assumed Scott Curtis's identity to

                 York plays his old partner, knowing all
                 his moves, frames his enemy for the
                 crime, kills him too and pulls off the
                 biggest robbery in history.

                 Do what you want to me. He called to

                     (w/ a steel glare)
                 It's not a request.

165   EXT.   HARBOR NEAR PUGET SOUND - NIGHT                       165

      A BEAUTIFUL, BRIGHT FULL MOON hangs in the dark sky. Dozens
      of COMMERCIAL LINERS, CARGO SHIPS and SEAPLANES line the
      piers.

166   EXT.   DINER NEAR PUGET SOUND - NIGHT                        166

      Open twenty-four hours a day, 365 days a year. A handful of
      cars occupy the spaces out front. Including the MERCEDES.

167   INT.   DINER NEAR PUGET SOUND - NIGHT                        167

      A scattering of PATRONS, some at the counter, some in booths.
      A PRETTY WAITRESS, 20's, rings up a bill.

                           PRETTY WAITRESS
                 That'll be $8.48, please.

      YORK AKA LORENZ/CURTIS hands the Cashier a twenty.

                           YORK
                 Keep the change.

                           PRETTY WAITRESS
                 Thanks, mister.

      A BUS BOY, 19, carries some garbage out the back.

      York heads for the exits, opens the door and... STEPS
      OUTSIDE!

168   EXT.   DINER NEAR PUGET SOUND - NIGHT                        168

      York hoofs two steps outside when...

      A BRIGHT SPOTLIGHT STRIKES YORK'S FACE!   He shields his
      eyes...

      BEHIND THE LIGHTS... Dekker and Teddy aim their pistols.

                           DEKKER
                 Jason York... this is the police. Put
                 your hands in the air and slowly get on
                 your knees. Do it. Now!

                           YORK
                 Don't shoot. You win.

      York RAISES HIS HANDS HIGH, takes a small step backwards.

                              DEKKER
                    Get down on the pavement!

                              YORK
                    I'm cooperating.   You win.

      York takes another tiny back-step.

                              DEKKER
                    GET DOWN NOW! FINAL WARNING!

                              YORK
                    I SAID... I... GIVE... UP!

      York bends down to ONE KNEE, DRAWS A 9 MM... FIRES!

      DEKKER AND TEDDY DUCK FOR COVER!

      YORK RUSHES BACK INTO THE RESTAURANT!

      DEKKER AND TEDDY RETURN FIRE!

      THE GLASS WINDOW DOORS EXPLODE!

                              DEKKER
                        (to Teddy)
                    Take the back!

169   INT.   DINER NEAR PUGET SOUND - NIGHT                         169

      CUSTOMERS SCREAM AS...

      Dekker enters, surveys the restaurant.

      A LOUD BANGING FROM THE KITCHEN!

      Dekker approaches the kitchen door, pushes it open and...

      BAM!   BAM!    BAM!   BULLETS RIP APART THE KITCHEN DOOR!

      Dekker spins out of the way. As gunfire stops, Dekker KICKS
      through the door! Leans in gun first...

170   THE KITCHEN --                                                170

      In the center of the room... York neck-holds the Pretty
      Waitress, gun to her head.

      Dekker moves in...

                              YORK
                    Was it Harry? It was Harry, right?
                    That fat fuck!

                    DEKKER
          Let the girl go. It's over.

York's EYES BLAZE WITH ACTIVITY!    Something brewing.

                    YORK
          Easy for you to say. I'm a plane ride
          away from a King's Ransom.

THROUGH A SIDE DOOR... Teddy slides in, unnoticed.

                    DEKKER
          Drop the weapon, let the girl go.

                     YORK
          And spend the rest of my days in a
          cage? Let me ponder...
              (beat)
          Don't think so. If you're going to
          stop me... I'm gonna make you earn it.

                    DEKKER
          That you don't want to do.

                     YORK
              (realizes)
          That's exactly what I said to him. Do
          you see the irony here? Am I the only
          one? Two months ago I was in your
          shoes. Some punk holding a gun to an
          innocent girl. What should you do?
              (beat)
          YOU'D DO EXACTLY WHAT I DID!

A GLINT sparkles in his eyes.   His teeth grind.    His gun GRIP
TIGHTENS!

Teddy moves into position from the side!    Then...

The BUS BOY enters from the same door Teddy came in.     The
door BANGS closed behind him.

York spins, FIRES in that direction!

Teddy's HIT!   The Bus Boy retreats out the side door!

YORK TURNS ON DEKKER, FIRES!

Dekker DUCKS away safely.

York drags the Pretty Waitress to the back!

Dekker runs over, checks on Teddy.

                              DEKKER
                  Shit.

                              TEDDY
                  I'm fine.    Go get him.

      Dekker looks her in the eyes, then darts away.

171   EXT.   DINER NEAR PUGET SOUND - NIGHT                          171

      Dekker exits the back.     Finds the Pretty Waitress.    Shook up.

                            DEKKER
                  Which way did he go?

                              PRETTY WAITRESS
                  That way.    Down towards the pier.

172   EXT.   HARBOR NEAR PUGET SOUND - NIGHT                         172

      York sprints across the street.        Dekker follows.

173   I/E    STEEL CONTAINER YARD - NIGHT                            173

      HUNDREDS OF GIANT STEEL CARGO CONTAINERS litter the yard...
      makes the place look and feel like a GIANT MAZE.

      York disappears into the steel maze.

      Dekker enters, slows to a walk. Carefully proceeds forward.
      Gun drawn. Second guessing each turn.

                            YORK (OS)
                  You've really screwed yourself...
                  Jenkins is going to expect these kind
                  of results from you everyday.

                            DEKKER
                  FBI's got a team of 40 computer
                  technicians figuring out Lei's virus.
                  They'll break it.

      Dekker rounds a corner...

                            YORK
                  Your conviction would be admirable, if
                  it wasn't just so sad.

      At the far end of the container, York FIRES!

      Dekker ducks back.

      York takes a look out, doesn't see Dekker.

       SHOOTING SCRIPT                MARCH 15, 2004              94.


                           YORK
                 Get it through your head... The
                 calvary ain't coming. No heroes are
                 coming to save the day. The bad guy
                 gets away at the end of this story.

      Dekker peers around the corner... York's gone.

                           YORK (OS)
                 But I'll give you credit... You turned
                 out to be quite the little thorn,
                 didn't you?

      Dekker speed-walks, continuing the search.

                           YORK (OS)
                 I think Conners would be sorry that you
                 died. But not me.

      Dekker stops, eyes a full 360. The containers all look
      alike. Dekker wonders if he's just going around in circles.
      Until...

      BAM! BAM! BAM! BULLETS RICOCHET ALL AROUND DEKKER!         He
      dive-rolls for cover as...

      ON TOP OF A CONTAINER... York UNLEASHES, until... CLICK!        Out
      of ammo.

      Dekker, hearing this, pops up, RETURNS FIRE!

      York leaps off the backside of the container!

      Dekker gives chase. As he circles the container... no York.
      Instead, he finds a DOCK.

174   EXT.   DOCK - NIGHT                                             174

      A narrow wooden dock. There's a few small boats, A TUG BOAT
      and at the end... A SEAPLANE.

      Dekker approaches the tug. Each step slow and deliberate.
      EYES TRANSFIXED on the seaplane.

      As he nears the Seaplane... A SHADOW RISES from BEHIND HIM.
      From on top of the TUG BOAT!

      Dekker turns just as...

      York throws a fishing net on top of Dekker.    As Dekker
      struggles in the net, HIS GUN DISCHARGES!

      York with a PIKE POLE in hand, leaps down, CLUBBING Dekker
      over the head with the weapon. Dekker goes down!

       SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004              95.


      Dekker's gun SLIDES off the dock, into the water.

      York charges Dekker with the PIKE POLE, ready to stab,
      when...

      At the last second... DEKKER ROLLS AWAY! THE PIKE POLE
      BREAKS A WOODEN PLANK TO PIECES, sticks into the ground
      beneath the water.

      Dekker, still tangled in the net, KICKS OUT York's legs.        He
      falls to the planks.

      York quickly rebounds. He POUNCES on Dekker, from behind he
      wraps his arm around Dekker's throat, CHOKING HIM.

      Dekker struggles to breathe.    York SQUEEZES harder.

                           YORK
                 I have come this far...      I will not be
                 denied.

      Dekker fights, arms flailing. He REACHES blindly behind
      York, grabs a hold of the PIKE POLE. The pole SNAPS in two!

      Dekker wildly SWINGS at York who dodges easily.

      York SLAMS Dekker into the side of the TUG.       Still choking.

      Dekker, on his last gasp, PUSHES OFF THE TUG!

      York stumbles backwards, GETS HIS FOOT CAUGHT IN THE HOLE!
      He twists, spinning around, falling down onto...

      ... THE REMAINING PIKE SPEAR!    The Pike punches through his
      chest... POPS out his back!

      York, blood and life escaping him, his eyes find Dekker.
      Then go dead.

      Dekker steps close.   Holds a cold, remorseless stare at
      York's body.

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

      HELICOPTER HOVERS overhead. Karen Cross interviews Jenkins.

176   INT.   DINER NEAR PUGET SOUND - NIGHT                            176

      Teddy, arm in sling, and Dekker sip on some already cold
      coffee.

                    TEDDY
          We used to spend all day   Sunday just
          reading in bed. I would    read the paper
          and he would read one of   his billion
          books. I didn't deserve    him. I knew
          that. But I still loved    him.

Teddy stares out the window...

POV OF TEDDY - Jenkins speaks to Karen Cross.

                     TEDDY
          He's the only man I ever loved.
              (beat)
          Did we all get shot today?

They can't help but laugh.

                    DEKKER
          They said in the city I'd be busy.
          Every day like this?

                    TEDDY
          Pretty much.

                      DEKKER
          Great.    I wonder what's next?

                      TEDDY
          For me...    a long vacation.

Teddy excuses herself to the bathroom.      Dekker goes to pay
the check.

AT THE CASHIER...   Dekker reaches for his wallet, opens it.

                      DEKKER
          How much?

                    PRETTY WAITRESS
          Do you think I'm going to charge you
          after all that? Go on.

                      DEKKER
          Thanks.

Dekker notices the tip jar by the register. He removes a TEN
DOLLAR BILL, about to stuff it in the jar...

That's when THE SMELL hits him. A strange, but familiar ODOR
comes from Dekker's wallet or more accurately... The TEN
DOLLAR BILL! But what is it?

                                                   FLASH BACK TO:

177   INT.   BEDROOM - RICHARDS'S APARTMENT - DAY                    177

      Marnie explains to Dekker and Conners...

                           MARNIE
                 Do you smell that?

                           DEKKER
                     (smells the bills; grimaces)
                 What is it?

                           MARNIE
                 When evidence is taken in, any physical
                 mark might effect the ability to lift
                 prints, so, to mark it, we spray it
                 with a scented solution.

      Off of Conners' LOOK.

      Conners and Dekker get to know one another...      The Waitress
      lays down the check.

                           WAITRESS
                 Anything else, officers?

      Teddy exits the ladies room, but Dekker is gone.

181    INT.   LIVING ROOM - CONNERS APARTMENT - NIGHT                     181

       PAPERS and BOOKS litter the floor.

       Dekker trashes the place, looking for a clue of any kind. He
       rifles through the bookshelves, cabinets. All to no avail.

       That's when he finds... a medium-sized paperback, dog-eared
       and worn. The title of the book... "CHAOS" by James Gleick.

       Dekker flips through the book. Pages are marked, high-
       lighted. Key words we find include, "EDWARD LORENZ, CHAOS
       THEORY, BIRTH OF A NEW SCIENCE."

                                                                 TIME CUT TO:

       Dekker holds the "Chaos" book in his hand, paces...

                            DEKKER
                      (into phone)
                  You tried them all?/ Nothing for
                  Conners or Lorenz?/ I don't know.        No,
                  maybe he's not on a flight.

       Dekker then notices - the book.     The author's name.

                               DEKKER
                  Try again.     But try Gleick.   James
                  Gleick.

183    INT.   WESTERN AIRLINES TERMINAL - DAY                             183

       Dekker scans the line up of people.      Nothing.

       BY THE MEN'S ROOM--

       A MAN, 40's, in DISGUISE (Brown Wig), SPIES Dekker.          He picks

                  There's a passage in the Surangama
                  Sutra which, roughly translated means:
                  "Things are not what they appear to be:
                  nor are they otherwise."

                 Conners?

      Dekker again scans the line -- he's not there.         He scans all
      the faces AGAIN, but still nothing.

                 to err is human.

      Dekker SPOTS A MAN ON A CELLPHONE, he runs up to him, SPINS
      HIM AROUND, BUT... It's not Conners.

                 Harry and the phone call. He called
                 me, said Callo was insignificant.
                 Threw up a red flag.

                 I called you.

                  York always thought "the plan" was
                  flawless. He was cocky. I told him
                  you have to leave room for error. You
                  can't always predict how it's all going
                  to play out. A random camera catches
                  an image of Richards, the scent on the
                  money... you. You were the biggest
                  wrench of the day. The Chaos Theory...

      SEES THE FIRE!

      Conners gets up, and reaches INTO THE BATHTUB, drags out... a
      CORPSE, HOOKS HIS BADGE ONTO THE CORPSE'S BELT and lays him

                 Who got killed? Curtis? Harrington,
                 Galt, Lei. They're all hoods. The

                 at the bank... that was unfortunate.
                 But... you live with your decisions.
                 You choose to take this road... there
                 is no half way. It's all or nothing.
                 That's why others fail. They don't
                 make the commitment. I won't make that
                 same mistake.

                           DEKKER

                 about, Callo?

                           CONNERS
                 Callo deserved his fate.      It's his fault.

         opportunities.

                   CONNERS
         This wasn't about killing, Shane. This
         was about standing up for what matters.
         Besides... you kinda grew on me.

         I'm an opportunist. I would've gladly
         died in the line of duty, but they took

      As Dekker continues his search, his cellphone CUTS OFF!

                            DEKKER
                 Conners?   Conners?

	1  GIANCALDO. SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. EXT/INT. DAY
	
	The October sun slashes through the gray clouds, cuts across the
	shadow towards the sea, along the coast where the new suburbs of the
	city of Giancaldo have been built up.
	
	Bright light streams through the windows, glancing off the white
	walls in an almost blinding reflection. MARIA, a woman a little over
	sixty, is trying to find somebody on the phone.
	
				MARIA  
		...Salvatore, that's right, 
		Salvatore. Di Vita Salvatore
		...But, miss, what do you mean you 
		don't know him?!...I...Yes...
			(She gives a nervous sigh. 
			She has dialed her way 
			through endless numbers 
			but still hasn't managed 
			to speak to Mr. Di
			Vita. She finally heaves a 
			sigh of relief.)
		...That's right, good for you! 
		Oh!...yes...And I'm his
		mother. I'm calling from Sicily. Been 
		trying all day...Ah, he's not 
		there...But would you be so kind as 
		to give me...?...Yes...
			(She nods at another woman 
			around forty sitting 
			nearby: it is LIA, her 
			daughter, who jots down 
			the numbers her 
			mother dictates:)
		...Six, five, six, two, two, oh, 
		six...Thanks ever so
		much...Goodbye. Goodbye.
	
	She hangs up, takes the number LIA has jotted down, determined to have still 
	another try. LIA speaks to her as if she were a baby, to be more convincing.
	
				LIA  
		Look, Ma...It's useless calling him. 
		He'll be terribly busy, God knows 
		where he is. Besides he might not 
		even remember. Do as I say, forget 
		it...He hasn't been here for thirty 
		years. You know how he is. 
	
	MARIA pauses to think it over. The decision she has to make is important. Then, 
	stubbornly.
	
				MARIA  
		He'll remember! He'll remember! 
			(She puts on her glasses 
			and starts dialing 
			the number.)
		...I'm positive. I know him better 
		than you do. If he were to find 
		out we hadn't told him, he'd be 
		angry. I know. 
			(She takes off her 
			glasses.)
		...Hello? Good morning. Could I 
		please speak to Mr. Salvatore Di 
		Vita. I'm his mother...
	
	2  ROME. STREETS. EXT/INT. NIGHT
	
	It's late, but there is still traffic on the streets heading downtown.
	Inside a high-powered car, a man  around fifty is driving. It is
	SALVATORE Dl VITA. Elegant, just growing gray, a handsome face
	creased by deep wrinkles. His weary expression hides the determined,
	sell-assured manner of the successful self-made man. He must be a
	heavy smoker judging by the way he draws the last puffs on his
	cigarette.
	
	He stops at a red light. He stubs out the cigarette and rolls down the
	window, as a little Fiat Uno pulls up alongside. A rock tune plays full
	blast on the radio. SALVATORE turns instinctively to have a look at the
	man at the wheel  a BOY with a brush cut standing straight in the latest
	fashion. He studies the Boy's expression with almost exaggerated
	attention, but devoid of curiosity, coldly. The GIRL sitting beside him,
	lots of curly hair, overripe red lips, returns SALVATORE'5 look,
	provocatively. The BOY notices, turns to SALVATORE in a surly voice:
	
				BOY  
		Hey! What the fuck you looking at!?
	
	Green light. The Fiat Uno shoots off, leaving a trail of music in its wake.
	
	3  ROME. SALVATORE S APARTMENT. INT. NIGHT 
	
	The apartment is luxurious, tastefully furnished. There is no one waiting for 
	SALVATORE. Through the picture window on the terrace, the city can be seen 
	slumbering in the night. SALVATORE gets undressed on his way to the bedroom. He 
	moves quietly, as if to make no noise. He doesn't even turn on the light, 
	finishes getting undressed in the pale blue glow coming from the picture window. 
	A rustling sound, a movement on the bed, the voice of a woman waking up. 
	
				CLARA  
		Salvatore...But what time is it? 
	
	She turns on the bedside light. It is CLARA, a young woman around thirty. 
	SALVATORE climbs in beside her under the covers, kisses her sweetly, then in a 
	whisper.
	
				SALVATORE  
		It's late, Clara. Sorry, but I wasn't 
		able to let you know I wouldn't be 
		corning...
			(He fondles her, but he is 
			tired, feels like 
			sleeping.) 
		Go to sleep now. Sleep.
	
	He turns over on the other side. CLARA shuts her eyes, is about to drop off, 
	but whispers.
	
				CLARA  
		Your mother phoned. She took me for 
		somebody else...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Surprised) 
		And what'd you tell her?
	
				CLARA  
		I played dumb, so as not to 
		disappoint her. We had a nice little 
		talk. She says you never go see her, 
		and when she wants to see you she has 
		to come to Rome...Is it true?
	
	SALVATORE doesn't answer. God only knows how often he's heard that question 
	before.
	
				SALVATORE  
		She phoned just to say that? 
	
	She reaches out to switch of the light, buries her head into the pillow.
	
				CLARA  
		She said a certain Alfredo had died. 
		And the funeral's taking place 
		tomorrow afternoon...
			(A strange look suddenly 
			comes into SALVATORE'S 
			eyes. The idea of going to 
			sleep has clearly left 
			him. It's a piece of news 
			he didn't expect. That's 
			taken him off-guard. CLARA 
			would like to carry on the 
			conversation, but 
			sleepiness makes 
			it almost impossible. An 
			she can manage is one last 
			question in a faint little 
			voice:)
		Who is it? A relative of yours?
	
				SALVATORE  
		No. Sleep. Go to sleep.
	
	She falls asleep in the dead silence of the night. SALVATORE is seized by a 
	sort of chill a deep, troubled feeling. He gazes through the window al the city, 
	with its shimmering lights still moving in the darkness, suddenly shrouded in a 
	heavy curtain of rain. But he gazes off, beyond the row of houses, beyond the 
	dark sky; the shadow of a wind chime plays across his face summoning up endless 
	memories, drawing forth from the infinite depths of oblivion a past that he 
	thought had vanished, been wiped out, and instead now re-emerges, comes back to 
	life, takes on light, superimposing itself on the mellow middle-aged features of 
	his face, in the shadow of the city shaken by the storm, until another image is 
	formed, an ancient, remote image...
	
	4  GIANCALDO. CHURCH AND SACRISTY. INT. MORNING
	
	An image from over forty years before. In the baroque church of
	Giancaldo. SALVATORE is nine years old. Dressed as an altar boy, he
	is kneeling by the altar with a little silver bell in his hands. The
	congregation is also kneeling. The PRIEST is consecrating the Host.
	Little SALVATORE has just got out of bed, is still half-asleep, yawns
	and doesn't notice that the PRIEST is standing there with the Host in
	the air glaring at him, as if trying to tell him something.
	
				PRIEST  
		Pss! Pssst!
	
	SALVATORE finishes yawning and opening his eyes meets the
	withering look of the PRIEST. He gets the message at once and
	rings the bell. Now the PRIEST can carry on, lifts the chalice and
	the bell is heard again.
	
						Cut to:
	
	The service is over. The PRIEST is in the sacristy removing his
	vestments. And SALVATORE is also there, removing his altar-boy
	tunic.
	
				PRIEST  
		But how can I make you understand? 
		Without the bell I just can't go on! 
		Always half asleep, you are! What do 
		you do at night anyway? Eat instead 
		of sleep?
	
				SALVATORE  
		Father, at my house we don't even eat 
		at noon. That's why I'm always 
		sleepy. That's what the vet says.
	
	The PRIEST has finished disrobing. He takes the bell
	SALVATORE was holding during the service and turns to leave.
	
				PRIEST  
		All right, Toto, get moving, I've got 
		things to do. Say hello to your 
		mother.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Can I...
	
				PRIEST  
			(Interrupting him) 
		And don't ask if you can come...
		Because you can't!! Shoo, shoo, off 
		with you!!
	
	SALVATORE gives a shrug and leaves. The PRIEST goes down a
	corridor, opens a door, another corridor, and finally a door
	leading to an outside courtyard. He cuts across it and disappears
	into another door.
	
	5  CINEMA PARADISO AND PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. MORNING
	
	The PRIEST enters a movie house. Not very big  200 seats on the main
	floor and another seventy in the balcony. Along the walls, posters of
	films to be shown are stuck up between the light fixtures. In one corner,
	a statue of the Virgin Mary with flowers. The CLEANING LADY has
	finished work and is leaving. Up in the balcony, over the last row of
	seats, are the holes of the projection booth. The middle hole is
	camouflaged by the huge head of a roaring lion, all in plaster, and the
	lens of the projector can be glimpsed between its sharp teeth.
	there are two smaller holes, through which the figure of a man can be
	made out, appearing and disappearing...It is ALFREDO, the
	projectionist. He is around forty, skinny and bony with a tough
	peasant face. He has finished loading the projector and is checking the
	carbons in the arc lamp. Then he removes the glass from one of the
	holes and looks down into the theatre, at the PRIEST who waves his
	hand.
	
				PRIEST  
		OK, Alfredo, you can start!!
	
	He sits down an by himself in the middle of the empty theatre.
	Up in the booth, ALFREDO lights the arc lamp and sets the
	projector going.
	
	Down in the theatre, the light goes off and out of the lion's mouth
	streams the glowing ray aimed al the screen. String music, sweet
	and ominous, spreads through the theatre. On the screen appear
	the credit titles of an American film of the 1940s. The PRIEST
	screws up his face and holds the bell in his right hand resting on
	the arm of his seat.
	
	At the back of the theatre, behind the last row, a curtain moves,
	opens a crack and SALVATORE'S gaunt little face appears. He
	has managed to sneak in somehow and stands there without a
	word, spellbound, watching the 'movie' on the glowing screen.
	The credit titles have long come and gone. The story is at a
	turning-point. 
	
	Up above, in the hole of the booth next to the lion,
	ALFREDO watches the film, but his eyes keep looking down at the
	PRIEST, who is now drumming the bell with his fingers. On the
	screen, the male and female lead, two Hollywood stars, are in
	close-up; the dialogue is passionate, romantic. SALVATORE,
	carried away by those faces, by the way they talk, by the beauty
	of the woman, slowly slips down the length of the curtain until he
	is sitting on the floor, his eyes glued to the screen. 
	
	The love scene reaches a climax, the music crescendos, and the love-struck 
	couple finally fall into each other's arms and kiss. Instinctively, the PRIEST 
	raises the bell into the air, as in some age-old ceremony, and gives it a loud 
	ring...
	
	Up in the booth ALFREDO hears the bell; it's the signal he's been
	waiting for. He takes a slip of paper from a pad prepared for that
	purpose and sticks it into the loops of the film containing that
	specific scene as it winds on to the reel. The projection
	continues...
	
	...And also the kiss of the two actors. The PRIEST'S nervous look lingers on 
	those black-and-white lips meeting and now pulling apart for one last 
	declaration of love before separating. SALVATORE is wide-eyed, he's probably 
	never seen a man and woman kiss before, it's a vision that for him has all the 
	attraction of forbidden fruit, the horror of sin. The screen is now filled with 
	the figure of a woman getting undressed, showing for one instant the white, 
	voluptuous flesh of her broad, naked shoulders. SALVATORE stares in open-mouthed 
	wonder. The PRIEST, in a fury, grabs the bell and shakes it for all he is worth. 
	From the sound of the bell to another sound...
	
	6  GIANCALDO. MAIN SQUARE. EXT. DAY 
	
	The tolling of the bell-tower rings out over the 
	square. It is noon. The vast square, pale and dusty, is alive with people. A 
	noisy line of men, women and cows waits in front of the fountain to get water. 
	Peddlers hawk their wares in mournful cries. People come and go in front of the 
	town hall. The working men's club is deserted. The entrance of the Cinema 
	Paradiso is shut. Hanging outside is the poster of the film that has just been 
	seen on screen. Up above, the windows of the projection booth are open. The hum 
	of the projector can be heard and the loud, lofty music typical of 'THE END'. 
	Then dead silence. The showing is over.
	
	7. CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY
	
	Despite the speed, numerous white streaks spin around on the reel,
	created by the slips of paper ALFREDO has inserted into the loops. He
	is rewinding the film by hand on the film-winder. When he's not
	talking, ALFREDO usually sings to himself. SALVATORE stands beside
	him, taking in everything he does with those quick, thieving eyes of his
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Harshly, shouting) 
		You must not come here! How many 
		times do I have to tell you?
			(And he slows down the 
			reels with his hand. The 
			slips of paper
			are about to arrive. 
			Here's the first.)
		If the film catches fire, runt that 
		you are, you'd go up in a
		burst of flame...whoosh! And turn 
		into a piece of...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Overlapping him)
		...and turn into a piece of 
		charcoal!!
	
	He's used to his terrorisms, pays no more attention. Not even his
	grim look scares him. Anyway, ALFREDO catches the joke, starts to give him a 
	slap, but instead reaches over and picks up a pair of scissors.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Angrily) 
		Christ, that's a sassy little tongue 
		you've got! Watch out, or someday 
		I'll snip it off. 
	
	And he snips a piece of film, pastes the ends together and goes on turning the 
	handle. SALVATORE picks up the strip of film and gives it a closer look. He sees 
	a series of frames all alike with a man kissing a woman.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Can I have it? 
	
	ALFREDO snatches it out of his hand, furiously, at the end of his string. He 
	shouts.
	
				ALFREDO  
		No!!! Are you deaf or something? I've 
		got to put this back in when we wind 
		up the film again! You're a real pain 
		in the neck! 
	
	SALVATORE reaches into a basket full of strips of film. He takes out a handful: 
	all kisses that have been cut.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Then why didn't you put these back 
		when you wound up the films again? 
	
	ALFREDO is caught out. He stops the film where another slip of paper is stuck 
	in and cuts the scene:
	
				ALFREDO  
		'Cause sometimes you can't find the 
		right place any more and so...well, 
		actually...they stay here. 
			(Finding an excuse) 
		Besides, there are more kisses than 
		you can count.
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Excited) 
		So I can have these? 
			(ALFREDO explodes, flies 
			off the handle. He grabs 
			SALVATORE by the shoulders 
			and shakes him.)
	
				ALFREDO  
		Look, Toto! Before I kick your ass 
		all the way to China and back, let's 
		make a deal. These strips here are 
		yours, I give them to you. However! 
		One  you're not to stick your nose in 
		here any more. Two  I'll keep them 
		for you, because you can't take them 
		home for God forbid and save our 
		souls, if they catch fire, all hell 
		will break loose! OK? Oh!!! And now 
		scram! 
	
	He takes him and turns him towards the stairs. For him the matter is closed. He 
	returns to the film-winder. SALVATORE sneaks back and while ALFREDO's attention 
	is elsewhere, snatches up a handful of movie frames scattered on the counter, 
	stuffs them into his pocket and...
	
				SALVATORE  
		What sort of deal is this? The strips 
		are mine! So why can't I come see 
		them? 
	
	And he stares at ALFREDO with a sly, saucy look. ALFREDO clutches his hand, 
	darts forth like an arrow and is about to give him a kick in the ass. He 
	shrieks:
	
				ALFREDO  
		Get out!! And don't show your face 
		here again! 
	
	And before the kick reaches its destination, SALVATORE has already dashed off 
	down the spiral staircase.
	
	8  GIANCALDO. SALVATORE'S HOUSE. INT. EVENING
	
	That was not the first theft of film strips. SALVATORE's hand reaches
	into a flowery metal box jammed full of pieces of film. He takes out a
	few frames and holds them up against the kerosene lamp. Gazes at the
	figures that remind him of the films seen at Cinema Paradiso, and in a
	whisper mangles fragments of dialogue, the shooting of guns, the
	musical climaxes...
	
				SALVATORE  
		Bang! Bang! Bang! Shoot first, think 
		later! This is no job for weaklings! 
		Treacherous dog!
	
	The house has no lights, is gloomy and cold. SALVATORE's
	mother, MARIA, is leaning on the table in front of him. She is
	young, around thirty, and her pretty face is haggard, marred by
	all the sacrifices. She is sewing some clothes, is a seamstress. LIA,
	his four-year-old sister, is sleeping on a cot in one corner. The
	kerosene lamp projects the trembling shadow of the film strips on
	the wall, figures of prairies, gunslingers, thugs. SALVATORE's
	voice changes, turns even tougher.
	
				SALVATORE
		Hey there, you lousy bastard, take 
		your hands off that gold, You black-
		hearted pig, stay away from me, or 
		I'll smash your face in! 
		'Ntantatah!!!...
			(In the heap of movie 
			frames there are also 
			several photographs. 
			SALVATORE picks them up. 
			Family keepsakes. A man in 
			an army uniform. Then the 
			same man with a girl 
			beside him whose smiling 
			face can be recognized as 
			MARIA. SALVATORE takes a 
			closer look at the man's 
			face, then whispers to his 
			mother:)
		Ma, if the war's over, how come 
		Daddy's never come back?
	
	MARIA looks up at him with a sweet smile.
	
				MARIA  
		He'll be back, he'll be back...
		You'll see. One of these
		days...
	
	But there is not much conviction written on her face. She looks
	back down at her sewing. SALVATORE goes on looking at the
	photos.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I don't remember him any moreMa, 
		where's Russia?
	
				MARIA  
		It takes years to get there. And 
		years to come back...Now go to bed, 
		Toto, it's late.
	
	SALVATORE puts the photos back into the box and tucks the box
	under LIA's cot near the charcoal burner.
	
	9  GRADE SCHOOL. COURTYARD. EXT. DAY
	
	A noisy crowd of little children in black smocks, white collars and blue
	bows moves about the large courtyard where there are two tall palm
	trees. The boys head for one door, the girls towards the opposite one.
	The Janitors line them up two by two, ready to enter. Here and there,
	parents and relatives accompany the younger ones. Beneath one of the
	palms, SALVATORE pulls off the altar-boy tunic, stuffs it into the
	khaki-colored cardboard schoolbag, takes out the smock and puts it
	on, as one of his schoolmates passes by. It is MASINO, and he's crying
	desperately because he doesn't want to go to school. His FATHER drags
	him along, yelling:
	
				MASINO'S FATHER
		You can fool your mother but not me! 
		Get yourself a damn diploma and 
		become a policeman. You good-for-
		nothing!
	
				MASINO  
		I don't want to go to school'
			(The sound of the bell. 
			The black lines move up 
			the steps towards the 
			school.)
	
	1O  FOURTH GRADE. INT. DAY 
	
	SALVATORE is sitting at the front-row desk next to PEPPINO, 
	a little freckle-faced boy. His attention, like that of the whole class, is 
	concentrated on what is taking place at the blackboard. The TEACHER is standing 
	there, watching a plump little boy, shy and not quite all there, do a two-figure 
	multiplication  it is NICOLA SCORSONE, known as 'COLA'. He is red in the face, 
	has one purple ear and one white one. He stares in terror at that '255 x 15' 
	written on the blackboard. The TEACHER yells, waving a birch rod in her hand. 
	
				TEACHER  
		Well then?! Five times five 
		equals...? 
	
	COLA stops to think a moment, then... 
	
				COLA  
		Thirty!
	
	The TEACHER grabs him by the purple ear and bashes his head against the numbers 
	on the blackboard. A large thud echoes through the room, followed by a roar of 
	laughter. The TEACHER slams her rod on the desk.
	
				TEACHER  
		Silence!! 
			(Then to COLA) 
		The five times table. Dunce! One 
		times five, five!!
			(The class repeats with 
			the TEACHER, in a sing-
			song chorus:)
	
				TEACHER and CLASS  
		Two times five, ten! Three times 
		five, fifteen! Four times five, 
		twenty!
			(With a wave of the rod, 
			the TEACHER silences the 
			class, and finishes the 
			sing-song with the fateful 
			question.)
	
				TEACHER  
		Five times five?
	
				COLA  
			(Timidly) 
		Forty...?
	
	Another blow of the head on the blackboard. Hubbub.
	Slapping of the rod on the desk. SALVATORE secretly shows
	COLA the picture of a Christmas tree on one page of the book,
	and mouths the word 'twenty-five'. COLA smiles, he has finally
	caught on.
	
				TEACHER  
		I'm asking you for the last time, 
		blockhead! Five times five equals...?
			(COLA turns to her with 
			smiling eyes and answers 
			blissfully:)
	
				COLA  
		Christmas!!
	
	SALVATORE clutches his head in anger, watches the TEACHER
	flogging COLA on the back with the rod. COLA screams at every
	blow, and at every blow the laughter in the class grows louder.
	SALVATORE stares at the rod moving up and down rhythmically. But he is not 
	thinking of the pain his schoolmate is feeling, but is drawn, rather, by that 
	strange regular beat, finds it similar to another regular beat, that of...
	
	11  CINEMA PARADISO. BALCONY AND MAIN FLOOR. INT. DAY
	
	...the rolling pin ALFREDO uses to flatten out a reel of film that has just 
	been unloaded. SALVATORE carefully watches ALFREDO 5 every move. He is not in 
	the projection booth, but up in the balcony, standing on top of the last row of 
	seats. He peers through the hole next to the lion's head. His bright little eyes 
	fix in his mind the things ALFREDO does, as he loads the film into the 
	projector, shuts the fireproof housings, turns on the amplifier, checks the 
	carbons in the arc lamp, then lowers his head to have a look into the theatre 
	and finds himself face to face with SALVATORE.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Sternly) 
		What are you doing here? 
	
				SALVATORE  
		I bought a ticket. I've come to see 
		the film.
			(Meanwhile the USHER comes 
			up behind him and grabs 
			him by the collar, and he 
			almost jumps out of his 
			skin. ALFREDO laughs.)
	
				USHER  
			(Yelling) 
		Go sit downstairs! You good-for-
		nothing sponger! ! 
			(To the audience) 
		Worse than rabbits they are!
	
	SALVATORE has run downstairs. The main floor is more
	crowded than the balcony, like every Sunday, and there is a greatdin. The BOY 
	selling ice-cream, soda pop and candy shouts and
	runs around like a chicken with its head off. Now the lights dim,
	the hubbub dies down and the performance starts. Before the film
	there is a preview for Stagecoach. The screen fills with images ofJohn Wayne, 
	the pursuit of the stagecoach by hostile Indians
	etc...
	
	SALVATORE is sitting in the front rows, right under the screen,
	next to BOCCIA, COLA, MASINO, PEPPINO and OTHER KIDS, all with their noses in 
	the air. BOCCIA, the biggest show off of the group, is smoking a cigarette. An 
	OLD MAN appears through the entrance curtain, takes a couple of steps and 
	shouts:)
	
				FIRST OLD MAN  
		Hello, everybody!
	
				AUDIENCE  
			(At once) 
		Ssssssh!!! Ssssssh! Silence!
	
				FIRST OLD MAN  
		Can't I say hello?
	
				USHER  
		It's a double-feature today.
	
				FIRST OLD MAN  
		I couldn't care less. I come here to 
		sleep.
	
	All at once, a chorus of shouts and whistles fills the theatre. Up
	on the screen, a globe of the world appears, spinning among the
	stars, the logo announcing the newsreel.
	
				AUDIENCE  
			(Hooting and whistling) 
		For Christ's sake! Cut it, 
		Alfredoooo!
	
	The CHILDREN in the front rows also yell, but SALVATORE goes
	on being alert. He turns and looks up at the holes of the projection
	booth, as if it were an impregnable fortress. He watches the crazy
	dancing of light in the glowing stream that opens towards him in a
	cone. And besides, that lion's head, mysterious, almost gruesome,
	emphasizes the enigmatic secret of the movies. In his dreamy eyes,
	that lifeless lion seems to wake up with a ferocious roar.
	
	SALVATORE has a frightened look...Another lion roaring. But up on the screen. 
	The MGM lion. The throng of children imitate the famous growl all together, 
	shaking their heads in unison.
	
				CHILDREN  
		Grrrr! Grrrrr! 
	
	The film starts: it is Visconti's La terra trema. SALVATORE is in bliss. His 
	wide eyes looking up at the magic square of light. The title music. Another OLD 
	MAN enters at the back of the theatre, but before sitting down, says hello in a 
	loud voice.
	
				SECOND OLD MAN  
		Greetings to one and all!
	
				AUDIENCE  
		SSSSSH' Drop dead! Silence! Hey, 
		kids, we're here to see the film! 
	
	Now there is an important sequence. The audience is silent. Concentrated on the 
	screen. BOCCIA passes the lighted cigarette to SALVATORE. He takes a puff and 
	hands it on to the others without ever taking his eyes off the screen. The 
	beautiful star of the film appears on screen. A different kind of attention 
	takes hold of the excited audience. SALVATORE and the others stare at her with 
	open mouths...She leans towards the leading man, a languid expression, their 
	profiles touch. But all at once, just at the best part, there is a sudden jolt. 
	
	The kiss isn't seen.
	
				AUDIENCE  
			(Disappointed) 
		Ahhh! What a shame! I've been going 
		to the movies for twenty years and I 
		never saw a kiss! 
	
	SALVATORE is the only one to laugh to himself. He knows what has happened.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		And when will we see one? 
	
	Up in the balcony, the audience is more sedate. The tickets cost more and the 
	people are richer, more refined. Among them, a MAN with a moustache, the look of 
	a public notary, is sitting right in front of the railing. Seriously, without 
	batting an eye, he spits down below with contempt. Right on the dot, a voice is 
	heard, followed by a chorus of protests.
	
				VOICE and AUDIENCE  
		Bugger!!! Ssssh!!! Silence!!
	
	12  SQUARE AND ENTRANCE OF CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. NIGHT
	
	The bell-tower rings midnight. The square is nearly deserted. Except
	for a landowner near the refreshment stand, with a moustache and a
	hat, DON VINCENZO by name, who is picking out from a group of
	labourers the men he'll be needing in the country at dawn. He chooses,
	points his finger, calls...
	
	People come out of the movie house after the last showing.
	The USHER locks the front door as ALFREDO climbs down from the
	projection booth. Among the crowd there is only one kid, SALVATORE.
	Tired, half-asleep. He's seen all the showings. He starts to walk away
	when he catches sight of his mother standing on the opposite corner,
	wrapped in an old coat. She's waiting for him, in a temper.
	SALVATORE drops his eyes to the ground, mortified. He knows what's
	coming. He goes over to her timidly, uncertain, gives her a questioning
	look.
	
				MARIA  
		I've been looking for you all day. 
		Did you buy the milk?
	
				SALVATORE  
		No...
	
				MARIA  
		Then where's the money?
	
				SALVATORE  
		Somebody stole it.
	
	MARIA gives him a slap. SALVATORE holds back the sobs, but
	his eyes brim with tears. ALFREDO and the USHER are nearby,
	have heard everything.
	
				MARIA  
		What'd you do with the money? Go to 
		the movies?
	
	SALVATORE nods his head and the sobs increase. MARIA, in
	despair, flies off the handle, slaps him again, but looks as if she
	doesn't really want to, as if deep down she forgives her son's
	escapade. ALFREDO catches on, speaks up on behalf of
	SALVATORE.
	
				ALFREDO  
		Signora Maria, don't do that. He's 
		just a kid. 
			(To SALVATORE) 
		And why are you telling fibs? 
			(To MARIA) 
		We let him in free. He must have lost 
		the money inside the movie
		theatre...
			(SALVATORE stares at him 
			in amazement, goes on 
			listening to him.)
		How much did you have?
	
				SALVATORE  
		Fifty lire...
			(MARIA wipes away his tears.)
	
				ALFREDO  
			(To the USHER) 
		What you find tonight on the floor 
		between the seats?
			(The USHER reaches into-
			his pockets, pulls out 
			some odds and ends.)
	
				USHER  
		A comb, two heel-savers, a box of 
		tobacco...
			(ALFREDO very skillfully 
			reaches out with fifty 
			lire he has taken
			from his pocket. And like 
			a magician he draws the 
			money out of
			the USHER'S hand.)
	
				ALFREDO 
		...and fifty lire! 
			(To MARIA) 
		See?
			(He hands over the money 
			under the USHER'S 
			astonished eyes.)
	
				MARIA  
		Thanks, Uncle Alfredo. Thanks. Good-
		night.
	
	She walks away, dragging SALVATORE by the hand. ALFREDO
	gives him a wink. SALVATORE smiles and winks back, but he's
	not very good at it; he can't manage to shut only one eye.
	Everybody leaves and the square empties, as the VILLAGE IDIOT
	comes up to the group of labourers, beside DON VINCENZO,
	motioning them all to get moving.
	
				IDIOT  
		It's midnight. I've got to shut down 
		the square! Go away.
		The square's mine! The square's 
		mine!!
	
	13  CEMETERY ROAD AND VILLAGE ROAD. EXT. DAY
	
	SALVATORE, dressed as an altar boy, walks alongside the PRIEST
	who is wearing the ceremonial vestments. They are tired, have walked
	a long way. Behind them a donkey pulls a wagon containing a little
	white coffin and a bunch of flowers. Behind that a little procession  the
	parents and relatives of the dead child. The road is very wide, covered
	with white earth. The spring sun is dazzling. The funeral procession
	kicks up a cloud of dust that makes everything blurred and hazy, like a
	dream, rimmed around the horizon by the blue line of the sea. The
	procession now turns into the large gate of the cemetery. ALFREDO,
	working in the fields, takes his hat off and watches the coffin as it passes by.
	
						Cut to:
	
	The funeral is over. The PRIEST and SALVATORE are walking back
	to the village. ALFREDO appears out of the countryside on e bicycle
	with a hoe and other farm tools in the basket. He comes pedaling up
	beside them.
	
				ALFREDO  
		Good morning, father. It's hard on 
		the feet, huh?
	
				PRIEST  
			(Breathless) 
		Yeah!...Getting there's downhill and 
		all the saints help you. But coming 
		back! The saints stand there watching 
		you, that's all! God's will be done.
	
	SALVATORE is about to open his mouth, wants to say something
	to ALFREDO, but he doesn't have time. ALFREDO pedals harder
	and rides off.
	
	SALVATORE is crestfallen. He looks et the PRIEST, then at the bicycle riding 
	away. His eyes light up  an idea! He suddenly yells:
	
				SALVATORE  
		Ouch! Ouch! My foot! I can't walk!
	
	He limps. Throws himself to the ground as if a snake had bitten him. The PRIEST 
	leans over in alarm. Up ahead in the distance, ALFREDO turns around to look.
	
						Cut to:
	
	There is a smile on SALVATORE'S face. He is riding on the crossbar of ALFREDO's 
	bicycle. On their way back lo the village.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo, did you know my father?
	
				ALFREDO  
		Of course I knew your father. He was 
		tall, thin, pleasant, and had a 
		moustache like mine. Always smiling. 
		He looked like Clark Gable. 
	
	There's something SALVATORE wants to talk about, but he doesn't know how to 
	start. He has a try with an innocent stratagem.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo, now that I'm older, I'm not 
		saying I can start coming to the 
		projection booth, to the movie 
		house...But...maybe, why don't we 
		become friends? 
	
	ALFREDO knows exactly what the little rascal is up to, and answers in a 
	strange, theatrical tone, as if he were repeating something he knows by heart, a 
	remark taken from some old film.
	
				ALFREDO  
			'I choose my friends for their 
		looks, and my enemies for their 
		brains...' 
			(Laughs) 
		You're too smart to be my friend. 
		Besides, as I always tell my kids, be 
		careful to pick the right friends!
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Surprised) 
		But you don't have any kids!!!
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Spluttering) 
		All right, all right! When I've got 
		kids that's what I'm telling them! 
			(The outlying houses of 
			Giancaldo finally heave 
			into sight.)
	
	14  SALVATORE S HOUSE. EXT. DAY
	
	LIA, SALVATORE'S kid sister, is crying outside the front door, terror
	stricken. Her face is smeared with smoke and her little dress half
	scorched and soaking wet. MARIA is distraught, damp with sweat, and
	tries to console her, hugging her in her arms.
	
				MARIA  
		Stop crying...The fire is out...I'm 
		here...That'll do, that'll do...
			(ALFREDO and SALVATORE 
			come up behind them. 
			SALVATORE has barely leapt 
			off the bicycle when his 
			mother sails into him like 
			a fury, shrieking:)
		Miserable boy! You're the ruin of me! 
		Your sister would have been burnt 
		alive if I hadn't been there! And all 
		your fault!
	
	SALVATORE darts off, chased by his mother, swift as a deer.
	ALFREDO doesn't understand what has happened, leans over
	LIA, who goes on bawling her eyes out, and sees on the ground, in
	the middle of the water, a flowery box all charred and still
	smoking, and all around scraps of film reduced to ashes and
	several singed photographs, the photos of SALVATORE s father.
	ALFREDO gets the message now, looks up at MARIA, who has
	caught SALVATORE and is dragging him home, hitting and
	slapping him all the way. SALVATORE covers his head with his
	hands to stave off the blows. MARIA turns to ALFREDO, in a
	stern, indignant voice.
	
				MARIA
		But aren't you ashamed of yourself, 
		Uncle Alfredo, playing with a little 
		boy at your age?!
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Cowed) 
		But...what's it got to do with 
		me?...
	
				MARIA  
		And who gave him all those films? 
		Promise you won't give him any more 
		of this trash! Don't let him set foot 
		any more in the movie house. The 
		boy's crazy! Crazy! All he talks 
		about is movies and Alfredo' Alfredo 
		and movies!! 
	
	ALFREDO is crestfallen, didn't think that SALVATORE'S craziness, his morbid 
	passion for movies, could go this far.
	
				ALFREDO  
		I give you my word, Donna Maria. 
			(MARIA now turns one last 
			time to her son.)
	
				MARIA  
		God's got to grant me one wish! Send 
		your father back home! And he'll see 
		you get what's coming to you! 
			(SALVATORE lowers his 
			hands, looks at her and 
			with the dreadful 
			sincerity of children:)
	
				SALVATORE  
		Daddy's not coming back...He's dead. 
			(An icy flash runs through 
			MARIA'S eyes.)
	
				MARIA  
		It's not true! No! It's not true!!! 
		I'll show you he's coming back!
	
	And she beats him desperately, as if to enforce her stubborn hope, slap after 
	slap. This time ALFREDO doesn't step in, lets MARIA give vent 
	to her rage and fury, but SALVATORE'S cries make him feel guilty.
	
	15:SQUARE AND PROJECTION BOOTH. EXT/INT. DAY 
	
	Another Sunday. A crowd of men has gathered in the square around the café where 
	there is a loudspeaker. They are listening to the running commentary of the 
	soccer games. They check their Sisal pools coupons. NICOLO CAROSIO'S VOICE 
	...We're at the seventh minute of the second half. Turin is leading one to 
	zero. The goal was scored by...(The scene is seen from above, by ALFREDO who 
	peers out of the window of the projection booth. CAROSIO'S voice drowns out the 
	soundtrack of the film being shown. ALFREDO is bored. He goes over to the 
	projector, looks through the hole...It's the last sequence of the film. The 
	music swells to a climax as 'THE END' appears on the screen. Swift as ever, 
	ALFREDO turns on the lights in the theatre' stops the projector. Looks back 
	through the hole, to see...)
	
	16:CINEMA PARADISO. INT/EXT. DAY
	
	...the house packed to the rafters. Voices and laughter of the children. Smoke, 
	ice-cream, soft drinks. The USHER has opened the emergency exits to let in air. 
	He fights off the gate-crashers who are trying to get in free. The sound of the 
	sports commentary fills the theatre. The village BLACKSMITH is sleeping in his 
	seat, his head thrown back and his mouth wide open. The KIDS blow up the empty 
	ice-cream sacks and pop them next to his ears. Bang! The BLACKSMITH wakes up 
	with a start, in a sea of laughter. He yells:  
	
				BLACKSMITH  
		Ah! I'll wring all your necks!! Or my 
		good name means nothing! !! Lousy 
		brats! 
	
	SALVATORE doesn't laugh. He is sad. He turns and looks up at the projection 
	booth. He sees ALFREDO through the lion's mouth. ALFREDO also catches sight of 
	him. SALVATORE gives him a timid wave of the hand, as if asking if he can come 
	up a moment. The look on ALFREDO'S face is unmistakable, irrevocable: N0! 
	SALVATORE'S not surprised; after what happened it won't be easy to win him over. 
	Yet there must be some way. But what is it? As usual, SALVATORE is smart as the 
	devil when he's out to get something. Through the emergency exit he sees a woman 
	pass by with a packet in her hand. It is ALFREDO's WIFE, and the packet is his 
	supper. SALVATORE leaps to his feet and runs out to her.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Signora Anna!
	
	17  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION ROOM AND SQUARE. INT/EXT. DAY
	
	ALFREDO starts up the projector. It's time for the documentaries and
	cartoons. SALVATORE peers in from the top of the stairs. He's scared of
	ALFREDO'S reaction, but pricks up his courage and shows him the
	packet. ALFREDO sees him, is about to pounce on him...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(On the defensive) 
		Your wife told me to bring you this. 
	
	His expression betrays the 'put on'. ALFREDO sighs, realizes it's another one of 
	his little games.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Sternly) 
		Give it to me!...
	
	He takes the packet, unwraps it and lifts the lid, shuts it again and puts the 
	container inside the lamp of the projector to keep it warm. SALVATORE hasn't 
	missed a single gesture, but speaks with his eyes 
	to the poor.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I told my mother you weren't the one 
		who gave me the films. That it 
		wasn't your fault. But I thought you 
		said the film could catch fire just 
		to scare me. Now that I know, I won't 
		steal any more from you. That's all I 
		wanted to say. I'm going. 
			(He turns to leave but 
			ALFREDO takes him by the 
			shoulder and stops 
			him.)
	
				ALFREDO  
		Toto, come here. 
	
	All things considered, there is something in that little boy, maybe his 
	feverish passion, that strikes him. He'll talk to him seriously, without 
	resorting to terrorism, try to convince him. He lowers the volume of the 
	monitor, sits down on the stool. SALVATORE raises his eyes from the floor and 
	looks at him at last...
	
				ALFREDO  
		Now listen to what I've got to say. I 
		took up this profession when I 
		was ten years old. In those days 
		there weren't these modern machines. 
		The films were silent. The projectors 
		were run by hand, like this, with a 
		crank. And you wound the crank all 
		day long. It was really rough going! 
		If you got tired and slowed down' 
		boom! Everything would go up in 
		flames!
	
				SALVATORE  
		Then why don't you want to teach it 
		to me too? Now that there's no more 
		cranking, and it's easier?
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Firmly) 
		Because I don't want to, Toto! This 
		is not a job for you. It's like being 
		a slave. You're always alone. You see 
		the same film over and over again, 
		because you have nothing else to do. 
		And you start talking to Greta Garbo 
		and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work 
		on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. 
		Only on Good Friday are you free. But 
		if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a 
		cross...You'd work Good Fridays too! 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Then why don't you change jobs? 
			(ALFREDO sighs, irritated. 
			He reaches out to turn the 
			knob of the carbon rods. 
			He gazes at SALVATORE as 
			if he were a grown-up, 
			somebody who's making 
			things hard for him.)
	
				ALFREDO  
		Because I'm an idiot. How many other 
		guys in town know how to be a 
		projectionist? None! Only a jerk like 
		me could do it. Besides I wasn't 
		lucky. When I was a kid there was the 
		war! When I grew up, another war! Now 
		it's all different. Times have 
		changed. And you want to be a dope 
		like me? Huh? Answer me!
	
				SALVATORE  
		No...
	
				ALFREDO  
		Good for you, Toto. Good for you...
		I'm only saying this for your own 
		good...
			(He gets up and, speaking 
			all the while, goes into a 
			closet with a bucket 
			in it, the toilet of the 
			booth. He turns his back 
			and pees. )
		Cooped up in here you die of heat in 
		the summer and of cold in the winter. 
		You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and 
		earn practically nothing. 
			(SALVATORE listens to 
			him, but taking advantage 
			of the fact he can't be 
			seen, he turns the knob of 
			the carbon rods, just as 
			he had seen done a moment 
			before...)
	
				SALVATORE  
			(In a loud voice) 
		But don't you like anything about 
		what you do? 
			(SALVATORE gazes at the 
			photos on the wall: 
			Keaton, Garbo, Snow 
			White. ALFREDO 
			smiles to himself. Sure, 
			there's something about 
			that damn job he likes:)
	
				ALFREDO  
		With time...you get used to it. 
		Besides, when you hear from up here 
		that there's a full house and that 
		people are laughing, having fun...
		Then you're happy too.
			(ALFREDO is lost in 
			thought, doesn't notice 
			that the documentaries
			and cartoons have 
			finished. The screen is 
			blank. And down in the
			theatre laughter is not 
			heard but an uproar of 
			whistling and
			swearing. SALVATORE'S eyes 
			sparkle, he seizes the 
			opportunity.
			He turns on the lights and 
			stops the projector, just 
			as ALFREDO
			would have done. At which 
			ALFREDO buttons up his 
			pants in a
			hurry and rushes over 
			alarmed, but sees that 
			everything is in order.
			SALVATORE looks at him all 
			smiles, as if he expected 
			a medal for
			civil bravery. Instead, 
			ALFREDO reacts like a wild 
			animal.)
		So I've been wasting my breath? You 
		pretend to agree with
		me, but as soon as my back is turned, 
		you do what you want!
			(He gives SALVATORE a kick 
			in the ass, shrieking:)
		Get out of here! I don't want to lay 
		eyes on you again! This is
		the last straw! Your mother's right, 
		you're crazy!!
			(He pushes him towards the 
			stairs. SALVATORE suddenly
			vanishes, scared out of 
			his wits. ALFREDO talks to 
			himself, in a
			fury:)
		But how'd he do it? The little 
		bastard! By watching, he's
		learned! It's incredible!
			(He peers out of the 
			window, yelling, as he 
			sees SALVATORE
			running through the 
			square. )
		I'm letting the box office know  
		you're not to set foot even into
		the theatre! There are no more 
		tickets for you! And I'm also
		talking to Father Adelfio! You won't 
		be an altar boy any more
		either!!! You little runt!
			(SALVATORE looks at him. 
			Hates him. Yells something 
			offensive:)
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! 
			(But his words are drowned 
			out by the sudden shouting 
			of the people outside the 
			café.)
	
				CROWD  
		Goal!! Holy Mother of God!!! 
			(A MAN in the crowd 
			crumples to the ground. 
			The others swarm around 
			him, alarmed. They hold up 
			his head. His face is 
			pale. They check the 
			coupon he is clutching in 
			his hand. A voice rises 
			like a siren from the 
			crowd.)
	
				MAN  
		Ciccio Spaccafico's won the 
		Sisal!!!!!
			(The yell can be heard...)
	
	I8  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. DAY
	
	...inside the movie house. The audience murmurs. Somebody opens
	an emergency exit...
	
				SPECTATOR'S VOICE  
		The Neapolitan's won the lottery!!! 
		Let's go see, kids!!! Northerners are 
		always lucky!
			(The whole audience leaps 
			up and heads for the exit. 
			Pushing. Shouting. 
			Laughing and Joking. )
	
	19  SQUARE AND VILLAGE. EXT. MORNING 
	
	Summer has come. The village has a different look. The peddlers sing their 
	monotonous refrains in the village streets. In one street, women are busy 
	canning tomatoes. In one corner of the square, the SHEARER has finished clipping 
	the donkey and is now shaving the hair of a row of bare-chested URCHINS with 
	nothing on but their underwear. Then another MAN disinfects them by spraying 
	them with the hand pumps used to spray trees in the country. The URCHINS 
	laugh. The BILL-POSTER is hanging up the posters of a new film, 'TODAY AT CINEMA
	PARADISO .
	
	20  GRADE SCHOOL DINING HALL. INT. MORNING 
	
	The fifth-grade exams. In the vast dining hall all the children are seated, one 
	for each desk, under the watchful eyes of the teachers. SALVATORE, BOCCIA, 
	PEPPINO, MASINO and COLA have taken places here and there, as nervous as 
	everybody else. The EXAMINING BOARD MEMBER is dictating the text of the 
	arithmetic problem. 
	
				EXAMINING BOARD MEMBER  
		A merchant owns two stores. In the 
		first he sells fruit and vegetables. 
		In the second he sells nails and 
		cement...
			(The PRINCIPAL comes in, 
			interrupts the dictation.) 
	
				PRINCIPAL  
		Excuse me, professor. Here are the 
		men taking the exam for the 
		elementary school certificate. 
			(Turning to the door) 
		Come in, please...
			(All the children turn to 
			look. A MAN around thirty 
			enters, ill at ease. The 
			children recognize him and 
			laugh mischievously. The 
			second is the BLACKSMITH, 
			the one who falls asleep 
			at the movies. The third 
			is a twenty-year-old-boy, 
			ANGELO. The fourth is 
			ALFREDO, embarrassed and 
			red in the face. SALVATORE 
			is speechless. Gives a 
			slightly ironic laugh. 
			There is a look of revenge 
			in his shrewd little 
			eyes.)
	
						Cut to:
	
	The assignment is now being carried out. There is dead silence in the 
	hall. 
	
	TEACHERS and the PRINCIPAL moue about, checking to be sure there are no notes 
	being handed around or other forms of 'collaboration'. The four outsiders are 
	having a hard time. It can be seen on their faces. ALFREDO is also in trouble, 
	doesn't know how to solve the problem, the calculations are too diff cult. He 
	looks at the desk next to him, where SALVATORE is sitting. SALVATORE is about to 
	look up at him, but ALFREDO immediately looks away, too proud to let himself be 
	seen. 
	
	The exchange of glances continues, grotesque, almost comical. SALVATORE 
	meanwhile writes down numbers and operations quite quickly. ALFREDO can't stand 
	it any longer, is nervous, beaded with sweat. He's sorry he ever showed up. 
	SALVATORE laughs up his sleeve, now he has the upper hand. ALFREDO tries 
	sneaking a look at his exercise book in order to copy something. But SALVATORE 
	turns his back, hiding it from sight. ALFREDO tries sneaking a look at somebody 
	else's exercise book, but the damn kid also covers it. It looks like a 
	conspiracy against him. ALFREDO has no way out. He has to accept the idea of 
	eating humble pie. He looks at SALVATORE, motions him with his eyes in a 
	conversation of glances. He asks for help, but SALVATORE stands firm, 
	implacable. 
	
	ALFREDO tries to put it into words in a low voice.
	
				ALFREDO 
		YOU jerk. Tell me how to solve this 
		fucking problem! 
	
				TEACHER  
		Ssssh! Silence back there!! 
	
	ALFREDO insists with his eyes. SALVATORE makes him understand with gestures 
	that he could help him maybe, but...on one condition. He imitates the gesture 
	of winding the crank of the projector. ALFREDO gets the message. It's pure 
	blackmail. He rubs his hand over his sweating face, raises his eyes to the 
	ceiling as if he were swearing. Then he surrenders, accepts the condition. 
	SALVATORE is serious, does not flaunt his victory, but you can tell he is happy. 
	He takes out a sheet of paper he had already prepared, with the solution to the 
	problem, rolls it up into a tiny ball and as soon as the TEACHER passes by, 
	takes aim and flicks it to him. ALFREDO'S hand catches the precious and dearly 
	bought message in mid-air. Their quarrel is over.
	
	2I  VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT. DAY/EVENING
	
	A bright, lilting tune marks the rhythm of the quick, blurred images, as
	in a dance, the images of ALFREDO teaching SALVATORE all the
	secrets of the projectionist trade.
	
	ALFREDO slips the reel on to the projector, unrolls the trailer and hands
	it to SALVATORE. SALVATORE mounts the film on the sprockets.
	Now SALVATORE sets the projector into motion, opens the shutter and
	stands on tip-toe to see the screen from the hole...
	
	A shot from In nome della legge. The main-floor audience applauds a
	line spoken by Massimo Gironi. And from the balcony, the same little
	MAN with the face of a public notary spits below.
	
				MAIN FLOOR VOICE  
		Bastard!! Pencil-pusher!!
	
	ALFREDO shows SALVATORE the running of the film. He points
	to a place on the projector.
	
				ALFREDO  
		Pay attention. This is where it can 
		easily catch fire. If it
		happens, the first thing you've got 
		to do is break it off, here
		and here, so the whole reel doesn't 
		go up in fames.
	
	On the screen, a shot from Riso amaro. A kiss. Unrelenting, the PRIEST rings his 
	bell. SALVATORE licks the film on one side, then on the other. He laughs.
	
				ALFREDO 
		You understand which side the 
		gelatin's on?
	
				SALVATORE  
		It tastes wonderful!
	
	A shot of Amedeo Nazzari in La figlia del capitano. A jump,
	an out-of-rack frame. The audience whistles.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		Fraaaame!! Wake up, Alfredo!
			(SALVATORE tries to do a 
			hand-binding. ALFREDO 
			winds the film, hangs a 
			slip on a nail in the 
			wall.)
	
				ALFREDO  
		These are the shipping invoices for 
		the film. They are always to be kept. 
		You see?
	
				SALVATORE  
		OK, Alfredo.
	
	Down on the main floor, a scene from Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.
	Everyone screams and hides their faces when Hyde looks at the
	camera.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		Holy Mother! What a face! So ugly!
	
	One young man, ANGELO, doesn't hide his face. He looks up at
	a young woman, ROSA, in the balcony, who turns and smiles at
	him.
	
	ALFREDO gives SALVATORE a wooden stool. He's had it made especially for him, so 
	he can be high enough to reach the reels of the projector and the arc lamp. 
	SALVATORE climbs up on it. He laughs, all excited. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		Now you can run it by yourself. 
	
	SALVATORE gives another smile. He is posing in a photographer's studio . He is 
	all dressed up for first communion, holding a white lily. The flash goes off 
	like lightning during a storm. Now SALVATORE is posing next to his mother and 
	little sister. They smile without hugging. Another flash of light. Click!
	
	22  FIFTH GRADE. INT. DAY
	
	Another click. The transparency of Rita Hayworth in her black gown
	from Gilda. MASINO is pasting it inside a minute pair of plastic field
	glasses. Other pupils crowd around him in excitement.
	
				MASINO  
			(In a whisper) 
		Christ, what a piece of ass!!!
	
	But there is not a cheerful atmosphere in the class - on the
	contrary, a strange silence. The pupils are all standing around the
	teacher's desk, having received their end-of-the-year report cards.
	PEPPINO, who shared SALVATORE s desk, is saying goodbye to
	his schoolmates. BOCCIA, COLA, the others. They have serious,
	sad expressions. He and SALVATORE kiss like grown-ups. The
	TEACHER is standing among them. One of the schoolmates does
	not respond lo PEPPINO's goodbye gesture. He takes a few steps
	back, serious, scared, his eyes lowered.
	
				TEACHER  
		Di Francesco, aren't you saying 
		goodbye to your schoolmate?
			(DI FRANCESCO gives his 
			head a little shake. The 
			TEACHER leans over to 
			him.)
		But why?
			(DI FRANCESCO whispers, 
			almost into her ear.)
	
				DI FRANCESCO  
		My father says he's a Communist...
	
	23  SQUARE AND PROJECTION BOOTH, CINEMA PARADISO. EXT/INT. DAY 
	
	Another farewell scene in the square. PEPPINO to his grandparents. His father 
	and mother are also there, saying goodbye to the old folks. There are tears. The 
	cardboard suitcases tied with string are loaded on to the luggage rack of the 
	black car. The scene is watched by SALVATORE and ALFREDO, up in the window of 
	the projection booth. They look like old friends. On the sound monitor, the 
	strains of some American musical comedy tune. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Will they really find work in 
		Germany? 
	
				ALFREDO  
		Who knows?...It's like an adventure. 
			(In a theatrical voice) 
		Hope springs eternal...
			(PEPPINO from the distance 
			gives one last wave at the 
			window of the 
			projection booth. 
			SALVATORE waves back.) 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Peppinoooo! Come back sooon!! 
			(The black car drives off, 
			leaving a cloud of dust 
			that envelops the 
			suppressed sobs of the 
			grandparents standing 
			there waving 	
			handkerchiefs. SALVATORE 
			watches the car drive off. 
			He mumbles:) 
		Good thing Germany's closer than 
		Russia. 
	
	ALFREDO rubs his hand through his hair.
	
	24  CINEMA PARADISO. BALCONY AND BOOTH. INT. EVENING
	
	The lion's head with the beam of light, seen from the balcony.
	SALVATORE'S face appears in the hole beside it, as he peers down at the
	images of the Settimana Incom newsreel.
	The audience is distracted. The snoring of a man sleeping can be heard.
	A pair of urchins pick up a cockroach with their hands, tip-toe down the
	aisle. The sleeping man is the same old BLACKSMITH, with his head
	thrown back. A little hand drops the cockroach into the gaping mouth.
	The URCHINS take to their heels. The BLACKSMITH squirms, wake up
	with a start. Spits, while everybody laughs. The newsreel is now about
	missing soldiers in Russia.
	
				COMMENTATOR  
		The Defense Minister has announced a 
		new listof names of Italian soldiers, 
		so far considered missing and now
		confirmed as dead. Families concerned 
		will be notified directly by military 
		authorities.
	
	SALVATORE pays careful attention, sees the black-and-white
	shots of the last war. The Russian campaign. The troops in the
	snow. Now in detail a heap of personal objects found on the
	corpses. Documents, clothing, glasses, photographs. One quick
	detail catches SALVATORE's eye  among those photographs, for one
	instant he sees one he thinks he recognizes. He quickly sticks a slip of paper 
	into the take-up reel, as when marking the kisses to be cut.
	
	25  PREFECTURE. CITY. INT. DAY
	
	The hands of an OFFICIAL tear off several forms and give them to
	MARIA who is sitting in front of the desk. She is dressed in black.
	SALVATORE stands beside her, holding her hand. They have black
	bands on their arms. An empty stare in their eyes.
	MARIA is pale, a cold look in her sunken eyes. Her heart is bursting in
	her breast. And a lump in her throat prevents her from speaking. She
	looks at her husband's belongings, identifies them  a gold chain, an ID
	card and the photograph, the one SALVATORE saw in the newsreel.
	MARIA strokes it with her fingers. SALVATORE comes up and looks, as
	the OFFICIAL concludes:
	
				OFFICIAL 
		...Unfortunately we don't know what 
		war cemetery he's buried in...This 
		is the form for the pension. If you'd 
		like to sign it...
	
	26  PREFECTURE AND CITY STREET. EXT. DAY 
	
	MARIA walks through the city. She holds SALVATORE by the hand. SALVATORE looks 
	up, trying to catch her eye. He sees her crying, in silence. The heartbroken 
	tears of someone who has lost the one last hope, but held back, so as not to be 
	seen by the child. SALVATORE presses close and puts his arm around her waist. 
	They turn the corner, and walk off in the noisy city, disfigured by the ruins of 
	war. A poster for Gone with the Wind catches SALVATORE's eye. He smiles.
	
	27  CINEMA PARADISO. BOX OFFICE. PROJECTION BOOTH. SQUARE. INT/EXT. EVENING 
	
	Winter has returned. On the screen, a sequence from I pompieri di Viggiu. The 
	theatre is jam full. The sea of heads sways and shakes at the irresistible jokes 
	of Toto. 
	
	Some people have climbed up on the window-sills. The aisles are crammed, an the 
	way down to the screen, where grown-ups and children sit on the floor, their 
	noses in the air. Some people munch crusts of bread they've brought along from 
	home. Almost everybody is smoking. A woman laughs, holding the baby she is 
	nursing. In one corner, at the end of one of the aisles jammed with people 
	standing, a girl laughs, but every now and then her expression reveals a look of 
	deep pleasure. 
	
	Her body moves slightly. Clinging to her from the rear is a man bathed in sweat. 
	
	They are making love standing there among the crowd, which notices nothing and 
	goes on laughing.
	
	In the balcony ANGELO is holding hands with ROSA.
	The curtain over the entrance is open. People are also standing there,
	seeing what they can from the distance, even a corner of the screen
	through the forest of heads. But the line continues on outside...All the
	way to the entrance of the movie house, out in the square. There are
	crowds of people, shivering from the cold, who protest, shove, risk
	provoking incidents. The PRIEST, Father Adelfio, is exhausted, tries to
	calm them down.
	
				PRIEST  
		Don't shove! There's no room! For 
		heaven's sake! I can't
		give another showing, it's late!
	
				VOICES IN CROWD  
		Father Adelfio, we've been here for 
		an hour! There are people inside 
		who've seen it twice! ! ! Move on!!
		Ouch!! My foot!!!
	
	It has just stopped raining, the bell-tower rings eleven o'clock. On
	the poster of the film a ' LAST DAY' sticker. The PRIEST, the
	TICKET-SELLER, the USHER and TWO CARABINIERES push the crowd back, close the 
	front door. The protest grows louder. Fists pound the door.
	
				CROWD  
		Open up!!! Father Adelfio!!
			(The audience in the 
			theatre hears the uproar. 
			Reacts:)
	
				AUDIENCE  
		Ssssh! Sssssh! Be quiet out there!! 
		What the hell!
			(From the window of the 
			projection booth, ALFREDO 
			and SALVATORE look at the 
			crowd down below, yelling 
			and complaining. Some of 
			the people look up at 
			them. )
	
				VOICES IN CROWD  
		Alfredooo! We want to get in!...
		Tomorrow you're taking it off!
			(ALFREDO spreads his arms 
			out as if to say there s 
			nothing he can do.)
	
				SALVATORE  
		Why can't we show the same film 
		tomorrow?
	
				ALFREDO  
		It's got to be sent to another town. 
		And if we don't the owner of that 
		movie house gets pissed off.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Too bad!
	
	The crowd sways nervously. The CARABINIERES give order.
	
				CARABINIERES  
			(Exasperated) 
		Stop! Go home, all of you! Otherwise 
		somebody's going to end up in jail!' 
		That's enough!
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Dramatically) 
		'Joe! A mob doesn't think, doesn't 
		know what it's doing...'
			(SALVATORE gives him a 
			curious, inquisitive look. 
			ALFREDO smiles.)
		Spencer Tracy said it in Fury. 
			(Mischievously) 
		What'd you say if we let these poor 
		devils see the film, Toto? 
			(SALVATORE stares at him 
			in amazement, all 
			excited.) 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Wonderful! But how can it be done? 
	
	ALFREDO turns away from the window. He gives a smirk, imitates the tough 
	American movie stars.
	
				ALFREDO  
		You don't believe my words, but 
		you'll have to believe your own 
		eyes!...And now get your ass off 
		that damn stool, boy! 
	
	SALVATORE laughs, eagerly, as if he were about to see a whole new movie. He 
	climbs off the stool. Both of them move towards the projector...
	
	28  PROJECTION BOOTH AND SQUARE. INT/EXT. EVENING
	
	Trying not to put his hand in front of the lens, ALFREDO removes the
	frame with the glass that protects the projection. He wheels it around
	and motions SALVATORE to look...On the wall behind the projector:
	the film picture appears gradually, reflected by the glass, moves as the
	glass moves all the way over to the window looking out over the square.
	There it disappears. SALVATORE can barely believe his eyes, as if it
	were a piece of magic. He takes a quick look through the hole to see if
	the film is still showing on the screen. It is.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Mysteriously) 
		Go to the window, boy, and have a 
		look...
	
	SALVATORE goes over to the window. Looks out. The reflected
	beam of light ends up on the white row of houses facing the
	square. It's like another screen. Except the images are
	backwards, like when you look in a mirror. And here and there
	are the windows of the houses...For SALVATORE, it's a
	wonderful spectacle, like a dream, ravishing.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo, it's beautiful.
			(A voice is heard in the 
			crowd of people jammed 
			around the entrance to the 
			movie house.)
	
				VOICE IN CROWD  
			(Shouting) 
		Hey, look there!! The movie!!
			(All heeds turn to look at 
			the house behind them.)
	
				CROWD  
		Oh, praise the Lord!! It's true! 
		Look! The movie!! There's Toto!! 
		Hurry! Hurry!...THANKS, ALFRED0000!!
	
	And everybody runs over to the other side of the square, in front
	of the strange new screen. ALFREDO and SALVATORE watch with glittering eyes. 
	SALVATORE lays his hand on the shoulder of his great pal.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Good for you, Alfredo! 
	
	A close-up of Toto projected on the houses, and one of the windows opens. A MAN 
	appears, in his pajamas. Dazzled by the light, he shades his eyes with his hand. 
	He sees all those people looking at him and laughing together.
	
				CROWD  
		Shut the window!! Shut the window! Go 
		to bed!! 
	
	The MAN is dazed. Doesn't now what's going on. Looks around, and sees the 
	black-and-white figures of the film dancing around him. He pops back inside, 
	slams the window shut, almost cared.
	
				VOICES IN CROWD  
			(To ALFREDO) 
		Sound!!! Sound!! Alfredooooo!!
	
				ALFREDO  
		What do you say, should we make them 
		happy?
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Smiling) 
		Sure, sure! 
	
	ALFREDO takes the loudspeaker of the monitor, rings it over to the window, 
	turns it around towards the square. He turns up he volume and the sound-track 
	fills the square. A chorus of approval.
	
				CROWD  
		Aaaaaaaa! At last!
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Looking at SALVATORE) 
		Do you want to go down there? 
			(SALVATORE gives a 
			contented nod.) 
		Go on. 
	
	SALVATORE runs on. ALFREDO looks wistfully towards the huge image in the 
	square. Down in the square SALVATORE heads for the crowd, his eyes trained on 
	the house-front screen. Behind him, the door of the movie house opens. The 
	PRIEST, Father Adelfio, sees the film being projected on the house front, 
	the people standing or sitting on the ground, laughing. His eyes nearly pop out 
	of his head. Then he motions over the TICKET-SELLER, whispers something into his 
	ear. The TICKET-SELLER strides over to the shivering spectators, pulls the pad 
	of tickets out of his pocket.
	
				TICKET-SELLER  
		Ladies and gentlemen! You have to buy 
		tickets! Reduced rate! 
	
	An irresistible chorus of Bronx cheers washes over him. SALVATORE looks around, 
	highly amused.
	
				CROWD  
		Fuck off!! The square belongs to 
		everybody! 
			(The VILLAGE IDIOT peers 
			Out Of the crowd, all 
			worked up.) 
	
				VILLAGE IDIOT  
		No!!! The square's mine!!! Come on, 
		kids, no joking around here!!! 
		Otherwise...
	
	The crowd roars with laughter. SALVATORE laughs too, as if carried away by it 
	all. And over the general merriment looms the shadow of ALFREDO, standing in the 
	window of the projection booth. All at once, on the house-front screen, the 
	image of Toto slows down for an instant, a white blister appears and spreads 
	until it fills the whole screen. The crowd gives a start of bewilderment and 
	fear. SALVATORE jerks his head around to look at the booth.
	
	29  PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY 
	
	The film bursts violently into flame among the gears and sprockets of the 
	projector. ALFREDO is taken off-guard. He breaks the film running into the take-
	up reel, but is unable to do it for the delivery reel. He grabs the film which 
	is catching fire and pulls it out quickly, tries to stop the flames from 
	reaching the reel in the f reproof housing. A desperate race against the speed 
	of the fire. The flames on the floor burn his legs. ALFREDO gives a jump, slows 
	down the movement of his hands for an instant and inevitably the flames run 
	ahead, reach the upper housing. It's like an explosion. The flames leap out, 
	striking him full in the face. ALFREDO doesn't have time to scream, struggles 
	desperately and falls to the floor. Meanwhile the flames envelop everything.
	
	30  SQUARE.EXT.EVENING 
	
	The flash of the flames flares up in the windows of the projection booth. 
	SALVATORE is appalled, elbows his way through the moving 
	crowd. Inside the movie house the murmuring of the audience can be heard, 
	growing louder and louder. A scream...
	
	3I:CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING 
	
	A violent spurt of flames leaps out of the mouth of the plaster lion's head, 
	into the darkness broken by the screams of people rushing for the exits.
	
	32  SQUARE AND CINEMA PARADISO ENTRANCE. EXT. EVENING 
	
	The crowd streaks out of the movie house, enveloped in a cloud of black smoke. 
	
				CROWD  
		Heeeelp! Run for your lives!!! 
	
	In the general panic, SALVATORE tries in vain to get inside, elbows his way 
	towards the street with the stairs leading to the projection booth. The audience 
	clashes against him, knocks him to the ground, almost trampling him underfoot. 
	He is suddenly seized by a superhuman force; gets up, claws his way desperately 
	ahead, with people falling on top of him and to the floor. He finally succeeds, 
	starts up the stairs...
	
	33  CINEMA PARADISO. STAIRS AND PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. EVENING 
	
	The place is filled with smoke. The air is suffocating. SALVATORE streaks up the 
	stairs, gasping for breath. The projection booth is enveloped inflames. 
	ALFREDO's body on the floor, burning. SALVATORE moves quickly, throws a blanket 
	over his shoulders, drags him by the feet over to the stairs, as boxes and other 
	objects fall on him. Using the same blanket, he stamps out the flames that have 
	seared ALFREDO'S clothes. With the force of desperation, he drags him further 
	down the stairs which have been reached by the smoke but not by the flames. 
	ALFREDO doesn't move, his face is burnt. SALVATORE looks at him and only now is 
	panic-stricken, lets out a terrified shriek, like a wounded colt. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo! Heeeelp! Help!!!
	
	34  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING 
	
	The plaster lion looks like a dragon spitting fire and smoke. The statue of the 
	Virgin Mary is also in flames. And the movie screen.
	
	35  SQUARE AND CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. EVENING 
	
	The fire has been put out. Nothing remains of the movie house but the skeleton. 
	Everything has gone up in smoke. 
	
	People stand around, dismayed. They gather around the PRIEST, who is at once 
	grieved and shocked, to express their solidarity and comfort. 
	
				VOICES  
		What a pity! Poor Alfredo! What a 
		terrible thing!! Cheer up, Father, is 
		there something we can do?'
	
				VILLAGE IDIOT  
			(Laughing) 
		Burnt up...Burnt up. 
	
				PRIEST  
		What'll we do now! The town will have 
		to get along without movies! Who's 
		got the money to rebuild it? 
	
	CICCIO SPACCAFICO, the man who won the Sisal pools, comes up, dressed in style. 
	He looks up at the charred cinema. It looks like a battlefield after an enemy 
	attack. From the smoke and ashes to...
	
	36  CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. EVENING
	
	...The great lighted sign of the CINEMA PARADISO . The movie house has been 
	rebuilt. New facade. New billboards. There are people 
	moving about the entrance. It is the evening of the inauguration...
	
	37  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING 
	
	The lobby is crowded with people, authorities, special guests. There is the 
	MAYOR, FATHER ADELFIO and the new owner, CICCIO SPACCAFICO, dressed to the 
	teeth. The MAYOR cuts the ribbon. Flashbulbs pop. Clapping. 
	
				GUESTS  
		Cheers' Congratulations, Don Ciccio! 
	
	The procession advances towards the stairs leading into the theatre. FATHER 
	ADELFIO, with a nostalgic sigh, blesses the lobby, then the corridor. Lastly, 
	the new auditorium, which resounds with toasts and cheers.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		To the Cinema Paradiso! 
	
	The PRIEST sprinkles the new seats, the walls, the screen with holy water...
	
	38  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. EVENING 
	
	Now FATHER ADELFIO is blessing the brand-new projection booth. He also blesses 
	the new projectionist: SALVATORE. He is very nervous, but serious, self-
	possessed. His worried-looking mother is also there for the occasion. The PRIEST 
	turns to SPACCAFICO. 
	
				PRIEST  
		How'd you solve his being under age? 
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		I took out a license as 
		projectionist, thanks to friends down 
		at the guild offices. But I don't 
		know a thing about it. Officially, I 
		do the job...
			(Smiling at Salvatore)
		...but Toto earns the money. 
	
				PRIEST  
		Fine. 
			(To SALVATORE) 
		Always be careful, my boy. Don't ever 
		go to sleep. Be sure another accident 
		doesn't happen. Do everything poor 
		Alfredo taught you. And may God bless 
		you. 
	
	SALVATORE nods his head seriously, assuming a responsible expression. His 
	mother kisses the PRIEST's hand.
	
				MARIA  
		Thanks, Father. Thanks. 
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		And now enough of this gloomy 
		atmosphere. Life goes on! I want to 
		see you happy and smiling!
	
	39  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING
	
	Laughter. The laughter of the large audience at the first showing of the
	inauguration film. Among the spectators, SALVATORE'S mother, MARIA, and his kid 
	sister, El A. Up on the screen, a man and a woman kiss. The first time a kiss 
	has been seen at the Cinema Paradiso. The audience murmurs, surprised and 
	excited.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		Ooooooh! They're kissing!! Look at 
		that!! Christ, that's news!!
	
	An OLD LADY sitting next to the MAYOR, crosses herself, flabbergasted. CICCIO 
	SPACCAFICO chuckles. Rubs his hands: these are going to be golden times for him. 
	FATHER ADELFIO gets up and stalks out of the theatre, indignant; he'll
	never set foot in the place again. The love theme gets louder and
	louder...
	
	40  PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. EVENING
	
	The same music spreads through the booth from the monitor. SALVATORE is by 
	himself. He is watching the film through the hole but strangely enough, the 
	story doesn't absorb him. ALFREDO'S absence makes him nervous, he gazes at the 
	stool he used to sit on. Il has been repainted. A voice from the rear of the 
	cabin:
	
				ANNA'S VOICE  
		Toto?...
	
	SALVATORE turns and at the top of the stairs sees SIGNORA
	ANNA and behind her, ALFREDO, her husband. He is wearing a
	pair of dark glasses and walks with the kelp of a cane. He has
	lost his sight, but not his spirit. He smiles:
	
				ALFREDO  
		Any room for me in this Cinema 
		Paradiso?
			(SALVATORE runs over and 
			embraces him.)
	
				SALVATORE  
		Come in, Alfredo.
	
				ANNA  
			(to SALVATORE) 
		Toto, will you bring him home when 
		you close down?
	
				SALVATORE  
		Yes. Signora Anna. 
			(To ALFREDO) 
		I'm glad you came.
	
						Cut to:
	
	ALFREDO is now sitting there immobile. He listens to the soundtrack of the film. 
	SALVATORE studies the way he stares into empty space, and the idea of darkness 
	frightens him. There is something new in ALFREDO'S manner, as if having grazed 
	death and the loss of his sight had endowed him with a deeper knowledge of men 
	and life.
	
				ALFREDO  
		How's school?
	
				SALVATORE  
		OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, 
		I'11 probably stop going...
	
				ALFREDO  
		Don't do that...Sooner or later 
		you'll be left empty-handed.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Why? What do you mean?
	
				ALFREDO  
		Toto, this isn't for you. For the 
		moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs 
		you, and you need the Cinema 
		Paradiso. But it won't last...Some 
		day you'll have other things 
		to do, more important things...
			(He reaches out and 
			touches SALVATORE'S face 
			to 'feel' his expression.)
		That's right, more important. I know 
		it. Now that I've lost my sight I see 
		more. 
		I see everything I didn't see 
		before...
			(As ALFREDO moves his hand 
			from SALVATORE's face, we 
			see that he is now a young 
			man, and that ALFREDO is 
			older, grayer.) 
		And it's all thanks to you, who saved 
		my life. And I'll never forget it...
			(SALVATORE doesn't 
			understand his strange 
			words. ALFREDO can 'feel' 
			he is troubled.)
		And don't put on that look. I haven't 
		gone off my head yet. You want proof?
	
	And he gives a joking smile. SALVATORE is curious, expects one of his fiendish 
	tricks.
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Smiling) 
		Yes. I want proof.
	
				ALFREDO  
		For example, at this moment the 
		film's out of focus. Go see. 
	
	SALVATORE stands up in disbelief. He looks through the hole, and indeed the film 
	is out of focus. He puts it back into focus, flabbergasted.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Smiling) 
		It's hard to explain, Toto...
	
	41  CAFE IN THE SQUARE. INT/EXT. MORNING
	
	As the BILL-POSTER attaches to the café door a poster of Catene - the
	coming attraction at the Cinema Paradiso - CICCIO SPACCAFICO is
	speaking on the phone in the phone booth. He is clearly peeved.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Only two days? Are you joking?!...
		What do I care if all the copies 
		are reserved?...Catene for only two 
		days in a place like this! Why, 
		people will eat me alive!...
			(Standing beside him 
			listening is SALVATORE. He 
			is carrying school 
			books under his ann. In 
			the café, several curious 
			ONLOOKERS laugh as through 
			the café window they watch 
			some unemployed PEASANT 
			MEN dancing together at 
			the club. SPACCAFICO 
			listens nervously, then 
			shrieks as if he were 
			about to eat the phone.)
		...I know, I know. But even if I 
		start showing at eight in the morning 
		it wouldn't be enough! This is a big 
		town now and you people at the 
		Titanus know it perfectly well! I'm 
		your sole agent and if I get pissed 
		off I'll write straight 
		to Lombardo, in Rome!! I'll give you 
		guys a good run-around!! If I get my 
		dander up, I can let fly, if my 
		name's Spaccafico!! 
	
						Cut to:  
	
	SPACCAFICO AND SALVATORE are now outside the café, head towards the square. In 
	front of the movie house, the CHARWOMAN is at work. SPACCAFICO is so nervous he 
	lights two cigarettes without noticing it. SALVATORE is turning something over 
	in his mind.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You 
		remember that old abandoned movie 
		house where they're supposed to build 
		those low-rent houses?
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		So what's that got to do with it?
	
				SALVATORE  
		The projector's all rusty, but I 
		could fix it in two or three days. 
		Give the place a good cleaning, put 
		in some seats and bring in a 
		projectionist and we'll show Catene 
		in two houses.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
			(Shrieking) 
		What the fuck you talking about? You 
		getting into the act too, Toto? 
		Titanus has trouble giving me even 
		one copy and I have to say thanks! If 
		I ask for two, the least they'll do 
		is cut off my head and play ball with 
		it! 
	
	A shrewd look glitters in SALVATORE s eyes. He smiles.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Who says we need two copies?
	
	42  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. DAY 
	
	The house is jammed with people. Almost bursting at the seams. The last scenes 
	of Catene move across the screen. Tears stream down the faces of the men and 
	women. The children are unusually silent. Even the BLACKSMITH is awake, indeed 
	whispers ahead of time all the lines of Nazzari and Yvonne Sanson, knows them by 
	heart. Among the crowd in the balcony there is ALFREDO and his wife, the MAYOR, 
	DON VINCENZO the landowner, the schoolteachers. Now the music is loud, heart-
	rending. 'THE END' appears on screen. The lights go on. And there is a great 
	din and uproar as one audience leaves and another arrives. The race for empty 
	seats. Quarrels. The CARABINIERES help the USHER maintain order and persuade the 
	people who want to see the film again to get up and leave. 
	
				USHER  
			(Exasperate]) 
		That's enough now! You've seen it ten

		Easy! Easy! Through the emergency

	43  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. 
	
	The end of the film slips through the sprockets. SALVATORE switches off the 
	motor. He is particularly fast in taking the reel out of the housing. And even 
	faster in dropping it into the sack BOCCIA is holding open for him. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Now get running and bring me the 
		first reel. Meanwhile I'll start 
		showing the news! 
	
				BOCCIA  
		OK, Toto!
	
	44  VILLAGE STREETS AND COUNTRYSIDE. EXT. DAY 
	
	BOCCIA speeds like an arrow on his bicycle through the village streets. Tied to 
	the parcel-rack is the sack containing the second part of Catene. He now turns 
	off the main street and takes a short-cut down a country road. He pedals as fast 
	as he can. Until he disappears into the distance, beyond the trees.
	
	45  ENTRANCE OLD ABANDONED MOVIE HOUSE. EXT. DAY 
	
	BOCCIA finally reaches the old movie house, which has been more or less spruced 
	up. Here too people are lined up in front of the posters of Catene. CICCIO 
	SPACCAFICO is waiting impatiently on an outside staircase. He too is holding a 
	sack, containing the first part of the film. The bicycle pulls up in front of 
	him. The sacks are exchanged. 
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Quick! Give it to me! Here's the 
		first part. Get moving! 
	
	BOCCIA heads back to the Cinema Paradiso, to take the first part to SALVATORE. 
	SPACCAFICO dashes up the stairs, and hands the sack to a MAN standing in the 
	door, through which the bare projection booth can be seen, and the projector 
	which SALVATORE has put back into working order. SPACCAFICO yells in excitement. 
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Here you are! Quick, quick!! People 
		are waiting!
	
	46  OLD ABANDONED MOVIE HOUSE. INT. DAY 
	
	In fact, inside the old freezing cold movie house, the audience is grumbling. 
	Everyone is wrapped in overcoats and woollen scarves and are sitting on chairs 
	they've brought from home and wooden benches. The hum of the projector is heard 
	at last. The lights go down. The grumbling subsides. The words 'PART TWO' appear 
	on screen and then the images of the film.
	
	47  VARIOUS COUNTRY ROADS AND VILLAGE STREETS. EXT. DAY/SUNDOWN
	
	Meanwhile BOCCIA pedals his way swiftly through the countryside on his way to 
	the Cinema Paradiso...
	
						FADE.
	
	Now BOCCIA is on his way back to the old movie house. To carry out another 
	exchange of sacks containing the reels of film.
	
						FADE.
	
	Another race back to Cinema Paradiso. BOCCIA starts looking tired, his breath is 
	short. And daylight starts fading into the colours of sundown.
	
						FADE.
	
	The last fading light of sundown.-BOCCIA is pedalling once more back
	to the old movie house. With the same sack tied to the parcel-rack. He
	is exhausted. On his last legs. He slows down, then stops.
	
	48  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING
	
	The lights are still on. In the thick blanket of smoke, the crowd stirs
	nervously. Shouting. Whistling.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		Hey, when's it starting!! We've got 
		ploughing to do in the morning!! 
		Toto, get a move on!! Heeey!!
	
	49  PROJECTION BOOTH. INT/EXT. EVENING
	
	In the booth, the projector is turned off. SALVATORE looks nervously
	out of the window...at the square. But not a sign of BOCCIA. A CARABINIERE 
	peers in through one of the holes.
	
				CARABINIERE  
		What are we going to do, Toto? The 
		whole place here is up in arms. 
		They've been waiting more than a half 
		hour.
	
				SALVATORE  
		What can I do?
	
	50  OLD ABANDONED MOVIE HOUSE. INT. EVENING
	
	Here too the audience is up in arms. They're waiting for Part Two tostart. 
	CICCIO SPACCAFICO tears his hair with rage.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Where's the fucking bastard got to?
	
				SPECTATOR  
		Let's get one thing straight, Don 
		Ciccio! I'm waiting ten minutes 
		more, and if you haven't started...
		you're giving me my money back!!
	
				AUDIENCE  
			(In chorus) 
		Well said! Well said! We want our 
		money back!!
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Easy! Easy! What about my showing you 
		the first part again? Huh? 
	
	People shout, whistle, give Bronx cheers.
	
	
				AUDIENCE  
		No! First part, my foot! We want to 
		see how the story ends!! 
	
	Down in the front row, PASQUALE, the man who sells black market cigarettes, 
	stands up.
	
				PASQUALE  
		I've seen the whole works! You want 
		me to tell you how it ends? 
	
	A shoe comes flying at him.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		Nooo! No! Shut up, you jerk!!
	
	5I  VILLAGE STREETS AND COUNTRY ROADS. EXT. EVENING
	
	SALVATORE has got himself a bicycle and is going off to look for
	BOCCIA. He pedals fast, turns into the country short cut. Looks
	around  not a sign of Boccia. By now it is dark. He sees a MAN in the window of 
	a farmhouse, calls out to him. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Boccia! Boccia! 
	
	SALVATORE rides on. Now he's in the open country. All of a sudden he seems to 
	hear something. He stops. Pricks up his ears. It's a sort of moan - he can't 
	figure out if it's an animal or a man. He turns on the flashlight he has brought 
	along. Takes a closer look around. 
	
	Catches sight of a bicycle wheel on the ground behind a bush. That's where the 
	moan is coming from! He creeps over in alarm. Next to the bicycle he now catches 
	sight of the sack with the film. And the moaning gets louder. 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Alarmed) 
		Boccia, what's wrong? 
			(He runs over to help his 
			friend. Behind the bush he 
			discovers BOCCIA humped up 
			between the legs of 
			TERESA, a prostitute. He 
			moves with all the fury 
			of his young years. 
			SALVATORE has never seen 
			people making love before 
			and is speechless.)
		Damn you, what are you doing? 
	
				BOCCIA  
			(Shouting) 
		Oh, Christ, it's so good!!! 
			(And he goes on ramming it 
			home.) 
	
				TERESA  
		Hey, cut it out! Go away. Shoo! 
	
	With a confused look on his face, SALVATORE picks up the sack and walks away, 
	looking over his shoulder at the couple who go on tossing around more and more 
	frantically.
	
	BOCCIA lets out a shriek of pleasure that rings through the countryside, as 
	SALVATORE pedals off like a madman and disappears into the trees. 
	
	52  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. DAY/EVENING 
	
	Music and the naked body of Brigitte Bardot. A row of youngsters on the main 
	floor stare at the naked actress, all excited. A regular rhythmic tremor runs 
	through them, half-hidden by the back of the seats.
	
	A scene from a horror film. The frightened faces of the audience. Off in one 
	corner, the door of the men's toilet opens and a MAN with a contented look comes 
	out, followed by TERESA, who motions another one to come in. In the projection 
	booth, SALVATORE is eating the meal his mother has brought him.
	
	A gangster film. The tense faces of the audience. A gun battle. Rounds of 
	machine-gunfire in the night. The shots echo through the theatre. A LITTLE BOY 
	claps his hands over his ears. Alternating with the machine-gunfire on screen, a 
	real pistol shoots the back of one of the spectators, the landowner DON 
	VINCENZO, who slumps down in his seat without anybody noticing...The shooting 
	continues up on screen...
	
	SALVATORE'S hand holds a lighted match under a piece of film, before the 
	horrified eyes of SPACCAFICO and the USHER, and the puzzled expression of 
	ALFREDO. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch 
		fire! 
	
				ALFREDO  
		Progress! It always arrives too late!
	
	A scene from Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. The only empty seat
	in the theatre is the one where DON VINCENZO was killed. A flower
	has been tied to it with string. All the other seats are taken.
	
						Fade to:
	
	ROSA and ANGELO are sitting next to each other. They are watching a
	different film. But she has a baby in her arms  they have got married,
	have set up a family.
	
	In the balcony, the MAN with the face of a public notary spits down
	below with a contented look. But this time the main floor takes its
	revenge and a blob of shit hits him square in the face.
	
	53  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. MORNING 
	
	In the morning the theatre is empty. All the doors are shut. Light filters in 
	through the open windows up above, illuminates the posters of coming attractions 
	and the yellowish screen. Off-screen, a woman's voice 
	and a boy's voice are heard. 
	
				TERESA'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		Come on...That's right...relax...
			(Laughing)
		...Don't be scared...
	
				SALVATORE'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		Is it true that if I bleed I've got 
		to squeeze lemon juice on it? 
	
				TERESA'S VOICE  (Off-screen) 
			(A loud laugh) 
		Lemon juice?...That's a new one for 
		you! Who tells you this crap...Take 
		it easy...That's right...You see, 
		it's not painful, is it?
	
	Slow pan along the walls of the theatre, the empty aisles,
	discovers SALVATORE on the floor between the seats with
	TERESA, the prostitute who has already been seen. SALVATORE is
	making love for the first time in his life. He is awkward and
	clumsy. There is an uncertain look in his eyes, his livid face is
	dripping with sweat.
	
				TERESA 
		...There you are! That's right, 
		that's right! Keep going...
			(SALVATORE is quicker, has 
			learned the lesson. TERESA 
			goads him on.)
		Ah!!! There, now you're a real man! A 
		man! ? A real calf!
			(SALVATORE's panting 
			slackens into a deep sigh 
			of pleasure.)
	
	54  VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT/EXT. DAY 
	
	The blade of a knife, clutched in a hardened hand. A blow. A cry of pain. A calf 
	falls like a dead weight to the ground...SALVATORE photographs the animal in 
	the throes of death with his 8mm movie camera. As well as the faces of the MEN 
	who now bleed and skin it quickly. In the vast slaughter-house, the voices of 
	the men and animals mingle together.
	
	SALVATORE'S eye is quick to catch the most unexpected expressions of ordinary 
	people. His movie camera is always ready, like a hunter's rifle. Now he is 
	shooting...
	
	A meeting in the square: the passionate reactions of the peasants listening to a 
	speaker who flails his arms around.
	
	At school: the old SCHOOLMISTRESS sitting at her desk, sunk in God knows what 
	dreams, her eyes staring off into empty space, as a tear runs down her pale, 
	unhappy face, and the unknowing STUDENTS carry out their assignments.
	
	At the railroad station: the nervous excitement of the people waiting on the 
	platforms. SALVATORE pans his camera on to TWO MEN fighting. But an arriving 
	train comes in between. Salvatore follows the train, pans along the cars. The 
	train stops. 
	
	-A door opens and the passengers climb out. Several TRADERS, a CARABINTERE, a 
	group of commuting STUDENTS, the TICKET-COLLECTOR, a distinguished looking 
	COUPLE and lastly, a GIRL who stops in the middle of the viewfinder. SALVATORE 
	is immediately attracted by her face. He goes on shooting without leaving it a 
	moment. He follows her through the lens. She is very beautiful, must be around 
	sixteen, a simple, sweet face, blue eyes. She is certainly the daughter of the 
	distinguished looking COUPLE who got off just before she did. The little family 
	moves off down the platform. Salvatore follows the girl's movements, as if 
	hypnotized. Now she passes by him, turns towards him for one moment, as if 
	trying to figure out where he is aiming that funny-looking gadget. SALVATORE 
	smiles at her, entranced.
	
	55  HIGH SCHOOL. COURTYARD. ENTRANCE. EXT. MORNING
	
	The JANITOR is ringing the bell. In the courtyard, on the other side of
	the gate, the STUDENTS prepare to enter. SALVATORE is with a group
	of schoolmates, including BOCCIA. And they all stare, wide-eyed, at
	the GIRL from the station. She has her books under her arm and is
	walking by herself.
	
				SALVATORE  
		You know that one there?
	
				BOCCIA  
		She's new. Not bad though. Nice-
		looking.
			(SALVATORE has the look of 
			somebody seeking for an 
			idea, some way of picking 
			up a conversation with 
			her.)
	
				SECOND STUDENT  
		Her father s the new bank director. 
		Loaded, luxury and easy living!
	
				FIRST STUDENT  
		People who jerk off with a shirt so 
		they won't get their hands dirty. 
			(Laughs.)
	
	All at once, BOCCIA and SALVATORE notice that the GIRL drops
	her lunch without noticing as she is about to enter the school. They
	fly off, swift as arrows. It's a chance not to be missed. BOCCIA is
	the quicker, is already in the lead. SALVATORE gives an angry
	gesture. A flash come into his eyes, the same flash he had as a little
	boy when he finds the right way to hit home. He picks up his step,
	trips BOCCIA and brings him to the ground. He pounces on him
	and lets go with his fist. He starts running again. Picks the
	bundle off the ground. Catches up with the GIRL from the
	station, nervous and inexperienced, but polite.
				SALVATORE  
		Look, you dropped this.
	
	And he hands her her lunch with a smile. She recognizes him.
	
				ELENA  
		Oh, thanks. I hadn't noticed...
	
	She takes the bundle as SALVATORE touches her hand delicately.
	
				SALVATORE  
		My name's Salvatore...And yours?
	
				ELENA  
			(Smiling) 
		Elena. My name's Elena.
	
	SALVATORE is very flustered. He feels as if all his blood were
	throbbing in his head. He tries to say something else, but the words
	catch in his throat.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I...I...The other time at the 
		station.
	
	BOCCIA suddenly grabs him by the collar and yanks him away. ELENA is frightened, 
	puts her hand over her eyes so as not to see.
	
	56:CINEMA PARADISO.PROJECTION BOOTH.INT.AFTERNOON 
	
	SALVATORE has a black eye, swollen shut. He is setting up a little 8mm projector 
	on a stool. ALFREDO is sitting in one corner. He has come to keep him company. 
	He listens to the sound-track of the movie being shown. 
	
				ALFREDO
		Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto? 
	
				SALVATORE  
		That's right, Modern Times. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		I've shown it so many times I know it 
		by heart. The first time I showed 
		it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first 
		wife died. They kept it hidden from 
		me all day so they wouldn't have to 
		close down the movie house. I only 
		found out that night, after the last 
		show. Those are things you never 
		forget...
			(Changing his tone.) 
		So, Toto, how are these home movies 
		going? 
			(SALVATORE has switched on 
			the little projector and a 
			square of light appears on 
			the wall beside ALFREDO, 
			with the scenes shot in 
			town.) 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Yes. 
			(The shots of the 
			slaughter-house have 
			appeared.) 
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Whispering) 
		What is it, what is it? What's the 
		picture? 
	
				SALVATORE  
		It's people in the slaughter-house 
		killing a calf. There's blood all 
		over the floor, like a lake. And 
		through this lake another calf passes 
		by on its way to die. 
	
	ALFREDO is concentrated, as if SALVATORE'S description transmitted the 
	real image to him, the colours, the forms. The railway station has appeared on 
	the wall, and the sequence of ELENA. SALVATORE does not move, does not say a 
	word, as he gazes at those blue eyes looking into the camera. ALFREDO senses 
	something funny in the boy's s11ence.
	
				ALFREDO  
		Now what can you see?
	
				SALVATORE  
		Nothing, there's nothing. It's all 
		out of focus.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Smiling) 
		Is there a woman?...Tell me the 
		truth...
			(SALVATORE is shamed, 
			uncertain, doesn't know 
			whet to say. A tender look 
			filters through ALFREDO's 
			dark glasses. He has 
			obviously caught on and 
			whispers:) 
		There is a woman.
	
	SALVATORE is forced to admit it, with a sigh.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Yes, it's a girl I saw at the 
		station.
	
				ALFREDO  
		What's she like? What's she like?...
	
	And as other shots of ELENA appear on the screen, SALVATORE describes her. As 
	only somebody in love could.
	
				SALVATORE  
		She's nice. My age...Slender, with 
		long hair, brunette. She had big blue 
		eyes, a simple expression and a 
		little beauty mark on her lip, but 
		really tiny. You can only see it 
		close-up. And when she smiles...She 
		makes you feel...
	
	He stops. Only now does he realize that he has let himself be carried away by 
	passion, by the desire to talk about her. ALFREDO smiles, spellbound...
	
				ALFREDO  
		Eh! Love...what a mystery!
			(SALVATORE turns off the 
			projector and heaves a 
			deep sigh, almost of 
			liberation. ALFREDO'S 
			sympathy does him a lot of 
			good. It's nice to be 
			understood. He moves over 
			closer to him. ALFREDO 
			runs his hand through his 
			hair, whispers:)
		I understand you, Toto...The ones 
		with blue eyes are the
		most beautiful. Whatever you do, you 
		can't make friends with
		them.
			(SALVATORE is comforted by 
			the way he talks. He 
			didn't think it
			was possible to put into 
			words the things he has 
			felt since meeting
			ELENA. He nods his head. 
			ALFREDO sighs.)
		Eh, there's nothing to be done about 
		it! The heavier a man is,
		the deeper his footprints. And if 
		he's in love, he suffers,
		because he knows he's up a one-way 
		street. Because love is a
		meaningless thing when a man gets it 
		into his head to do what
		he wants...
			(SALVATORE is touched by 
			his sensitivity, by his 
			intense, passionate, sweet 
			way of speaking.)
	
				SALVATORE  
		What you say is wonderful! But sad...
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Smiling) 
		They're not my words. John Wayne said 
		it in Shepherd of the Hills.
	
	SALVATORE suddenly changes expression, as if discovering he was being made fun 
	of.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Stinking two-timer!! 
			(And they burst out 
			laughing.)
	
	57:CINEMAPARADISOANDVARIOUSSTREETS.EXT.DAY
	
	A grey, windy day. It is opening-time and the shutters of the movie
	house are being rolled up. SALVATORE is about to enter through the
	small door of the spiral staircase, when in the distance he catches sight
	of...
	
	ELENA crossing a street with her books under her arm. She is alone.
	SALVATORE doesn't stop to think twice, dashes off, runs through streets
	full of dust, another square, turns the corner, but has lost sight of her.
	He looks around in all directions  there she is! He starts running again.
	And finally catches up with her, all out of breath, practically
	speechless with emotion.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Hi, Elena!
	
				ELENA  
		Hi. Why are you running?
	
				SALVATORE  
		No particular reason...
			(He is entranced by her 
			eyes. He wants to tell her 
			all sorts of
			things, say all the words 
			he has memorized a 
			thousand times. But
			now he can't get them out. 
			His knees tremble. He does 
			his best to
			overcome his confusion, 
			but all that comes out 
			is:)
		Nice day, huh?
			(A gust of wind envelops 
			them in a cloud of dust 
			and a clap of
			thunder rends the air. 
			ELENA laughs, amused by 
			the blunder.)
	
				ELENA  
		Yes, nice day.
			(SALVATORE laughs too. He 
			gazes at her long hair 
			tossed by the wind. She 
			turns to leave.)
		...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Bye-bye, Elena.
			(ELENA walks away. And 
			SALVATORE also turns to 
			leave. Only now is he 
			seized by disappointment,  
			regret at not having made
			the best of the 
			opportunity. He talks to 
			himself.)
		...What an idiot! What an idiot! 
		'Nice day'! Christ!!
	
	58:SALVATORE'S BEDROOM.INT.DAY 
	
	SALVATORE projects images of ELENA on his wall. He lies across his bed gazing at 
	her image.
	
				SALVATORE  
		You probably don't believe me, but 
		I'm going to become the leading man 
		in your life. Sure, I don't look like 
		Marlon Brando, but look at me, really 
		look at me. Am I really so ugly? So 
		should I try once more? Maybe It'll 
		succeed. What do you 
		say? 
	
	ELENA seems to be saying, Yes. As SALVATORE kisses ELENA, her image disappears. 
	He is left with his face against the wall in the white light from the 
	projector.
	
	59:PHONEB00TH AND ELENA'S HOUSE.INT.DAY
	
	SALVATORE is in a phone booth. The telephone will certainly help him feel less 
	nervous.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Hello, can I speak to Elena, please?
	
				WOMANS VOICE  
		Yes. 
			(SALVATORE recognizes 
			ELENA's voice, changes his 
			tone, turns sweeter, more 
			personal.)
	
				SALVATORE 
		Is that you, Elena?
	
				WOMAN'S VOICE  
		Yes...
	
				SALVATORE  
		Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't recognize 
		your voice. This is Salvatore, 
		remember?
	
				WOMAN'SVOICE  
		Yes...
	
	SALVATORE finally speaks, says everything all in one breath, without stopping, 
	without hesitating, in order to leave no room for shyness.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Listen, I know that every time we see 
		each other I make a fool of myself, 
		but I'm not like that, I swear. It's 
		just that when I see you, I feel shy, 
		the right words don't come to me, I 
		don't have the courage to say that 
		all I do is think about you...
			(He has finally got it 
			out. He's dripping with 
			sweat, but happy at having 
			succeeded. He continues.) 
		That's right, Elena, you're the last 
		thing I think of when I go to sleep 
		and the first when I wake up in the 
		morning. And at night I always dream 
		of you. I know, it's not good on the 
		phone. But please, don't get me 
		wrong. Because I love you very 
		much...
	
				WOMAN'SVOICE  
			(Interrupting him) 
		If you don't stop phoning her, I'm 
		calling the police!
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Stunned) 
		But excuse me, who's speaking?
	
	At ELENA'S house, a WOMAN who is visibly in a state is speaking on the phone.
	
				ELENA'S MOTHER  
		I'm Elena's mother, you filthy pig! 
	
	SALVATORE feels like dropping through the floor, tries to get a word in to 
	explain, to apologize, but the flood of insults overwhelms him.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I'm sorry, Signora, maybe there's a 
		misunderstanding...I...
	
				WOMAN'S VOICE  
		And don't call my daughter any more. 
		Never! 
	
	SALVATORE has no choice but to hang up, disappointed, defeated. He's so mad he 
	starts slapping himself.
	
	60:ALFREDO'S HOUSE.EXT.AFTERNOON
	
	Good Friday. ALFREDO comes out of his house, leaning on
	SALVATORE's shoulder. They go off down the street, towards the
	church. SALVATORE has finished recounting his misadventure.
	
				ALFREDO  
		I told you, the blue-eyed ones are 
		the most difficult.
	
				SALVATORE  
		But why? There must be some way to 
		make her understand!
	
				ALFREDO  
		Don't think about it, Toto. Don't 
		even try. With feelings, there's 
		nothing to understand. 
	
	SALVATORE gives an angry gesture. This time ALFREDO'S words do not quiet his 
	frenzy, don't help him. He moves away from him a few steps.
	
	ALFREDO stands there motionless in the middle of the road.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Stop it! I've had enough of your 
		sermons! You act as if you created 
		the world! 
			(A bicycle streaks by 
			ALFREDO, who gives a 
			startled jump, as if it 
			were about to 
			run into him. He raises 
			his voice, panic-
			stricken.)
	
				ALFREDO  
		Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off 
		with me now! Come here! I don't 
		know where the fuck I have to go. 
			(A MAN on a bicycle almost 
			collides with ALFREDO. 
			SALVATORE fumes, goes over 
			to him listlessly. ALFREDO 
			puts his hand back on his 
			shoulder and they start 
			walking again. ALFREDO has 
			calmed down, but his voice 
			is determined.) 
		And the next time be careful how you 
		talk. Not to take credit away 
		from the Lord, but if I had created 
		the world, in all modesty, certain 
		things would have come out better. 
		But unfortunately such was not the 
		case.
	
				SALVATORE 
			(Laughing) 
		You see, it s like I say. You always 
		have an answer for everything.
	
				ALFREDO  
		I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm 
		going to tell you a story. 
			(And he squeezes 
			SALVATORE'S shoulder. It's 
			the signal for taking a 
			rest. They sit in a 
			doorway. ALFREDO starts 
			telling his story, and his 
			way of speaking is 
			hypnotic, magical. With 
			those eyes lost in empty 
			space, it's as if his 
			thoughts and his words 
			came in from some other 
			dimension, mysterious, 
			hidden...) 
		Once upon a time a king gave a feast 
		and there were all the most beautiful 
		princesses of the realm. Basta, one 
		of the guards, saw the king's 
		daughter: she was the loveliest of 
		all! And he immediately fell in love 
		with her. But what could a poor 
		soldier do compared with a king's 
		daughter?!...One day he managed 
		to meet her and told her he couldn't 
		live without her. The princess was so 
		struck by the depth of his feeling 
		that she said to the soldier  'If you 
		will wait a hundred days and a 
		hundred nights beneath my balcony, 
		then in the end I'll be yours.' 
		Christ, the soldier ran off there and 
		waited! One day, two days, 
		ten, twenty...Every night she looked 
		out of her window, but he never 
		budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never 
		budged! The birds shat on him and the 
		bees ate him alive! After ninety 
		nights he was gaunt and pale and 
		tears streamed from his eyes but he 
		couldn't hold them back. He didn't 
		even have the strength to sleep any 
		more. The princess kept watch...And 
		on the ninety-ninth night, the 
		soldier got up, picked up his chair 
		and left!
	
				SALVATORE  
		No! You mean right at the end? 
			(SALVATORE is amazed, 
			dumbfounded; that ending 
			has made a deep 
			impression. They 
			start walking again.)
				ALFREDO  
		That's right, Toto, right at the end? 
		And don't ask me what it means. If 
		you figure it out, let me know...
	
				SALVATORE  
		I'll be damned'
	
	6I:CHURCH.INT.EVENING
	
	Before the high altar, the Virgin Mary in tears clutches three spikes inher 
	hand. And beside her is another statue  Christ descended from the
	cross. MEN and WOMEN stand in line to kiss Christ's wounds. Many people are 
	sitting between the pews. SALVATORE helps ALFREDO take a seat, and at that 
	moment catches sight at the far end of ELENA on her way to the confessional. 
	
	She kneels down on one side, just as FATHER ADELFIO comes out of the middle 
	booth and goes to the altar to say something to the sacristan. SALVATORE'S eyes 
	light up. He has had a brainstorm. 
	
	He leans over and whispers something into ALFREDO's ear. ALFREDO nods his head. 
	SALVATORE is so happy that he gives him a pat on the cheek, like a caress. Then 
	he hurries over to the PRIEST. Says something in a low voice, gesticulates with 
	some agitation, points to the pew where ALFREDO is sitting. The PRIEST tries to 
	say he can't now, but SALVATORE insists, and wins. The PRIEST goes over to 
	ALFREDO, leans over. 
	
				PRIEST  
		What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of 
		all times! 
	
				ALFREDO  
			(In a grave voice) 
		Father Adelfio, I have a very serious 
		doubt that is torturing my soul. And 
		you've got to help me, because I've 
		lost all peace of mind...
	
	SALVATORE watches from a distance. He sees the PRIEST put on an alarmed 
	expression and then sit down beside ALFREDO. Everything's ready. He creeps over 
	to the confessional. ELENA is there, kneeling down waiting for the PRIEST to 
	arrive. In an instant, without anyone noticing, SALVATORE pops inside the 
	confessional. He shuts the little door below and draws the purple curtain. On 
	the other side of grille, only a few inches away, those eyes that keep him awake 
	all night. 
	
				ELENA  
		Father, I have sinned...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(In a low voice) 
		We'll talk about that later. 
	
				ELENA  
			(Surprised) 
		But...who...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Interrupting her) 
		Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend 
		everything's normal. I'm Salvatore. 
	
	ELENA'S eyes pop in amazement.
	
				ELENA  
		What are you doing here?
	
	Meanwhile ALFREDO and the PRIEST continue their unusual and animated discussion. 
	The PRIEST is appalled, crosses himself. 
	
				PRIEST  
		But Alfredo, what you're saying is 
		horrifying! 
	
				ALFREDO  
		I know. But take the-miracle of the 
		loaves and fishes, for example! I 
		think about it a lot...How is it 
		possible for...
	
	In the confessional, the whispered conversation between SALVATORE and ELENA 
	continues.
	
				ELENA  
			(Annoyed) 
		There was a terrible rumpus at home. 
		My mother told my father. And how 
		could you have mistaken my voice?!
	
	SALVATORE is mortified, on tenterhooks, keeps an eye on ALFREDO and the PRIEST 
	through a crack in the curtain.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Forgive me, Elena. It was stupid of 
		me. But I had to talk to you. 
	
	She looks up at him and her eyes are even more beautiful in the candlelight. 
	This time SALVATORE finds the courage to speak to her calmly, with 
	determination. That grille probably helps him, allows him to see without being 
	seen.
	
				SALVATORE  
		You're so beautiful, Elena...That's 
		what I wanted to tell you. When I 
		meet you, I can't put two words 
		together because...you give me the 
		shivers. I don't know what you do in 
		these situations, what you're 
		supposed to say. It's the first time. 
		But I think I'm in love with you. 
	
	ELENA gazes through the grille at the two shining specks of his eyes. She is 
	bewildered by that flood of passion. At that moment, an OLD WOMAN kneels down on 
	the other side of the confessional and her face appears behind the grille.
	
				OLD WOMAN  
		Father, I have sinned...
			(SALVATORE turns lo her, 
			instinctively.)
	
				SALVATORE  
		I absolve you in the name of the 
		Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. 
		Go in peace, my daughter. 
			(And he slams the panel 
			shut in her face. ELENA is 
			barely able to control her 
			laughter.) 
		When you laugh, you're even more 
		beautiful. 
	
	She pulls herself together again and puts on a serious, but tender look.
	
				ELENA  
		Salvatore, it's awfully sweet of you. 
		And even though I don't know you, I 
		like you. But...I'm not in love with 
		you. 
	
	For SALVATORE, it's as if a knife had plunged straight into his heart. He sits 
	there gazing into her eyes, at the beauty mark on her lip, without moving. Then 
	through the crack sees ALFREDO and the PRIEST conversing nervously, God knows 
	what they're saying. And he turns back to her.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I don't care. I'll wait.
	
				ELENA  
		For what?
	
				SALVATORE  
		For you to fall in love with me too. 
		Listen carefully. Every night, when I 
		get off work, I'll come and wait 
		beneath your window. Every night. 
		When you change your mind, open your 
		window. That's all. I'll 
		understand...
	
	He smiles at her. She is upset by those exaggerated words, but also intrigued.
	
	The PRIEST has meanwhile solved the problem that ALFREDO has made up as an 
	excuse.
	
				PRIEST  
			(Exhausted) 
		You understand now? You see it 
		clearly?
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Hypocritically) 
		Oh yes, father. Now everything's 
		clear.
	
				PRIEST  
		And the next time don't go around 
		saying such heresy. You survived the 
		fire at the movie house. But no one 
		can save you from the fire of Hell!
	
	62:SQUARE AND ELENA'S HOUSE. EXT. NIGHT
	
	Sweet poignant music accompanies SALVATORE's long waits beneath the window of 
	ELENA'S room... A warm early summer night. The last spectators wander off into 
	the streets. The VILLAGE IDIOT makes his rounds of the square.
	
	SALVATORE is beneath her window. He waits. The shutters are open,
	but not the windows with the curtains. ELENA peers at him through a
	dark crack...
	
						Fade to:
	
	A rainy night. SALVATORE is back there again. Determined,
	headstrong. A dog keeps him company, taking shelter under an
	overhanging roof. The window is shut...
	
						Fade to:
	
	SALVATORE'S hand adds another check to an endless row of checks on
	the calendar. A check a day...
	
						Fade to:
	
	Another night. Wind. The window is still shut. SALVATORE's eyes are
	the eyes of a lovesick man prepared to face the hardest battles, just to
	win, just to conquer his loved one. She peeks at him through the crack,
	but he can't see her...
	
						Fade to:
	
	The paces of the calendar are covered with checks. Several months
	have gone by. SALVATORE adds a check on the last page, on 30 December. Tomorrow 
	night will be...New Year's Eve. The streets are empty. Loud merry voices can be 
	heard coming from the houses. Old discarded objects hail down from balconies. 
	Firecrackers explode here and there. SALVATORE is there in the same old place, 
	as usual. The shutters are open, but not the windows, and all is darkness 
	inside. SALVATORE is wrapped in a large overcoat and stamps his feet to keep 
	warm...
	
	63:SALVATORES HOUSE. GIANCALDO. INT. NIGHT
	
	Toasts are being prepared in SALVATORE's house. MARIA is there
	with her daughter, LIA, then ALFREDO with his wife, ANNA.
	SALVATORE is the only one missing for the "family" to be complete.
	The bottle of spumante and the Christmas cake are ready. The radio is
	on with the New Year's Eve programme.
	
				MARIA  
			(Nervously) 
		But why hasn't Toto shown up? The 
		movie house is closed at this hour!
	
	ALFREDO has a know-all look. He tries to put her mind at rest.
	
				ALFREDO  
		He had to do something for me...
	
	Over the radio, music and merrymaking
	
	64:ELENA'S HOUSE.EXT.NIGHT 
	
	More sounds of merrymaking, coming from ELENA's house. SALVATORE listens to it, 
	sees the shadows of her parents and relatives, maybe even hers, ready to 
	celebrate, welcome in the New Year. But further on, that window remains dark and 
	shut. SALVATORE gazes at it again. 
	
	There is a new look in his eyes, like a gleam of hope. Maybe it's the 
	specialness of that night, maybe it's the fire crackers, the festive atmosphere, 
	but something tells him that's going to be the right night. The night when 
	she'll open her window. In fact, a light suddenly goes on in the room. 
	SALVATORE'S eyes sparkle, have already taken on the hue of victory. 
	
	The window is pulled open, and his heart starts pounding like a drum. The music 
	reaches its climax. Two hands come out. SALVATORE shuts his eyes for a moment, 
	to hold back the flood of feeling. He opens them again and sees......The hands 
	reach out and take hold of the shutters and pull them shut. The light goes out. 
	It is midnight. An echoing voice does the countdown.
	
				RADIO VOICE  
		Six, five, four, three, two, one, 
		zero! Happy New Year! Happy New Year! 
	
	And a roar of voices, shouts, explosions, fills the air. SALVATORE has remained 
	standing there immobile, speechless. Disappointed. Defeated.
	
	65  SALVATORE S HOUSE. GIANCALDO. INT. NIGHT
	
	At his house, glasses are about to be raised. There is a strange, tense 
	merriment. MARIA is unable to conceal her concern, her presentiment. She glances 
	at the door, hoping to see SALVATORE appear.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(To Maria) 
		There's nothing to worry about. He's 
		probably with his friends. 
			(To all) 
		Let's toast!
	
				EVERYBODY  
			(Toasting) 
		Here's to you! Here's to you! Happy 
		New Year!
	
				MARIA  
		For Toto too, here's to you!! Happy 
		New Year! !
	
	Everybody echoes MARIA'S toast...
	
	66  ELENA S HOUSE. EXT. NIGHT 
	
	But SALVATORE is not happy in these first few minutes of the New Year. He feels 
	hurt, humiliated, rejected. He walks off amidst the old discarded objects flying 
	down from the terraces. That was his last night. He's not showing up beneath 
	that balcony any more.
	
	67  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. AFTERNOON 
	
	Outside there is a violent thunderstorm. The pounding of the rain and the 
	rumbling of the thunder drown out the sound-track of the film being shown. Two 
	buckets are on the floor to catch the water dripping through the roof. SALVATORE 
	is alone. For the first time he feels he hates the profession he's got into. He 
	is tearing up the calendar where he checked off the nights he spent waiting for 
	ELENA. He tears it into a thousand pieces, as if trying to wipe out the traces 
	of his grief. He is so absorbed in his thoughts that he doesn't notice that 
	someone has appeared at the top of the stairs and quietly entered the room. And 
	now stands there watching him in silence. The thunder is deafening. That someone 
	is ELENA. She comes up behind him, realizes he is thinking 
	about her. Whispers. 
	
				ELENA  
		Salvatore...
	
	Loud passionate music is heard on the monitor. SALVATORE turns and sees her as 
	if in a dream. It is a sudden blow to the heart. The look on her face is 
	wonderfully sweet, the look of somebody who knows she is madly loved and 
	who now realizes at last that she is in love too. For SALVATORE it is an 
	overwhelming, almost unbearable moment...A long passionate embrace that is 
	never-ending. They are happy, cling to each other never to leave each other 
	again. 
	
	They spin around, end up against the wall where strips of film are hanging, the 
	first-part endings and the trailers. Another intense look, their eyes 
	locked...And it is their first kiss. A kiss at first timid, hesitant, almost 
	clumsy, and then becomes resolute, poignant. Amidst the film strips dangling 
	around and touching their young faces. Meanwhile the film has finished, the 
	projector turns uselessly...Down below the screen is blank, the audience 
	whistles...But SALVATORE hears nothing, neither the whistles nor the useless 
	whirring of the reels in the projector. All he hears is her breathing, an he 
	feels is the warmth of her 
	skin.
	
	68  VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT/EXT. DAY
	
	The happiest, most vivid moments SALVATORE and ELENA spend
	together:
	
	A country outing. They eat a lavish salad using the flat branches of the
	prickly pear for plates.
	
	A chase through an endless field of wheat.
	In the projection booth. A cake with seventeen lighted candles.
	SALVATORE and ELENA blow them out together. And then a kiss.
	
	69  ROAD AT THE EDGE OF TOWN.EXT. DAY
	
	SALVATORE is driving an old beaten-up Balilla he bought from a
	car-wrecker. ELENA sits beside him, having the time of her life. They
	roar with laughter. The car jolts, moves by fits and starts, jarred by the
	holes in the road, and besides SALVATORE is not such a hot driver. She
	fondles him.
	
				ELENA  
			(Ironically) 
		You have a great future as a driver. 
		If they don't arrest you first!!
	
				SALVATORE  
		That's nothing to do with it, it's 
		the car that's still being run in...
	
	He has barely finished the last sentence when the car gives a
	sudden violent shudder. A sharp report. A cloud of white smoke issues from the 
	motor. And the Balilla stops dead in its tracks. ELENA and SALVATORE cannot 
	smother their wild laughter. They embrace. 
	
				ELENA  
		SO now how do we get home? 
	
						Cut to:  
	
	The two of them are standing beside the empty road, looking bored, as they have 
	already been waiting a long time for someone to go by, a car, a wagon. When all 
	at once a car comes around the bend, heading for town. SALVATORE and ELENA flag 
	it down. 
	
	The DRIVER slows down. The back door opens, a MAN gets out. An alarmed and 
	startled look comes over ELENA's face  that man is her FATHER. She sees him 
	stride over in a rage. 
	
	He has almost reached SALVATORE, who tries lo be polite, to make the best of the 
	situation. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Hello, Dr Mendola...Hem...
	
	ELENA buries her face in her hands, so as not to see...
	
	70  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING
	
	SALVATORE has a bruise on his cheek and two Band-aids on his face.
	He got himself a good thrashing, and then some. The house is jammed,
	as on the great occasions. Curiosity is written all over the faces of the
	audience. But what they're seeing is not a film, but an instalment of
	Double or Nothing. SALVATORE is standing by a teleprojector which
	has been set up in the central aisle of the balcony. It is a machine that
	makes it possible to project television show on the screen. ALFREDO is
	sitting beside him.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(In a low voice) 
		Toto, are you pulling my leg or 
		something? How is it possible to see 
		this television without film?
	
				SALVATORE  
		Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. 
		And if you buy a television set, you 
		can watch it at home, without any 
		fuss...
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Sceptically) 
		Could be...But I don't like this
		business. It smells fishy to me.
	
	ELENA is sitting in one corner of the balcony with her parents. Sitting beside 
	her FATHER is the owner of the movie house, SPACCAFICO, who thanks him.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
			(In a low voice) 
		You see what a bright idea, Dr 
		Mendola? But without the bank loan 
		how could I have bought the machine? 
		If we don't get organized around 
		here, in this day and age, we'll meet 
		the same end as the Punch and Judy 
		shows! 
	
	ELENA is not very interested in the TV show. She sneaks a look at SALVATORE. 
	From the looks on their faces, it is clear that things are not going very well. 
	He gives her a nod, as if to say he wants to speak to her and that she should 
	figure out some way! ELENA leans over to her MOTHER, whispers something into her 
	ear.
	
	7I  CINEMA PARADISO. TOILET. INT. EVENING
	
	ELENA's MOTHER stands waiting in front of the women's toilet,
	gazing at Mike Bongiorno emceeing the TV show in the distance.
	
	Inside the toilet, ELENA is standing on the toilet seat whispering to
	SALVATORE, who is standing on the 20ilet seat of the men's toilet.
	
	Their eyes are barely able to peek over the flush tank which they have
	uncovered. ELENA is worried.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Could it be your father doesn't like 
		the work I do...That my family's too 
		poor...Is that it? 
	
	She gives a nod of the head, but only faintly, so as no2 to wound his 
	vulnerability. SALVATORE sighs.
	
				ELENA'S MOTHER  
			(Off-screen) 
		Elena!
	
				ELENA  
		All right! ! 
			(To Salvatore, in a 
			whisper) 
		For the moment it's impossible to see 
		each other...As soon as school is 
		out, we're going to go stay with 
		friends in Tuscany. We'll be there 
		all summer...Maybe if you came up, 
		we could meet in secret...
				SALVATORE  
			(Crestfallen) 
		But we're opening the outdoor movie 
		theatre this summer. What will I do 
		all this time without seeing you?!
				
				ELENA  
		I'll write to you every day. Don't 
		worry. I love you. The summer'll be 
		over and I'll be back...
	
	They reach out to kiss each other. Who knows when they'll be able to see each 
	other again?
	
				ELENA'S MOTHER  
			(Off-screen) 
		Elena! 
	
	ELENA climbs down, pulls the chain and walks off, leaving SALVATORE standing 
	there on the toilet seat.
	
	Summer has come. A bevy of barefoot children chase after the carts carrying the 
	carters' families to the beach to go swimming. SALVATORE, helped by the USHER, 
	has finished loading the disassembled projector on to a wagon in order to carry 
	it to the outdoor movie house. The USHER has hung a sign on the Cinema Paradiso 
	to the effect that 'Showings to continue at the Imperia Arena', and now climbs 
	into the wagon. 
	
	The horse moves off slowly and the monotonous clatter of its hoofs reminds 
	SALVATORE that the summer is going to be long this year, longer than ever. And 
	he leans on the projector that totters and lurches from the jolting of the 
	wheels. A cart carrying a cheerful and noisy family pulls up alongside the 
	wagon. There are the MEN from the slaughter-house. They recognize SALVATORE. 
	
				SLAUGHTER-HOUSE MAN 
		Well, look who's here!! Cecil B. De 
		Mille! Hey, Toto!! When are you 
		coming to shoot another film?!? 
	
	And they laugh, with their gaping toothless mouths. SALVATORE doesn't feel like 
	joking, not even like answering. He looks away, so as not to see their leers. He 
	wants to be by himself. 
	
	73  BEACH AND IMPERIA ARENA. EXT. DAY 
	
	
	The beach is almost deserted, dotted here and there with groups of bathers. The 
	carts and horses are scattered in the sand, near the Imperia Arena, where some 
	WORKMEN are putting on the finishing touches for the new opening. The wagon 
	arrives and SALVATORE and the USHER unload the projector.
	
	74  BEACH. IMPERIA ARENA. PROJECTION BOOTH. EXT.EVENING
	
	A sultry evening. The jacklights of the octopus fishers twinkle on the
	dark horizon. The sound-track of a comic film reverberates over the sea,
	the laughter of the audience mingles with the sound of the shallow waves
	breaking on the rocks. A group of LITTLE BOYS in a boat pulls away
	from shore. They join some more boats standing still in the water, all of
	them crammed with LITTLE BOYS all looking in the same direction...
	towards the screen of the open-air movie at the water's edge. There is a
	funny scene.
	
				LITTLE BOYS  
		All seats are sold out! Free entrance 
		and payment on the way out!! Sssssh!!
	
	And they guffaw noisily. Their laughter is echoed by more
	laughter, in the distance...
	
	...the laughter of the Arena audience, scattered among the
	metal chairs. By dint of laughing, the people in one of the rows
	of chairs tip over backwards. Screams, laughs, whistles.
	The projection booth has a door at the back with stairs leading
	down to the rocks. SALVATORE is sitting on the ground, bare
	chested, tired and sticky with sweat. He is reading a letter from
	ELENA. He is so engrossed the words can almost be read on his
	face.
	
				ELENA'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		Salvatore, my darling, here the days 
		never end. I find your name 
		everywhere if I read a book, do a 
		crossword puzzle, thumb through a 
		newspaper...You're always before my 
		eyes. Today I've got some rather bad 
		news. At the end of October we're 
		moving to the city where I'll attend 
		the University. It'll be hard to see 
		each other every day. But don't 
		worry, whenever I can get away I'll 
		always come running to you, to the 
		Cinema Paradiso.
	
	On the Arena screen, with its potted plants and palm trees, a
	very funny scene is being shown. The audience again bursts into
	wild laughter. And the audience of LITTLE BOYS in the boats also laugh. One
	of them, laughing himself to tears, loses his balance and falls
	into the water. The others howl with laughter. A voice rises up
	out of the carousel of boats.
	
				URCHIN  
		Fuck me! I've caught an octopus! An 
		oooooctopus!
	
						FADE
	
	75  VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT/EXT. DAY 
	
	The August sun is blazing hot. People are forced to stay inside when the sirocco 
	blows. The streets are empty. And there is a strange silence. Nothing can be 
	heard except far in the distance, from somewhere in the country, the love song 
	of some carter...SALVATORE hears it too, stretched out on the floor of his 
	room, his eyes fixed on the ceiling where flies buzz around nervously. The 
	MAILMAN comes down the street on his bicycle, rides up to SALVATORE and hands 
	him a letter...Sitting in the shade of a white wall, SALVATORE reads the 
	letter. Next to him, the dog that kept him company at night, beneath ELENA's 
	window. He gazes up at him as if looking for news of her.
	
	76:ARENA IMPERIA. PROJECTION BOOTH. EXT/INT.EVENING
	
	The Arena is crowded with sun-burnt faces. On screen, scenes from
	Ulysses. On a shelf in the projection booth, there is an enormous pack of 
	letters. SALVATORE is worn out. The waiting has destroyed him. He looks
	like a madman. As he winds up one of the parts of the film, he repeats
	her name obsessively, under his breath.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Elena...Elena...Elena...
	
	Now he is sitting outside on the back steps, a few yards from the
	sea. There is a breeze this evening, the waves are rather high and
	the boats of 'gate-crashers' can be seen out in the water, rolling
	fitfully but not dangerously. SALVATORE stretches out, gazes up
	at the inky sky and talks to himself, just like a madman,
	whispering...
	
				SALVATORE  
		When will this shitty summer be over? 
			(Half shutting his eyes) 
		In a film it'd already be finished...
			(Smiling)
		...Fade-out and cut to a nice 
		thunderstorm!!! Huh? that'd be 
		perfect!
	
	A clap of thunder explodes in the air. Loud, rumbling. SALVATORE'S eyes pop 
	open. The Arena audience looks up in alarm at the sky...The 'gate-crashers' in 
	the boats also look up and see a streak of lightning ushering in another clap of 
	thunder. One of those storms is building up that ruins late summer 
	nights. SALVATORE gives a contented smile as the cloudburst pours down 
	violently, suddenly... The Arena audience scatters with a howl and scurries 
	over to the overhanging roofs of the projection booth, to take shelter and to go
	on watching the film despite the rain...
	
	The LITTLE BOYS in the boats quickly pull tarpaulins over their
	heads...But SALVATORE does not get up. He lets the rain fall on him,
	goes on laughing, incredulous and stunned as if a real miracle had
	taken place. And as he shuts his eyes and lifts his head up, to
	catch more rain on his face, and gives himself up to that marvellous feeling of 
	joy, a mouth comes to rest passionately on his lips it is ELENA. SALVATORE opens 
	his eyes in utter amazement, it seems like a vision, another hallucination 
	created by the rain...Instead no, it is really her! 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Elena!...But when...
	
				ELENA  
		I got back today. You can't imagine 
		the excuses I had to make up to be 
		here...
	
	SALVATORE's lips interrupt her. It is an intense, a stupendous kiss. They've 
	probably never been so happy as they are at that moment. They cling to each 
	other as the rain goes on streaming over their bodies, mingling her hair with 
	his, binding them ever closer.
	
	77  CINEMA PARADISO. ENTRANCE. EXT. DAY
	
	Autumn has arrived. In the streets, the PEASANTS prepare the barrels
	for preserving the grape must. ALFREDO is sitting in front of the Cinema 
	Paradiso with SPACCAFICO and the USHER. It is a quiet moment, they chat, while 
	the humming of the projector and the sound track of the film can be heard 
	through the window of the booth. The MAILMAN stops and hands SPACCAFICO a folded 
	sheet of paper.
	
				MAILMAN  
		Don Ciccio, this is for Toto. Give it 
		him...
			(And he pedals off on his 
			bicycle.)
	
				ALFREDO  
		What is it?
	
	SPACCAFICO unfolds it, reads it, claps his hands on his head, in alarm.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Holy blood of Judas! Now what am I 
		going to do??!
	
	78  UNIVERSITY. EXT. DAY
	
	ELENA is waiting near the University. She paces nervously back and
	forth. Glances at her watch. He's late. She looks around in all
	directions and sees him at last. He comes running up to her. They
	embrace...
	
				ELENA  
		So what'd they say?
	
				SALVATORE  
		The army says that, as a war orphan, 
		I don't have to serve in the 
		military, but nothing can be done. 
		It's a bureaucratic error. I have to 
		leave. Day after tomorrow morning. 
		They're sending me to Rome. But 
		they'll discharge me ten days later. 
		Let's go...
	
	He takes her hand, turns to go to a café. ELENA holds back. She has caught sight 
	of her FATHER's car approaching. ELENA turns to look and in a faint voice 
	reveals the reason for her nervousness.
	
				ELENA  
		No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's 
		my father.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Good, this way we can finally talk. 
		I'll convince him this time.
	
				ELENA  
		He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He 
		has other plans for me.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Who?
	
				ELENA  
		The son of one of his colleagues. 
		Don't act that way. We'll talk about 
		it later. Wait for me Thursday at the 
		Cinema Paradiso. I'll be coming with 
		the five o'clock bus. 
	
	SALVATORE looks with longing as ELENA drives away with her father. 
	ELENA gives him a meaningful look through the window. SALVATORE returns the 
	look, but stands there motionless, with a grim expression, like someone who 
	knows how to take the treacherous blows of life. The car drives off and with it 
	ELENA. Their eyes hang on the same thread. The thread of hope and now of fear.
	
	79  CINEMA PARADISO. ENTRANCE. EXT. MORNING
	
	The poster of Il Grido hangs on the billboard outside the theatre.
	SPACCAFICO replaces 'THURSDAY' with a 'TODAY' sticker. The
	CHARWOMAN is washing the floor of the lobby. SPACCAFICO shouts
	up to SALVATORE, who is in the projectionist's booth. SPACCAFICIO
	says that tomorrow he'll be leaving and today is his last day on the job,
	and he's sorry.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Toto, this is no film for the common 
		herd. One day'll be more than 
		enough...So tonight, please set up 
		tomorrow's film, so the projectionist 
		who is coming will find it ready.
	
				SALVATORE  
		OK...
	
	SPACCAFICO understands SALVATORE's sadness.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Cheer up, Toto. I'll be here waiting 
		for you. No one's taking your job 
		away from you. Don't worry!
	
	80  SQUARE AND PROJECTION BOOTH, CINEMA PARADISO. EXT/INT. DAY
	
	The bus has pulled into the square but among the people getting out
	there is no sign of ELENA. SALVATORE stands nervously up in the window of the 
	projection booth, glances at his watch. It's already five-thirty and she hasn't 
	come. He checks the projector. The first part has just begun and the reel is 
	full of film.
	
	The first part is now about to finish, the reel is almost empty, and ELENA still 
	isn't there. SALVATORE is extremely nervous, worried, mortified by his meeting 
	with her FATHER. 
	He sees ELENA's face pulling away in the car. Thinks back over her 
	terrible confession. He paces back and forth, as if he were in a prison cell, 
	thinking up solutions...The stair light finally goes on; there she is SALVATORE 
	dashes over and down the stairs to meet her. He comes down the final turn of the 
	spiral staircase and finds himself face to face with ALFREDO, who is slowly 
	making his way up with the help of his cane. SALVATORE freezes to the spot. 
	ALFREDO senses his disappointment. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		You weren't expecting me? 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Nervously) 
		No, Alfredo, I was coming to help 
		you...
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Smiling) 
		You were expecting her? Huh? 
			(SALVATORE doesn't answer. 
			He's too worried, too 
			upset. ALFREDO climbs 
			another step, whispering.)
		...It's a nasty business waiting by 
		yourself. In company it's better. 
		No?...Then I'll leave. 
	
	As usual ALFREDO'S sweetness comforts SALVATORE, indeed suddenly gives him a 
	bold idea, one that quiets his nervousness. He puts a hand on ALFREDO'S 
	shoulder.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo, I need your help!
	
	8I  ROAD TO THE CITY. EXT. AFTERNOON 
	
	The Balilla speeds as fast as it can down the road to the city, where ELENA s 
	family has gone to live. SALVATORE drives along in a state of agitation. The 
	idea of having to leave without seeing ELENA is his obsession. An obsession he 
	refuses to accept...
	
	82 CINEMA PARADISO.PROJECTION BOOTH.INT.AFTERNOON
	
	The second part has begun, the reel is full. For the first time in many
	years, ALFREDO is alone in the booth, sitting in front of the projector,
	and he feels helpless. Not only because he's blind, but also because
	there is nothing he can do for SALVATORE. A strange agitation comes over him, as 
	if he were experiencing the same anxiety troubling his 'Toto' at that moment. 
	Meanwhile, the film roll on and with it, time, minutes...
	
	83  CITY.EXT.AFTERNOON
	
	SALVATORE has already reached the city. He slows down at the bus
	terminus. Looks at the people waiting, but she is not there...
	He asks several girls in front of the University. But they haven't seen
	her...
	
	He phones from a phone booth. But nobody answers. His self-control
	is about to give way to desperation...
	
	84  CINEMA PARADISO.PROJECTION BOOTH.INT.AFTERNOON
	
	On the reel there is less film. Like an hourglass with the sand trickling
	through...
	
	85:ELENAS HOUSE IN THE CITY.EXT/INT.AFTERNOON 
	
	SALVATORE comes streaking up in front of her house. He screeches to a stop, 
	dashes out like greased lightning. His nerves are tense, a slight tremor runs 
	through his whole body. He rings the bell, but nobody answers. A MAN who lives 
	in the building opens the front door and comes out. 
	
	SALVATORE seizes the chance and climbs up to the third floor. He pounds on the 
	door furiously, almost cracking his knuckles. But all to no avail; there is 
	nobody at home. He shrieks, panic stricken. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Open up! Open up! Elenaaa! 
	
	And in fact, there is somebody inside: ELENA's MOTHER. She sits there immobile, 
	without a word. 
	
	The pounding on the door reverberates in the room, but she does not budge, 
	determined to ignore that desperate message.
	
	86:CINEMA PARADISO.PROJECTION BOOTH.INT.AFTERNOON
	
	The reel spins faster. The film is almost ended. By now there is very
	little time...
	
	87  ROAD TO THE VILLAGE. EXT. SUNDOWN 
	
	And SALVATORE is on his way home, defeated. Be drives as fast as he can. Be is 
	in a terrible state, can't figure out what's happened. Can't explain it. And 
	that's what hurts. 
	
	88  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. SUNDOWN
	
	The words 'THE END' appear on the screen...and the film runs out, leaving the 
	projector turning uselessly. ALFREDO is alarmed. He can hear that the film is 
	finished, but doesn't know where to begin. He gropes around. He's scared. Like a 
	little boy calls his mother when he's lost in a crowd, so old ALFREDO calls 
	SALVATORE. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		TotooooO! TotooooO! 
	
	The few people down in the audience start whistling and complaining about the 
	film they haven't understood. 
	
				SPECTATORS  
		Lights! Christ, what a piece of 
		crap!! We want OUT money back!!! 
		Heeeeey!! Bandits!! 
	
	Others are shouting that they like the film.
	
	89  CINEMA PARADISO. ENTRANCE. EXT. SUNDOWN 
	
	The Balilla screeches to a stop in front of the theatre. SALVATORE darts out and 
	runs to the stairs...
	
	90  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. SUNDOWN 
	
	SALVATORE turns the lights on in the theatre and turns off the projector, trying 
	to calm down ALFREDO, who has got to his feet, frightened. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		But where'd you go, Toto?!! 
	
				SALVATORE  
		I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy! 
			(And he folds him into his 
			arms, like calming down a 
			little boy who has had a 
			nightmare. Be whispers, 
			still out of breath:) 
		Sit down, sit down...
			(ALFREDO quiets down as 
			SALVATORE lowers him into 
			a chair, and asks him the 
			only question upon which 
			his last hope depends.) 
		Did she come? 
	
				ALFREDO  
		No, nobody came. 
			(And he embraces him, 
			almost as if to comfort 
			him in his great 
			disappointment.)
	
	For SALVATORE it's really the end: she's not coming. Tomorrow he'll be leaving 
	without having seen her again. 
	
	SALVATORE'S hands remove the photographs of Amedeo Nazzari and of ELENA from the 
	wall, slip them into one of his pockets. 
	
	Now the hands open the metal containers of tomorrow's film, take . 
	out the reels to set them up, pick up the receipt - his last before leaving - 
	and with the same mechanical gesture, hang it on a nail, as usual.
	
	91  ROME. VARIOUS SETTINGS, MILITARY LIFE. EXT/ INT. DAY/NIGHT 
	
	A wild frenetic sequence, set to the pace of military life...SALVATORE, in 
	uniform with close-cropped hair, answers his superior, shouts: 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Radio Operator Di Vita Salvatore! 
		Third Battalion, Ninth Company, 
		sir!!!
	
	Target practice. SALVATORE fires all the shots in the cartridge, one after the 
	other... 
	
	A SECOND LIEUTENANT barks out a march rhythm in the blazing sun. 
	
				SECOND LIEUTENANT  
		One, two, one, two!! Attention! Left 
		march! 
	
	SALVATORE sneaks out of line, goes over and slips a letter into 
	the mailbox and hurries back to his place.
	
	On one of the public phones in a square of Rome, SALVATORE is phoning ELENA. 
	Nobody answers. He slams down the receiver, as the line of SOLDIERS waits its 
	turn...
	
	Night-time. A large plastic bag full of water. A thud. SALVATORE wakes up with a 
	start in a lake of ice water. He lets out a terrified shriek as the others 
	laugh, protected by the dark. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Aaaaaaah! Heeeeeelp!! 
	
	In the large dormitory, the SERGEANT is handing out the mail. He 
	throws a pile of letters on SALVATORE'S bunk. They are his letters to ELENA, 
	stamped 'ADDRESS UNKNOWN'.
	
	Mess duty. SALVATORE is washing Up, in a sea of water and grease.
	He rimes a pan full of tomato sauce with a tap hose. A spurt of red water 
	splatters him in the face. 
	
	A training run. Another letter which SALVATORE drops into the mailbox...
	
	A cold, rainy night. SALVATORE stands stiff as a poker in front of the 
	Ammunition depot. It is his first guard duty. Soaked to the skin, gazing wide-
	eyed into empty space. 
	
	COLONEL'S office. 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Aggressively) 
		Colonel, I was supposed to spend ten 
		days here and it's been about a year, 
		and I haven't ever gone borne. I'd 
		like a furlough, at least! 
	
	SALVATORE is in the guardhouse. A cold, dark, filthy cell. His nerves start to 
	give way. He bows his head in despair. 
	
	Hospital. SALVATORE is exhausted, run-down. The night-stand is jammed with 
	medicines. He lies in bed without moving, staring off into empty space, and 
	repeats obsessively in a low voice, as if talking to himself. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Elena...Elena...Elena...
			(He has touched the 
			extreme of suffering, a 
			young man who has 
			been denied love and 
			affection, his rights, 
			freedom. A NURSE comes 
			up.) 
	
				NURSE  
		Di Vita Salvatore, get ready, your 
		discharge has come through.
	
	SALVATORE registers this information with his eyes and nods absently.
	
	92  GIANCALDO. SQUARE AND STREETS. EXT. DAY 
	
	The bus disappears around the corner leaving SALVATORE standing there alone. It 
	is a blazing hot day. The sirocco wind blows the yellow dust in all directions. 
	The square is empty, the billboard in front of the closed movie house announces 
	a Western. SALVATORE puts his suitcase on the ground, looks around. Everything 
	exactly the same, immobile. Only one new feature  in the cafe there's a jukebox 
	playing 'Estate' sung by Milva. 
	
	SALVATORE turns towards the Cinema Paradiso. The projectionist is at the 
	window of the booth, smoking a cigarette. Who knows who he is, where he came 
	from. A hot flurry of dust. SALVATORE turns and sees a dog leaping around kim, 
	wagging its tail. It's the dog that kept him company during his nights beneath 
	the window. SALVATORE gives a start of joy, drops his suitcase and leans over to 
	stroke him. Then he hugs him, as if he were an old friend. 
	
	93  ALFREDO'S HOUSE. INT. AFTERNOON 
	
	SALVATORE goes to see ALFREDO. He is still in bed, has just woken up. He is glad 
	to hear his 'Toto'. He feels his forehead, his eyes and cheeks, as if to 'see' 
	him. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		You 're thinner...You can tell 
		you've not been treated well. 
			(As usual, you can't hide 
			anything from ALFREDO. 
			SALVATORE senses something 
			different in him that he 
			can't figure out, like 
			same wild restlessness 
			within). 
	
				SALVATORE  
		They tell me you never go out, never 
		talk to anybody. Why?
				
				ALFREDO  
		Toto, sooner or later there comes a 
		time when talking or keeping quiet is 
		the same thing. So it's better to 
		shut up. 
			(Changing his lone) 
		It's hot in here. Toto, take me to 
		the beach. 
	
	94  BEACH AND WATERFRONT. EXT. AFTERNOON 
	
	The sea is ruffled and the air is less sultry, easier to breathe. 
	SALVATORE and ALFREDO walk slowly along the waterfront. ALFREDO totters 
	slightly, holds on to SALVATORE, who is telling him something very funny. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		At the Christmas party the lieutenant 
		pinches a girl's ass. The girl turns 
		around: it's the daughter of the 
		commanding officer. The lieutenant is 
		scared to death and says: 'Miss, if 
		your heart is as hard as what I have 
		just touched, I'm done for! 
	
	And they roar with laughter. They look like two old school buddies telling each 
	other dirty jokes. They stop beside a low wall. ALFREDO knows that those laughs 
	are simply a way of uselessly dancing around the countless things that are 
	troubling SALVATORE. And he breaks the ice, while SALVATORE is still 
	laughing.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Seriously) 
		Did you ever see her again? 
			(SALVATORE'S laughter dies 
			away, taken off-guard as 
			he is. Then he lights a 
			cigarette.)
	
				SALVATORE  
		No. And nobody knows where she is. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		It was probably meant to be like 
		this. Each of us has a star to 
		follow. So now what are you thinking 
		of doing? 
	
	It's a terrible question, and SALVATORE has no answer to it. In fact, would 
	rather not even talk about it. He changes his tone, as if he hadn't heard it, 
	laughs, trying again to ding to the funny jokes he heard during military 
	service.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Listen to this one...The commander 
		says to the sergeant: 'You 
		remember that windmill that used to 
		be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the 
		mill's gone but the wind's still 
		there!' 
			(And he bursts into 
			nervous laughter. But this 
			time ALFREDO remains cold, 
			unmoved, does not laugh 
			with him. SALVATORE 
			gradually falls silent. He 
			doesn't know what to say. 
			For the first time in his 
			life, he doesn't know what 
			goal to aim for, doesn't 
			know what to do. The cloud 
			of smoke wreaths his 
			nervous face, now he seems 
			to relax, whispers:) 
		You remember the story of the soldier 
		and the princess? 
			(ALFREDO nods his head.) 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Now I understand why the soldier went 
		away just before the end. That's 
		right, just one more night and the 
		princess would have been his. But 
		she, also, could not have kept her 
		promise. And...that would have been 
		terrible, he would have died from it. 
		So instead, for ninety-nine nights at 
		least he had lived with the illusion 
		that she was there waiting for him...
			(This time SALVATORE is 
			the one to explain 
			something to ALFREDO. And 
			ALFREDO realizes how 
			bitter his story is and, 
			above all, that the boy 
			standing there is no 
			longer a boy...) 
	
				ALFREDO  
		Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! 
		This land is cursed. 
			(They are now leaning 
			against a boat on the 
			beach. ALFREDO goes on 
			whispering his words.) 
		When you're here every day you feel 
		like you're at the center
		of the universe, it seems like 
		nothing ever changes. Then you go 
		away, one year, two...And when you 
		come back, everything's different. 
		The thread has broken. You don't 
		find those you were looking for, your 
		things no longer exist. Isn't that 
		the case?...You've got to go away a 
		long time, for many, many years, 
		before coming back and finding your 
		people again, the land where 
		you were born...But not now, it's 
		impossible. Now you're blinder than I 
		am.
			(Intense words, straight 
			from the heart, and 
			SALVATORE is spellbound. 
			He whispers with a smile:) 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Who said that? Gary Cooper, James 
		Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
			(ALFREDO also gives a 
			gentle smile) 
	
				ALFREDO  
		No, Toto, nobody said it. I say it! 
		Life's not like you saw it in the 
		movies. Life...is harder. 
			(He lays his hand on 
			SALVATORE'S shoulder, 
			gives it a hard squeeze.) 
		Get out! Go back to Rome. You 're 
		young, the world is yours! And I'm 
		old...I don't want to hear you talk 
		any more, I want to hear talk about 
		you. 
	
	SALVATORE gives a shudder that runs through his very soul. The setting sun lies 
	colorless on the horizon.
	
	95  VARIOUS SETTINGS. EXT/INT. NIGHT 
	
	Night. The square is empty. SALVATORE is sitting on the church steps. 
	His head in his hands. He has to make a decision leave or stay. And why?... 
	'What decision will he make?' is the question that keeps ALFREDO awake, in his 
	hot dark bedroom...
	
	MARIA, his mother, also can't get to sleep. She knows, senses, that her son is 
	on the verge of an important turning-point. But what will he decide? What will 
	happen?...
	
	Also LIA, his sister, feels a strange, heavy tension in the air. And 
	doesn't sleep. She's probably wondering where SALVATORE is at that 
	hour... 
	
	He's sitting on the ground. But even if he were to go to bed he wouldn't 
	sleep. He rubs his face with his hand. The church bell chimes four a.m...
	
	ALMOST THIRTY YEARS LATER, another distant bell is chiming four a.m. And 
	SALVATORE is once again wide awake. He is thinking, with his hand on his face, 
	just like then. And the same decision to make: what to do? Stretched out beside 
	a sleeping WOMAN, he goes on staring at the window. Outside, the storm has 
	passed. The long memory has almost faded, only the sound of a train surfaces in 
	his mind...
	
	96  GIANCALDO RAILWAY STATION. EXT. DAY
	
	It's the train that THIRTY YEARS EARLIER had pulled into the station
	of his home town before leaving for Rome. SALVATORE hugs his 
	MOTHER and SISTER. The moment has come to say goodbye to  
	ALFREDO. The old man is deeply moved. A heart-rending trembling
	comes into his husky voice. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		Don't come back any more, don't think 
		about us, don't turn round, don't 
		write, don't give in to nostalgia. 
		Forget us all. If you can't hear it 
		and come back, don't come looking for 
		me, I won't let you into the house, 
		you understand? 
	
	They clasp each other tightly, as if they knew they wouldn't be meeting 
	again...
	
				SALVATORE  
		Thanks for all you've done for me. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		Whatever you do, love it like you 
		loved that projection booth of the 
		Paradiso when you were little...
			(The train moves now. 
			Hands wave in the air, 
			drawing further and 
			further away. The PRIEST 
			has arrived at the last 
			moment and waves goodbye 
			from the distance.)
	
				PRIEST  
			(Shouting) 
		Goodbye, TotooooooO!!! I got here too 
		late. What a shame! 
	
	The figure of ALFREDO and the others can no longer be distinguished. Only a 
	distant blur at the end of the track. 
	
	97  PUNTA RAISI AIRPORT. EXT. DAY 
	
	THIRTY YEARS LATER, a plane flies over Sicily. It lands on the 
	runway char seems to emerge from the sea and flatten out towards the slopes of 
	the dark mountains. Salvatore's face appears among the clouds reflected in one 
	of the plane windows. He has the tense look of the man who suddenly comes home 
	after the adventure of life has carried him afar, wandering the world, where he 
	has forgotten everything. From the plane window to another window...
	
	98  SUPERHIGHWAY. INT/EXT. DAY 
	
	...the window of the taxi-cab driving SALVATORE to his home town. The scenery 
	moving by on either side of the road summons up sweet memories. A lot of things 
	have changed, but the colors are still the same. The yellow running through the 
	entire landscape is unmistakable. And all those black birds perched in a row on 
	the guard-rail are crows. 
	
	The cab now approaches the outskirts of Giancaldo. But if the sign, 
	hadn't been there with the name on it, it could be an entirely different 
	place...
	
	99  SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. EXT/INT. DAY
	
	The house where SALVATORE'S MOTHER lives is also new, nearer the 
	sea. 
	
	The old lady is sitting alone in an armchair in the parlor, knitting a white 
	sweater. Her hands move very swiftly, almost mechanically. 
	
	The hands of a woman who is waiting. The front doorbell rings twice. MARIA stops 
	short. That is what she has been waiting for. She mumbles in excitement. 
	
				MARIA  
		It's Toto...I knew it...
	
	And she scrambles to her feet, dropping her knitting in the chair, one needle 
	dangling over the edge. She hurries off, forgetting that she still has the ball 
	of white yarn in her apron pocket. And the yarn runs off the needles and the 
	knitting comes undone quickly as she moves about the house, goes down the stairs 
	to the front door.   
	
	There the yam stops and MARIA' s excited voice is heard.
	
				MARIA 'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		Toto!...
	
				SALVATORE'S VOICE (Off-screen) 
		How are you, Mamma?... 
	
	The camera now moves, discovering them through the parlor window, hugging each 
	other outside the front door. Under the curious eyes of an old bored dog.
	
	100  SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. INT. DAY 
	
	MARIA is no longer wearing an apron. Mother and son are sitting side 
	by side at the kitchen table...
	
				MARIA  
		Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll 
		see. And you won't recognize the 
		kids any more, they're grown up by 
		now. 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Smiling) 
		They're always writing to me saying 
		they want to come to Rome!
	
	SALVATORE looks around; It's a place he's never seen before, and yet it's 
	his mother's house.)
	 
				MARIA  
		See how pretty the house is? We did 
		everything over.
			(Smiling) 
		If it hadn't been for you! 
			(Getting up) 
		Come, I have a surprise.... 
			(She takes him by the hand 
			and leads him out to the 
			hallway. SALVATORE looks 
			at her and feels a pang. 
			She seems smaller, age 
			withers the body, she is 
			slightly stooped, her hair 
			is gathered into a knot at 
			the back other head.)
		You must be tired. If you want to 
		rest, there's time before the 
		funeral. 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Interrupting her) 
		No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by 
		air, you know. 
	
				MARIA  
			(Smiling, ironically) 
		You shouldn't tell me that now. After 
		all these years! 
			(SALVATORE gets the 
			message, feels guilty. 
			Thinking about it, it 
			seems incredible that he 
			has never come before. 
			MARIA opens a door, steps 
			aside to let her son in, 
			whispers:) 
		I put all your things in here. Go in, 
		go in...
	
	SALVATORE lakes a few steps, is flabbergasted at the sight of his old room 
	perfectly reconstructed and preserved. It looks like a museum, the museum of the 
	past. Despite the bed, the clothes in the cupboard, the books on the shelves, it 
	is perfectly clear that no one has ever lived in it and never will live in it. 
	MARIA senses his perturbation, remains standing in the doorway as if to leave 
	him alone...SALVATORE goes over to the bed, looks around  the old 8mm movie 
	camera, the projector, his documentaries, the bicycle hanging on the wall, the 
	photographs of his favorite movie stars. But what mostly catches his eye is a 
	tiny framed photograph: SALVATORE as a little boy and ALFREDO, standing smiling 
	in front of the Cinema Paradiso. Strange, at that time ALFREDO was younger than 
	he is now! It's as if he were standing there before him one last time. That 
	impressive figure, his good-natured bur firm look, touches his heart. From 
	ALFREDO'S smiling face to...
	
	101  GIANCALDO. MAIN STREET AND SQUARE. EXT. DAY 
	
	...the coffin where his old blind friend rests for ever. The funeral
	procession winds its way down the main street. At the intersections, , 
	cars stop to let the black hearse pass by. People cross themselves. The old men 
	remove their hats. Store shutters are lowered. Then, when the procession has 
	passed by, the cars start up again, the old men put their hats back on, the 
	shutters are pulled up. 
	
	SALVATORE is in the front row with his MOTHER, next to ALFREDO'S WIDOW. 
	SIGNORA ANNA says in a whisper, her eyes fixed on the coffin.  
	
				ANNA  
		He would have been happy you came, 
		Toto. He always talked about you. 
		Always! Right to the end! He was 
		terribly fond of you...
			(Tears come to her, she is 
			unable to say any more. 
			SALVATORE gives her a hug, 
			deeply touched by her 
			words.) 
		He left two things for you. Come see 
		me before you leave. 
	
	SALVATORE nods his head. He gazes intensely at the coffin covered with flowers 
	and is grieved as if he were ashamed never to have come to see the man who had 
	been like a father to him. But why had he forgotten him? Up in front, leading 
	the procession, he sees a young PRIEST with an altar boy beside him, and these 
	figures are also like chisels scraping the rust off his soul and bringing old 
	feelings to light again. 
	
	The procession reaches the square. The dark column stands etched in the dazzling 
	early-afternoon light. SIGNORA ANNA motions the driver and the procession comes 
	to a halt. It is ALFREDO'S last farewell to the place where he had spent the 
	best years of his life  the Cinema Paradiso. Everyone turns to look and 
	SALVATORE also turns, taken by surprise...It has fallen to pieces: doors and 
	windows boarded shut, crumbling walls, a piece of the sign dangling down, weeds 
	and mildew in the cracks and on the roof. The square has changed completely, is 
	unrecognizable. Buildings, stores, sign boards and lines of cars creeping at a 
	snail's pace in a deafening chorus of honking horns. And the central square has 
	turned motorcycles. SALVATORE turns slowly to look behind him, towards the small 
	crowd, and is entranced by the unexpected sight of faces that he recognizes at 
	once, despite the many years that have gone by:  the MAN AT THE BOX OFFICE, the 
	USHER who also served as bill-poster, the CHARWOMAN, the CARABINIERE SERGEANT, 
	and further on behind ROSA and ANGELO, the lovebirds who had met in the movie 
	house and then got married. They all have white hair. And they too have 
	recognized him, give little hello nods and gestures. Another face 
	he seems to recognize: why sure, it's SPACCAFICO, the owner. How old he's 
	become! He also looks up and his eyes meet SALVATORE'S. A hello nod. 
	SALVATORE makes his way over to him through the crowd. They shake hands 
	heartily, without a word, both touched. The procession starts up again. 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Under his breath) 
		How long's it been shut? 
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Six years ago this May. No one came 
		any more. You "know better than me, 
		Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, 
		videos. By now the movie business is 
		only a dream. The city's bought it 
		now to make a new parking lot. Next 
		Saturday they're 
		tearing it down...A pity!...
	
	SALVATORE is disconcerted, irritated by that 'Mr. Di Vita'. Besides, finding 
	out that the movie house is to be torn down depresses him, after all, it's a 
	piece of his life...And all those curious faces staring at him.
	
				SALVATORE  
		But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? 
		It didn't used to be that way...
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Well, it's hard to call an important 
		person by his first name. But if it 
		really matters to you, I'11 call 
		you...
			(Smiling) 
		Toto!...
	
	SALVATORE smiles at that. Meanwhile, the procession has reached the church. 
	SALVATORE excuses himself and goes over to the hearse. Old SPACCAFICO watches 
	him go, then says, almost to himself) 
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Bless you, Toto. 
	
	The coffin is unloaded. SALVATORE has asked to be one of the 
	bearers into the church. As he moves off slowly with that weight 
	on his shoulder, somebody catches his eye on the other side of the sidewalk. An 
	old woman, sixty or seventy years old, with a plastic bag in her hand. She 
	crosses herself quickly. SALVATORE recognizes her  she was the one he made love 
	with for the first time. TERESA, the prostitute. The coffin is carried into the 
	church, followed by the little procession. 
	
	102  SALVATORE' S MOTHER'S HOUSE. EXT/INT. EVENING 
	
	The little house is sunk in the darkness of evening and the ground floor
	windows are lit up. The rustling of the sea can be heard. The family is having 
	supper. The table is set with the finest silver and the company china has been 
	brought out. LIA is also there with her husband, ALFIO, and their two children. 
	FILIPPO, fifteen, and SARA, thirteen. The television is on, but the sound has 
	been turned practically all the way down. SALVATORE'S presence arouses a special 
	excitement. The children look at their uncle with a certain awe, after all they 
	don't really know him. 
	
				SARA  
			(Playfully) 
		Uncle, the next time Granny comes to 
		Rome, I want to come along too. I 
		want to see what you do when you 
		work...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Smiling) 
		Fine. But I warn you, there isn't 
		much to see. I sell much more smoke 
		than fire...
	
	The CHILDREN laugh. At the sight of them, LIA, ALFIO and MARIA also smile.
	
				ALFIO 
			(To SALVATORE) 
		Watch out, don't get too familiar 
		with those two 
			(indicating the children)
		they're worse than cannibals. They'll 
		take advantage. 
	
	Everybody laughs again. Even MARIA laughs a lot. SALVATORE looks at her; he had 
	never seen her laugh like that, amused, at peace.
	
				FILIPPO  
		You leaving tomorrow, Uncle? 
	
	SALVATORE doesn't know what to say. He feels drunk. It has been a day of violent 
	upheavals, a series of almost overwhelming emotions and now he knows nothing  on 
	the one hand, he' d like to stay, let himself drift on the sweet tide of family 
	life, be completely carried off by the rolling waves of his own past: on the 
	other, he wishes he had never come. He forces himself to smile again.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I don't know, Filippo. I don't 
		know...
	
	They go on eating, but SALVATORE isn't very hungry. Re peers at LIA eating out 
	of the comer of his eye, feels deeply bound to her  she has a few white hairs 
	and light wrinkles line her face. 
	
	Then he looks at her husband, ALFIO, he's going bald but he tries to hide it by 
	combing over the little hair left. Who knows what their marriage is like, he 
	wonders. He looks back at LIA, and it's as if she sensed it, she looks up, 
	guesses the nature of his thoughts, imagines what he is trying to figure out, a 
	blush colors her cheeks and she smiles. SALVATORE returns a conniving smile.
	The ringing of a phone. SARA starts to get up to go and answer it, hut MARIA 
	stops her with a glance of the eye.
	
				MARIA  
			(To SALVATORE) 
		It must be for you...They've been 
		calling all afternoon. They wanted to 
		know if you're leaving this evening 
		or tomorrow...
	
	Everyone turns to SALVATORE with questioning looks, making him feel even more 
	restless and undecided. The phone goes on ringing.
	
	103  CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. DAY . 
	
	The TRAFFIC cops are trying to break the front door down with their
	shoulders. Once, twice, and at last, the door flies open with a screech, 
	kicking up a cloud of dust. SALVATORE enters by himself...
	
	104  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY 
	
	SALVATORE'S silhouette stands out against the light in the open door. S lowly he 
	makes his way into the empty theatre. A thick layer of dust lends everything a 
	gray, rarefied look. The light streaming in from the windows up above teems with 
	strange mates of dust, like a haze. 
	
	Cobwebs hang like long veils from the ceiling. SALVATORE walks down the middle 
	aisle. The rows of seats are unhinged, what was once the wooden veneer has 
	warped from the dampness. He looks around as if he Were thumbing through the 
	album of his memories.  
	
	The screen dangles from its frame. The emergency exits are boarded 
	and nailed shut. Observing the emptiness of the theatre, SALVATORE 
	has the feeling he can hear the howling, the whistling and voices of the . 
	audience, as he remembers it. But only for one brief moment, then the silence 
	returns. A mouse creeps along one wall, stops near a pile of dust. SALVATORE is 
	attracted by that little gray mass. He goes over as the mouse scampers off, 
	takes a closer look and recognizes the shape of half a lion's head covered with 
	dust. He moves it with his foot, then looks up at the projection booth, 
	repeating the same gesture of bygone years. But the lion's head is no longer 
	there, only the outline of it on the wall, and cobwebs have covered the hales of 
	the booth, those little square openings that had caused him such long suffering 
	as a little boy...SALVATORE now climbs up the spiral staircase. Each step kicks 
	up a little cloud of dust. 
	
	The little booth, yellow with fumes, appears before him again. Now it 
	looks like some big, empty cave. The projector is no longer there, nor 
	the equipment. Who knows where they junked them?! The only thing left is a clump 
	of film strips still attached to the wall: trailers, Part One 
	endings, etc...There he had kissed ELENA for the first time, and
	strips of film like those had grazed their faces. Now they are caught up
	in the coils of cobwebs. And where the film-winder once stood, the
	nails remain with thousands of yellowing receipts. Of all the films 
	shown at the Cinema Paradiso Palace. And three more boxfuls of 
	them are on the floor. 
	
	And the windows overlooking the square are bolted shut and the glass   
	broken. SALVATORE peers out of one of the cracks in the window and
	sees the village...which is now a city. A different world he no longer 
	knows. 
	
	105  CAFÉ IN SQUARE. INT/EXT. DAY 
	
	The cafe in the square has been completely renovated. The CASHIER and BARMEN 
	have young, unfamiliar faces. SALVATORE holds out the receipt with a tip. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		A double whisky, please. 
	
	Several BOYS are sitting at the comer tables, talking about girls. Others stand 
	playing 'war games', shake around to the obsessive strains of same electronic 
	tune. 
	
	A man comes up to SALVATORE and asks for his autograph. Then SALVATORE turns to 
	the plate-glass window overlooking the main street, where the workers' club once 
	was. And like a flash, a shudder freezes him to the spot.... Two steps away 
	from 
	him, through the glass, a stunning vision, which casts him beyond time, chills 
	his blood: there before him is ELENA! But she is still young, young as she was 
	then! Sweet, luminous, alluring, exactly the way he saw her the first time at 
	the station. 
	
	She is waiting to go across the street with a bunch of books under her 
	arm...Have the passing years had no effect on her? Or is she an hallucination? 
	No! It's a dream! Or is he dead too, like ALFREDO? SALVATORE doesn't know how to 
	explain it. And he is suddenly seized by a feeling of panic. His glass drops to 
	the floor...As the GIRL walks off... 
	
	106  GIANCALDO. STREET. EXT. DAY 
	
	At the age of fifty-five, SALVATORE feels no scruples about wandering
	the streets of his home town, spying from a distance on an eighteen- year-old 
	girl. There's nothing he can do about it. He stares at her with the amazement of 
	someone who discovers that miracles exist. Now he is nearer to her. How lovely 
	she is! It's her, no doubt about it! Exactly the same. Except she has a 
	different hair-do and is wearing different clothes:  ELENA didn't wear slacks. 
	The GIRL goes up to a parked motorcycle. She removes the padlock and fastens her 
	books to the rack. SALVATORE is standing there a few steps away, and without 
	stopping to think, moves a little closer, discreetly, politely.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Excuse me, Miss...
			(She turns to look at him, 
			indifferent, but friendly. 
			He looks at her wonderful 
			blue eyes.) 
		I'm so sorry, I thought you were 
		someone else. 
			
				GIRL  
			(Shrugging) 
		Well. 
	
	She has already started the motor of her bike. A flip of the accelerator and 
	off she goes, her hair flying in the wind. 
	
	SALVATORE follows her with his eyes until she disappears around the corner.
	
	107  SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. INT. AFTERNOON 
	
	The old shots of ELENA getting off the train and walking away, casting a curious 
	look at the camera...SALVATORE is watching her again, projected on the white 
	wall of his room. He also watches the other shots of those happy long-gone days  
	the picnic,. she at the beach, smiling, joyful...And again SALVATORE doesn't 
	understand, or doesn't want to understand. But these scenes could have been shot 
	yesterday, so identical to ELENA is the girl he saw on the street...And the 
	wound which he thought had healed years ago, starts bleeding again. 
	
	The lingering note of suffering for a romance that had ended without his ever 
	knowing why, and the endless explanations that had been sifted through by his 
	young mind, start slipping through his soul again, like those shots 
	slipping again through an old 8mm projector. 
	
	Through the crack of the door, MARIA sees those images on the wall, SALVATORE 
	rocking his head back and forth slowly, like he used to do as a boy when he 
	cried. She somehow feels his grief, his bitterness, lowers her eyes and walks 
	away without a word, as the little shiny rectangle on the wall remains blank, 
	empty...And SALVATORE sits there gazing at it, as if he saw other scenes which 
	his camera never set down on film, only his memory. 
	 
	108  HIGH SCHOOL. STREETS AND LITTLE SQUARE. EXT. DAY 
	
	The HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS are coming out after school. Happy young faces. That 
	GIRL 's motorcycle can be seen in a rear-view mirror. SALVATORE is at the wheel 
	of the car ALFIO has lent him. He has obviously followed that motorcycle before. 
	He waits with an eagerness he thought he had long lost, a determination to 
	understand, to get to the bottom of the matter, which frightens him and at the 
	same time overwhelms him hopelessly. 
	
	And here she comes. She unlocks the padlock and prepares to speed off. SALVATORE 
	starts the motor and follows her a short distance away. The GIRL heads for the 
	new residential district on the outskirts. 
	
	109  SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. INT. DAY 
	
	MARIA is setting the table. LIA and her family are eating at her 
	house today. SALVATORE is sitting again, with a lighted cigarette, 
	gazing through the window at the shrubs tossing in the wind and the 
	rolling sea. The air whistling through the cracks of the windows lends a 
	heaviness to the silence, like the troubled look on his face. MARIA glances at 
	him. 
	
				MARIA  
		What are you thinking, Toto? 
	
	SALVATORE looks at the old woman's lovely face, a faint smile. on his lips. 
	There was always something like an unspoken rule between them, the rule of 
	silence, of unconfessed complicity. And now he feels that rule has to be broken. 
	He speaks quietly, as if to curb the tumult of his feelings of guilt.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I was thinking...that we've never 
		talked, Mamma...When I was little I 
		saw you as if you were already old. 
		That's probably true with all kids...
		Who knows? 
			(She nods, then sits down 
			before him. He strokes her 
			old, skinny, heavily 
			veined hands...) 
		But only now do I realize you were 
		young, you were beautiful, had a 
		whole life before you. But how...
			(Sighing) 
		...how could you have lived alone 
		all that time, with no one to look 
		after you? You could have 
		remarried...Why not? At the time I 
		probably wouldn't have understood, 
		but I would have later...
	
	MARIA doesn't answer, but she is not troubled. An inner peace lends her a sweet, 
	quiet expression. Then she too agrees to break the rule of silence. 
	
				MARIA  
		I never had anybody. If that's what 
		you think...I didn't want anybody. I 
		always remained faithful. First to 
		your father, then to you, to Lia. 
			(With a shrug) 
		That's the way I'm made, there's 
		nothing I can do about it. 
			(Smiling) 
		And you're like me, you're too honest 
		and too attached to the things you
		love...But I don't know if that's a 
		good thing. Faithfulness is a bad 
		business. If you're faithful, you're 
		always alone! 
			(SALVATORE is immersed in 
			the profound truth of 
			those words. And he says 
			nothing. The silence is 
			broken by the ringing of 
			the phone. A menacing 
			sound, which SALVATORE 
			cannot bear. He knows they 
			are calling him from Rome, 
			gives a nervous gesture, 
			stands up and pulls out 
			the plug. The silence 
			returns, the whistling of 
			the wind. MARIA lowers her 
			eyes.) 
		It's my fault! It would have been 
		better if I hadn't called you... 
	
	SALVATORE sits down again, leaning closer to her. He stubs out his cigarette in 
	the already overflowing ashtray.
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Whispering) 
		No...It's nothing to do with you. 
		It's just that I was scared of coming 
		back. Now, after all these years, I 
		thought I was strong, that I had 
		forgotten lots of things. Instead, I 
		find it's quite the opposite, as if I 
		had never left. And yet, I look at 
		Lia and feel as if I didn't know her, 
		and you, Mamma...I abandoned you, 
		ran away like a thief, thought only 
		of myself, and never gave you 
		an explanation...
	
				MARIA  
			(Interrupting him) 
		And I never asked for one! You have 
		nothing to explain. I always thought 
		that what you did was right, and that 
		was that. With no beating around the 
		bush...
			(Smiling, playing it down) 
		Only one thing made me suffer: 
		bolting the door shut before going to 
		bed at night...
	
				SALVATORE  
		You never used to do that! 
	
	She smiles like a little girl who is about to confess the fibs she has told.
	
				MARIA  
		No, no...When you used to work at 
		the movies, I could never get to 
		sleep at night until you came home. 
		Then when you arrived, I pretended to 
		be asleep, but I heard all your 
		movements. Then when you fell asleep, 
		I'd get up and bolt the door. Then, 
		when you left, every time I did it, I 
		felt as if I had left somebody 
		outside the door, far away.... 
			(SALVATORE listens to his 
			MOTHER'S words, surprised 
			and entranced by the 
			poetry of her way of 
			speaking...) 
		But you were right to leave. You 
		succeeded in doing what you wanted to 
		do...
			(Sighing) 
		When I call you, a different, woman 
		always answers. I pretend I know them 
		so they won't have to go through the 
		embarrassment of introducing 
		themselves. 
			(Smiling) 
		I'm sure they take me for a crazy old 
		woman. But so far I've never heard 
		one voice that really loves you...I 
		would have known. And yet, I'd like 
		to see you...settled down...fall in 
		love...
			(Gazing into his eyes) 
		But your life's there. Here there are 
		nothing but ghosts, Toto! Let it go. 
	
	She has said this with a subtle allusiveness in her voice. And SALVATORE 
	realizes she has always known everything. But he doesn't' answer her. 
	They look at each other a Long time without speaking. Their rule of conniving 
	silence has come back into play, as before, forever. It is her expression that 
	tells him to leave, to take the plane and fly away...
	
	110  SMALL SQUARE AND HOUSE. INT/EXT. EVENING 
	
	But SALVATORE has not taken his MOTHER'S advice. Re has not left. Something 
	holds him there still, leads him to go on looking. 
	
	The GIRL'S motorcycle is parked in the courtyard beyond the gate of a small 
	house. He is studying it from inside the car parked in a corner of the small 
	square, near a café. Re has been there some while, but is not nervous, waits 
	there with determination...
	
	Several windows in the house are lit, but no one can be seen through 
	the curtains. Nothing but shadows pass by every now and then. Now the light in 
	one of the windows goes out, and the light on the stair goes on. The front door 
	opens and the GIRL comes out with a tall, sturdy- looking, elegantly dressed 
	GENTLEMAN around fifty. 
	
	They converse bur are too far away for their voices to be heard. SALVATORE 
	watches them come out the gate and climb into a car. They look like father and 
	daughter. The car now drives off and passes right by him. A gleam of light, 
	the reflection from the headlights, falls on the GENTLEMAN'S face. He recognizes 
	him at once, from the birthmark on his temple...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(To himself) 
		Boccia! 
	
	His eyes flash, he's afraid he's understood. And now the craze to get to the 
	bottom of it all gnaws away at him. There is no turning back. 
	
	111 CAFÉ. AND SMALL SQUARE. INT/EXT. EVENING 
	
	SALVATORE'S hands rifle through a phone directory. He is in the cafe, on the 
	other side of the glass door leading to the little square. His finger 
	runs down the column of names...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Mumbling) 
		His last name was Lo Meo, Vincenzo. 
	
	He has already put the token into the slot and dials the number, looking at the 
	two lit upstairs windows of that house, where the mystery of his life may be 
	hiding. SALVATORE hears the first ring, his heart in his throat...A shadow 
	appears in one of the windows. And a voice answers. 
	
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		Hello? 
			(It's a woman's voice. 
			SALVATORE shuts his eyes, 
			is about to speak, but the 
			lump in his throat 
			silences him...) 
	
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		Hello? Hello? 
	
	He still hesitates, can' t get a word out, as if he had lost his voice or 
	didn't know what to say. He hangs up. The shadow at the window also hangs up, 
	then disappears... 
	
	SALVATORE is at a loss, sits down at one of the rabies near the 
	phone in the almost empty cafe. At the far end, a group of five people watching 
	television.
	
				BARMAN  
		You want something? 
	
	And he turns back to the television. SALVATORE lights a cigarette. He is 
	uncertain. Once again he has to lake an important decision  redial the number 
	and seek a face behind that shadow? Or forget the whole thing, the GIRL, BOCCIA, 
	the shadow, and go away? Yes, best go away. He gets up and leaves. He can be 
	seen through the window turning the comer. A pack of cigarettes and a lighter 
	lie on the table, he has forgotten them. And the lighted cigarette bums down in 
	the ashtray. A few moments have gone by. Footsteps, and a hand picks up the 
	lighter and the cigarettes. It is SALVATORE who now, on a sudden urge, slips 
	another token into the slot. The shadow reappears at the window. The same voice 
	as before.
	 
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		Hello, who's speaking? 
	
	SALVATORE answers at last, keeping his eyes shut, whispering:
	 
				SALVATORE  
		I'd like to speak to Signora Elena...
	
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		Speaking. Who is it, please? 
	
	SALVATORE feels a terrible pang, continues:
	
				SALVATORE  
		Salvatore. 
	
	Silence, charged with tension. Then the voice continues weakly, as if puzzled.
	
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		Salvatore...who? 
	
	He runs his hand over his forehead, his eyes, as if to soothe the turmoil he 
	feels inside.
	
				SALVATORE 
		Di Vita. Salvatore Di Vita. Do you 
		remember? 
			(Another pause chilly, 
			heavy. SALVATORE opens his 
			eyes, looks at the window. 
			Her shadow is motionless, 
			as if cut out of 
			cardboard.) 
		Elena, I'm here, in the bar, across 
		the street from your house. 
	
	The shadow moves slowly, a hand pulls aside the curtain. It's a moment of heart-
	rending emotion...She appears. And they see each other from a distance, after 
	thirty years, each of them with a phone receiver to their ear. But she is 
	somewhat in the dark, against the light, it's impossible to make out her 
	features. Her voice gives a sudden start, instantly controlled.
	 
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		Certainly, I remember...
	
	SALVATORE'S eyes glisten, try to pierce the distance and the darkness to get a 
	better look, but in vain. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Elena. I'd like to see you...Let's 
		meet. 
	
	ELENA lets the curtain drop and goes back to being a shadow. She whispers the 
	words.
	
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		It's been so long. Why should we 
		meet? What good would it do? 
	
				SALVATORE 
		Please, don't say no.. . 
	
	But her voice is firm, unshakeable, even if quivering with emotion.
	
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		I'm old, Salvatore. And you too. It's 
		best not to meet. Goodbye. 
	
	The shadow hangs up, disappears. The light goes off.
	
	112  DIFFERENT SETTINGS. INT/EXT. EVENING 
	
	The wind is stronger now, the streets and the square are empty. SALVATORE 
	is at the wheel of the car, driving aimlessly around the town. He has 
	rediscovered the woman who conditioned his whole life and they hadn't had the 
	courage to meet. An obsessive musical heat, fraught with rage, pours out of the 
	car radio. 
	
	113  SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. INT. EVENING 
	
	A phone ringing drowns out the sound of the television and the wind  
	whistling outside. In the half-darkened room, MARIA picks up the receiver...  
	
				MARIA  
		Hello?
	
	No one answers, but she can sense the presence of someone who now hangs up. 
	MARIA is alarmed. Who could it be at this hour? And where is Toto?
	
	114  SEAFRONT AND PIER. EXT/INT. CAR. EVENING 
	
	SALVATORE stands motionless on the pier, facing the storm-tossed sea. He feels 
	relieved by the roar of the waves that dispels his bitter thoughts, blurs them, 
	but does not wipe out the look of suffering in his eyes. A flashing light seems 
	to approach behind his back. SALVATORE turns and is blinded by the headlights of 
	a car parked at the beginning of the pier. The splattering waves lend the scene 
	a hazy cast and diffuse the glare of the flashing headlights. Now the lights 
	move towards him. And SALVATORE also lakes a few timid steps forward... 
	They are close. The car has almost stopped. But it is impossible to make out the 
	person at the wheel who now reaches over to open the other door. A voice can be 
	barely heard over the raging sea. It is ELENA's voice. 
	
				ELENA  
		Salvatore! 
	
	SALVATORE approaches, accepting the invitation, enters the car and shuts the 
	door. The headlights go off and the car remains there suspended between the open 
	sea and the harbor with its rocking boats. Inside the car, not a word. Two dark 
	figures gaze at each other, unintelligible, as if the night were trying to 
	further delay that meeting. The glowing reflection of a wave higher than the 
	others now lights up their faces. ELENA was right, they are no longer the faces 
	of teenagers, but of people on in years who study each other, searching for a 
	truth. The howling of the wind and the crashing of the waves are louder, but 
	ELENA and SALVATORE /rear nothing, sit glued to their seats, fixed in the 
	endless gaze that envelops them. He is the first to break the silence in a faint  
	voice.
	
				SALVATORE  
		How'd you know I'd be here? 
	
	ELENA  I don't know how many years have gone by, but some things about you I do 
	remember. There weren't many, places you could have gone. I looked around...
	
	SALVATORE turns on the light of the rear-view mirror. Finally 
	they can see better. They look at each other a little ill at ease, 
	making the inevitable comparisons with the memory of their young faces. 
	SALVATORE carefully observes her graying hair, her blue eyes lined 
	with wrinkles, the somewhat faded beauty mark on her lip.
	
				SALVATORE  
		You're still beautiful...
	
				ELENA  
		Don't be silly...I'm old.
			(She looks down troubled 
			by the way he has of 
			gazing into her eyes, 
			speaks almost mumbling her 
			words.) 
		Don't look at me like that, please. 
			(And she switches off the 
			light. But this time it is 
			less dark, things can be 
			seen.) 
		Why'd you come back? 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo died. Do you remember him? 
	
				ELENA  
		Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. 
		You were terribly fond of him. 
	
	A moment of silence. It's hard to find something to say.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! 
		Who knows how many Salvatores 
		must be running after her...
	
				ELENA  
			(Smiling) 
		One or two. Bur there're not all that 
		many Salvatores. 
			(SALVATORE also smiles, 
			but a puzzled smile as if 
			what she has said had 
			thrown him off-guard.) 
		I've got a son, too...he's older. 
		And you, do you have children? 
	
				SALVATORE  
		No. And I'm not married. 
			(ELENA sits there in 
			silence. A veil of sadness 
			clouds her eyes. 
			SALVATORE'S 
			too...) 
		Are you happy? 
	
				ELENA  
		All things considered, yes. Even if 
		it wasn't what I dreamt of then...
	
	Again SALVATORE is thrown off-guard, as if the round key of 
	his enquiry had met with only square locks. She continues.
	 
				ELENA  
		My husband...you know him. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Sure, sure! Boccia...
			(With a bitter smile) 
		What's he do? 
	
				ELENA  
		Politics. He's the district 
		representative. We met at the 
		University in Pisa. 
	
	Then instinctively, in a shy voice, SALVATORE asks the question 
	that he probably wouldn't have asked a moment later.
	
				SALVATORE  
		And...how come you never married 
		that guy from Tuscany? 
	
	The white foam of the waves splashes up over the wall of the pier, dashing 
	against the car windows. The shadow of the trickling water is superimposed on 
	the agony of their faces. ELENA hides her embarrassment beneath a faint but 
	haughty smile.
	
				ELENA  
		I didn't want to...I had to fight 
		tooth and nail. But in the end I 
		won...
			(SALVATORE is unable to 
			smile. It's as if the void 
			were growing and swelling 
			within. Thunder and 
			lightning shatter the 
			roaring of the wind and 
			sea, hut it does not rain. 
			Now her smile Jades away.)
		At that time...I was waiting for 
		you...
	
	There is no resentment in her words. She has said them fondly. With the serenity 
	of someone who has suffered greatly and then found a strong convincing way of 
	suffering no more. For SALVATORE, it's as if one of those thunderbolts had 
	pierced his heart. He leans over, gazing into her shining eyes. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		But I've never forgotten you, Elena! 
	
				ELENA  
			(Whispering) 
		Nor have I. Even though you 
		disappeared...
			(SALVATORE is staggered, 
			feels as if he were 
			plunging into the void. 
			What she has said strikes 
			him as grotesque. ELENA 
			strokes his hair, as if to 
			restrain his sinking 
			heart, gives a sweet 
			smile.) 
		But what's the point of talking about 
		it? We risk being pathetic and 
		ridiculous. 
			(And she tries to change 
			the subject.) 
		You still live in Rome? 
	
	But SALVATORE ignores the question. He doesn't want to change the subject. 
	He feels that everything is crumbling inside him, the alibis and excuses he had 
	had to give himself in order to accept the end of their romance. And instead, 
	now the tables seem to have completely turned. Without realizing, he shouts 
	desperately, staring wildly at her and shaking her by the 
	shoulders.
	
				SALVATORE  
		What do you mean, you were waiting 
		for me?! What are you saying? 
			(He controls himself at 
			once, continues, breathing 
			heavily.) 
		The last time we saw each other, we 
		made a date to meet at the Cinema 
		Paradiso. You remember? And you 
		didn't come, you disappeared without 
		leaving a trace, nothing! I'll tell 
		you how many years have gone by: more 
		than thirty!!! 
	
	Quiet rears stream down Elena's face, glisten with the reflections of the 
	lightning and the waves.
	
				ELENA  
		I kept that date. 
			(SALVATORE laughs at the 
			absurdity of it. A 
			nervous, heartbroken 
			laugh, which slowly melts 
			away as she goes on to 
			say:) 
		But I was late...
			(Tears continue to stream 
			out of her blue eyes, but 
			she tells her story in a 
			calm voice.) 
		I had a fight with my family. I tried 
		to convince them again that they 
		couldn't separate us. But it was 
		futile. They had decided to leave 
		Sicily once and for all. Which is 
		what we did. I didn't know what to do 
		any more, what to say. And I said 
		yes, I'd do whatever they wanted. In 
		return, my father promised to let me 
		see you one last time, to say 
		goodbye. But I hoped that by seeing 
		each other we could take advantage of 
		it and make a decision...I thought 
		we would run away together. 
			(She holds back her sobs. 
			Dries her tears with the 
			back of her hand, and 
			continues:) 
		My father drove me to the movie 
		theatre. But you weren't in the 
		projection booth. Only Alfredo...
	
	Her voice continues over the scene of same thirty years before...
	
	115  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. AFTERNOON Flashback. 
	
				ELENA'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		And I didn't have time to wait for 
		you to comeback... 
	
	From the bottom of the spiral staircase, ELENA'S FATHER is waiting nervously, 
	yells up at the projection booth.
	
				ELENA' S FATHER  
		Elena! Hurry up!! 
	
				YOUNG ELENA  
		All right, Daddy!...
	
	In the projection booth, ALFREDO is sitting on a stool, near the
	projector. Seen from the rear, the YOUNG ELENA is leaning over 
	beside him, she is excited, her eyes are red and swollen with tears.
	
				ELENA'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		So I told Alfredo how things stood 
		and fiat I was leaving the same 
		evening, and I asked him to tell you 
		everything. He was very kind, he 
		listened carefully, then... 
	
	ALFREDO answers YOUNG ELENA, stroking her hair.
	
				ALFREDO  
		Easy, easy. 
			(Sighing) 
		Listen carefully to what I have to 
		say. If you want me to tell Toto what 
		you've told me, I will. But if you 
		want my advice, forget it. It's 
		better for both of you if you don't 
		see each other...
			(YOUNG ELENA gives a start 
			of resentment, listens 
			with surprise.) 
		Dear girl, fire always turns into 
		ashes! Even the deepest love ends 
		sooner or later. And after that other 
		loves appear, lots of them. Toto, he 
		can't understand fiat now. If I tell 
		him he won't believe it, he' d be 
		capable of killing me...But you can 
		understand, you've got to 
		understand...Do it for him! 
	
	116  WATERFRONT. INT. CAR. EVENING 
	
	SALVATORE sits there without moving, pale as a sheet, looks as if he had
	grown even older. As if the whole world has fallen in on him. For ELENA, it was 
	a painful but liberating story. She dries her last tears. 
	
				ELENA  
		It's the first time I've had to 
		chance to tell the story. I never 
		mentioned it to anybody. 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(In a daze) 
		Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell 
		on you too! 
	
				ELENA  
		I told him I'd take his advice. But 
		before I went away I left you that 
		note...
			(SALVATORE gives her a 
			quick look, a questioning 
			look. He listens.) 
		I was on my way down the stairs...
			(Her voice continues, laid 
			over the...) 
	
	117  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. AFTERNOON Flashback
	
	ELENA has already said goodbye to ALFREDO, is on her way down the stairs, but 
	stops short. 
	
				ELENA' S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		I thought Alfredo couldn't see me. So 
		I snuck back up...
			(She tip-toes back without 
			making any noise. Goes 
			over to the film-winder. 
			Takes out a pen, looks for 
			a scrap of paper, but 
			doesn't see any. Her eyes 
			fall on the film receipts 
			hanging on the nail. She 
			tears off the top one, 
			turns it over and 
			scribbles a message on the 
			back.) 
		I wrote you where you could find me, 
		and that I'd wait for you. 
	
	She hangs the scrap of paper back on the nail, well in sight. She creeps out, 
	glancing at ALFREDO, who hasn't noticed a thing.
	
	118  WATERFRONT. EXT/INT. CAR. EVENING 
	
	ELENA finishes telling her story. She heaves a Jeep sigh. 
	
				ELENA  
		But you disappeared all the same. 
	
	There is a haunted look in SALVATORE's eyes, he is searching his memory for 
	something he can't find, then suddenly sees, as if in a dream...his hand thirty 
	years before going through the routine gesture of hanging a receipt on the nail, 
	over the others, mechanically, without even looking...and he shuts his eyes as 
	if fearing the truth. Her last words have wounded him. He shakes his head, then 
	in a faint voice:
	
				SALVATORE  
		Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! 
		You'll never know. I wrote, 
		telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever 
		answered. But I dreamt of you for 
		years! That's why I went away...and 
		never came back here. 
			(And his anguish breaks 
			free, dissolving into 
			quiet, almost childish 
			tears. ELENA is startled 
			by his reaction. She 
			caresses him, 	
			passionately. They embrace 
			and remain like that, she 
			with her face buried in 
			his shoulder, he leaning 
			on hers with his tear-
			filled eyes.)
		Even as the years passed, in all the 
		women I met, I was only looking for 
		you. I had success it's true, but 
		there was always something missing...
			(She is deeply moved, goes 
			on caressing him gently 
			until he calms down. The 
			car windows are steamed 
			up. The sea, the harbor, 
			the waves have 	
			disappeared. Nothing 
			remains but the sound of  
			the storm. SALVATORE takes 
			her face between his 
			hands. They gaze at each 
			other, their faces 
			practically touching. He 
			murmurs:) 
		I'd never have imagined that all this 
		had to end because of the man who was 
		like a father to me. A crazy lunatic!  
			(She gives a faint smile.) 
	
				ELENA  
		He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I 
		was upset. I think I really hated 
		him. But then, with time, I 
		understood what he said...and your 
		silence too. 
	
	SALVATORE whispers one last dreadful revelation. And it's as if he had got a 
	terrible weight off his chest.
	
				SALVATORE  
		But I never saw that note! 
			(He squints, as if to 
			stress the absurdity of 
			the idea.) 
		I must have covered it with my hand, 
		without realizing it, that's the only 
		explanation...
			(But strangely enough, 
			ELENA is not surprised.) 
	
				ELENA  
		What difference does it make to find 
		an explanation? That's the way it 
		went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, 
		he was the only one who really 
		understood you. Salvatore, if you had 
		chosen to be with me, you'd have 
		never made your films. And that would 
		have been a pity! Because they're 
		wonderful, I've seen them all. 
			(Her eyes glitter with 
			joy, then she smiles, 
			almost ironically.) 
		But you shouldn't have gone and 
		changed your name. You should have 
		kept your own. 
	
	Tears stream down Salvatore's cheeks. He gives her a look of longing, of 
	desire. 
	
	ELENA embraces him. They kiss with heartrending tenderness, with the same 
	passion of their first kiss amidst the strips of film brushing their faces, so 
	many years ago. And they make love, clasped in the cramped quarters of the car, 
	like two teenagers. Passionate kisses, embraces, deep sighs. Their hair 
	damp with sweat, their hands clasping, their fingers interweaving. Then the 
	frenzy subsides into a deep, tumultuous pleasure, of immense loving and immense 
	grief...As outside the wind and the waves go on rating around that car which 
	seems suspended in empty space.) 
	
	 
	119  ALFREDO'S WIDOW'S HOUSE. INT. DAY 
	
	SIGNORA ANNA'S hands place an old wooden stool and a rusty round 
	metal can on the table.
	
				ANNA  
		These are the things he left to 
		you...
	
	SALVATORE is sitting by the table. He has finished the cup of coffee SIGNORA 
	ANNA has prepared for him. He picks up the stool, recognizes it at once: it's 
	the one ALFREDO had made for him as a little boy so he could climb up and put 
	the reels on the projector. 
	
				ANNA  
		When they showed your films on 
		television, he was happy. He'd plop 
		himself down there and all his 
		ailments were forgotten. He knew all 
		the words by heart, every one, and 
		I'd describe what was going on. And 
		when the papers talked about 
		you, I had to read them two or three 
		times...
	
	SALVATORE examines the can, wonders what it can be. He opens it: inside is a 
	reel of film, wrapped in a plastic bag, well preserved. Those objects bring a 
	pang to his heart, and the things that ANNA said, but he feels disappointed, as 
	if he expected to find something else.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Did he ever think of meeting me? 
	
				ANNA  
		No, never! One time your mother said 
		that if he wanted, you'd have surely 
		come. He got furious and said  'No, 
		Toto mustn't come back to Giancaldo, 
		never!!' He didn't say it to be mean. 
		He was a decent man. Who knows what 
		he could have been thinking? Towards 
		the end he'd say such strange things. 
		And a moment before he shut his eyes, 
		he told your mother not to let you 
		know. 
	
	120  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY 
	
	A cloud of yellowed scraps of paper flutters into the air and as it falls slowly 
	to the ground another handful is flung up. SALVATORE is in the projection booth, 
	looking through the countless yellowed receipts, stuffed away in boxes. He looks 
	at them one by one, then throws them into the air. A desperate search, almost a 
	defiance of the passing of time. He continues with greater determination, flings 
	piles of receipts into the air, glances at a few dates, a film title, tries to 
	discover the oldest dates at the bottom. He moves swiftly, his hands plunge in, 
	then fling up a nimbus of paper and dust. But to no avail...He stops, short of 
	breath. His eyes go over to the nails in the wall, where other stacks of 
	receipts are hanging. He gets up and goes to look at them, thumbs " it through 
	them hastily, in anger... 
	
	He yanks off two or three packs, which come off, nail and all. Only then does he 
	notice that at the bottom of those blocks of yellowed paper, there are same more 
	sheets, much older, almost brown. His eyes concentrate on the mildewed scraps of 
	paper. He leans over, picks themup and goes through them one by one, delicately, 
	because they crumble in his fingers...And then all of a sudden, some film 
	titles 
	he recognizes from that time. He goes on thumbing through them, and all at once 
	an astonished look appears on his face  in his hands is a receipt that has been 
	turned over. It's the one! The message scribbled on it can still be seen. He 
	reads it. 
	
				SALVATORE'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		Salvatore, forgive me. I'll explain 
		later what happened. Not finding you 
		here was terrible. Unfortunately, 
		this evening, my mother and I are 
		leaving for Tuscany. We're moving 
		there. But you' re the only one I 
		love, I'll never be with anybody 
		else, I promise. Here's the address 
		of a girlfriend of mine where you 
		can write to me. Don't abandon me. 
		Love and kisses, Elena. 
	
	He clasps the scrap of paper, and his brimming eyes darken with regret.
	
	121  CAFÉ~ IN SQUARE AND ELENA'S HOUSE. INT/EXT. DAY 
	
	ELENA stands near the window overlooking the little square, listening on the 
	phone to SALVATORE'S voice. She can see him through the transparent curtain 
	speaking on the phone down below in the café. 
	
				ELENA  
		When are you leaving? 
	
	SALVATORE opens his eyes, tosses away his cigarette.
	
				SALVATORE  
		This afternoon. Elena, in the future 
		maybe we could...
	
	ELENA interrupts him, speaks softly, tenderly.
	
				ELENA  
		No, Salvatore...there is no future. 
		There's only the past. Even meeting 
		last night was nothing but a dream, a 
		beautiful dream. 
			(Smiling) 
		We never did it when we were kids, 
		remember? 
			(Down in the cafe, 
			SALVATORE nods his head 
			slowly, desperately.) 
		Now that it's happened, I don't think 
		there could have been a better 
		ending.
			(It's farewell. SALVATORE 
			glances one last time at 
			that window.) 
	
				SALVATORE  
		I'll never agree with you. Never, 
		Elena. 
	
	122  CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. DAY 
	
	The square, unusually empty. There is no one, and no cars and motorcycles are 
	parked in the middle. The stores are shut. And there is an unreal silence. The 
	houses on the two streets on either side of the theatre are covered by enormous 
	pieces of gray canvas. 
	
	Only now does the camera discover in the distance, a crowd of curious onlookers 
	waiting in front of the movie house, kept at a safe distance by firemen and 
	policemen. Old SPACCAFICO is in the crowd. SALVATORE is also there. Be gazes at 
	the front of the old movie theatre...
	
	123  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. DAY 
	
	The inside of the theatre, completely empty...All of a sudden, a blinding flash 
	and...
	
	124  SQUARE AND CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. DAY 
	
	...a deafening roar rends the air, accompanied by a surge of amazement in the 
	crowd. And the Cinema Paradiso suddenly collapses, folds inward and disappears 
	for ever in a gigantic cloud of white smoke that rises into the air, carried by 
	the wind towards the crowd...
	
	125  ELENA' S HOUSE. INT. DAY 
	
	The echo of the explosion is also heard in ELENA'S house. She is alone. 
	And the bang distresses her, as if something had burst inside her. From her face 
	to...
	
	126  SQUARE AND CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. DAY 
	
	SALVATORE's face, stiff, unmoving, his eyes fixed on those falling ruins, on 
	that season of his life turning into smoke and dust. Enveloped in the white 
	cloud, SPACCAFICO stands crying in silence. 
	
	Mice dart out of the ruins in terror, scamper nervously into the square. A group 
	of youngsters scream, amused and excited. Among them, ELENA'S DAUGHTER, 
	smiling... SALVATORE sees her joking with friends and pointing to some boys  
	chasing the mice across the square, hooting and laughing. As a white-haired OLD 
	TRAMP, filthy and covered in rags, makes his way through the crowd. There is an 
	empty look in his eyes and he repeats obsessively in a low voice:
	
				VILLAGE IDIOT  
		The square's mine, the square's mine, 
		the square's mine... 
	
	SALVATORE recognizes him, it's the VILLAGE IDIOT, the one who used to close down 
	the square at night. Be watches him walk off, raving, with nobody even noticing. 
	The crowd now moves over to the huge empty space where the movie house once 
	stood. The murmuring voices are drowned out by the deafening roar of an 
	airplane. From the ruins of the Cinema Paradiso, fade to...
	
	127  ROME. STUDIO VIEWING-ROOM. INT. DAY 
	
	...SALVATORE'S hands giving a STUDIO PROJECTIONIST the rusty metal can left him 
	by ALFREDO. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Please check the splices. As soon as 
		you're ready you can start. 
	
				PROJECTIONIST  
		OK. Congratulations on your film. 
		It's terrific. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Thanks. 
	
	A COLLEAGUE of SALVATORE comes up behind him.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Well? 
	
				COLLEAGUE  
		The distributor is opening up the 
		film earlier. The press conference is 
		in the afternoon. The actors will 
		also be there, the producer, just 
		about everyone. 
	
	An ASSISTANT comes up to them.
	
				ASSISTANT  
		The official notification of the 
		award just came out, but we've 
		already received a mountain of 
		telegrams. Aren't you happy? 
	
				SALVATORE  
		It's all right. We'll talk about it 
		later. 
	
	SALVATORE walks off towards the viewing theatre. 
	
	SALVATORE is by himself in the small viewing theatre. Now the lights go down. 
	The beam of light shines out of the little square hole of the projection booth 
	and the screen lights up. A number trailer goes by and then SALVATORE sees the 
	first shots. 
	
	A start of intense amazement and joy suddenly runs through him, astounds him, 
	delights him. It's the best piece of film he has ever seen...  
	
	It consists of all the kisses ALFREDO cut out of the films and kept for him, 
	when he was a little boy. They have been spliced together, one , after the 
	other, at random, same of them even upside down. And yet it looks like a first-
	rate editing job. 
	
	In rapid sequence the passionate kisses between actors and actresses, names 
	famous and names unknown in the history of movies. Greta Garbo, Gary Cooper, 
	Alida Valii, Rudolph Valentino, Ingrid Bergman, Clark Gable, Anna Magnani, 
	Humphrey Bogart, Marlene Dietrich, Amedeo Nazzari, Luisa Ferida, Vittorio De 
	Sica, Rita Hayworth, Tyrone Power, Doris Durante, Massimo Gironi, Marta Abba, 
	Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Assia Noris...
	
	A whole movie season summed up in a few fragments, a few seconds. A bizarre, 
	poignant, melancholy parade. 
	
	SALVATORE is overwhelmed, moved to tears. It is the most profound act of love he 
	has ever seen. He laughs as tears shine in his eyes. Up on the screen, another 
	kiss, the last kiss marking the happy ending of a film. And the age-old words 
	appear 'THE END'.

	1  GIANCALDO. SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. EXT/INT. DAY
	
	The October sun slashes through the gray clouds, cuts across the
	shadow towards the sea, along the coast where the new suburbs of the
	city of Giancaldo have been built up.
	
	Bright light streams through the windows, glancing off the white
	walls in an almost blinding reflection. MARIA, a woman a little over
	sixty, is trying to find somebody on the phone.
	
				MARIA  
		...Salvatore, that's right, 
		Salvatore. Di Vita Salvatore
		...But, miss, what do you mean you 
		don't know him?!...I...Yes...
			(She gives a nervous sigh. 
			She has dialed her way 
			through endless numbers 
			but still hasn't managed 
			to speak to Mr. Di
			Vita. She finally heaves a 
			sigh of relief.)
		...That's right, good for you! 
		Oh!...yes...And I'm his
		mother. I'm calling from Sicily. Been 
		trying all day...Ah, he's not 
		there...But would you be so kind as 
		to give me...?...Yes...
			(She nods at another woman 
			around forty sitting 
			nearby: it is LIA, her 
			daughter, who jots down 
			the numbers her 
			mother dictates:)
		...Six, five, six, two, two, oh, 
		six...Thanks ever so
		much...Goodbye. Goodbye.
	
	She hangs up, takes the number LIA has jotted down, determined to have still 
	another try. LIA speaks to her as if she were a baby, to be more convincing.
	
				LIA  
		Look, Ma...It's useless calling him. 
		He'll be terribly busy, God knows 
		where he is. Besides he might not 
		even remember. Do as I say, forget 
		it...He hasn't been here for thirty 
		years. You know how he is. 
	
	MARIA pauses to think it over. The decision she has to make is important. Then, 
	stubbornly.
	
				MARIA  
		He'll remember! He'll remember! 
			(She puts on her glasses 
			and starts dialing 
			the number.)
		...I'm positive. I know him better 
		than you do. If he were to find 
		out we hadn't told him, he'd be 
		angry. I know. 
			(She takes off her 
			glasses.)
		...Hello? Good morning. Could I 
		please speak to Mr. Salvatore Di 
		Vita. I'm his mother...
	
	2  ROME. STREETS. EXT/INT. NIGHT
	
	It's late, but there is still traffic on the streets heading downtown.
	Inside a high-powered car, a man  around fifty is driving. It is
	SALVATORE Dl VITA. Elegant, just growing gray, a handsome face
	creased by deep wrinkles. His weary expression hides the determined,
	sell-assured manner of the successful self-made man. He must be a
	heavy smoker judging by the way he draws the last puffs on his
	cigarette.
	
	He stops at a red light. He stubs out the cigarette and rolls down the
	window, as a little Fiat Uno pulls up alongside. A rock tune plays full
	blast on the radio. SALVATORE turns instinctively to have a look at the
	man at the wheel  a BOY with a brush cut standing straight in the latest
	fashion. He studies the Boy's expression with almost exaggerated
	attention, but devoid of curiosity, coldly. The GIRL sitting beside him,
	lots of curly hair, overripe red lips, returns SALVATORE'5 look,
	provocatively. The BOY notices, turns to SALVATORE in a surly voice:
	
				BOY  
		Hey! What the fuck you looking at!?
	
	Green light. The Fiat Uno shoots off, leaving a trail of music in its wake.
	
	3  ROME. SALVATORE S APARTMENT. INT. NIGHT 
	
	The apartment is luxurious, tastefully furnished. There is no one waiting for 
	SALVATORE. Through the picture window on the terrace, the city can be seen 
	slumbering in the night. SALVATORE gets undressed on his way to the bedroom. He 
	moves quietly, as if to make no noise. He doesn't even turn on the light, 
	finishes getting undressed in the pale blue glow coming from the picture window. 
	A rustling sound, a movement on the bed, the voice of a woman waking up. 
	
				CLARA  
		Salvatore...But what time is it? 
	
	She turns on the bedside light. It is CLARA, a young woman around thirty. 
	SALVATORE climbs in beside her under the covers, kisses her sweetly, then in a 
	whisper.
	
				SALVATORE  
		It's late, Clara. Sorry, but I wasn't 
		able to let you know I wouldn't be 
		corning...
			(He fondles her, but he is 
			tired, feels like 
			sleeping.) 
		Go to sleep now. Sleep.
	
	He turns over on the other side. CLARA shuts her eyes, is about to drop off, 
	but whispers.
	
				CLARA  
		Your mother phoned. She took me for 
		somebody else...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Surprised) 
		And what'd you tell her?
	
				CLARA  
		I played dumb, so as not to 
		disappoint her. We had a nice little 
		talk. She says you never go see her, 
		and when she wants to see you she has 
		to come to Rome...Is it true?
	
	SALVATORE doesn't answer. God only knows how often he's heard that question 
	before.
	
				SALVATORE  
		She phoned just to say that? 
	
	She reaches out to switch of the light, buries her head into the pillow.
	
				CLARA  
		She said a certain Alfredo had died. 
		And the funeral's taking place 
		tomorrow afternoon...
			(A strange look suddenly 
			comes into SALVATORE'S 
			eyes. The idea of going to 
			sleep has clearly left 
			him. It's a piece of news 
			he didn't expect. That's 
			taken him off-guard. CLARA 
			would like to carry on the 
			conversation, but 
			sleepiness makes 
			it almost impossible. An 
			she can manage is one last 
			question in a faint little 
			voice:)
		Who is it? A relative of yours?
	
				SALVATORE  
		No. Sleep. Go to sleep.
	
	She falls asleep in the dead silence of the night. SALVATORE is seized by a 
	sort of chill a deep, troubled feeling. He gazes through the window al the city, 
	with its shimmering lights still moving in the darkness, suddenly shrouded in a 
	heavy curtain of rain. But he gazes off, beyond the row of houses, beyond the 
	dark sky; the shadow of a wind chime plays across his face summoning up endless 
	memories, drawing forth from the infinite depths of oblivion a past that he 
	thought had vanished, been wiped out, and instead now re-emerges, comes back to 
	life, takes on light, superimposing itself on the mellow middle-aged features of 
	his face, in the shadow of the city shaken by the storm, until another image is 
	formed, an ancient, remote image...
	
	4  GIANCALDO. CHURCH AND SACRISTY. INT. MORNING
	
	An image from over forty years before. In the baroque church of
	Giancaldo. SALVATORE is nine years old. Dressed as an altar boy, he
	is kneeling by the altar with a little silver bell in his hands. The
	congregation is also kneeling. The PRIEST is consecrating the Host.
	Little SALVATORE has just got out of bed, is still half-asleep, yawns
	and doesn't notice that the PRIEST is standing there with the Host in
	the air glaring at him, as if trying to tell him something.
	
				PRIEST  
		Pss! Pssst!
	
	SALVATORE finishes yawning and opening his eyes meets the
	withering look of the PRIEST. He gets the message at once and
	rings the bell. Now the PRIEST can carry on, lifts the chalice and
	the bell is heard again.
	
						Cut to:
	
	The service is over. The PRIEST is in the sacristy removing his
	vestments. And SALVATORE is also there, removing his altar-boy
	tunic.
	
				PRIEST  
		But how can I make you understand? 
		Without the bell I just can't go on! 
		Always half asleep, you are! What do 
		you do at night anyway? Eat instead 
		of sleep?
	
				SALVATORE  
		Father, at my house we don't even eat 
		at noon. That's why I'm always 
		sleepy. That's what the vet says.
	
	The PRIEST has finished disrobing. He takes the bell
	SALVATORE was holding during the service and turns to leave.
	
				PRIEST  
		All right, Toto, get moving, I've got 
		things to do. Say hello to your 
		mother.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Can I...
	
				PRIEST  
			(Interrupting him) 
		And don't ask if you can come...
		Because you can't!! Shoo, shoo, off 
		with you!!
	
	SALVATORE gives a shrug and leaves. The PRIEST goes down a
	corridor, opens a door, another corridor, and finally a door
	leading to an outside courtyard. He cuts across it and disappears
	into another door.
	
	5  CINEMA PARADISO AND PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. MORNING
	
	The PRIEST enters a movie house. Not very big  200 seats on the main
	floor and another seventy in the balcony. Along the walls, posters of
	films to be shown are stuck up between the light fixtures. In one corner,
	a statue of the Virgin Mary with flowers. The CLEANING LADY has
	finished work and is leaving. Up in the balcony, over the last row of
	seats, are the holes of the projection booth. The middle hole is
	camouflaged by the huge head of a roaring lion, all in plaster, and the
	lens of the projector can be glimpsed between its sharp teeth.
	there are two smaller holes, through which the figure of a man can be
	made out, appearing and disappearing...It is ALFREDO, the
	projectionist. He is around forty, skinny and bony with a tough
	peasant face. He has finished loading the projector and is checking the
	carbons in the arc lamp. Then he removes the glass from one of the
	holes and looks down into the theatre, at the PRIEST who waves his
	hand.
	
				PRIEST  
		OK, Alfredo, you can start!!
	
	He sits down an by himself in the middle of the empty theatre.
	Up in the booth, ALFREDO lights the arc lamp and sets the
	projector going.
	
	Down in the theatre, the light goes off and out of the lion's mouth
	streams the glowing ray aimed al the screen. String music, sweet
	and ominous, spreads through the theatre. On the screen appear
	the credit titles of an American film of the 1940s. The PRIEST
	screws up his face and holds the bell in his right hand resting on
	the arm of his seat.
	
	At the back of the theatre, behind the last row, a curtain moves,
	opens a crack and SALVATORE'S gaunt little face appears. He
	has managed to sneak in somehow and stands there without a
	word, spellbound, watching the 'movie' on the glowing screen.
	The credit titles have long come and gone. The story is at a
	turning-point. 
	
	Up above, in the hole of the booth next to the lion,
	ALFREDO watches the film, but his eyes keep looking down at the
	PRIEST, who is now drumming the bell with his fingers. On the
	screen, the male and female lead, two Hollywood stars, are in
	close-up; the dialogue is passionate, romantic. SALVATORE,
	carried away by those faces, by the way they talk, by the beauty
	of the woman, slowly slips down the length of the curtain until he
	is sitting on the floor, his eyes glued to the screen. 
	
	The love scene reaches a climax, the music crescendos, and the love-struck 
	couple finally fall into each other's arms and kiss. Instinctively, the PRIEST 
	raises the bell into the air, as in some age-old ceremony, and gives it a loud 
	ring...
	
	Up in the booth ALFREDO hears the bell; it's the signal he's been
	waiting for. He takes a slip of paper from a pad prepared for that
	purpose and sticks it into the loops of the film containing that
	specific scene as it winds on to the reel. The projection
	continues...
	
	...And also the kiss of the two actors. The PRIEST'S nervous look lingers on 
	those black-and-white lips meeting and now pulling apart for one last 
	declaration of love before separating. SALVATORE is wide-eyed, he's probably 
	never seen a man and woman kiss before, it's a vision that for him has all the 
	attraction of forbidden fruit, the horror of sin. The screen is now filled with 
	the figure of a woman getting undressed, showing for one instant the white, 
	voluptuous flesh of her broad, naked shoulders. SALVATORE stares in open-mouthed 
	wonder. The PRIEST, in a fury, grabs the bell and shakes it for all he is worth. 
	From the sound of the bell to another sound...
	
	6  GIANCALDO. MAIN SQUARE. EXT. DAY 
	
	The tolling of the bell-tower rings out over the 
	square. It is noon. The vast square, pale and dusty, is alive with people. A 
	noisy line of men, women and cows waits in front of the fountain to get water. 
	Peddlers hawk their wares in mournful cries. People come and go in front of the 
	town hall. The working men's club is deserted. The entrance of the Cinema 
	Paradiso is shut. Hanging outside is the poster of the film that has just been 
	seen on screen. Up above, the windows of the projection booth are open. The hum 
	of the projector can be heard and the loud, lofty music typical of 'THE END'. 
	Then dead silence. The showing is over.
	
	7. CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY
	
	Despite the speed, numerous white streaks spin around on the reel,
	created by the slips of paper ALFREDO has inserted into the loops. He
	is rewinding the film by hand on the film-winder. When he's not
	talking, ALFREDO usually sings to himself. SALVATORE stands beside
	him, taking in everything he does with those quick, thieving eyes of his
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Harshly, shouting) 
		You must not come here! How many 
		times do I have to tell you?
			(And he slows down the 
			reels with his hand. The 
			slips of paper
			are about to arrive. 
			Here's the first.)
		If the film catches fire, runt that 
		you are, you'd go up in a
		burst of flame...whoosh! And turn 
		into a piece of...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Overlapping him)
		...and turn into a piece of 
		charcoal!!
	
	He's used to his terrorisms, pays no more attention. Not even his
	grim look scares him. Anyway, ALFREDO catches the joke, starts to give him a 
	slap, but instead reaches over and picks up a pair of scissors.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Angrily) 
		Christ, that's a sassy little tongue 
		you've got! Watch out, or someday 
		I'll snip it off. 
	
	And he snips a piece of film, pastes the ends together and goes on turning the 
	handle. SALVATORE picks up the strip of film and gives it a closer look. He sees 
	a series of frames all alike with a man kissing a woman.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Can I have it? 
	
	ALFREDO snatches it out of his hand, furiously, at the end of his string. He 
	shouts.
	
				ALFREDO  
		No!!! Are you deaf or something? I've 
		got to put this back in when we wind 
		up the film again! You're a real pain 
		in the neck! 
	
	SALVATORE reaches into a basket full of strips of film. He takes out a handful: 
	all kisses that have been cut.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Then why didn't you put these back 
		when you wound up the films again? 
	
	ALFREDO is caught out. He stops the film where another slip of paper is stuck 
	in and cuts the scene:
	
				ALFREDO  
		'Cause sometimes you can't find the 
		right place any more and so...well, 
		actually...they stay here. 
			(Finding an excuse) 
		Besides, there are more kisses than 
		you can count.
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Excited) 
		So I can have these? 
			(ALFREDO explodes, flies 
			off the handle. He grabs 
			SALVATORE by the shoulders 
			and shakes him.)
	
				ALFREDO  
		Look, Toto! Before I kick your ass 
		all the way to China and back, let's 
		make a deal. These strips here are 
		yours, I give them to you. However! 
		One  you're not to stick your nose in 
		here any more. Two  I'll keep them 
		for you, because you can't take them 
		home for God forbid and save our 
		souls, if they catch fire, all hell 
		will break loose! OK? Oh!!! And now 
		scram! 
	
	He takes him and turns him towards the stairs. For him the matter is closed. He 
	returns to the film-winder. SALVATORE sneaks back and while ALFREDO's attention 
	is elsewhere, snatches up a handful of movie frames scattered on the counter, 
	stuffs them into his pocket and...
	
				SALVATORE  
		What sort of deal is this? The strips 
		are mine! So why can't I come see 
		them? 
	
	And he stares at ALFREDO with a sly, saucy look. ALFREDO clutches his hand, 
	darts forth like an arrow and is about to give him a kick in the ass. He 
	shrieks:
	
				ALFREDO  
		Get out!! And don't show your face 
		here again! 
	
	And before the kick reaches its destination, SALVATORE has already dashed off 
	down the spiral staircase.
	
	8  GIANCALDO. SALVATORE'S HOUSE. INT. EVENING
	
	That was not the first theft of film strips. SALVATORE's hand reaches
	into a flowery metal box jammed full of pieces of film. He takes out a
	few frames and holds them up against the kerosene lamp. Gazes at the
	figures that remind him of the films seen at Cinema Paradiso, and in a
	whisper mangles fragments of dialogue, the shooting of guns, the
	musical climaxes...
	
				SALVATORE  
		Bang! Bang! Bang! Shoot first, think 
		later! This is no job for weaklings! 
		Treacherous dog!
	
	The house has no lights, is gloomy and cold. SALVATORE's
	mother, MARIA, is leaning on the table in front of him. She is
	young, around thirty, and her pretty face is haggard, marred by
	all the sacrifices. She is sewing some clothes, is a seamstress. LIA,
	his four-year-old sister, is sleeping on a cot in one corner. The
	kerosene lamp projects the trembling shadow of the film strips on
	the wall, figures of prairies, gunslingers, thugs. SALVATORE's
	voice changes, turns even tougher.
	
				SALVATORE
		Hey there, you lousy bastard, take 
		your hands off that gold, You black-
		hearted pig, stay away from me, or 
		I'll smash your face in! 
		'Ntantatah!!!...
			(In the heap of movie 
			frames there are also 
			several photographs. 
			SALVATORE picks them up. 
			Family keepsakes. A man in 
			an army uniform. Then the 
			same man with a girl 
			beside him whose smiling 
			face can be recognized as 
			MARIA. SALVATORE takes a 
			closer look at the man's 
			face, then whispers to his 
			mother:)
		Ma, if the war's over, how come 
		Daddy's never come back?
	
	MARIA looks up at him with a sweet smile.
	
				MARIA  
		He'll be back, he'll be back...
		You'll see. One of these
		days...
	
	But there is not much conviction written on her face. She looks
	back down at her sewing. SALVATORE goes on looking at the
	photos.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I don't remember him any moreMa, 
		where's Russia?
	
				MARIA  
		It takes years to get there. And 
		years to come back...Now go to bed, 
		Toto, it's late.
	
	SALVATORE puts the photos back into the box and tucks the box
	under LIA's cot near the charcoal burner.
	
	9  GRADE SCHOOL. COURTYARD. EXT. DAY
	
	A noisy crowd of little children in black smocks, white collars and blue
	bows moves about the large courtyard where there are two tall palm
	trees. The boys head for one door, the girls towards the opposite one.
	The Janitors line them up two by two, ready to enter. Here and there,
	parents and relatives accompany the younger ones. Beneath one of the
	palms, SALVATORE pulls off the altar-boy tunic, stuffs it into the
	khaki-colored cardboard schoolbag, takes out the smock and puts it
	on, as one of his schoolmates passes by. It is MASINO, and he's crying
	desperately because he doesn't want to go to school. His FATHER drags
	him along, yelling:
	
				MASINO'S FATHER
		You can fool your mother but not me! 
		Get yourself a damn diploma and 
		become a policeman. You good-for-
		nothing!
	
				MASINO  
		I don't want to go to school'
			(The sound of the bell. 
			The black lines move up 
			the steps towards the 
			school.)
	
	1O  FOURTH GRADE. INT. DAY 
	
	SALVATORE is sitting at the front-row desk next to PEPPINO, 
	a little freckle-faced boy. His attention, like that of the whole class, is 
	concentrated on what is taking place at the blackboard. The TEACHER is standing 
	there, watching a plump little boy, shy and not quite all there, do a two-figure 
	multiplication  it is NICOLA SCORSONE, known as 'COLA'. He is red in the face, 
	has one purple ear and one white one. He stares in terror at that '255 x 15' 
	written on the blackboard. The TEACHER yells, waving a birch rod in her hand. 
	
				TEACHER  
		Well then?! Five times five 
		equals...? 
	
	COLA stops to think a moment, then... 
	
				COLA  
		Thirty!
	
	The TEACHER grabs him by the purple ear and bashes his head against the numbers 
	on the blackboard. A large thud echoes through the room, followed by a roar of 
	laughter. The TEACHER slams her rod on the desk.
	
				TEACHER  
		Silence!! 
			(Then to COLA) 
		The five times table. Dunce! One 
		times five, five!!
			(The class repeats with 
			the TEACHER, in a sing-
			song chorus:)
	
				TEACHER and CLASS  
		Two times five, ten! Three times 
		five, fifteen! Four times five, 
		twenty!
			(With a wave of the rod, 
			the TEACHER silences the 
			class, and finishes the 
			sing-song with the fateful 
			question.)
	
				TEACHER  
		Five times five?
	
				COLA  
			(Timidly) 
		Forty...?
	
	Another blow of the head on the blackboard. Hubbub.
	Slapping of the rod on the desk. SALVATORE secretly shows
	COLA the picture of a Christmas tree on one page of the book,
	and mouths the word 'twenty-five'. COLA smiles, he has finally
	caught on.
	
				TEACHER  
		I'm asking you for the last time, 
		blockhead! Five times five equals...?
			(COLA turns to her with 
			smiling eyes and answers 
			blissfully:)
	
				COLA  
		Christmas!!
	
	SALVATORE clutches his head in anger, watches the TEACHER
	flogging COLA on the back with the rod. COLA screams at every
	blow, and at every blow the laughter in the class grows louder.
	SALVATORE stares at the rod moving up and down rhythmically. But he is not 
	thinking of the pain his schoolmate is feeling, but is drawn, rather, by that 
	strange regular beat, finds it similar to another regular beat, that of...
	
	11  CINEMA PARADISO. BALCONY AND MAIN FLOOR. INT. DAY
	
	...the rolling pin ALFREDO uses to flatten out a reel of film that has just 
	been unloaded. SALVATORE carefully watches ALFREDO 5 every move. He is not in 
	the projection booth, but up in the balcony, standing on top of the last row of 
	seats. He peers through the hole next to the lion's head. His bright little eyes 
	fix in his mind the things ALFREDO does, as he loads the film into the 
	projector, shuts the fireproof housings, turns on the amplifier, checks the 
	carbons in the arc lamp, then lowers his head to have a look into the theatre 
	and finds himself face to face with SALVATORE.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Sternly) 
		What are you doing here? 
	
				SALVATORE  
		I bought a ticket. I've come to see 
		the film.
			(Meanwhile the USHER comes 
			up behind him and grabs 
			him by the collar, and he 
			almost jumps out of his 
			skin. ALFREDO laughs.)
	
				USHER  
			(Yelling) 
		Go sit downstairs! You good-for-
		nothing sponger! ! 
			(To the audience) 
		Worse than rabbits they are!
	
	SALVATORE has run downstairs. The main floor is more
	crowded than the balcony, like every Sunday, and there is a greatdin. The BOY 
	selling ice-cream, soda pop and candy shouts and
	runs around like a chicken with its head off. Now the lights dim,
	the hubbub dies down and the performance starts. Before the film
	there is a preview for Stagecoach. The screen fills with images ofJohn Wayne, 
	the pursuit of the stagecoach by hostile Indians
	etc...
	
	SALVATORE is sitting in the front rows, right under the screen,
	next to BOCCIA, COLA, MASINO, PEPPINO and OTHER KIDS, all with their noses in 
	the air. BOCCIA, the biggest show off of the group, is smoking a cigarette. An 
	OLD MAN appears through the entrance curtain, takes a couple of steps and 
	shouts:)
	
				FIRST OLD MAN  
		Hello, everybody!
	
				AUDIENCE  
			(At once) 
		Ssssssh!!! Ssssssh! Silence!
	
				FIRST OLD MAN  
		Can't I say hello?
	
				USHER  
		It's a double-feature today.
	
				FIRST OLD MAN  
		I couldn't care less. I come here to 
		sleep.
	
	All at once, a chorus of shouts and whistles fills the theatre. Up
	on the screen, a globe of the world appears, spinning among the
	stars, the logo announcing the newsreel.
	
				AUDIENCE  
			(Hooting and whistling) 
		For Christ's sake! Cut it, 
		Alfredoooo!
	
	The CHILDREN in the front rows also yell, but SALVATORE goes
	on being alert. He turns and looks up at the holes of the projection
	booth, as if it were an impregnable fortress. He watches the crazy
	dancing of light in the glowing stream that opens towards him in a
	cone. And besides, that lion's head, mysterious, almost gruesome,
	emphasizes the enigmatic secret of the movies. In his dreamy eyes,
	that lifeless lion seems to wake up with a ferocious roar.
	
	SALVATORE has a frightened look...Another lion roaring. But up on the screen. 
	The MGM lion. The throng of children imitate the famous growl all together, 
	shaking their heads in unison.
	
				CHILDREN  
		Grrrr! Grrrrr! 
	
	The film starts: it is Visconti's La terra trema. SALVATORE is in bliss. His 
	wide eyes looking up at the magic square of light. The title music. Another OLD 
	MAN enters at the back of the theatre, but before sitting down, says hello in a 
	loud voice.
	
				SECOND OLD MAN  
		Greetings to one and all!
	
				AUDIENCE  
		SSSSSH' Drop dead! Silence! Hey, 
		kids, we're here to see the film! 
	
	Now there is an important sequence. The audience is silent. Concentrated on the 
	screen. BOCCIA passes the lighted cigarette to SALVATORE. He takes a puff and 
	hands it on to the others without ever taking his eyes off the screen. The 
	beautiful star of the film appears on screen. A different kind of attention 
	takes hold of the excited audience. SALVATORE and the others stare at her with 
	open mouths...She leans towards the leading man, a languid expression, their 
	profiles touch. But all at once, just at the best part, there is a sudden jolt. 
	
	The kiss isn't seen.
	
				AUDIENCE  
			(Disappointed) 
		Ahhh! What a shame! I've been going 
		to the movies for twenty years and I 
		never saw a kiss! 
	
	SALVATORE is the only one to laugh to himself. He knows what has happened.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		And when will we see one? 
	
	Up in the balcony, the audience is more sedate. The tickets cost more and the 
	people are richer, more refined. Among them, a MAN with a moustache, the look of 
	a public notary, is sitting right in front of the railing. Seriously, without 
	batting an eye, he spits down below with contempt. Right on the dot, a voice is 
	heard, followed by a chorus of protests.
	
				VOICE and AUDIENCE  
		Bugger!!! Ssssh!!! Silence!!
	
	12  SQUARE AND ENTRANCE OF CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. NIGHT
	
	The bell-tower rings midnight. The square is nearly deserted. Except
	for a landowner near the refreshment stand, with a moustache and a
	hat, DON VINCENZO by name, who is picking out from a group of
	labourers the men he'll be needing in the country at dawn. He chooses,
	points his finger, calls...
	
	People come out of the movie house after the last showing.
	The USHER locks the front door as ALFREDO climbs down from the
	projection booth. Among the crowd there is only one kid, SALVATORE.
	Tired, half-asleep. He's seen all the showings. He starts to walk away
	when he catches sight of his mother standing on the opposite corner,
	wrapped in an old coat. She's waiting for him, in a temper.
	SALVATORE drops his eyes to the ground, mortified. He knows what's
	coming. He goes over to her timidly, uncertain, gives her a questioning
	look.
	
				MARIA  
		I've been looking for you all day. 
		Did you buy the milk?
	
				SALVATORE  
		No...
	
				MARIA  
		Then where's the money?
	
				SALVATORE  
		Somebody stole it.
	
	MARIA gives him a slap. SALVATORE holds back the sobs, but
	his eyes brim with tears. ALFREDO and the USHER are nearby,
	have heard everything.
	
				MARIA  
		What'd you do with the money? Go to 
		the movies?
	
	SALVATORE nods his head and the sobs increase. MARIA, in
	despair, flies off the handle, slaps him again, but looks as if she
	doesn't really want to, as if deep down she forgives her son's
	escapade. ALFREDO catches on, speaks up on behalf of
	SALVATORE.
	
				ALFREDO  
		Signora Maria, don't do that. He's 
		just a kid. 
			(To SALVATORE) 
		And why are you telling fibs? 
			(To MARIA) 
		We let him in free. He must have lost 
		the money inside the movie
		theatre...
			(SALVATORE stares at him 
			in amazement, goes on 
			listening to him.)
		How much did you have?
	
				SALVATORE  
		Fifty lire...
			(MARIA wipes away his tears.)
	
				ALFREDO  
			(To the USHER) 
		What you find tonight on the floor 
		between the seats?
			(The USHER reaches into-
			his pockets, pulls out 
			some odds and ends.)
	
				USHER  
		A comb, two heel-savers, a box of 
		tobacco...
			(ALFREDO very skillfully 
			reaches out with fifty 
			lire he has taken
			from his pocket. And like 
			a magician he draws the 
			money out of
			the USHER'S hand.)
	
				ALFREDO 
		...and fifty lire! 
			(To MARIA) 
		See?
			(He hands over the money 
			under the USHER'S 
			astonished eyes.)
	
				MARIA  
		Thanks, Uncle Alfredo. Thanks. Good-
		night.
	
	She walks away, dragging SALVATORE by the hand. ALFREDO
	gives him a wink. SALVATORE smiles and winks back, but he's
	not very good at it; he can't manage to shut only one eye.
	Everybody leaves and the square empties, as the VILLAGE IDIOT
	comes up to the group of labourers, beside DON VINCENZO,
	motioning them all to get moving.
	
				IDIOT  
		It's midnight. I've got to shut down 
		the square! Go away.
		The square's mine! The square's 
		mine!!
	
	13  CEMETERY ROAD AND VILLAGE ROAD. EXT. DAY
	
	SALVATORE, dressed as an altar boy, walks alongside the PRIEST
	who is wearing the ceremonial vestments. They are tired, have walked
	a long way. Behind them a donkey pulls a wagon containing a little
	white coffin and a bunch of flowers. Behind that a little procession  the
	parents and relatives of the dead child. The road is very wide, covered
	with white earth. The spring sun is dazzling. The funeral procession
	kicks up a cloud of dust that makes everything blurred and hazy, like a
	dream, rimmed around the horizon by the blue line of the sea. The
	procession now turns into the large gate of the cemetery. ALFREDO,
	working in the fields, takes his hat off and watches the coffin as it passes by.
	
						Cut to:
	
	The funeral is over. The PRIEST and SALVATORE are walking back
	to the village. ALFREDO appears out of the countryside on e bicycle
	with a hoe and other farm tools in the basket. He comes pedaling up
	beside them.
	
				ALFREDO  
		Good morning, father. It's hard on 
		the feet, huh?
	
				PRIEST  
			(Breathless) 
		Yeah!...Getting there's downhill and 
		all the saints help you. But coming 
		back! The saints stand there watching 
		you, that's all! God's will be done.
	
	SALVATORE is about to open his mouth, wants to say something
	to ALFREDO, but he doesn't have time. ALFREDO pedals harder
	and rides off.
	
	SALVATORE is crestfallen. He looks et the PRIEST, then at the bicycle riding 
	away. His eyes light up  an idea! He suddenly yells:
	
				SALVATORE  
		Ouch! Ouch! My foot! I can't walk!
	
	He limps. Throws himself to the ground as if a snake had bitten him. The PRIEST 
	leans over in alarm. Up ahead in the distance, ALFREDO turns around to look.
	
						Cut to:
	
	There is a smile on SALVATORE'S face. He is riding on the crossbar of ALFREDO's 
	bicycle. On their way back lo the village.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo, did you know my father?
	
				ALFREDO  
		Of course I knew your father. He was 
		tall, thin, pleasant, and had a 
		moustache like mine. Always smiling. 
		He looked like Clark Gable. 
	
	There's something SALVATORE wants to talk about, but he doesn't know how to 
	start. He has a try with an innocent stratagem.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo, now that I'm older, I'm not 
		saying I can start coming to the 
		projection booth, to the movie 
		house...But...maybe, why don't we 
		become friends? 
	
	ALFREDO knows exactly what the little rascal is up to, and answers in a 
	strange, theatrical tone, as if he were repeating something he knows by heart, a 
	remark taken from some old film.
	
				ALFREDO  
			'I choose my friends for their 
		looks, and my enemies for their 
		brains...' 
			(Laughs) 
		You're too smart to be my friend. 
		Besides, as I always tell my kids, be 
		careful to pick the right friends!
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Surprised) 
		But you don't have any kids!!!
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Spluttering) 
		All right, all right! When I've got 
		kids that's what I'm telling them! 
			(The outlying houses of 
			Giancaldo finally heave 
			into sight.)
	
	14  SALVATORE S HOUSE. EXT. DAY
	
	LIA, SALVATORE'S kid sister, is crying outside the front door, terror
	stricken. Her face is smeared with smoke and her little dress half
	scorched and soaking wet. MARIA is distraught, damp with sweat, and
	tries to console her, hugging her in her arms.
	
				MARIA  
		Stop crying...The fire is out...I'm 
		here...That'll do, that'll do...
			(ALFREDO and SALVATORE 
			come up behind them. 
			SALVATORE has barely leapt 
			off the bicycle when his 
			mother sails into him like 
			a fury, shrieking:)
		Miserable boy! You're the ruin of me! 
		Your sister would have been burnt 
		alive if I hadn't been there! And all 
		your fault!
	
	SALVATORE darts off, chased by his mother, swift as a deer.
	ALFREDO doesn't understand what has happened, leans over
	LIA, who goes on bawling her eyes out, and sees on the ground, in
	the middle of the water, a flowery box all charred and still
	smoking, and all around scraps of film reduced to ashes and
	several singed photographs, the photos of SALVATORE s father.
	ALFREDO gets the message now, looks up at MARIA, who has
	caught SALVATORE and is dragging him home, hitting and
	slapping him all the way. SALVATORE covers his head with his
	hands to stave off the blows. MARIA turns to ALFREDO, in a
	stern, indignant voice.
	
				MARIA
		But aren't you ashamed of yourself, 
		Uncle Alfredo, playing with a little 
		boy at your age?!
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Cowed) 
		But...what's it got to do with 
		me?...
	
				MARIA  
		And who gave him all those films? 
		Promise you won't give him any more 
		of this trash! Don't let him set foot 
		any more in the movie house. The 
		boy's crazy! Crazy! All he talks 
		about is movies and Alfredo' Alfredo 
		and movies!! 
	
	ALFREDO is crestfallen, didn't think that SALVATORE'S craziness, his morbid 
	passion for movies, could go this far.
	
				ALFREDO  
		I give you my word, Donna Maria. 
			(MARIA now turns one last 
			time to her son.)
	
				MARIA  
		God's got to grant me one wish! Send 
		your father back home! And he'll see 
		you get what's coming to you! 
			(SALVATORE lowers his 
			hands, looks at her and 
			with the dreadful 
			sincerity of children:)
	
				SALVATORE  
		Daddy's not coming back...He's dead. 
			(An icy flash runs through 
			MARIA'S eyes.)
	
				MARIA  
		It's not true! No! It's not true!!! 
		I'll show you he's coming back!
	
	And she beats him desperately, as if to enforce her stubborn hope, slap after 
	slap. This time ALFREDO doesn't step in, lets MARIA give vent 
	to her rage and fury, but SALVATORE'S cries make him feel guilty.
	
	15:SQUARE AND PROJECTION BOOTH. EXT/INT. DAY 
	
	Another Sunday. A crowd of men has gathered in the square around the café where 
	there is a loudspeaker. They are listening to the running commentary of the 
	soccer games. They check their Sisal pools coupons. NICOLO CAROSIO'S VOICE 
	...We're at the seventh minute of the second half. Turin is leading one to 
	zero. The goal was scored by...(The scene is seen from above, by ALFREDO who 
	peers out of the window of the projection booth. CAROSIO'S voice drowns out the 
	soundtrack of the film being shown. ALFREDO is bored. He goes over to the 
	projector, looks through the hole...It's the last sequence of the film. The 
	music swells to a climax as 'THE END' appears on the screen. Swift as ever, 
	ALFREDO turns on the lights in the theatre' stops the projector. Looks back 
	through the hole, to see...)
	
	16:CINEMA PARADISO. INT/EXT. DAY
	
	...the house packed to the rafters. Voices and laughter of the children. Smoke, 
	ice-cream, soft drinks. The USHER has opened the emergency exits to let in air. 
	He fights off the gate-crashers who are trying to get in free. The sound of the 
	sports commentary fills the theatre. The village BLACKSMITH is sleeping in his 
	seat, his head thrown back and his mouth wide open. The KIDS blow up the empty 
	ice-cream sacks and pop them next to his ears. Bang! The BLACKSMITH wakes up 
	with a start, in a sea of laughter. He yells:  
	
				BLACKSMITH  
		Ah! I'll wring all your necks!! Or my 
		good name means nothing! !! Lousy 
		brats! 
	
	SALVATORE doesn't laugh. He is sad. He turns and looks up at the projection 
	booth. He sees ALFREDO through the lion's mouth. ALFREDO also catches sight of 
	him. SALVATORE gives him a timid wave of the hand, as if asking if he can come 
	up a moment. The look on ALFREDO'S face is unmistakable, irrevocable: N0! 
	SALVATORE'S not surprised; after what happened it won't be easy to win him over. 
	Yet there must be some way. But what is it? As usual, SALVATORE is smart as the 
	devil when he's out to get something. Through the emergency exit he sees a woman 
	pass by with a packet in her hand. It is ALFREDO's WIFE, and the packet is his 
	supper. SALVATORE leaps to his feet and runs out to her.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Signora Anna!
	
	17  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION ROOM AND SQUARE. INT/EXT. DAY
	
	ALFREDO starts up the projector. It's time for the documentaries and
	cartoons. SALVATORE peers in from the top of the stairs. He's scared of
	ALFREDO'S reaction, but pricks up his courage and shows him the
	packet. ALFREDO sees him, is about to pounce on him...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(On the defensive) 
		Your wife told me to bring you this. 
	
	His expression betrays the 'put on'. ALFREDO sighs, realizes it's another one of 
	his little games.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Sternly) 
		Give it to me!...
	
	He takes the packet, unwraps it and lifts the lid, shuts it again and puts the 
	container inside the lamp of the projector to keep it warm. SALVATORE hasn't 
	missed a single gesture, but speaks with his eyes 
	to the poor.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I told my mother you weren't the one 
		who gave me the films. That it 
		wasn't your fault. But I thought you 
		said the film could catch fire just 
		to scare me. Now that I know, I won't 
		steal any more from you. That's all I 
		wanted to say. I'm going. 
			(He turns to leave but 
			ALFREDO takes him by the 
			shoulder and stops 
			him.)
	
				ALFREDO  
		Toto, come here. 
	
	All things considered, there is something in that little boy, maybe his 
	feverish passion, that strikes him. He'll talk to him seriously, without 
	resorting to terrorism, try to convince him. He lowers the volume of the 
	monitor, sits down on the stool. SALVATORE raises his eyes from the floor and 
	looks at him at last...
	
				ALFREDO  
		Now listen to what I've got to say. I 
		took up this profession when I 
		was ten years old. In those days 
		there weren't these modern machines. 
		The films were silent. The projectors 
		were run by hand, like this, with a 
		crank. And you wound the crank all 
		day long. It was really rough going! 
		If you got tired and slowed down' 
		boom! Everything would go up in 
		flames!
	
				SALVATORE  
		Then why don't you want to teach it 
		to me too? Now that there's no more 
		cranking, and it's easier?
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Firmly) 
		Because I don't want to, Toto! This 
		is not a job for you. It's like being 
		a slave. You're always alone. You see 
		the same film over and over again, 
		because you have nothing else to do. 
		And you start talking to Greta Garbo 
		and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work 
		on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. 
		Only on Good Friday are you free. But 
		if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a 
		cross...You'd work Good Fridays too! 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Then why don't you change jobs? 
			(ALFREDO sighs, irritated. 
			He reaches out to turn the 
			knob of the carbon rods. 
			He gazes at SALVATORE as 
			if he were a grown-up, 
			somebody who's making 
			things hard for him.)
	
				ALFREDO  
		Because I'm an idiot. How many other 
		guys in town know how to be a 
		projectionist? None! Only a jerk like 
		me could do it. Besides I wasn't 
		lucky. When I was a kid there was the 
		war! When I grew up, another war! Now 
		it's all different. Times have 
		changed. And you want to be a dope 
		like me? Huh? Answer me!
	
				SALVATORE  
		No...
	
				ALFREDO  
		Good for you, Toto. Good for you...
		I'm only saying this for your own 
		good...
			(He gets up and, speaking 
			all the while, goes into a 
			closet with a bucket 
			in it, the toilet of the 
			booth. He turns his back 
			and pees. )
		Cooped up in here you die of heat in 
		the summer and of cold in the winter. 
		You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and 
		earn practically nothing. 
			(SALVATORE listens to 
			him, but taking advantage 
			of the fact he can't be 
			seen, he turns the knob of 
			the carbon rods, just as 
			he had seen done a moment 
			before...)
	
				SALVATORE  
			(In a loud voice) 
		But don't you like anything about 
		what you do? 
			(SALVATORE gazes at the 
			photos on the wall: 
			Keaton, Garbo, Snow 
			White. ALFREDO 
			smiles to himself. Sure, 
			there's something about 
			that damn job he likes:)
	
				ALFREDO  
		With time...you get used to it. 
		Besides, when you hear from up here 
		that there's a full house and that 
		people are laughing, having fun...
		Then you're happy too.
			(ALFREDO is lost in 
			thought, doesn't notice 
			that the documentaries
			and cartoons have 
			finished. The screen is 
			blank. And down in the
			theatre laughter is not 
			heard but an uproar of 
			whistling and
			swearing. SALVATORE'S eyes 
			sparkle, he seizes the 
			opportunity.
			He turns on the lights and 
			stops the projector, just 
			as ALFREDO
			would have done. At which 
			ALFREDO buttons up his 
			pants in a
			hurry and rushes over 
			alarmed, but sees that 
			everything is in order.
			SALVATORE looks at him all 
			smiles, as if he expected 
			a medal for
			civil bravery. Instead, 
			ALFREDO reacts like a wild 
			animal.)
		So I've been wasting my breath? You 
		pretend to agree with
		me, but as soon as my back is turned, 
		you do what you want!
			(He gives SALVATORE a kick 
			in the ass, shrieking:)
		Get out of here! I don't want to lay 
		eyes on you again! This is
		the last straw! Your mother's right, 
		you're crazy!!
			(He pushes him towards the 
			stairs. SALVATORE suddenly
			vanishes, scared out of 
			his wits. ALFREDO talks to 
			himself, in a
			fury:)
		But how'd he do it? The little 
		bastard! By watching, he's
		learned! It's incredible!
			(He peers out of the 
			window, yelling, as he 
			sees SALVATORE
			running through the 
			square. )
		I'm letting the box office know  
		you're not to set foot even into
		the theatre! There are no more 
		tickets for you! And I'm also
		talking to Father Adelfio! You won't 
		be an altar boy any more
		either!!! You little runt!
			(SALVATORE looks at him. 
			Hates him. Yells something 
			offensive:)
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! 
			(But his words are drowned 
			out by the sudden shouting 
			of the people outside the

				CROWD  
		Goal!! Holy Mother of God!!!

			crumples to the ground. 
			The others swarm around

			pale. They check the 
			coupon he is clutching in

	...inside the movie house. The audience murmurs. Somebody opens
	an emergency exit...
	
				SPECTATOR'S VOICE  
		The Neapolitan's won the lottery!!! 
		Let's go see, kids!!! Northerners are 
		always lucky!
			(The whole audience leaps 
			up and heads for the exit. 
			Pushing. Shouting. 
			Laughing and Joking. )
	
	19  SQUARE AND VILLAGE. EXT. MORNING 
	
	Summer has come. The village has a different look. The peddlers sing their 
	monotonous refrains in the village streets. In one street, women are busy 
	canning tomatoes. In one corner of the square, the SHEARER has finished clipping 
	the donkey and is now shaving the hair of a row of bare-chested URCHINS with 
	nothing on but their underwear. Then another MAN disinfects them by spraying 
	them with the hand pumps used to spray trees in the country. The URCHINS 
	laugh. The BILL-POSTER is hanging up the posters of a new film, 'TODAY AT CINEMA
	PARADISO .
	
	20  GRADE SCHOOL DINING HALL. INT. MORNING 
	
	The fifth-grade exams. In the vast dining hall all the children are seated, one 
	for each desk, under the watchful eyes of the teachers. SALVATORE, BOCCIA, 
	PEPPINO, MASINO and COLA have taken places here and there, as nervous as 
	everybody else. The EXAMINING BOARD MEMBER is dictating the text of the 
	arithmetic problem. 
	
				EXAMINING BOARD MEMBER  
		A merchant owns two stores. In the 
		first he sells fruit and vegetables. 
		In the second he sells nails and 
		cement...
			(The PRINCIPAL comes in, 
			interrupts the dictation.) 
	
				PRINCIPAL  
		Excuse me, professor. Here are the 
		men taking the exam for the 
		elementary school certificate. 
			(Turning to the door) 
		Come in, please...
			(All the children turn to 
			look. A MAN around thirty 
			enters, ill at ease. The 
			children recognize him and 
			laugh mischievously. The 
			second is the BLACKSMITH, 
			the one who falls asleep 
			at the movies. The third 
			is a twenty-year-old-boy, 
			ANGELO. The fourth is 
			ALFREDO, embarrassed and 
			red in the face. SALVATORE 
			is speechless. Gives a 
			slightly ironic laugh. 
			There is a look of revenge 
			in his shrewd little 
			eyes.)
	
						Cut to:
	
	The assignment is now being carried out. There is dead silence in the 
	hall. 
	
	TEACHERS and the PRINCIPAL moue about, checking to be sure there are no notes 
	being handed around or other forms of 'collaboration'. The four outsiders are 
	having a hard time. It can be seen on their faces. ALFREDO is also in trouble, 
	doesn't know how to solve the problem, the calculations are too diff cult. He 
	looks at the desk next to him, where SALVATORE is sitting. SALVATORE is about to 
	look up at him, but ALFREDO immediately looks away, too proud to let himself be 
	seen. 
	
	The exchange of glances continues, grotesque, almost comical. SALVATORE 
	meanwhile writes down numbers and operations quite quickly. ALFREDO can't stand 
	it any longer, is nervous, beaded with sweat. He's sorry he ever showed up. 
	SALVATORE laughs up his sleeve, now he has the upper hand. ALFREDO tries 
	sneaking a look at his exercise book in order to copy something. But SALVATORE 
	turns his back, hiding it from sight. ALFREDO tries sneaking a look at somebody 
	else's exercise book, but the damn kid also covers it. It looks like a 
	conspiracy against him. ALFREDO has no way out. He has to accept the idea of 
	eating humble pie. He looks at SALVATORE, motions him with his eyes in a 
	conversation of glances. He asks for help, but SALVATORE stands firm, 
	implacable. 
	
	ALFREDO tries to put it into words in a low voice.
	
				ALFREDO 
		YOU jerk. Tell me how to solve this 
		fucking problem! 
	
				TEACHER  
		Ssssh! Silence back there!! 
	
	ALFREDO insists with his eyes. SALVATORE makes him understand with gestures 
	that he could help him maybe, but...on one condition. He imitates the gesture 
	of winding the crank of the projector. ALFREDO gets the message. It's pure 
	blackmail. He rubs his hand over his sweating face, raises his eyes to the 
	ceiling as if he were swearing. Then he surrenders, accepts the condition. 
	SALVATORE is serious, does not flaunt his victory, but you can tell he is happy. 
	He takes out a sheet of paper he had already prepared, with the solution to the 
	problem, rolls it up into a tiny ball and as soon as the TEACHER passes by, 
	takes aim and flicks it to him. ALFREDO'S hand catches the precious and dearly 
	bought message in mid-air. Their quarrel is over.
	
	2I  VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT. DAY/EVENING
	
	A bright, lilting tune marks the rhythm of the quick, blurred images, as
	in a dance, the images of ALFREDO teaching SALVATORE all the
	secrets of the projectionist trade.
	
	ALFREDO slips the reel on to the projector, unrolls the trailer and hands
	it to SALVATORE. SALVATORE mounts the film on the sprockets.
	Now SALVATORE sets the projector into motion, opens the shutter and
	stands on tip-toe to see the screen from the hole...
	
	A shot from In nome della legge. The main-floor audience applauds a
	line spoken by Massimo Gironi. And from the balcony, the same little
	MAN with the face of a public notary spits below.
	
				MAIN FLOOR VOICE  
		Bastard!! Pencil-pusher!!
	
	ALFREDO shows SALVATORE the running of the film. He points
	to a place on the projector.
	
				ALFREDO  
		Pay attention. This is where it can 
		easily catch fire. If it
		happens, the first thing you've got 
		to do is break it off, here
		and here, so the whole reel doesn't 
		go up in fames.
	
	On the screen, a shot from Riso amaro. A kiss. Unrelenting, the PRIEST rings his 
	bell. SALVATORE licks the film on one side, then on the other. He laughs.
	
				ALFREDO 
		You understand which side the 
		gelatin's on?
	
				SALVATORE  
		It tastes wonderful!
	
	A shot of Amedeo Nazzari in La figlia del capitano. A jump,
	an out-of-rack frame. The audience whistles.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		Fraaaame!! Wake up, Alfredo!
			(SALVATORE tries to do a 
			hand-binding. ALFREDO 
			winds the film, hangs a 
			slip on a nail in the 
			wall.)
	
				ALFREDO  
		These are the shipping invoices for 
		the film. They are always to be kept. 
		You see?
	
				SALVATORE  
		OK, Alfredo.
	
	Down on the main floor, a scene from Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.
	Everyone screams and hides their faces when Hyde looks at the
	camera.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		Holy Mother! What a face! So ugly!
	
	One young man, ANGELO, doesn't hide his face. He looks up at
	a young woman, ROSA, in the balcony, who turns and smiles at
	him.
	
	ALFREDO gives SALVATORE a wooden stool. He's had it made especially for him, so 
	he can be high enough to reach the reels of the projector and the arc lamp. 
	SALVATORE climbs up on it. He laughs, all excited. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		Now you can run it by yourself. 
	
	SALVATORE gives another smile. He is posing in a photographer's studio . He is 
	all dressed up for first communion, holding a white lily. The flash goes off 
	like lightning during a storm. Now SALVATORE is posing next to his mother and 
	little sister. They smile without hugging. Another flash of light. Click!
	
	22  FIFTH GRADE. INT. DAY
	
	Another click. The transparency of Rita Hayworth in her black gown
	from Gilda. MASINO is pasting it inside a minute pair of plastic field
	glasses. Other pupils crowd around him in excitement.
	
				MASINO  
			(In a whisper) 
		Christ, what a piece of ass!!!
	
	But there is not a cheerful atmosphere in the class - on the
	contrary, a strange silence. The pupils are all standing around the
	teacher's desk, having received their end-of-the-year report cards.
	PEPPINO, who shared SALVATORE s desk, is saying goodbye to
	his schoolmates. BOCCIA, COLA, the others. They have serious,
	sad expressions. He and SALVATORE kiss like grown-ups. The
	TEACHER is standing among them. One of the schoolmates does
	not respond lo PEPPINO's goodbye gesture. He takes a few steps
	back, serious, scared, his eyes lowered.
	
				TEACHER  
		Di Francesco, aren't you saying 
		goodbye to your schoolmate?
			(DI FRANCESCO gives his 
			head a little shake. The 
			TEACHER leans over to 
			him.)
		But why?
			(DI FRANCESCO whispers, 
			almost into her ear.)
	
				DI FRANCESCO  
		My father says he's a Communist...
	
	23  SQUARE AND PROJECTION BOOTH, CINEMA PARADISO. EXT/INT. DAY 
	
	Another farewell scene in the square. PEPPINO to his grandparents. His father 
	and mother are also there, saying goodbye to the old folks. There are tears. The 
	cardboard suitcases tied with string are loaded on to the luggage rack of the 
	black car. The scene is watched by SALVATORE and ALFREDO, up in the window of 
	the projection booth. They look like old friends. On the sound monitor, the 
	strains of some American musical comedy tune. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Will they really find work in 
		Germany? 
	
				ALFREDO  
		Who knows?...It's like an adventure. 
			(In a theatrical voice) 
		Hope springs eternal...
			(PEPPINO from the distance 
			gives one last wave at the 
			window of the 
			projection booth. 
			SALVATORE waves back.) 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Peppinoooo! Come back sooon!! 
			(The black car drives off, 
			leaving a cloud of dust 
			that envelops the 
			suppressed sobs of the 
			grandparents standing 
			there waving 	
			handkerchiefs. SALVATORE 
			watches the car drive off. 
			He mumbles:) 
		Good thing Germany's closer than 
		Russia. 
	
	ALFREDO rubs his hand through his hair.
	
	24  CINEMA PARADISO. BALCONY AND BOOTH. INT. EVENING
	
	The lion's head with the beam of light, seen from the balcony.
	SALVATORE'S face appears in the hole beside it, as he peers down at the
	images of the Settimana Incom newsreel.
	The audience is distracted. The snoring of a man sleeping can be heard.
	A pair of urchins pick up a cockroach with their hands, tip-toe down the
	aisle. The sleeping man is the same old BLACKSMITH, with his head
	thrown back. A little hand drops the cockroach into the gaping mouth.
	The URCHINS take to their heels. The BLACKSMITH squirms, wake up
	with a start. Spits, while everybody laughs. The newsreel is now about
	missing soldiers in Russia.
	
				COMMENTATOR  
		The Defense Minister has announced a 
		new listof names of Italian soldiers, 
		so far considered missing and now
		confirmed as dead. Families concerned 
		will be notified directly by military 
		authorities.
	
	SALVATORE pays careful attention, sees the black-and-white
	shots of the last war. The Russian campaign. The troops in the
	snow. Now in detail a heap of personal objects found on the
	corpses. Documents, clothing, glasses, photographs. One quick
	detail catches SALVATORE's eye  among those photographs, for one
	instant he sees one he thinks he recognizes. He quickly sticks a slip of paper 
	into the take-up reel, as when marking the kisses to be cut.
	
	25  PREFECTURE. CITY. INT. DAY
	
	The hands of an OFFICIAL tear off several forms and give them to
	MARIA who is sitting in front of the desk. She is dressed in black.
	SALVATORE stands beside her, holding her hand. They have black
	bands on their arms. An empty stare in their eyes.
	MARIA is pale, a cold look in her sunken eyes. Her heart is bursting in
	her breast. And a lump in her throat prevents her from speaking. She
	looks at her husband's belongings, identifies them  a gold chain, an ID
	card and the photograph, the one SALVATORE saw in the newsreel.
	MARIA strokes it with her fingers. SALVATORE comes up and looks, as
	the OFFICIAL concludes:
	
				OFFICIAL 
		...Unfortunately we don't know what 
		war cemetery he's buried in...This 
		is the form for the pension. If you'd 
		like to sign it...
	
	26  PREFECTURE AND CITY STREET. EXT. DAY 
	
	MARIA walks through the city. She holds SALVATORE by the hand. SALVATORE looks 
	up, trying to catch her eye. He sees her crying, in silence. The heartbroken 
	tears of someone who has lost the one last hope, but held back, so as not to be 
	seen by the child. SALVATORE presses close and puts his arm around her waist. 
	They turn the corner, and walk off in the noisy city, disfigured by the ruins of 
	war. A poster for Gone with the Wind catches SALVATORE's eye. He smiles.
	
	27  CINEMA PARADISO. BOX OFFICE. PROJECTION BOOTH. SQUARE. INT/EXT. EVENING 
	
	Winter has returned. On the screen, a sequence from I pompieri di Viggiu. The 
	theatre is jam full. The sea of heads sways and shakes at the irresistible jokes 
	of Toto. 
	
	Some people have climbed up on the window-sills. The aisles are crammed, an the 
	way down to the screen, where grown-ups and children sit on the floor, their 
	noses in the air. Some people munch crusts of bread they've brought along from 
	home. Almost everybody is smoking. A woman laughs, holding the baby she is 
	nursing. In one corner, at the end of one of the aisles jammed with people 
	standing, a girl laughs, but every now and then her expression reveals a look of 
	deep pleasure. 
	
	Her body moves slightly. Clinging to her from the rear is a man bathed in sweat. 
	
	They are making love standing there among the crowd, which notices nothing and 
	goes on laughing.
	
	In the balcony ANGELO is holding hands with ROSA.
	The curtain over the entrance is open. People are also standing there,
	seeing what they can from the distance, even a corner of the screen
	through the forest of heads. But the line continues on outside...All the
	way to the entrance of the movie house, out in the square. There are
	crowds of people, shivering from the cold, who protest, shove, risk
	provoking incidents. The PRIEST, Father Adelfio, is exhausted, tries to
	calm them down.
	
				PRIEST  
		Don't shove! There's no room! For 
		heaven's sake! I can't
		give another showing, it's late!
	
				VOICES IN CROWD  
		Father Adelfio, we've been here for 
		an hour! There are people inside 
		who've seen it twice! ! ! Move on!!
		Ouch!! My foot!!!
	
	It has just stopped raining, the bell-tower rings eleven o'clock. On
	the poster of the film a ' LAST DAY' sticker. The PRIEST, the
	TICKET-SELLER, the USHER and TWO CARABINIERES push the crowd back, close the 
	front door. The protest grows louder. Fists pound the door.
	
				CROWD  
		Open up!!! Father Adelfio!!
			(The audience in the 
			theatre hears the uproar. 
			Reacts:)
	
				AUDIENCE  
		Ssssh! Sssssh! Be quiet out there!! 
		What the hell!
			(From the window of the 
			projection booth, ALFREDO 
			and SALVATORE look at the 
			crowd down below, yelling 
			and complaining. Some of 
			the people look up at 
			them. )
	
				VOICES IN CROWD  
		Alfredooo! We want to get in!...
		Tomorrow you're taking it off!
			(ALFREDO spreads his arms 
			out as if to say there s 
			nothing he can do.)
	
				SALVATORE  
		Why can't we show the same film 
		tomorrow?
	
				ALFREDO  
		It's got to be sent to another town. 
		And if we don't the owner of that 
		movie house gets pissed off.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Too bad!
	
	The crowd sways nervously. The CARABINIERES give order.
	
				CARABINIERES  
			(Exasperated) 
		Stop! Go home, all of you! Otherwise 
		somebody's going to end up in jail!' 
		That's enough!
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Dramatically) 
		'Joe! A mob doesn't think, doesn't 
		know what it's doing...'
			(SALVATORE gives him a 
			curious, inquisitive look. 
			ALFREDO smiles.)
		Spencer Tracy said it in Fury. 
			(Mischievously) 
		What'd you say if we let these poor 
		devils see the film, Toto? 
			(SALVATORE stares at him 
			in amazement, all 
			excited.) 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Wonderful! But how can it be done? 
	
	ALFREDO turns away from the window. He gives a smirk, imitates the tough 
	American movie stars.
	
				ALFREDO  
		You don't believe my words, but 
		you'll have to believe your own 
		eyes!...And now get your ass off 
		that damn stool, boy! 
	
	SALVATORE laughs, eagerly, as if he were about to see a whole new movie. He 
	climbs off the stool. Both of them move towards the projector...
	
	28  PROJECTION BOOTH AND SQUARE. INT/EXT. EVENING
	
	Trying not to put his hand in front of the lens, ALFREDO removes the
	frame with the glass that protects the projection. He wheels it around
	and motions SALVATORE to look...On the wall behind the projector:
	the film picture appears gradually, reflected by the glass, moves as the
	glass moves all the way over to the window looking out over the square.
	There it disappears. SALVATORE can barely believe his eyes, as if it
	were a piece of magic. He takes a quick look through the hole to see if
	the film is still showing on the screen. It is.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Mysteriously) 
		Go to the window, boy, and have a 
		look...
	
	SALVATORE goes over to the window. Looks out. The reflected
	beam of light ends up on the white row of houses facing the
	square. It's like another screen. Except the images are
	backwards, like when you look in a mirror. And here and there
	are the windows of the houses...For SALVATORE, it's a
	wonderful spectacle, like a dream, ravishing.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo, it's beautiful.
			(A voice is heard in the 
			crowd of people jammed 
			around the entrance to the 
			movie house.)
	
				VOICE IN CROWD  
			(Shouting) 
		Hey, look there!! The movie!!
			(All heeds turn to look at 
			the house behind them.)
	
				CROWD  
		Oh, praise the Lord!! It's true! 
		Look! The movie!! There's Toto!! 
		Hurry! Hurry!...THANKS, ALFRED0000!!
	
	And everybody runs over to the other side of the square, in front
	of the strange new screen. ALFREDO and SALVATORE watch with glittering eyes. 
	SALVATORE lays his hand on the shoulder of his great pal.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Good for you, Alfredo! 
	
	A close-up of Toto projected on the houses, and one of the windows opens. A MAN 
	appears, in his pajamas. Dazzled by the light, he shades his eyes with his hand. 
	He sees all those people looking at him and laughing together.
	
				CROWD  
		Shut the window!! Shut the window! Go 
		to bed!! 
	
	The MAN is dazed. Doesn't now what's going on. Looks around, and sees the 
	black-and-white figures of the film dancing around him. He pops back inside, 
	slams the window shut, almost cared.
	
				VOICES IN CROWD  
			(To ALFREDO) 
		Sound!!! Sound!! Alfredooooo!!
	
				ALFREDO  
		What do you say, should we make them 
		happy?
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Smiling) 
		Sure, sure! 
	
	ALFREDO takes the loudspeaker of the monitor, rings it over to the window, 
	turns it around towards the square. He turns up he volume and the sound-track 
	fills the square. A chorus of approval.
	
				CROWD  
		Aaaaaaaa! At last!
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Looking at SALVATORE) 
		Do you want to go down there? 
			(SALVATORE gives a 
			contented nod.) 
		Go on. 
	
	SALVATORE runs on. ALFREDO looks wistfully towards the huge image in the 
	square. Down in the square SALVATORE heads for the crowd, his eyes trained on 
	the house-front screen. Behind him, the door of the movie house opens. The 
	PRIEST, Father Adelfio, sees the film being projected on the house front, 
	the people standing or sitting on the ground, laughing. His eyes nearly pop out 
	of his head. Then he motions over the TICKET-SELLER, whispers something into his 
	ear. The TICKET-SELLER strides over to the shivering spectators, pulls the pad 
	of tickets out of his pocket.
	
				TICKET-SELLER  
		Ladies and gentlemen! You have to buy 
		tickets! Reduced rate! 
	
	An irresistible chorus of Bronx cheers washes over him. SALVATORE looks around, 
	highly amused.
	
				CROWD  
		Fuck off!! The square belongs to 
		everybody! 
			(The VILLAGE IDIOT peers 
			Out Of the crowd, all 
			worked up.) 
	
				VILLAGE IDIOT  
		No!!! The square's mine!!! Come on, 
		kids, no joking around here!!! 
		Otherwise...
	
	The crowd roars with laughter. SALVATORE laughs too, as if carried away by it 
	all. And over the general merriment looms the shadow of ALFREDO, standing in the 
	window of the projection booth. All at once, on the house-front screen, the 
	image of Toto slows down for an instant, a white blister appears and spreads 
	until it fills the whole screen. The crowd gives a start of bewilderment and 
	fear. SALVATORE jerks his head around to look at the booth.
	
	29  PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY 
	
	The film bursts violently into flame among the gears and sprockets of the 
	projector. ALFREDO is taken off-guard. He breaks the film running into the take-
	up reel, but is unable to do it for the delivery reel. He grabs the film which 
	is catching fire and pulls it out quickly, tries to stop the flames from 
	reaching the reel in the f reproof housing. A desperate race against the speed 
	of the fire. The flames on the floor burn his legs. ALFREDO gives a jump, slows 
	down the movement of his hands for an instant and inevitably the flames run 
	ahead, reach the upper housing. It's like an explosion. The flames leap out, 
	striking him full in the face. ALFREDO doesn't have time to scream, struggles 
	desperately and falls to the floor. Meanwhile the flames envelop everything.
	
	30  SQUARE.EXT.EVENING 
	
	The flash of the flames flares up in the windows of the projection booth. 
	SALVATORE is appalled, elbows his way through the moving 
	crowd. Inside the movie house the murmuring of the audience can be heard, 
	growing louder and louder. A scream...
	
	3I:CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING 
	
	A violent spurt of flames leaps out of the mouth of the plaster lion's head, 
	into the darkness broken by the screams of people rushing for the exits.
	
	32  SQUARE AND CINEMA PARADISO ENTRANCE. EXT. EVENING 
	
	The crowd streaks out of the movie house, enveloped in a cloud of black smoke. 
	
				CROWD  
		Heeeelp! Run for your lives!!! 
	
	In the general panic, SALVATORE tries in vain to get inside, elbows his way 
	towards the street with the stairs leading to the projection booth. The audience 
	clashes against him, knocks him to the ground, almost trampling him underfoot. 
	He is suddenly seized by a superhuman force; gets up, claws his way desperately 
	ahead, with people falling on top of him and to the floor. He finally succeeds, 
	starts up the stairs...
	
	33  CINEMA PARADISO. STAIRS AND PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. EVENING 
	
	The place is filled with smoke. The air is suffocating. SALVATORE streaks up the 
	stairs, gasping for breath. The projection booth is enveloped inflames. 
	ALFREDO's body on the floor, burning. SALVATORE moves quickly, throws a blanket 
	over his shoulders, drags him by the feet over to the stairs, as boxes and other 
	objects fall on him. Using the same blanket, he stamps out the flames that have 
	seared ALFREDO'S clothes. With the force of desperation, he drags him further 
	down the stairs which have been reached by the smoke but not by the flames. 
	ALFREDO doesn't move, his face is burnt. SALVATORE looks at him and only now is 
	panic-stricken, lets out a terrified shriek, like a wounded colt. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo! Heeeelp! Help!!!
	
	34  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING 
	
	The plaster lion looks like a dragon spitting fire and smoke. The statue of the 
	Virgin Mary is also in flames. And the movie screen.
	
	35  SQUARE AND CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. EVENING 
	
	The fire has been put out. Nothing remains of the movie house but the skeleton. 
	Everything has gone up in smoke. 
	
	People stand around, dismayed. They gather around the PRIEST, who is at once 
	grieved and shocked, to express their solidarity and comfort. 
	
				VOICES  
		What a pity! Poor Alfredo! What a 
		terrible thing!! Cheer up, Father, is 
		there something we can do?'
	
				VILLAGE IDIOT  
			(Laughing) 
		Burnt up...Burnt up. 
	
				PRIEST  
		What'll we do now! The town will have 
		to get along without movies! Who's 
		got the money to rebuild it? 
	
	CICCIO SPACCAFICO, the man who won the Sisal pools, comes up, dressed in style. 
	He looks up at the charred cinema. It looks like a battlefield after an enemy 
	attack. From the smoke and ashes to...
	
	36  CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. EVENING
	
	...The great lighted sign of the CINEMA PARADISO . The movie house has been 
	rebuilt. New facade. New billboards. There are people 
	moving about the entrance. It is the evening of the inauguration...
	
	37  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING 
	
	The lobby is crowded with people, authorities, special guests. There is the 
	MAYOR, FATHER ADELFIO and the new owner, CICCIO SPACCAFICO, dressed to the 
	teeth. The MAYOR cuts the ribbon. Flashbulbs pop. Clapping. 
	
				GUESTS  
		Cheers' Congratulations, Don Ciccio! 
	
	The procession advances towards the stairs leading into the theatre. FATHER 
	ADELFIO, with a nostalgic sigh, blesses the lobby, then the corridor. Lastly, 
	the new auditorium, which resounds with toasts and cheers.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		To the Cinema Paradiso! 
	
	The PRIEST sprinkles the new seats, the walls, the screen with holy water...
	
	38  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. EVENING 
	
	Now FATHER ADELFIO is blessing the brand-new projection booth. He also blesses 
	the new projectionist: SALVATORE. He is very nervous, but serious, self-
	possessed. His worried-looking mother is also there for the occasion. The PRIEST 
	turns to SPACCAFICO. 
	
				PRIEST  
		How'd you solve his being under age? 
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		I took out a license as 
		projectionist, thanks to friends down 
		at the guild offices. But I don't 
		know a thing about it. Officially, I 
		do the job...
			(Smiling at Salvatore)
		...but Toto earns the money. 
	
				PRIEST  
		Fine. 
			(To SALVATORE) 
		Always be careful, my boy. Don't ever 
		go to sleep. Be sure another accident 
		doesn't happen. Do everything poor 
		Alfredo taught you. And may God bless 
		you. 
	
	SALVATORE nods his head seriously, assuming a responsible expression. His 
	mother kisses the PRIEST's hand.
	
				MARIA  
		Thanks, Father. Thanks. 
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		And now enough of this gloomy 
		atmosphere. Life goes on! I want to 
		see you happy and smiling!
	
	39  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING
	
	Laughter. The laughter of the large audience at the first showing of the
	inauguration film. Among the spectators, SALVATORE'S mother, MARIA, and his kid 
	sister, El A. Up on the screen, a man and a woman kiss. The first time a kiss 
	has been seen at the Cinema Paradiso. The audience murmurs, surprised and 
	excited.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		Ooooooh! They're kissing!! Look at 
		that!! Christ, that's news!!
	
	An OLD LADY sitting next to the MAYOR, crosses herself, flabbergasted. CICCIO 
	SPACCAFICO chuckles. Rubs his hands: these are going to be golden times for him. 
	FATHER ADELFIO gets up and stalks out of the theatre, indignant; he'll
	never set foot in the place again. The love theme gets louder and
	louder...
	
	40  PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. EVENING
	
	The same music spreads through the booth from the monitor. SALVATORE is by 
	himself. He is watching the film through the hole but strangely enough, the 
	story doesn't absorb him. ALFREDO'S absence makes him nervous, he gazes at the 
	stool he used to sit on. Il has been repainted. A voice from the rear of the 
	cabin:
	
				ANNA'S VOICE  
		Toto?...
	
	SALVATORE turns and at the top of the stairs sees SIGNORA
	ANNA and behind her, ALFREDO, her husband. He is wearing a
	pair of dark glasses and walks with the kelp of a cane. He has
	lost his sight, but not his spirit. He smiles:
	
				ALFREDO  
		Any room for me in this Cinema 
		Paradiso?
			(SALVATORE runs over and 
			embraces him.)
	
				SALVATORE  
		Come in, Alfredo.
	
				ANNA  
			(to SALVATORE) 
		Toto, will you bring him home when 
		you close down?
	
				SALVATORE  
		Yes. Signora Anna. 
			(To ALFREDO) 
		I'm glad you came.
	
						Cut to:
	
	ALFREDO is now sitting there immobile. He listens to the soundtrack of the film. 
	SALVATORE studies the way he stares into empty space, and the idea of darkness 
	frightens him. There is something new in ALFREDO'S manner, as if having grazed 
	death and the loss of his sight had endowed him with a deeper knowledge of men 
	and life.
	
				ALFREDO  
		How's school?
	
				SALVATORE  
		OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, 
		I'11 probably stop going...
	
				ALFREDO  
		Don't do that...Sooner or later 
		you'll be left empty-handed.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Why? What do you mean?
	
				ALFREDO  
		Toto, this isn't for you. For the 
		moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs 
		you, and you need the Cinema 
		Paradiso. But it won't last...Some 
		day you'll have other things 
		to do, more important things...
			(He reaches out and 
			touches SALVATORE'S face 
			to 'feel' his expression.)
		That's right, more important. I know 
		it. Now that I've lost my sight I see 
		more. 
		I see everything I didn't see 
		before...
			(As ALFREDO moves his hand 
			from SALVATORE's face, we 
			see that he is now a young 
			man, and that ALFREDO is 
			older, grayer.) 
		And it's all thanks to you, who saved 
		my life. And I'll never forget it...
			(SALVATORE doesn't 
			understand his strange 
			words. ALFREDO can 'feel' 
			he is troubled.)
		And don't put on that look. I haven't 
		gone off my head yet. You want proof?
	
	And he gives a joking smile. SALVATORE is curious, expects one of his fiendish 
	tricks.
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Smiling) 
		Yes. I want proof.
	
				ALFREDO  
		For example, at this moment the 
		film's out of focus. Go see. 
	
	SALVATORE stands up in disbelief. He looks through the hole, and indeed the film 
	is out of focus. He puts it back into focus, flabbergasted.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Smiling) 
		It's hard to explain, Toto...
	
	41  CAFE IN THE SQUARE. INT/EXT. MORNING
	
	As the BILL-POSTER attaches to the café door a poster of Catene - the
	coming attraction at the Cinema Paradiso - CICCIO SPACCAFICO is
	speaking on the phone in the phone booth. He is clearly peeved.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Only two days? Are you joking?!...
		What do I care if all the copies 
		are reserved?...Catene for only two 
		days in a place like this! Why, 
		people will eat me alive!...
			(Standing beside him 
			listening is SALVATORE. He 
			is carrying school 
			books under his ann. In 
			the café, several curious 
			ONLOOKERS laugh as through 
			the café window they watch 
			some unemployed PEASANT 
			MEN dancing together at 
			the club. SPACCAFICO 
			listens nervously, then 
			shrieks as if he were 
			about to eat the phone.)
		...I know, I know. But even if I 
		start showing at eight in the morning 
		it wouldn't be enough! This is a big 
		town now and you people at the 
		Titanus know it perfectly well! I'm 
		your sole agent and if I get pissed 
		off I'll write straight 
		to Lombardo, in Rome!! I'll give you 
		guys a good run-around!! If I get my 
		dander up, I can let fly, if my 
		name's Spaccafico!! 
	
						Cut to:  
	
	SPACCAFICO AND SALVATORE are now outside the café, head towards the square. In 
	front of the movie house, the CHARWOMAN is at work. SPACCAFICO is so nervous he 
	lights two cigarettes without noticing it. SALVATORE is turning something over 
	in his mind.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You 
		remember that old abandoned movie 
		house where they're supposed to build 
		those low-rent houses?
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		So what's that got to do with it?
	
				SALVATORE  
		The projector's all rusty, but I 
		could fix it in two or three days. 
		Give the place a good cleaning, put 
		in some seats and bring in a 
		projectionist and we'll show Catene 
		in two houses.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
			(Shrieking) 
		What the fuck you talking about? You 
		getting into the act too, Toto? 
		Titanus has trouble giving me even 
		one copy and I have to say thanks! If 
		I ask for two, the least they'll do 
		is cut off my head and play ball with 
		it! 
	
	A shrewd look glitters in SALVATORE s eyes. He smiles.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Who says we need two copies?
	
	42  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. DAY 
	
	The house is jammed with people. Almost bursting at the seams. The last scenes 
	of Catene move across the screen. Tears stream down the faces of the men and 
	women. The children are unusually silent. Even the BLACKSMITH is awake, indeed 
	whispers ahead of time all the lines of Nazzari and Yvonne Sanson, knows them by 
	heart. Among the crowd in the balcony there is ALFREDO and his wife, the MAYOR, 
	DON VINCENZO the landowner, the schoolteachers. Now the music is loud, heart-
	rending. 'THE END' appears on screen. The lights go on. And there is a great 
	din and uproar as one audience leaves and another arrives. The race for empty 
	seats. Quarrels. The CARABINIERES help the USHER maintain order and persuade the 
	people who want to see the film again to get up and leave. 
	
				USHER  
			(Exasperate]) 
		That's enough now! You've seen it ten 
		times! I need the seats! I wish you'd 
		all get the galloping runs! 
	
				CARABINIERES  
		Easy! Easy! Through the emergency 
		exits, quick! Stop the jabbering!!
	
	43  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. 
	
	The end of the film slips through the sprockets. SALVATORE switches off the 
	motor. He is particularly fast in taking the reel out of the housing. And even 
	faster in dropping it into the sack BOCCIA is holding open for him. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Now get running and bring me the 
		first reel. Meanwhile I'll start 
		showing the news! 
	
				BOCCIA  
		OK, Toto!
	
	44  VILLAGE STREETS AND COUNTRYSIDE. EXT. DAY 
	
	BOCCIA speeds like an arrow on his bicycle through the village streets. Tied to 
	the parcel-rack is the sack containing the second part of Catene. He now turns 
	off the main street and takes a short-cut down a country road. He pedals as fast 
	as he can. Until he disappears into the distance, beyond the trees.
	
	45  ENTRANCE OLD ABANDONED MOVIE HOUSE. EXT. DAY 
	
	BOCCIA finally reaches the old movie house, which has been more or less spruced 
	up. Here too people are lined up in front of the posters of Catene. CICCIO 
	SPACCAFICO is waiting impatiently on an outside staircase. He too is holding a 
	sack, containing the first part of the film. The bicycle pulls up in front of 
	him. The sacks are exchanged. 
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Quick! Give it to me! Here's the 
		first part. Get moving! 
	
	BOCCIA heads back to the Cinema Paradiso, to take the first part to SALVATORE. 
	SPACCAFICO dashes up the stairs, and hands the sack to a MAN standing in the 
	door, through which the bare projection booth can be seen, and the projector 
	which SALVATORE has put back into working order. SPACCAFICO yells in excitement. 
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Here you are! Quick, quick!! People 
		are waiting!
	
	46  OLD ABANDONED MOVIE HOUSE. INT. DAY 
	
	In fact, inside the old freezing cold movie house, the audience is grumbling. 
	Everyone is wrapped in overcoats and woollen scarves and are sitting on chairs 
	they've brought from home and wooden benches. The hum of the projector is heard 
	at last. The lights go down. The grumbling subsides. The words 'PART TWO' appear 
	on screen and then the images of the film.
	
	47  VARIOUS COUNTRY ROADS AND VILLAGE STREETS. EXT. DAY/SUNDOWN
	
	Meanwhile BOCCIA pedals his way swiftly through the countryside on his way to 
	the Cinema Paradiso...
	
						FADE.
	
	Now BOCCIA is on his way back to the old movie house. To carry out another 
	exchange of sacks containing the reels of film.
	
						FADE.
	
	Another race back to Cinema Paradiso. BOCCIA starts looking tired, his breath is 
	short. And daylight starts fading into the colours of sundown.
	
						FADE.
	
	The last fading light of sundown.-BOCCIA is pedalling once more back
	to the old movie house. With the same sack tied to the parcel-rack. He
	is exhausted. On his last legs. He slows down, then stops.
	
	48  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING
	
	The lights are still on. In the thick blanket of smoke, the crowd stirs
	nervously. Shouting. Whistling.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		Hey, when's it starting!! We've got 
		ploughing to do in the morning!! 
		Toto, get a move on!! Heeey!!
	
	49  PROJECTION BOOTH. INT/EXT. EVENING
	
	In the booth, the projector is turned off. SALVATORE looks nervously
	out of the window...at the square. But not a sign of BOCCIA. A CARABINIERE 
	peers in through one of the holes.
	
				CARABINIERE  
		What are we going to do, Toto? The 
		whole place here is up in arms. 
		They've been waiting more than a half 
		hour.
	
				SALVATORE  
		What can I do?
	
	50  OLD ABANDONED MOVIE HOUSE. INT. EVENING
	
	Here too the audience is up in arms. They're waiting for Part Two tostart. 
	CICCIO SPACCAFICO tears his hair with rage.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Where's the fucking bastard got to?
	
				SPECTATOR  
		Let's get one thing straight, Don 
		Ciccio! I'm waiting ten minutes 
		more, and if you haven't started...
		you're giving me my money back!!
	
				AUDIENCE  
			(In chorus) 
		Well said! Well said! We want our 
		money back!!
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Easy! Easy! What about my showing you 
		the first part again? Huh? 
	
	People shout, whistle, give Bronx cheers.
	
	
				AUDIENCE  
		No! First part, my foot! We want to 
		see how the story ends!! 
	
	Down in the front row, PASQUALE, the man who sells black market cigarettes, 
	stands up.
	
				PASQUALE  
		I've seen the whole works! You want 
		me to tell you how it ends? 
	
	A shoe comes flying at him.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		Nooo! No! Shut up, you jerk!!
	
	5I  VILLAGE STREETS AND COUNTRY ROADS. EXT. EVENING
	
	SALVATORE has got himself a bicycle and is going off to look for
	BOCCIA. He pedals fast, turns into the country short cut. Looks
	around  not a sign of Boccia. By now it is dark. He sees a MAN in the window of 
	a farmhouse, calls out to him. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Boccia! Boccia! 
	
	SALVATORE rides on. Now he's in the open country. All of a sudden he seems to 
	hear something. He stops. Pricks up his ears. It's a sort of moan - he can't 
	figure out if it's an animal or a man. He turns on the flashlight he has brought 
	along. Takes a closer look around. 
	
	Catches sight of a bicycle wheel on the ground behind a bush. That's where the 
	moan is coming from! He creeps over in alarm. Next to the bicycle he now catches 
	sight of the sack with the film. And the moaning gets louder. 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Alarmed) 
		Boccia, what's wrong? 
			(He runs over to help his 
			friend. Behind the bush he 
			discovers BOCCIA humped up 
			between the legs of 
			TERESA, a prostitute. He 
			moves with all the fury 
			of his young years. 
			SALVATORE has never seen 
			people making love before 
			and is speechless.)
		Damn you, what are you doing? 
	
				BOCCIA  
			(Shouting) 
		Oh, Christ, it's so good!!! 
			(And he goes on ramming it 
			home.) 
	
				TERESA  
		Hey, cut it out! Go away. Shoo! 
	
	With a confused look on his face, SALVATORE picks up the sack and walks away, 
	looking over his shoulder at the couple who go on tossing around more and more 
	frantically.
	
	BOCCIA lets out a shriek of pleasure that rings through the countryside, as 
	SALVATORE pedals off like a madman and disappears into the trees. 
	
	52  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. DAY/EVENING 
	
	Music and the naked body of Brigitte Bardot. A row of youngsters on the main 
	floor stare at the naked actress, all excited. A regular rhythmic tremor runs 
	through them, half-hidden by the back of the seats.
	
	A scene from a horror film. The frightened faces of the audience. Off in one 
	corner, the door of the men's toilet opens and a MAN with a contented look comes 
	out, followed by TERESA, who motions another one to come in. In the projection 
	booth, SALVATORE is eating the meal his mother has brought him.
	
	A gangster film. The tense faces of the audience. A gun battle. Rounds of 
	machine-gunfire in the night. The shots echo through the theatre. A LITTLE BOY 
	claps his hands over his ears. Alternating with the machine-gunfire on screen, a 
	real pistol shoots the back of one of the spectators, the landowner DON 
	VINCENZO, who slumps down in his seat without anybody noticing...The shooting 
	continues up on screen...
	
	SALVATORE'S hand holds a lighted match under a piece of film, before the 
	horrified eyes of SPACCAFICO and the USHER, and the puzzled expression of 
	ALFREDO. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch 
		fire! 
	
				ALFREDO  
		Progress! It always arrives too late!
	
	A scene from Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. The only empty seat
	in the theatre is the one where DON VINCENZO was killed. A flower
	has been tied to it with string. All the other seats are taken.
	
						Fade to:
	
	ROSA and ANGELO are sitting next to each other. They are watching a
	different film. But she has a baby in her arms  they have got married,
	have set up a family.
	
	In the balcony, the MAN with the face of a public notary spits down
	below with a contented look. But this time the main floor takes its
	revenge and a blob of shit hits him square in the face.
	
	53  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. MORNING 
	
	In the morning the theatre is empty. All the doors are shut. Light filters in 
	through the open windows up above, illuminates the posters of coming attractions 
	and the yellowish screen. Off-screen, a woman's voice 
	and a boy's voice are heard. 
	
				TERESA'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		Come on...That's right...relax...
			(Laughing)
		...Don't be scared...
	
				SALVATORE'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		Is it true that if I bleed I've got 
		to squeeze lemon juice on it? 
	
				TERESA'S VOICE  (Off-screen) 
			(A loud laugh) 
		Lemon juice?...That's a new one for 
		you! Who tells you this crap...Take 
		it easy...That's right...You see, 
		it's not painful, is it?
	
	Slow pan along the walls of the theatre, the empty aisles,
	discovers SALVATORE on the floor between the seats with
	TERESA, the prostitute who has already been seen. SALVATORE is
	making love for the first time in his life. He is awkward and
	clumsy. There is an uncertain look in his eyes, his livid face is
	dripping with sweat.
	
				TERESA 
		...There you are! That's right, 
		that's right! Keep going...
			(SALVATORE is quicker, has 
			learned the lesson. TERESA 
			goads him on.)
		Ah!!! There, now you're a real man! A 
		man! ? A real calf!
			(SALVATORE's panting 
			slackens into a deep sigh 
			of pleasure.)
	
	54  VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT/EXT. DAY 
	
	The blade of a knife, clutched in a hardened hand. A blow. A cry of pain. A calf 
	falls like a dead weight to the ground...SALVATORE photographs the animal in 
	the throes of death with his 8mm movie camera. As well as the faces of the MEN 
	who now bleed and skin it quickly. In the vast slaughter-house, the voices of 
	the men and animals mingle together.
	
	SALVATORE'S eye is quick to catch the most unexpected expressions of ordinary 
	people. His movie camera is always ready, like a hunter's rifle. Now he is 
	shooting...
	
	A meeting in the square: the passionate reactions of the peasants listening to a 
	speaker who flails his arms around.
	
	At school: the old SCHOOLMISTRESS sitting at her desk, sunk in God knows what 
	dreams, her eyes staring off into empty space, as a tear runs down her pale, 
	unhappy face, and the unknowing STUDENTS carry out their assignments.
	
	At the railroad station: the nervous excitement of the people waiting on the 
	platforms. SALVATORE pans his camera on to TWO MEN fighting. But an arriving 
	train comes in between. Salvatore follows the train, pans along the cars. The 
	train stops. 
	
	-A door opens and the passengers climb out. Several TRADERS, a CARABINTERE, a 
	group of commuting STUDENTS, the TICKET-COLLECTOR, a distinguished looking 
	COUPLE and lastly, a GIRL who stops in the middle of the viewfinder. SALVATORE 
	is immediately attracted by her face. He goes on shooting without leaving it a 
	moment. He follows her through the lens. She is very beautiful, must be around 
	sixteen, a simple, sweet face, blue eyes. She is certainly the daughter of the 
	distinguished looking COUPLE who got off just before she did. The little family 
	moves off down the platform. Salvatore follows the girl's movements, as if 
	hypnotized. Now she passes by him, turns towards him for one moment, as if 
	trying to figure out where he is aiming that funny-looking gadget. SALVATORE 
	smiles at her, entranced.
	
	55  HIGH SCHOOL. COURTYARD. ENTRANCE. EXT. MORNING
	
	The JANITOR is ringing the bell. In the courtyard, on the other side of
	the gate, the STUDENTS prepare to enter. SALVATORE is with a group
	of schoolmates, including BOCCIA. And they all stare, wide-eyed, at
	the GIRL from the station. She has her books under her arm and is
	walking by herself.
	
				SALVATORE  
		You know that one there?
	
				BOCCIA  
		She's new. Not bad though. Nice-
		looking.
			(SALVATORE has the look of 
			somebody seeking for an 
			idea, some way of picking 
			up a conversation with 
			her.)
	
				SECOND STUDENT  
		Her father s the new bank director. 
		Loaded, luxury and easy living!
	
				FIRST STUDENT  
		People who jerk off with a shirt so 
		they won't get their hands dirty. 
			(Laughs.)
	
	All at once, BOCCIA and SALVATORE notice that the GIRL drops
	her lunch without noticing as she is about to enter the school. They
	fly off, swift as arrows. It's a chance not to be missed. BOCCIA is
	the quicker, is already in the lead. SALVATORE gives an angry
	gesture. A flash come into his eyes, the same flash he had as a little
	boy when he finds the right way to hit home. He picks up his step,
	trips BOCCIA and brings him to the ground. He pounces on him
	and lets go with his fist. He starts running again. Picks the
	bundle off the ground. Catches up with the GIRL from the
	station, nervous and inexperienced, but polite.
				SALVATORE  
		Look, you dropped this.
	
	And he hands her her lunch with a smile. She recognizes him.
	
				ELENA  
		Oh, thanks. I hadn't noticed...
	
	She takes the bundle as SALVATORE touches her hand delicately.
	
				SALVATORE  
		My name's Salvatore...And yours?
	
				ELENA  
			(Smiling) 
		Elena. My name's Elena.
	
	SALVATORE is very flustered. He feels as if all his blood were
	throbbing in his head. He tries to say something else, but the words
	catch in his throat.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I...I...The other time at the 
		station.
	
	BOCCIA suddenly grabs him by the collar and yanks him away. ELENA is frightened, 
	puts her hand over her eyes so as not to see.
	
	56:CINEMA PARADISO.PROJECTION BOOTH.INT.AFTERNOON 
	
	SALVATORE has a black eye, swollen shut. He is setting up a little 8mm projector 
	on a stool. ALFREDO is sitting in one corner. He has come to keep him company. 
	He listens to the sound-track of the movie being shown. 
	
				ALFREDO
		Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto? 
	
				SALVATORE  
		That's right, Modern Times. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		I've shown it so many times I know it 
		by heart. The first time I showed 
		it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first 
		wife died. They kept it hidden from 
		me all day so they wouldn't have to 
		close down the movie house. I only 
		found out that night, after the last 
		show. Those are things you never 
		forget...
			(Changing his tone.) 
		So, Toto, how are these home movies 
		going? 
			(SALVATORE has switched on 
			the little projector and a 
			square of light appears on 
			the wall beside ALFREDO, 
			with the scenes shot in 
			town.) 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Yes. 
			(The shots of the 
			slaughter-house have 
			appeared.) 
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Whispering) 
		What is it, what is it? What's the 
		picture? 
	
				SALVATORE  
		It's people in the slaughter-house 
		killing a calf. There's blood all 
		over the floor, like a lake. And 
		through this lake another calf passes 
		by on its way to die. 
	
	ALFREDO is concentrated, as if SALVATORE'S description transmitted the 
	real image to him, the colours, the forms. The railway station has appeared on 
	the wall, and the sequence of ELENA. SALVATORE does not move, does not say a 
	word, as he gazes at those blue eyes looking into the camera. ALFREDO senses 
	something funny in the boy's s11ence.
	
				ALFREDO  
		Now what can you see?
	
				SALVATORE  
		Nothing, there's nothing. It's all 
		out of focus.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Smiling) 
		Is there a woman?...Tell me the 
		truth...
			(SALVATORE is shamed, 
			uncertain, doesn't know 
			whet to say. A tender look 
			filters through ALFREDO's 
			dark glasses. He has 
			obviously caught on and 
			whispers:) 
		There is a woman.
	
	SALVATORE is forced to admit it, with a sigh.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Yes, it's a girl I saw at the 
		station.
	
				ALFREDO  
		What's she like? What's she like?...
	
	And as other shots of ELENA appear on the screen, SALVATORE describes her. As 
	only somebody in love could.
	
				SALVATORE  
		She's nice. My age...Slender, with 
		long hair, brunette. She had big blue 
		eyes, a simple expression and a 
		little beauty mark on her lip, but 
		really tiny. You can only see it 
		close-up. And when she smiles...She 
		makes you feel...
	
	He stops. Only now does he realize that he has let himself be carried away by 
	passion, by the desire to talk about her. ALFREDO smiles, spellbound...
	
				ALFREDO  
		Eh! Love...what a mystery!
			(SALVATORE turns off the 
			projector and heaves a 
			deep sigh, almost of 
			liberation. ALFREDO'S 
			sympathy does him a lot of 
			good. It's nice to be 
			understood. He moves over 
			closer to him. ALFREDO 
			runs his hand through his 
			hair, whispers:)
		I understand you, Toto...The ones 
		with blue eyes are the
		most beautiful. Whatever you do, you 
		can't make friends with
		them.
			(SALVATORE is comforted by 
			the way he talks. He 
			didn't think it
			was possible to put into 
			words the things he has 
			felt since meeting
			ELENA. He nods his head. 
			ALFREDO sighs.)
		Eh, there's nothing to be done about 
		it! The heavier a man is,
		the deeper his footprints. And if 
		he's in love, he suffers,
		because he knows he's up a one-way 
		street. Because love is a
		meaningless thing when a man gets it 
		into his head to do what
		he wants...
			(SALVATORE is touched by 
			his sensitivity, by his 
			intense, passionate, sweet 
			way of speaking.)
	
				SALVATORE  
		What you say is wonderful! But sad...
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Smiling) 
		They're not my words. John Wayne said 
		it in Shepherd of the Hills.
	
	SALVATORE suddenly changes expression, as if discovering he was being made fun 
	of.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Stinking two-timer!! 
			(And they burst out 
			laughing.)
	
	57:CINEMAPARADISOANDVARIOUSSTREETS.EXT.DAY
	
	A grey, windy day. It is opening-time and the shutters of the movie
	house are being rolled up. SALVATORE is about to enter through the
	small door of the spiral staircase, when in the distance he catches sight
	of...
	
	ELENA crossing a street with her books under her arm. She is alone.
	SALVATORE doesn't stop to think twice, dashes off, runs through streets
	full of dust, another square, turns the corner, but has lost sight of her.
	He looks around in all directions  there she is! He starts running again.
	And finally catches up with her, all out of breath, practically
	speechless with emotion.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Hi, Elena!
	
				ELENA  
		Hi. Why are you running?
	
				SALVATORE  
		No particular reason...
			(He is entranced by her 
			eyes. He wants to tell her 
			all sorts of
			things, say all the words 
			he has memorized a 
			thousand times. But
			now he can't get them out. 
			His knees tremble. He does 
			his best to
			overcome his confusion, 
			but all that comes out 
			is:)
		Nice day, huh?
			(A gust of wind envelops 
			them in a cloud of dust 
			and a clap of
			thunder rends the air. 
			ELENA laughs, amused by 
			the blunder.)
	
				ELENA  
		Yes, nice day.
			(SALVATORE laughs too. He 
			gazes at her long hair 
			tossed by the wind. She 
			turns to leave.)
		...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Bye-bye, Elena.
			(ELENA walks away. And 
			SALVATORE also turns to 
			leave. Only now is he 
			seized by disappointment,  
			regret at not having made
			the best of the 
			opportunity. He talks to 
			himself.)
		...What an idiot! What an idiot! 
		'Nice day'! Christ!!
	
	58:SALVATORE'S BEDROOM.INT.DAY 
	
	SALVATORE projects images of ELENA on his wall. He lies across his bed gazing at 
	her image.
	
				SALVATORE  
		You probably don't believe me, but 
		I'm going to become the leading man 
		in your life. Sure, I don't look like 
		Marlon Brando, but look at me, really 
		look at me. Am I really so ugly? So 
		should I try once more? Maybe It'll 
		succeed. What do you 
		say? 
	
	ELENA seems to be saying, Yes. As SALVATORE kisses ELENA, her image disappears. 
	He is left with his face against the wall in the white light from the 
	projector.
	
	59:PHONEB00TH AND ELENA'S HOUSE.INT.DAY
	
	SALVATORE is in a phone booth. The telephone will certainly help him feel less 
	nervous.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Hello, can I speak to Elena, please?
	
				WOMANS VOICE  
		Yes. 
			(SALVATORE recognizes 
			ELENA's voice, changes his 
			tone, turns sweeter, more 
			personal.)
	
				SALVATORE 
		Is that you, Elena?
	
				WOMAN'S VOICE  
		Yes...
	
				SALVATORE  
		Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't recognize 
		your voice. This is Salvatore, 
		remember?
	
				WOMAN'SVOICE  
		Yes...
	
	SALVATORE finally speaks, says everything all in one breath, without stopping, 
	without hesitating, in order to leave no room for shyness.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Listen, I know that every time we see 
		each other I make a fool of myself, 
		but I'm not like that, I swear. It's 
		just that when I see you, I feel shy, 
		the right words don't come to me, I 
		don't have the courage to say that 
		all I do is think about you...
			(He has finally got it 
			out. He's dripping with 
			sweat, but happy at having 
			succeeded. He continues.) 
		That's right, Elena, you're the last 
		thing I think of when I go to sleep 
		and the first when I wake up in the 
		morning. And at night I always dream 
		of you. I know, it's not good on the 
		phone. But please, don't get me 
		wrong. Because I love you very 
		much...
	
				WOMAN'SVOICE  
			(Interrupting him) 
		If you don't stop phoning her, I'm 
		calling the police!
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Stunned) 
		But excuse me, who's speaking?
	
	At ELENA'S house, a WOMAN who is visibly in a state is speaking on the phone.
	
				ELENA'S MOTHER  
		I'm Elena's mother, you filthy pig! 
	
	SALVATORE feels like dropping through the floor, tries to get a word in to 
	explain, to apologize, but the flood of insults overwhelms him.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I'm sorry, Signora, maybe there's a 
		misunderstanding...I...
	
				WOMAN'S VOICE  
		And don't call my daughter any more. 
		Never! 
	
	SALVATORE has no choice but to hang up, disappointed, defeated. He's so mad he 
	starts slapping himself.
	
	60:ALFREDO'S HOUSE.EXT.AFTERNOON
	
	Good Friday. ALFREDO comes out of his house, leaning on
	SALVATORE's shoulder. They go off down the street, towards the
	church. SALVATORE has finished recounting his misadventure.
	
				ALFREDO  
		I told you, the blue-eyed ones are 
		the most difficult.
	
				SALVATORE  
		But why? There must be some way to 
		make her understand!
	
				ALFREDO  
		Don't think about it, Toto. Don't 
		even try. With feelings, there's 
		nothing to understand. 
	
	SALVATORE gives an angry gesture. This time ALFREDO'S words do not quiet his 
	frenzy, don't help him. He moves away from him a few steps.
	
	ALFREDO stands there motionless in the middle of the road.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Stop it! I've had enough of your 
		sermons! You act as if you created 
		the world! 
			(A bicycle streaks by 
			ALFREDO, who gives a 
			startled jump, as if it 
			were about to 
			run into him. He raises 
			his voice, panic-
			stricken.)
	
				ALFREDO  
		Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off 
		with me now! Come here! I don't 
		know where the fuck I have to go. 
			(A MAN on a bicycle almost 
			collides with ALFREDO. 
			SALVATORE fumes, goes over 
			to him listlessly. ALFREDO 
			puts his hand back on his 
			shoulder and they start 
			walking again. ALFREDO has 
			calmed down, but his voice 
			is determined.) 
		And the next time be careful how you 
		talk. Not to take credit away 
		from the Lord, but if I had created 
		the world, in all modesty, certain 
		things would have come out better. 
		But unfortunately such was not the 
		case.
	
				SALVATORE 
			(Laughing) 
		You see, it s like I say. You always 
		have an answer for everything.
	
				ALFREDO  
		I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm 
		going to tell you a story. 
			(And he squeezes 
			SALVATORE'S shoulder. It's 
			the signal for taking a 
			rest. They sit in a 
			doorway. ALFREDO starts 
			telling his story, and his 
			way of speaking is 
			hypnotic, magical. With 
			those eyes lost in empty 
			space, it's as if his 
			thoughts and his words 
			came in from some other 
			dimension, mysterious, 
			hidden...) 
		Once upon a time a king gave a feast 
		and there were all the most beautiful 
		princesses of the realm. Basta, one 
		of the guards, saw the king's 
		daughter: she was the loveliest of 
		all! And he immediately fell in love 
		with her. But what could a poor 
		soldier do compared with a king's 
		daughter?!...One day he managed 
		to meet her and told her he couldn't 
		live without her. The princess was so 
		struck by the depth of his feeling 
		that she said to the soldier  'If you 
		will wait a hundred days and a 
		hundred nights beneath my balcony, 
		then in the end I'll be yours.' 
		Christ, the soldier ran off there and 
		waited! One day, two days, 
		ten, twenty...Every night she looked 
		out of her window, but he never 
		budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never 
		budged! The birds shat on him and the 
		bees ate him alive! After ninety 
		nights he was gaunt and pale and 
		tears streamed from his eyes but he 
		couldn't hold them back. He didn't 
		even have the strength to sleep any 
		more. The princess kept watch...And 
		on the ninety-ninth night, the 
		soldier got up, picked up his chair 
		and left!
	
				SALVATORE  
		No! You mean right at the end? 
			(SALVATORE is amazed, 
			dumbfounded; that ending 
			has made a deep 
			impression. They 
			start walking again.)
				ALFREDO  
		That's right, Toto, right at the end? 
		And don't ask me what it means. If 
		you figure it out, let me know...
	
				SALVATORE  
		I'll be damned'
	
	6I:CHURCH.INT.EVENING
	
	Before the high altar, the Virgin Mary in tears clutches three spikes inher 
	hand. And beside her is another statue  Christ descended from the
	cross. MEN and WOMEN stand in line to kiss Christ's wounds. Many people are 
	sitting between the pews. SALVATORE helps ALFREDO take a seat, and at that 
	moment catches sight at the far end of ELENA on her way to the confessional. 
	
	She kneels down on one side, just as FATHER ADELFIO comes out of the middle 
	booth and goes to the altar to say something to the sacristan. SALVATORE'S eyes 
	light up. He has had a brainstorm. 
	
	He leans over and whispers something into ALFREDO's ear. ALFREDO nods his head. 
	SALVATORE is so happy that he gives him a pat on the cheek, like a caress. Then 
	he hurries over to the PRIEST. Says something in a low voice, gesticulates with 
	some agitation, points to the pew where ALFREDO is sitting. The PRIEST tries to 
	say he can't now, but SALVATORE insists, and wins. The PRIEST goes over to 
	ALFREDO, leans over. 
	
				PRIEST  
		What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of 
		all times! 
	
				ALFREDO  
			(In a grave voice) 
		Father Adelfio, I have a very serious 
		doubt that is torturing my soul. And 
		you've got to help me, because I've 
		lost all peace of mind...
	
	SALVATORE watches from a distance. He sees the PRIEST put on an alarmed 
	expression and then sit down beside ALFREDO. Everything's ready. He creeps over 
	to the confessional. ELENA is there, kneeling down waiting for the PRIEST to 
	arrive. In an instant, without anyone noticing, SALVATORE pops inside the 
	confessional. He shuts the little door below and draws the purple curtain. On 
	the other side of grille, only a few inches away, those eyes that keep him awake 
	all night. 
	
				ELENA  
		Father, I have sinned...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(In a low voice) 
		We'll talk about that later. 
	
				ELENA  
			(Surprised) 
		But...who...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Interrupting her) 
		Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend 
		everything's normal. I'm Salvatore. 
	
	ELENA'S eyes pop in amazement.
	
				ELENA  
		What are you doing here?
	
	Meanwhile ALFREDO and the PRIEST continue their unusual and animated discussion. 
	The PRIEST is appalled, crosses himself. 
	
				PRIEST  
		But Alfredo, what you're saying is 
		horrifying! 
	
				ALFREDO  
		I know. But take the-miracle of the 
		loaves and fishes, for example! I 
		think about it a lot...How is it 
		possible for...
	
	In the confessional, the whispered conversation between SALVATORE and ELENA 
	continues.
	
				ELENA  
			(Annoyed) 
		There was a terrible rumpus at home. 
		My mother told my father. And how 
		could you have mistaken my voice?!
	
	SALVATORE is mortified, on tenterhooks, keeps an eye on ALFREDO and the PRIEST 
	through a crack in the curtain.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Forgive me, Elena. It was stupid of 
		me. But I had to talk to you. 
	
	She looks up at him and her eyes are even more beautiful in the candlelight. 
	This time SALVATORE finds the courage to speak to her calmly, with 
	determination. That grille probably helps him, allows him to see without being 
	seen.
	
				SALVATORE  
		You're so beautiful, Elena...That's 
		what I wanted to tell you. When I 
		meet you, I can't put two words 
		together because...you give me the 
		shivers. I don't know what you do in 
		these situations, what you're 
		supposed to say. It's the first time. 
		But I think I'm in love with you. 
	
	ELENA gazes through the grille at the two shining specks of his eyes. She is 
	bewildered by that flood of passion. At that moment, an OLD WOMAN kneels down on 
	the other side of the confessional and her face appears behind the grille.
	
				OLD WOMAN  
		Father, I have sinned...
			(SALVATORE turns lo her, 
			instinctively.)
	
				SALVATORE  
		I absolve you in the name of the 
		Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. 
		Go in peace, my daughter. 
			(And he slams the panel 
			shut in her face. ELENA is 
			barely able to control her 
			laughter.) 
		When you laugh, you're even more 
		beautiful. 
	
	She pulls herself together again and puts on a serious, but tender look.
	
				ELENA  
		Salvatore, it's awfully sweet of you. 
		And even though I don't know you, I 
		like you. But...I'm not in love with 
		you. 
	
	For SALVATORE, it's as if a knife had plunged straight into his heart. He sits 
	there gazing into her eyes, at the beauty mark on her lip, without moving. Then 
	through the crack sees ALFREDO and the PRIEST conversing nervously, God knows 
	what they're saying. And he turns back to her.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I don't care. I'll wait.
	
				ELENA  
		For what?
	
				SALVATORE  
		For you to fall in love with me too. 
		Listen carefully. Every night, when I 
		get off work, I'll come and wait 
		beneath your window. Every night. 
		When you change your mind, open your 
		window. That's all. I'll 
		understand...
	
	He smiles at her. She is upset by those exaggerated words, but also intrigued.
	
	The PRIEST has meanwhile solved the problem that ALFREDO has made up as an 
	excuse.
	
				PRIEST  
			(Exhausted) 
		You understand now? You see it 
		clearly?
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Hypocritically) 
		Oh yes, father. Now everything's 
		clear.
	
				PRIEST  
		And the next time don't go around 
		saying such heresy. You survived the 
		fire at the movie house. But no one 
		can save you from the fire of Hell!
	
	62:SQUARE AND ELENA'S HOUSE. EXT. NIGHT
	
	Sweet poignant music accompanies SALVATORE's long waits beneath the window of 
	ELENA'S room... A warm early summer night. The last spectators wander off into 
	the streets. The VILLAGE IDIOT makes his rounds of the square.
	
	SALVATORE is beneath her window. He waits. The shutters are open,
	but not the windows with the curtains. ELENA peers at him through a
	dark crack...
	
						Fade to:
	
	A rainy night. SALVATORE is back there again. Determined,
	headstrong. A dog keeps him company, taking shelter under an
	overhanging roof. The window is shut...
	
						Fade to:
	
	SALVATORE'S hand adds another check to an endless row of checks on
	the calendar. A check a day...
	
						Fade to:
	
	Another night. Wind. The window is still shut. SALVATORE's eyes are
	the eyes of a lovesick man prepared to face the hardest battles, just to
	win, just to conquer his loved one. She peeks at him through the crack,
	but he can't see her...
	
						Fade to:
	
	The paces of the calendar are covered with checks. Several months
	have gone by. SALVATORE adds a check on the last page, on 30 December. Tomorrow 
	night will be...New Year's Eve. The streets are empty. Loud merry voices can be 
	heard coming from the houses. Old discarded objects hail down from balconies. 
	Firecrackers explode here and there. SALVATORE is there in the same old place, 
	as usual. The shutters are open, but not the windows, and all is darkness 
	inside. SALVATORE is wrapped in a large overcoat and stamps his feet to keep 
	warm...
	
	63:SALVATORES HOUSE. GIANCALDO. INT. NIGHT
	
	Toasts are being prepared in SALVATORE's house. MARIA is there
	with her daughter, LIA, then ALFREDO with his wife, ANNA.
	SALVATORE is the only one missing for the "family" to be complete.
	The bottle of spumante and the Christmas cake are ready. The radio is
	on with the New Year's Eve programme.
	
				MARIA  
			(Nervously) 
		But why hasn't Toto shown up? The 
		movie house is closed at this hour!
	
	ALFREDO has a know-all look. He tries to put her mind at rest.
	
				ALFREDO  
		He had to do something for me...
	
	Over the radio, music and merrymaking
	
	64:ELENA'S HOUSE.EXT.NIGHT 
	
	More sounds of merrymaking, coming from ELENA's house. SALVATORE listens to it, 
	sees the shadows of her parents and relatives, maybe even hers, ready to 
	celebrate, welcome in the New Year. But further on, that window remains dark and 
	shut. SALVATORE gazes at it again. 
	
	There is a new look in his eyes, like a gleam of hope. Maybe it's the 
	specialness of that night, maybe it's the fire crackers, the festive atmosphere, 
	but something tells him that's going to be the right night. The night when 
	she'll open her window. In fact, a light suddenly goes on in the room. 
	SALVATORE'S eyes sparkle, have already taken on the hue of victory. 
	
	The window is pulled open, and his heart starts pounding like a drum. The music 
	reaches its climax. Two hands come out. SALVATORE shuts his eyes for a moment, 
	to hold back the flood of feeling. He opens them again and sees......The hands 
	reach out and take hold of the shutters and pull them shut. The light goes out. 
	It is midnight. An echoing voice does the countdown.
	
				RADIO VOICE  
		Six, five, four, three, two, one, 
		zero! Happy New Year! Happy New Year! 
	
	And a roar of voices, shouts, explosions, fills the air. SALVATORE has remained 
	standing there immobile, speechless. Disappointed. Defeated.
	
	65  SALVATORE S HOUSE. GIANCALDO. INT. NIGHT
	
	At his house, glasses are about to be raised. There is a strange, tense 
	merriment. MARIA is unable to conceal her concern, her presentiment. She glances 
	at the door, hoping to see SALVATORE appear.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(To Maria) 
		There's nothing to worry about. He's 
		probably with his friends. 
			(To all) 
		Let's toast!
	
				EVERYBODY  
			(Toasting) 
		Here's to you! Here's to you! Happy 
		New Year!
	
				MARIA  
		For Toto too, here's to you!! Happy 
		New Year! !
	
	Everybody echoes MARIA'S toast...
	
	66  ELENA S HOUSE. EXT. NIGHT 
	
	But SALVATORE is not happy in these first few minutes of the New Year. He feels 
	hurt, humiliated, rejected. He walks off amidst the old discarded objects flying 
	down from the terraces. That was his last night. He's not showing up beneath 
	that balcony any more.
	
	67  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. AFTERNOON 
	
	Outside there is a violent thunderstorm. The pounding of the rain and the 
	rumbling of the thunder drown out the sound-track of the film being shown. Two 
	buckets are on the floor to catch the water dripping through the roof. SALVATORE 
	is alone. For the first time he feels he hates the profession he's got into. He 
	is tearing up the calendar where he checked off the nights he spent waiting for 
	ELENA. He tears it into a thousand pieces, as if trying to wipe out the traces 
	of his grief. He is so absorbed in his thoughts that he doesn't notice that 
	someone has appeared at the top of the stairs and quietly entered the room. And 
	now stands there watching him in silence. The thunder is deafening. That someone 
	is ELENA. She comes up behind him, realizes he is thinking 
	about her. Whispers. 
	
				ELENA  
		Salvatore...
	
	Loud passionate music is heard on the monitor. SALVATORE turns and sees her as 
	if in a dream. It is a sudden blow to the heart. The look on her face is 
	wonderfully sweet, the look of somebody who knows she is madly loved and 
	who now realizes at last that she is in love too. For SALVATORE it is an 
	overwhelming, almost unbearable moment...A long passionate embrace that is 
	never-ending. They are happy, cling to each other never to leave each other 
	again. 
	
	They spin around, end up against the wall where strips of film are hanging, the 
	first-part endings and the trailers. Another intense look, their eyes 
	locked...And it is their first kiss. A kiss at first timid, hesitant, almost 
	clumsy, and then becomes resolute, poignant. Amidst the film strips dangling 
	around and touching their young faces. Meanwhile the film has finished, the 
	projector turns uselessly...Down below the screen is blank, the audience 
	whistles...But SALVATORE hears nothing, neither the whistles nor the useless 
	whirring of the reels in the projector. All he hears is her breathing, an he 
	feels is the warmth of her 
	skin.
	
	68  VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT/EXT. DAY
	
	The happiest, most vivid moments SALVATORE and ELENA spend
	together:
	
	A country outing. They eat a lavish salad using the flat branches of the
	prickly pear for plates.
	
	A chase through an endless field of wheat.
	In the projection booth. A cake with seventeen lighted candles.
	SALVATORE and ELENA blow them out together. And then a kiss.
	
	69  ROAD AT THE EDGE OF TOWN.EXT. DAY
	
	SALVATORE is driving an old beaten-up Balilla he bought from a
	car-wrecker. ELENA sits beside him, having the time of her life. They
	roar with laughter. The car jolts, moves by fits and starts, jarred by the
	holes in the road, and besides SALVATORE is not such a hot driver. She
	fondles him.
	
				ELENA  
			(Ironically) 
		You have a great future as a driver. 
		If they don't arrest you first!!
	
				SALVATORE  
		That's nothing to do with it, it's 
		the car that's still being run in...
	
	He has barely finished the last sentence when the car gives a
	sudden violent shudder. A sharp report. A cloud of white smoke issues from the 
	motor. And the Balilla stops dead in its tracks. ELENA and SALVATORE cannot 
	smother their wild laughter. They embrace. 
	
				ELENA  
		SO now how do we get home? 
	
						Cut to:  
	
	The two of them are standing beside the empty road, looking bored, as they have 
	already been waiting a long time for someone to go by, a car, a wagon. When all 
	at once a car comes around the bend, heading for town. SALVATORE and ELENA flag 
	it down. 
	
	The DRIVER slows down. The back door opens, a MAN gets out. An alarmed and 
	startled look comes over ELENA's face  that man is her FATHER. She sees him 
	stride over in a rage. 
	
	He has almost reached SALVATORE, who tries lo be polite, to make the best of the 
	situation. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Hello, Dr Mendola...Hem...
	
	ELENA buries her face in her hands, so as not to see...
	
	70  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING
	
	SALVATORE has a bruise on his cheek and two Band-aids on his face.
	He got himself a good thrashing, and then some. The house is jammed,
	as on the great occasions. Curiosity is written all over the faces of the
	audience. But what they're seeing is not a film, but an instalment of
	Double or Nothing. SALVATORE is standing by a teleprojector which
	has been set up in the central aisle of the balcony. It is a machine that
	makes it possible to project television show on the screen. ALFREDO is
	sitting beside him.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(In a low voice) 
		Toto, are you pulling my leg or 
		something? How is it possible to see 
		this television without film?
	
				SALVATORE  
		Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. 
		And if you buy a television set, you 
		can watch it at home, without any 
		fuss...
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Sceptically) 
		Could be...But I don't like this
		business. It smells fishy to me.
	
	ELENA is sitting in one corner of the balcony with her parents. Sitting beside 
	her FATHER is the owner of the movie house, SPACCAFICO, who thanks him.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
			(In a low voice) 
		You see what a bright idea, Dr 
		Mendola? But without the bank loan 
		how could I have bought the machine? 
		If we don't get organized around 
		here, in this day and age, we'll meet 
		the same end as the Punch and Judy 
		shows! 
	
	ELENA is not very interested in the TV show. She sneaks a look at SALVATORE. 
	From the looks on their faces, it is clear that things are not going very well. 
	He gives her a nod, as if to say he wants to speak to her and that she should 
	figure out some way! ELENA leans over to her MOTHER, whispers something into her 
	ear.
	
	7I  CINEMA PARADISO. TOILET. INT. EVENING
	
	ELENA's MOTHER stands waiting in front of the women's toilet,
	gazing at Mike Bongiorno emceeing the TV show in the distance.
	
	Inside the toilet, ELENA is standing on the toilet seat whispering to
	SALVATORE, who is standing on the 20ilet seat of the men's toilet.
	
	Their eyes are barely able to peek over the flush tank which they have
	uncovered. ELENA is worried.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Could it be your father doesn't like 
		the work I do...That my family's too 
		poor...Is that it? 
	
	She gives a nod of the head, but only faintly, so as no2 to wound his 
	vulnerability. SALVATORE sighs.
	
				ELENA'S MOTHER  
			(Off-screen) 
		Elena!
	
				ELENA  
		All right! ! 
			(To Salvatore, in a 
			whisper) 
		For the moment it's impossible to see 
		each other...As soon as school is 
		out, we're going to go stay with 
		friends in Tuscany. We'll be there 
		all summer...Maybe if you came up, 
		we could meet in secret...
				SALVATORE  
			(Crestfallen) 
		But we're opening the outdoor movie 
		theatre this summer. What will I do 
		all this time without seeing you?!
				
				ELENA  
		I'll write to you every day. Don't 
		worry. I love you. The summer'll be 
		over and I'll be back...
	
	They reach out to kiss each other. Who knows when they'll be able to see each 
	other again?
	
				ELENA'S MOTHER  
			(Off-screen) 
		Elena! 
	
	ELENA climbs down, pulls the chain and walks off, leaving SALVATORE standing 
	there on the toilet seat.
	
	Summer has come. A bevy of barefoot children chase after the carts carrying the 
	carters' families to the beach to go swimming. SALVATORE, helped by the USHER, 
	has finished loading the disassembled projector on to a wagon in order to carry 
	it to the outdoor movie house. The USHER has hung a sign on the Cinema Paradiso 
	to the effect that 'Showings to continue at the Imperia Arena', and now climbs 
	into the wagon. 
	
	The horse moves off slowly and the monotonous clatter of its hoofs reminds 
	SALVATORE that the summer is going to be long this year, longer than ever. And 
	he leans on the projector that totters and lurches from the jolting of the 
	wheels. A cart carrying a cheerful and noisy family pulls up alongside the 
	wagon. There are the MEN from the slaughter-house. They recognize SALVATORE. 
	
				SLAUGHTER-HOUSE MAN 
		Well, look who's here!! Cecil B. De 
		Mille! Hey, Toto!! When are you 
		coming to shoot another film?!? 
	
	And they laugh, with their gaping toothless mouths. SALVATORE doesn't feel like 
	joking, not even like answering. He looks away, so as not to see their leers. He 
	wants to be by himself. 
	
	73  BEACH AND IMPERIA ARENA. EXT. DAY 
	
	
	The beach is almost deserted, dotted here and there with groups of bathers. The 
	carts and horses are scattered in the sand, near the Imperia Arena, where some 
	WORKMEN are putting on the finishing touches for the new opening. The wagon 
	arrives and SALVATORE and the USHER unload the projector.
	
	74  BEACH. IMPERIA ARENA. PROJECTION BOOTH. EXT.EVENING
	
	A sultry evening. The jacklights of the octopus fishers twinkle on the
	dark horizon. The sound-track of a comic film reverberates over the sea,
	the laughter of the audience mingles with the sound of the shallow waves
	breaking on the rocks. A group of LITTLE BOYS in a boat pulls away
	from shore. They join some more boats standing still in the water, all of
	them crammed with LITTLE BOYS all looking in the same direction...
	towards the screen of the open-air movie at the water's edge. There is a
	funny scene.
	
				LITTLE BOYS  
		All seats are sold out! Free entrance 
		and payment on the way out!! Sssssh!!
	
	And they guffaw noisily. Their laughter is echoed by more
	laughter, in the distance...
	
	...the laughter of the Arena audience, scattered among the
	metal chairs. By dint of laughing, the people in one of the rows
	of chairs tip over backwards. Screams, laughs, whistles.
	The projection booth has a door at the back with stairs leading
	down to the rocks. SALVATORE is sitting on the ground, bare
	chested, tired and sticky with sweat. He is reading a letter from
	ELENA. He is so engrossed the words can almost be read on his
	face.
	
				ELENA'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		Salvatore, my darling, here the days 
		never end. I find your name 
		everywhere if I read a book, do a 
		crossword puzzle, thumb through a 
		newspaper...You're always before my 
		eyes. Today I've got some rather bad 
		news. At the end of October we're 
		moving to the city where I'll attend 
		the University. It'll be hard to see 
		each other every day. But don't 
		worry, whenever I can get away I'll 
		always come running to you, to the 
		Cinema Paradiso.
	
	On the Arena screen, with its potted plants and palm trees, a
	very funny scene is being shown. The audience again bursts into
	wild laughter. And the audience of LITTLE BOYS in the boats also laugh. One
	of them, laughing himself to tears, loses his balance and falls
	into the water. The others howl with laughter. A voice rises up
	out of the carousel of boats.
	
				URCHIN  
		Fuck me! I've caught an octopus! An 
		oooooctopus!
	
						FADE
	
	75  VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT/EXT. DAY 
	
	The August sun is blazing hot. People are forced to stay inside when the sirocco 
	blows. The streets are empty. And there is a strange silence. Nothing can be 
	heard except far in the distance, from somewhere in the country, the love song 
	of some carter...SALVATORE hears it too, stretched out on the floor of his 
	room, his eyes fixed on the ceiling where flies buzz around nervously. The 
	MAILMAN comes down the street on his bicycle, rides up to SALVATORE and hands 
	him a letter...Sitting in the shade of a white wall, SALVATORE reads the 
	letter. Next to him, the dog that kept him company at night, beneath ELENA's 
	window. He gazes up at him as if looking for news of her.
	
	76:ARENA IMPERIA. PROJECTION BOOTH. EXT/INT.EVENING
	
	The Arena is crowded with sun-burnt faces. On screen, scenes from
	Ulysses. On a shelf in the projection booth, there is an enormous pack of 
	letters. SALVATORE is worn out. The waiting has destroyed him. He looks
	like a madman. As he winds up one of the parts of the film, he repeats
	her name obsessively, under his breath.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Elena...Elena...Elena...
	
	Now he is sitting outside on the back steps, a few yards from the
	sea. There is a breeze this evening, the waves are rather high and
	the boats of 'gate-crashers' can be seen out in the water, rolling
	fitfully but not dangerously. SALVATORE stretches out, gazes up
	at the inky sky and talks to himself, just like a madman,
	whispering...
	
				SALVATORE  
		When will this shitty summer be over? 
			(Half shutting his eyes) 
		In a film it'd already be finished...
			(Smiling)
		...Fade-out and cut to a nice 
		thunderstorm!!! Huh? that'd be 
		perfect!
	
	A clap of thunder explodes in the air. Loud, rumbling. SALVATORE'S eyes pop 
	open. The Arena audience looks up in alarm at the sky...The 'gate-crashers' in 
	the boats also look up and see a streak of lightning ushering in another clap of 
	thunder. One of those storms is building up that ruins late summer 
	nights. SALVATORE gives a contented smile as the cloudburst pours down 
	violently, suddenly... The Arena audience scatters with a howl and scurries 
	over to the overhanging roofs of the projection booth, to take shelter and to go
	on watching the film despite the rain...
	
	The LITTLE BOYS in the boats quickly pull tarpaulins over their
	heads...But SALVATORE does not get up. He lets the rain fall on him,
	goes on laughing, incredulous and stunned as if a real miracle had
	taken place. And as he shuts his eyes and lifts his head up, to
	catch more rain on his face, and gives himself up to that marvellous feeling of 
	joy, a mouth comes to rest passionately on his lips it is ELENA. SALVATORE opens 
	his eyes in utter amazement, it seems like a vision, another hallucination 
	created by the rain...Instead no, it is really her! 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Elena!...But when...
	
				ELENA  
		I got back today. You can't imagine 
		the excuses I had to make up to be 
		here...
	
	SALVATORE's lips interrupt her. It is an intense, a stupendous kiss. They've 
	probably never been so happy as they are at that moment. They cling to each 
	other as the rain goes on streaming over their bodies, mingling her hair with 
	his, binding them ever closer.
	
	77  CINEMA PARADISO. ENTRANCE. EXT. DAY
	
	Autumn has arrived. In the streets, the PEASANTS prepare the barrels
	for preserving the grape must. ALFREDO is sitting in front of the Cinema 
	Paradiso with SPACCAFICO and the USHER. It is a quiet moment, they chat, while 
	the humming of the projector and the sound track of the film can be heard 
	through the window of the booth. The MAILMAN stops and hands SPACCAFICO a folded 
	sheet of paper.
	
				MAILMAN  
		Don Ciccio, this is for Toto. Give it 
		him...
			(And he pedals off on his 
			bicycle.)
	
				ALFREDO  
		What is it?
	
	SPACCAFICO unfolds it, reads it, claps his hands on his head, in alarm.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Holy blood of Judas! Now what am I 
		going to do??!
	
	78  UNIVERSITY. EXT. DAY
	
	ELENA is waiting near the University. She paces nervously back and
	forth. Glances at her watch. He's late. She looks around in all
	directions and sees him at last. He comes running up to her. They
	embrace...
	
				ELENA  
		So what'd they say?
	
				SALVATORE  
		The army says that, as a war orphan, 
		I don't have to serve in the 
		military, but nothing can be done. 
		It's a bureaucratic error. I have to 
		leave. Day after tomorrow morning. 
		They're sending me to Rome. But 
		they'll discharge me ten days later. 
		Let's go...
	
	He takes her hand, turns to go to a café. ELENA holds back. She has caught sight 
	of her FATHER's car approaching. ELENA turns to look and in a faint voice 
	reveals the reason for her nervousness.
	
				ELENA  
		No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's 
		my father.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Good, this way we can finally talk. 
		I'll convince him this time.
	
				ELENA  
		He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He 
		has other plans for me.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Who?
	
				ELENA  
		The son of one of his colleagues. 
		Don't act that way. We'll talk about 
		it later. Wait for me Thursday at the 
		Cinema Paradiso. I'll be coming with 
		the five o'clock bus. 
	
	SALVATORE looks with longing as ELENA drives away with her father. 
	ELENA gives him a meaningful look through the window. SALVATORE returns the 
	look, but stands there motionless, with a grim expression, like someone who 
	knows how to take the treacherous blows of life. The car drives off and with it 
	ELENA. Their eyes hang on the same thread. The thread of hope and now of fear.
	
	79  CINEMA PARADISO. ENTRANCE. EXT. MORNING
	
	The poster of Il Grido hangs on the billboard outside the theatre.
	SPACCAFICO replaces 'THURSDAY' with a 'TODAY' sticker. The
	CHARWOMAN is washing the floor of the lobby. SPACCAFICO shouts
	up to SALVATORE, who is in the projectionist's booth. SPACCAFICIO
	says that tomorrow he'll be leaving and today is his last day on the job,
	and he's sorry.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Toto, this is no film for the common 
		herd. One day'll be more than 
		enough...So tonight, please set up 
		tomorrow's film, so the projectionist 
		who is coming will find it ready.
	
				SALVATORE  
		OK...
	
	SPACCAFICO understands SALVATORE's sadness.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Cheer up, Toto. I'll be here waiting 
		for you. No one's taking your job 
		away from you. Don't worry!
	
	80  SQUARE AND PROJECTION BOOTH, CINEMA PARADISO. EXT/INT. DAY
	
	The bus has pulled into the square but among the people getting out
	there is no sign of ELENA. SALVATORE stands nervously up in the window of the 
	projection booth, glances at his watch. It's already five-thirty and she hasn't 
	come. He checks the projector. The first part has just begun and the reel is 
	full of film.
	
	The first part is now about to finish, the reel is almost empty, and ELENA still 
	isn't there. SALVATORE is extremely nervous, worried, mortified by his meeting 
	with her FATHER. 
	He sees ELENA's face pulling away in the car. Thinks back over her 
	terrible confession. He paces back and forth, as if he were in a prison cell, 
	thinking up solutions...The stair light finally goes on; there she is SALVATORE 
	dashes over and down the stairs to meet her. He comes down the final turn of the 
	spiral staircase and finds himself face to face with ALFREDO, who is slowly 
	making his way up with the help of his cane. SALVATORE freezes to the spot. 
	ALFREDO senses his disappointment. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		You weren't expecting me? 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Nervously) 
		No, Alfredo, I was coming to help 
		you...
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Smiling) 
		You were expecting her? Huh? 
			(SALVATORE doesn't answer. 
			He's too worried, too 
			upset. ALFREDO climbs 
			another step, whispering.)
		...It's a nasty business waiting by 
		yourself. In company it's better. 
		No?...Then I'll leave. 
	
	As usual ALFREDO'S sweetness comforts SALVATORE, indeed suddenly gives him a 
	bold idea, one that quiets his nervousness. He puts a hand on ALFREDO'S 
	shoulder.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo, I need your help!
	
	8I  ROAD TO THE CITY. EXT. AFTERNOON 
	
	The Balilla speeds as fast as it can down the road to the city, where ELENA s 
	family has gone to live. SALVATORE drives along in a state of agitation. The 
	idea of having to leave without seeing ELENA is his obsession. An obsession he 
	refuses to accept...
	
	82 CINEMA PARADISO.PROJECTION BOOTH.INT.AFTERNOON
	
	The second part has begun, the reel is full. For the first time in many
	years, ALFREDO is alone in the booth, sitting in front of the projector,
	and he feels helpless. Not only because he's blind, but also because
	there is nothing he can do for SALVATORE. A strange agitation comes over him, as 
	if he were experiencing the same anxiety troubling his 'Toto' at that moment. 
	Meanwhile, the film roll on and with it, time, minutes...
	
	83  CITY.EXT.AFTERNOON
	
	SALVATORE has already reached the city. He slows down at the bus
	terminus. Looks at the people waiting, but she is not there...
	He asks several girls in front of the University. But they haven't seen
	her...
	
	He phones from a phone booth. But nobody answers. His self-control
	is about to give way to desperation...
	
	84  CINEMA PARADISO.PROJECTION BOOTH.INT.AFTERNOON
	
	On the reel there is less film. Like an hourglass with the sand trickling
	through...
	
	85:ELENAS HOUSE IN THE CITY.EXT/INT.AFTERNOON 
	
	SALVATORE comes streaking up in front of her house. He screeches to a stop, 
	dashes out like greased lightning. His nerves are tense, a slight tremor runs 
	through his whole body. He rings the bell, but nobody answers. A MAN who lives 
	in the building opens the front door and comes out. 
	
	SALVATORE seizes the chance and climbs up to the third floor. He pounds on the 
	door furiously, almost cracking his knuckles. But all to no avail; there is 
	nobody at home. He shrieks, panic stricken. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Open up! Open up! Elenaaa! 
	
	And in fact, there is somebody inside: ELENA's MOTHER. She sits there immobile, 
	without a word. 
	
	The pounding on the door reverberates in the room, but she does not budge, 
	determined to ignore that desperate message.
	
	86:CINEMA PARADISO.PROJECTION BOOTH.INT.AFTERNOON
	
	The reel spins faster. The film is almost ended. By now there is very
	little time...
	
	87  ROAD TO THE VILLAGE. EXT. SUNDOWN 
	
	And SALVATORE is on his way home, defeated. Be drives as fast as he can. Be is 
	in a terrible state, can't figure out what's happened. Can't explain it. And 
	that's what hurts. 
	
	88  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. SUNDOWN
	
	The words 'THE END' appear on the screen...and the film runs out, leaving the 
	projector turning uselessly. ALFREDO is alarmed. He can hear that the film is 
	finished, but doesn't know where to begin. He gropes around. He's scared. Like a 
	little boy calls his mother when he's lost in a crowd, so old ALFREDO calls 
	SALVATORE. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		TotooooO! TotooooO! 
	
	The few people down in the audience start whistling and complaining about the 
	film they haven't understood. 
	
				SPECTATORS  
		Lights! Christ, what a piece of 
		crap!! We want OUT money back!!! 
		Heeeeey!! Bandits!! 
	
	Others are shouting that they like the film.
	
	89  CINEMA PARADISO. ENTRANCE. EXT. SUNDOWN 
	
	The Balilla screeches to a stop in front of the theatre. SALVATORE darts out and 
	runs to the stairs...
	
	90  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. SUNDOWN 
	
	SALVATORE turns the lights on in the theatre and turns off the projector, trying 
	to calm down ALFREDO, who has got to his feet, frightened. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		But where'd you go, Toto?!! 
	
				SALVATORE  
		I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy! 
			(And he folds him into his 
			arms, like calming down a 
			little boy who has had a 
			nightmare. Be whispers, 
			still out of breath:) 
		Sit down, sit down...
			(ALFREDO quiets down as 
			SALVATORE lowers him into 
			a chair, and asks him the 
			only question upon which 
			his last hope depends.) 
		Did she come? 
	
				ALFREDO  
		No, nobody came. 
			(And he embraces him, 
			almost as if to comfort 
			him in his great 
			disappointment.)
	
	For SALVATORE it's really the end: she's not coming. Tomorrow he'll be leaving 
	without having seen her again. 
	
	SALVATORE'S hands remove the photographs of Amedeo Nazzari and of ELENA from the 
	wall, slip them into one of his pockets. 
	
	Now the hands open the metal containers of tomorrow's film, take . 
	out the reels to set them up, pick up the receipt - his last before leaving - 
	and with the same mechanical gesture, hang it on a nail, as usual.
	
	91  ROME. VARIOUS SETTINGS, MILITARY LIFE. EXT/ INT. DAY/NIGHT 
	
	A wild frenetic sequence, set to the pace of military life...SALVATORE, in 
	uniform with close-cropped hair, answers his superior, shouts: 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Radio Operator Di Vita Salvatore! 
		Third Battalion, Ninth Company, 
		sir!!!
	
	Target practice. SALVATORE fires all the shots in the cartridge, one after the 
	other... 
	
	A SECOND LIEUTENANT barks out a march rhythm in the blazing sun. 
	
				SECOND LIEUTENANT  
		One, two, one, two!! Attention! Left 
		march! 
	
	SALVATORE sneaks out of line, goes over and slips a letter into 
	the mailbox and hurries back to his place.
	
	On one of the public phones in a square of Rome, SALVATORE is phoning ELENA. 
	Nobody answers. He slams down the receiver, as the line of SOLDIERS waits its 
	turn...
	
	Night-time. A large plastic bag full of water. A thud. SALVATORE wakes up with a 
	start in a lake of ice water. He lets out a terrified shriek as the others 
	laugh, protected by the dark. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Aaaaaaah! Heeeeeelp!! 
	
	In the large dormitory, the SERGEANT is handing out the mail. He 
	throws a pile of letters on SALVATORE'S bunk. They are his letters to ELENA, 
	stamped 'ADDRESS UNKNOWN'.
	
	Mess duty. SALVATORE is washing Up, in a sea of water and grease.
	He rimes a pan full of tomato sauce with a tap hose. A spurt of red water 
	splatters him in the face. 
	
	A training run. Another letter which SALVATORE drops into the mailbox...
	
	A cold, rainy night. SALVATORE stands stiff as a poker in front of the 
	Ammunition depot. It is his first guard duty. Soaked to the skin, gazing wide-
	eyed into empty space. 
	
	COLONEL'S office. 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Aggressively) 
		Colonel, I was supposed to spend ten 
		days here and it's been about a year, 
		and I haven't ever gone borne. I'd 
		like a furlough, at least! 
	
	SALVATORE is in the guardhouse. A cold, dark, filthy cell. His nerves start to 
	give way. He bows his head in despair. 
	
	Hospital. SALVATORE is exhausted, run-down. The night-stand is jammed with 
	medicines. He lies in bed without moving, staring off into empty space, and 
	repeats obsessively in a low voice, as if talking to himself. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Elena...Elena...Elena...
			(He has touched the 
			extreme of suffering, a 
			young man who has 
			been denied love and 
			affection, his rights, 
			freedom. A NURSE comes 
			up.) 
	
				NURSE  
		Di Vita Salvatore, get ready, your 
		discharge has come through.
	
	SALVATORE registers this information with his eyes and nods absently.
	
	92  GIANCALDO. SQUARE AND STREETS. EXT. DAY 
	
	The bus disappears around the corner leaving SALVATORE standing there alone. It 
	is a blazing hot day. The sirocco wind blows the yellow dust in all directions. 
	The square is empty, the billboard in front of the closed movie house announces 
	a Western. SALVATORE puts his suitcase on the ground, looks around. Everything 
	exactly the same, immobile. Only one new feature  in the cafe there's a jukebox 
	playing 'Estate' sung by Milva. 
	
	SALVATORE turns towards the Cinema Paradiso. The projectionist is at the 
	window of the booth, smoking a cigarette. Who knows who he is, where he came 
	from. A hot flurry of dust. SALVATORE turns and sees a dog leaping around kim, 
	wagging its tail. It's the dog that kept him company during his nights beneath 
	the window. SALVATORE gives a start of joy, drops his suitcase and leans over to 
	stroke him. Then he hugs him, as if he were an old friend. 
	
	93  ALFREDO'S HOUSE. INT. AFTERNOON 
	
	SALVATORE goes to see ALFREDO. He is still in bed, has just woken up. He is glad 
	to hear his 'Toto'. He feels his forehead, his eyes and cheeks, as if to 'see' 
	him. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		You 're thinner...You can tell 
		you've not been treated well. 
			(As usual, you can't hide 
			anything from ALFREDO. 
			SALVATORE senses something 
			different in him that he 
			can't figure out, like 
			same wild restlessness 
			within). 
	
				SALVATORE  
		They tell me you never go out, never 
		talk to anybody. Why?
				
				ALFREDO  
		Toto, sooner or later there comes a 
		time when talking or keeping quiet is 
		the same thing. So it's better to 
		shut up. 
			(Changing his lone) 
		It's hot in here. Toto, take me to 
		the beach. 
	
	94  BEACH AND WATERFRONT. EXT. AFTERNOON 
	
	The sea is ruffled and the air is less sultry, easier to breathe. 
	SALVATORE and ALFREDO walk slowly along the waterfront. ALFREDO totters 
	slightly, holds on to SALVATORE, who is telling him something very funny. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		At the Christmas party the lieutenant 
		pinches a girl's ass. The girl turns 
		around: it's the daughter of the 
		commanding officer. The lieutenant is 
		scared to death and says: 'Miss, if 
		your heart is as hard as what I have 
		just touched, I'm done for! 
	
	And they roar with laughter. They look like two old school buddies telling each 
	other dirty jokes. They stop beside a low wall. ALFREDO knows that those laughs 
	are simply a way of uselessly dancing around the countless things that are 
	troubling SALVATORE. And he breaks the ice, while SALVATORE is still 
	laughing.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Seriously) 
		Did you ever see her again? 
			(SALVATORE'S laughter dies 
			away, taken off-guard as 
			he is. Then he lights a 
			cigarette.)
	
				SALVATORE  
		No. And nobody knows where she is. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		It was probably meant to be like 
		this. Each of us has a star to 
		follow. So now what are you thinking 
		of doing? 
	
	It's a terrible question, and SALVATORE has no answer to it. In fact, would 
	rather not even talk about it. He changes his tone, as if he hadn't heard it, 
	laughs, trying again to ding to the funny jokes he heard during military 
	service.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Listen to this one...The commander 
		says to the sergeant: 'You 
		remember that windmill that used to 
		be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the 
		mill's gone but the wind's still 
		there!' 
			(And he bursts into 
			nervous laughter. But this 
			time ALFREDO remains cold, 
			unmoved, does not laugh 
			with him. SALVATORE 
			gradually falls silent. He 
			doesn't know what to say. 
			For the first time in his 
			life, he doesn't know what 
			goal to aim for, doesn't 
			know what to do. The cloud 
			of smoke wreaths his 
			nervous face, now he seems 
			to relax, whispers:) 
		You remember the story of the soldier 
		and the princess? 
			(ALFREDO nods his head.) 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Now I understand why the soldier went 
		away just before the end. That's 
		right, just one more night and the 
		princess would have been his. But 
		she, also, could not have kept her 
		promise. And...that would have been 
		terrible, he would have died from it. 
		So instead, for ninety-nine nights at 
		least he had lived with the illusion 
		that she was there waiting for him...
			(This time SALVATORE is 
			the one to explain 
			something to ALFREDO. And 
			ALFREDO realizes how 
			bitter his story is and, 
			above all, that the boy 
			standing there is no 
			longer a boy...) 
	
				ALFREDO  
		Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! 
		This land is cursed. 
			(They are now leaning 
			against a boat on the 
			beach. ALFREDO goes on 
			whispering his words.) 
		When you're here every day you feel 
		like you're at the center
		of the universe, it seems like 
		nothing ever changes. Then you go 
		away, one year, two...And when you 
		come back, everything's different. 
		The thread has broken. You don't 
		find those you were looking for, your 
		things no longer exist. Isn't that 
		the case?...You've got to go away a 
		long time, for many, many years, 
		before coming back and finding your 
		people again, the land where 
		you were born...But not now, it's 
		impossible. Now you're blinder than I 
		am.
			(Intense words, straight 
			from the heart, and 
			SALVATORE is spellbound. 
			He whispers with a smile:) 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Who said that? Gary Cooper, James 
		Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
			(ALFREDO also gives a 
			gentle smile) 
	
				ALFREDO  
		No, Toto, nobody said it. I say it! 
		Life's not like you saw it in the 
		movies. Life...is harder. 
			(He lays his hand on 
			SALVATORE'S shoulder, 
			gives it a hard squeeze.) 
		Get out! Go back to Rome. You 're 
		young, the world is yours! And I'm 
		old...I don't want to hear you talk 
		any more, I want to hear talk about 
		you. 
	
	SALVATORE gives a shudder that runs through his very soul. The setting sun lies 
	colorless on the horizon.
	
	95  VARIOUS SETTINGS. EXT/INT. NIGHT 
	
	Night. The square is empty. SALVATORE is sitting on the church steps. 
	His head in his hands. He has to make a decision leave or stay. And why?... 
	'What decision will he make?' is the question that keeps ALFREDO awake, in his 
	hot dark bedroom...
	
	MARIA, his mother, also can't get to sleep. She knows, senses, that her son is 
	on the verge of an important turning-point. But what will he decide? What will 
	happen?...
	
	Also LIA, his sister, feels a strange, heavy tension in the air. And 
	doesn't sleep. She's probably wondering where SALVATORE is at that 
	hour... 
	
	He's sitting on the ground. But even if he were to go to bed he wouldn't 
	sleep. He rubs his face with his hand. The church bell chimes four a.m...
	
	ALMOST THIRTY YEARS LATER, another distant bell is chiming four a.m. And 
	SALVATORE is once again wide awake. He is thinking, with his hand on his face, 
	just like then. And the same decision to make: what to do? Stretched out beside 
	a sleeping WOMAN, he goes on staring at the window. Outside, the storm has 
	passed. The long memory has almost faded, only the sound of a train surfaces in 
	his mind...
	
	96  GIANCALDO RAILWAY STATION. EXT. DAY
	
	It's the train that THIRTY YEARS EARLIER had pulled into the station
	of his home town before leaving for Rome. SALVATORE hugs his 
	MOTHER and SISTER. The moment has come to say goodbye to  
	ALFREDO. The old man is deeply moved. A heart-rending trembling
	comes into his husky voice. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		Don't come back any more, don't think 
		about us, don't turn round, don't 
		write, don't give in to nostalgia. 
		Forget us all. If you can't hear it 
		and come back, don't come looking for 
		me, I won't let you into the house, 
		you understand? 
	
	They clasp each other tightly, as if they knew they wouldn't be meeting 
	again...
	
				SALVATORE  
		Thanks for all you've done for me. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		Whatever you do, love it like you 
		loved that projection booth of the 
		Paradiso when you were little...
			(The train moves now. 
			Hands wave in the air, 
			drawing further and 
			further away. The PRIEST 
			has arrived at the last 
			moment and waves goodbye 
			from the distance.)
	
				PRIEST  
			(Shouting) 
		Goodbye, TotooooooO!!! I got here too 
		late. What a shame! 
	
	The figure of ALFREDO and the others can no longer be distinguished. Only a 
	distant blur at the end of the track. 
	
	97  PUNTA RAISI AIRPORT. EXT. DAY 
	
	THIRTY YEARS LATER, a plane flies over Sicily. It lands on the 
	runway char seems to emerge from the sea and flatten out towards the slopes of 
	the dark mountains. Salvatore's face appears among the clouds reflected in one 
	of the plane windows. He has the tense look of the man who suddenly comes home 
	after the adventure of life has carried him afar, wandering the world, where he 
	has forgotten everything. From the plane window to another window...
	
	98  SUPERHIGHWAY. INT/EXT. DAY 
	
	...the window of the taxi-cab driving SALVATORE to his home town. The scenery 
	moving by on either side of the road summons up sweet memories. A lot of things 
	have changed, but the colors are still the same. The yellow running through the 
	entire landscape is unmistakable. And all those black birds perched in a row on 
	the guard-rail are crows. 
	
	The cab now approaches the outskirts of Giancaldo. But if the sign, 
	hadn't been there with the name on it, it could be an entirely different 
	place...
	
	99  SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. EXT/INT. DAY
	
	The house where SALVATORE'S MOTHER lives is also new, nearer the 
	sea. 
	
	The old lady is sitting alone in an armchair in the parlor, knitting a white 
	sweater. Her hands move very swiftly, almost mechanically. 
	
	The hands of a woman who is waiting. The front doorbell rings twice. MARIA stops 
	short. That is what she has been waiting for. She mumbles in excitement. 
	
				MARIA  
		It's Toto...I knew it...
	
	And she scrambles to her feet, dropping her knitting in the chair, one needle 
	dangling over the edge. She hurries off, forgetting that she still has the ball 
	of white yarn in her apron pocket. And the yarn runs off the needles and the 
	knitting comes undone quickly as she moves about the house, goes down the stairs 
	to the front door.   
	
	There the yam stops and MARIA' s excited voice is heard.
	
				MARIA 'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		Toto!...
	
				SALVATORE'S VOICE (Off-screen) 
		How are you, Mamma?... 
	
	The camera now moves, discovering them through the parlor window, hugging each 
	other outside the front door. Under the curious eyes of an old bored dog.
	
	100  SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. INT. DAY 
	
	MARIA is no longer wearing an apron. Mother and son are sitting side 
	by side at the kitchen table...
	
				MARIA  
		Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll 
		see. And you won't recognize the 
		kids any more, they're grown up by 
		now. 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Smiling) 
		They're always writing to me saying 
		they want to come to Rome!
	
	SALVATORE looks around; It's a place he's never seen before, and yet it's 
	his mother's house.)
	 
				MARIA  
		See how pretty the house is? We did 
		everything over.
			(Smiling) 
		If it hadn't been for you! 
			(Getting up) 
		Come, I have a surprise.... 
			(She takes him by the hand 
			and leads him out to the 
			hallway. SALVATORE looks 
			at her and feels a pang. 
			She seems smaller, age 
			withers the body, she is 
			slightly stooped, her hair 
			is gathered into a knot at 
			the back other head.)
		You must be tired. If you want to 
		rest, there's time before the 
		funeral. 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Interrupting her) 
		No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by 
		air, you know. 
	
				MARIA  
			(Smiling, ironically) 
		You shouldn't tell me that now. After 
		all these years! 
			(SALVATORE gets the 
			message, feels guilty. 
			Thinking about it, it 
			seems incredible that he 
			has never come before. 
			MARIA opens a door, steps 
			aside to let her son in, 
			whispers:) 
		I put all your things in here. Go in, 
		go in...
	
	SALVATORE lakes a few steps, is flabbergasted at the sight of his old room 
	perfectly reconstructed and preserved. It looks like a museum, the museum of the 
	past. Despite the bed, the clothes in the cupboard, the books on the shelves, it 
	is perfectly clear that no one has ever lived in it and never will live in it. 
	MARIA senses his perturbation, remains standing in the doorway as if to leave 
	him alone...SALVATORE goes over to the bed, looks around  the old 8mm movie 
	camera, the projector, his documentaries, the bicycle hanging on the wall, the 
	photographs of his favorite movie stars. But what mostly catches his eye is a 
	tiny framed photograph: SALVATORE as a little boy and ALFREDO, standing smiling 
	in front of the Cinema Paradiso. Strange, at that time ALFREDO was younger than 
	he is now! It's as if he were standing there before him one last time. That 
	impressive figure, his good-natured bur firm look, touches his heart. From 
	ALFREDO'S smiling face to...
	
	101  GIANCALDO. MAIN STREET AND SQUARE. EXT. DAY 
	
	...the coffin where his old blind friend rests for ever. The funeral
	procession winds its way down the main street. At the intersections, , 
	cars stop to let the black hearse pass by. People cross themselves. The old men 
	remove their hats. Store shutters are lowered. Then, when the procession has 
	passed by, the cars start up again, the old men put their hats back on, the 
	shutters are pulled up. 
	
	SALVATORE is in the front row with his MOTHER, next to ALFREDO'S WIDOW. 
	SIGNORA ANNA says in a whisper, her eyes fixed on the coffin.  
	
				ANNA  
		He would have been happy you came, 
		Toto. He always talked about you. 
		Always! Right to the end! He was 
		terribly fond of you...
			(Tears come to her, she is 
			unable to say any more. 
			SALVATORE gives her a hug, 
			deeply touched by her 
			words.) 
		He left two things for you. Come see 
		me before you leave. 
	
	SALVATORE nods his head. He gazes intensely at the coffin covered with flowers 
	and is grieved as if he were ashamed never to have come to see the man who had 
	been like a father to him. But why had he forgotten him? Up in front, leading 
	the procession, he sees a young PRIEST with an altar boy beside him, and these 
	figures are also like chisels scraping the rust off his soul and bringing old 
	feelings to light again. 
	
	The procession reaches the square. The dark column stands etched in the dazzling 
	early-afternoon light. SIGNORA ANNA motions the driver and the procession comes 
	to a halt. It is ALFREDO'S last farewell to the place where he had spent the 
	best years of his life  the Cinema Paradiso. Everyone turns to look and 
	SALVATORE also turns, taken by surprise...It has fallen to pieces: doors and 
	windows boarded shut, crumbling walls, a piece of the sign dangling down, weeds 
	and mildew in the cracks and on the roof. The square has changed completely, is 
	unrecognizable. Buildings, stores, sign boards and lines of cars creeping at a 
	snail's pace in a deafening chorus of honking horns. And the central square has 
	turned motorcycles. SALVATORE turns slowly to look behind him, towards the small 
	crowd, and is entranced by the unexpected sight of faces that he recognizes at 
	once, despite the many years that have gone by:  the MAN AT THE BOX OFFICE, the 
	USHER who also served as bill-poster, the CHARWOMAN, the CARABINIERE SERGEANT, 
	and further on behind ROSA and ANGELO, the lovebirds who had met in the movie 
	house and then got married. They all have white hair. And they too have 
	recognized him, give little hello nods and gestures. Another face 
	he seems to recognize: why sure, it's SPACCAFICO, the owner. How old he's 
	become! He also looks up and his eyes meet SALVATORE'S. A hello nod. 
	SALVATORE makes his way over to him through the crowd. They shake hands 
	heartily, without a word, both touched. The procession starts up again. 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Under his breath) 
		How long's it been shut? 
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Six years ago this May. No one came 
		any more. You "know better than me, 
		Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, 
		videos. By now the movie business is 
		only a dream. The city's bought it 
		now to make a new parking lot. Next 
		Saturday they're 
		tearing it down...A pity!...
	
	SALVATORE is disconcerted, irritated by that 'Mr. Di Vita'. Besides, finding 
	out that the movie house is to be torn down depresses him, after all, it's a 
	piece of his life...And all those curious faces staring at him.
	
				SALVATORE  
		But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? 
		It didn't used to be that way...
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Well, it's hard to call an important 
		person by his first name. But if it 
		really matters to you, I'11 call 
		you...
			(Smiling) 
		Toto!...
	
	SALVATORE smiles at that. Meanwhile, the procession has reached the church. 
	SALVATORE excuses himself and goes over to the hearse. Old SPACCAFICO watches 
	him go, then says, almost to himself) 
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Bless you, Toto. 
	
	The coffin is unloaded. SALVATORE has asked to be one of the 
	bearers into the church. As he moves off slowly with that weight 
	on his shoulder, somebody catches his eye on the other side of the sidewalk. An 
	old woman, sixty or seventy years old, with a plastic bag in her hand. She 
	crosses herself quickly. SALVATORE recognizes her  she was the one he made love 
	with for the first time. TERESA, the prostitute. The coffin is carried into the 
	church, followed by the little procession. 
	
	102  SALVATORE' S MOTHER'S HOUSE. EXT/INT. EVENING 
	
	The little house is sunk in the darkness of evening and the ground floor
	windows are lit up. The rustling of the sea can be heard. The family is having 
	supper. The table is set with the finest silver and the company china has been 
	brought out. LIA is also there with her husband, ALFIO, and their two children. 
	FILIPPO, fifteen, and SARA, thirteen. The television is on, but the sound has 
	been turned practically all the way down. SALVATORE'S presence arouses a special 
	excitement. The children look at their uncle with a certain awe, after all they 
	don't really know him. 
	
				SARA  
			(Playfully) 
		Uncle, the next time Granny comes to 
		Rome, I want to come along too. I 
		want to see what you do when you 
		work...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Smiling) 
		Fine. But I warn you, there isn't 
		much to see. I sell much more smoke 
		than fire...
	
	The CHILDREN laugh. At the sight of them, LIA, ALFIO and MARIA also smile.
	
				ALFIO 
			(To SALVATORE) 
		Watch out, don't get too familiar 
		with those two 
			(indicating the children)
		they're worse than cannibals. They'll 
		take advantage. 
	
	Everybody laughs again. Even MARIA laughs a lot. SALVATORE looks at her; he had 
	never seen her laugh like that, amused, at peace.
	
				FILIPPO  
		You leaving tomorrow, Uncle? 
	
	SALVATORE doesn't know what to say. He feels drunk. It has been a day of violent 
	upheavals, a series of almost overwhelming emotions and now he knows nothing  on 
	the one hand, he' d like to stay, let himself drift on the sweet tide of family 
	life, be completely carried off by the rolling waves of his own past: on the 
	other, he wishes he had never come. He forces himself to smile again.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I don't know, Filippo. I don't 
		know...
	
	They go on eating, but SALVATORE isn't very hungry. Re peers at LIA eating out 
	of the comer of his eye, feels deeply bound to her  she has a few white hairs 
	and light wrinkles line her face. 
	
	Then he looks at her husband, ALFIO, he's going bald but he tries to hide it by 
	combing over the little hair left. Who knows what their marriage is like, he 
	wonders. He looks back at LIA, and it's as if she sensed it, she looks up, 
	guesses the nature of his thoughts, imagines what he is trying to figure out, a 
	blush colors her cheeks and she smiles. SALVATORE returns a conniving smile.
	The ringing of a phone. SARA starts to get up to go and answer it, hut MARIA 
	stops her with a glance of the eye.
	
				MARIA  
			(To SALVATORE) 
		It must be for you...They've been 
		calling all afternoon. They wanted to 
		know if you're leaving this evening 
		or tomorrow...
	
	Everyone turns to SALVATORE with questioning looks, making him feel even more 
	restless and undecided. The phone goes on ringing.
	
	103  CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. DAY . 
	
	The TRAFFIC cops are trying to break the front door down with their
	shoulders. Once, twice, and at last, the door flies open with a screech, 
	kicking up a cloud of dust. SALVATORE enters by himself...
	
	104  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY 
	
	SALVATORE'S silhouette stands out against the light in the open door. S lowly he 
	makes his way into the empty theatre. A thick layer of dust lends everything a 
	gray, rarefied look. The light streaming in from the windows up above teems with 
	strange mates of dust, like a haze. 
	
	Cobwebs hang like long veils from the ceiling. SALVATORE walks down the middle 
	aisle. The rows of seats are unhinged, what was once the wooden veneer has 
	warped from the dampness. He looks around as if he Were thumbing through the 
	album of his memories.  
	
	The screen dangles from its frame. The emergency exits are boarded 
	and nailed shut. Observing the emptiness of the theatre, SALVATORE 
	has the feeling he can hear the howling, the whistling and voices of the . 
	audience, as he remembers it. But only for one brief moment, then the silence 
	returns. A mouse creeps along one wall, stops near a pile of dust. SALVATORE is 
	attracted by that little gray mass. He goes over as the mouse scampers off, 
	takes a closer look and recognizes the shape of half a lion's head covered with 
	dust. He moves it with his foot, then looks up at the projection booth, 
	repeating the same gesture of bygone years. But the lion's head is no longer 
	there, only the outline of it on the wall, and cobwebs have covered the hales of 
	the booth, those little square openings that had caused him such long suffering 
	as a little boy...SALVATORE now climbs up the spiral staircase. Each step kicks 
	up a little cloud of dust. 
	
	The little booth, yellow with fumes, appears before him again. Now it 
	looks like some big, empty cave. The projector is no longer there, nor 
	the equipment. Who knows where they junked them?! The only thing left is a clump 
	of film strips still attached to the wall: trailers, Part One 
	endings, etc...There he had kissed ELENA for the first time, and
	strips of film like those had grazed their faces. Now they are caught up
	in the coils of cobwebs. And where the film-winder once stood, the
	nails remain with thousands of yellowing receipts. Of all the films 
	shown at the Cinema Paradiso Palace. And three more boxfuls of 
	them are on the floor. 
	
	And the windows overlooking the square are bolted shut and the glass   
	broken. SALVATORE peers out of one of the cracks in the window and
	sees the village...which is now a city. A different world he no longer 
	knows. 
	
	105  CAFÉ IN SQUARE. INT/EXT. DAY 
	
	The cafe in the square has been completely renovated. The CASHIER and BARMEN 
	have young, unfamiliar faces. SALVATORE holds out the receipt with a tip. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		A double whisky, please. 
	
	Several BOYS are sitting at the comer tables, talking about girls. Others stand 
	playing 'war games', shake around to the obsessive strains of same electronic 
	tune. 
	
	A man comes up to SALVATORE and asks for his autograph. Then SALVATORE turns to 
	the plate-glass window overlooking the main street, where the workers' club once 
	was. And like a flash, a shudder freezes him to the spot.... Two steps away 
	from 
	him, through the glass, a stunning vision, which casts him beyond time, chills 
	his blood: there before him is ELENA! But she is still young, young as she was 
	then! Sweet, luminous, alluring, exactly the way he saw her the first time at 
	the station. 
	
	She is waiting to go across the street with a bunch of books under her 
	arm...Have the passing years had no effect on her? Or is she an hallucination? 
	No! It's a dream! Or is he dead too, like ALFREDO? SALVATORE doesn't know how to 
	explain it. And he is suddenly seized by a feeling of panic. His glass drops to 
	the floor...As the GIRL walks off... 
	
	106  GIANCALDO. STREET. EXT. DAY 
	
	At the age of fifty-five, SALVATORE feels no scruples about wandering
	the streets of his home town, spying from a distance on an eighteen- year-old 
	girl. There's nothing he can do about it. He stares at her with the amazement of 
	someone who discovers that miracles exist. Now he is nearer to her. How lovely 
	she is! It's her, no doubt about it! Exactly the same. Except she has a 
	different hair-do and is wearing different clothes:  ELENA didn't wear slacks. 
	The GIRL goes up to a parked motorcycle. She removes the padlock and fastens her 
	books to the rack. SALVATORE is standing there a few steps away, and without 
	stopping to think, moves a little closer, discreetly, politely.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Excuse me, Miss...
			(She turns to look at him, 
			indifferent, but friendly. 
			He looks at her wonderful 
			blue eyes.) 
		I'm so sorry, I thought you were 
		someone else. 
			
				GIRL  
			(Shrugging) 
		Well. 
	
	She has already started the motor of her bike. A flip of the accelerator and 
	off she goes, her hair flying in the wind. 
	
	SALVATORE follows her with his eyes until she disappears around the corner.
	
	107  SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. INT. AFTERNOON 
	
	The old shots of ELENA getting off the train and walking away, casting a curious 
	look at the camera...SALVATORE is watching her again, projected on the white 
	wall of his room. He also watches the other shots of those happy long-gone days  
	the picnic,. she at the beach, smiling, joyful...And again SALVATORE doesn't 
	understand, or doesn't want to understand. But these scenes could have been shot 
	yesterday, so identical to ELENA is the girl he saw on the street...And the 
	wound which he thought had healed years ago, starts bleeding again. 
	
	The lingering note of suffering for a romance that had ended without his ever 
	knowing why, and the endless explanations that had been sifted through by his 
	young mind, start slipping through his soul again, like those shots 
	slipping again through an old 8mm projector. 
	
	Through the crack of the door, MARIA sees those images on the wall, SALVATORE 
	rocking his head back and forth slowly, like he used to do as a boy when he 
	cried. She somehow feels his grief, his bitterness, lowers her eyes and walks 
	away without a word, as the little shiny rectangle on the wall remains blank, 
	empty...And SALVATORE sits there gazing at it, as if he saw other scenes which 
	his camera never set down on film, only his memory. 
	 
	108  HIGH SCHOOL. STREETS AND LITTLE SQUARE. EXT. DAY 
	
	The HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS are coming out after school. Happy young faces. That 
	GIRL 's motorcycle can be seen in a rear-view mirror. SALVATORE is at the wheel 
	of the car ALFIO has lent him. He has obviously followed that motorcycle before. 
	He waits with an eagerness he thought he had long lost, a determination to 
	understand, to get to the bottom of the matter, which frightens him and at the 
	same time overwhelms him hopelessly. 
	
	And here she comes. She unlocks the padlock and prepares to speed off. SALVATORE 
	starts the motor and follows her a short distance away. The GIRL heads for the 
	new residential district on the outskirts. 
	
	109  SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. INT. DAY 
	
	MARIA is setting the table. LIA and her family are eating at her 
	house today. SALVATORE is sitting again, with a lighted cigarette, 
	gazing through the window at the shrubs tossing in the wind and the 
	rolling sea. The air whistling through the cracks of the windows lends a 
	heaviness to the silence, like the troubled look on his face. MARIA glances at 
	him. 
	
				MARIA  
		What are you thinking, Toto? 
	
	SALVATORE looks at the old woman's lovely face, a faint smile. on his lips. 
	There was always something like an unspoken rule between them, the rule of 
	silence, of unconfessed complicity. And now he feels that rule has to be broken. 
	He speaks quietly, as if to curb the tumult of his feelings of guilt.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I was thinking...that we've never 
		talked, Mamma...When I was little I 
		saw you as if you were already old. 
		That's probably true with all kids...
		Who knows? 
			(She nods, then sits down 
			before him. He strokes her 
			old, skinny, heavily 
			veined hands...) 
		But only now do I realize you were 
		young, you were beautiful, had a 
		whole life before you. But how...
			(Sighing) 
		...how could you have lived alone 
		all that time, with no one to look 
		after you? You could have 
		remarried...Why not? At the time I 
		probably wouldn't have understood, 
		but I would have later...
	
	MARIA doesn't answer, but she is not troubled. An inner peace lends her a sweet, 
	quiet expression. Then she too agrees to break the rule of silence. 
	
				MARIA  
		I never had anybody. If that's what 
		you think...I didn't want anybody. I 
		always remained faithful. First to 
		your father, then to you, to Lia. 
			(With a shrug) 
		That's the way I'm made, there's 
		nothing I can do about it. 
			(Smiling) 
		And you're like me, you're too honest 
		and too attached to the things you
		love...But I don't know if that's a 
		good thing. Faithfulness is a bad 
		business. If you're faithful, you're 
		always alone! 
			(SALVATORE is immersed in 
			the profound truth of 
			those words. And he says 
			nothing. The silence is 
			broken by the ringing of 
			the phone. A menacing 
			sound, which SALVATORE 
			cannot bear. He knows they 
			are calling him from Rome, 
			gives a nervous gesture, 
			stands up and pulls out 
			the plug. The silence 
			returns, the whistling of 
			the wind. MARIA lowers her 
			eyes.) 
		It's my fault! It would have been 
		better if I hadn't called you... 
	
	SALVATORE sits down again, leaning closer to her. He stubs out his cigarette in 
	the already overflowing ashtray.
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Whispering) 
		No...It's nothing to do with you. 
		It's just that I was scared of coming 
		back. Now, after all these years, I 
		thought I was strong, that I had 
		forgotten lots of things. Instead, I 
		find it's quite the opposite, as if I 
		had never left. And yet, I look at 
		Lia and feel as if I didn't know her, 
		and you, Mamma...I abandoned you, 
		ran away like a thief, thought only 
		of myself, and never gave you 
		an explanation...
	
				MARIA  
			(Interrupting him) 
		And I never asked for one! You have 
		nothing to explain. I always thought 
		that what you did was right, and that 
		was that. With no beating around the 
		bush...
			(Smiling, playing it down) 
		Only one thing made me suffer: 
		bolting the door shut before going to 
		bed at night...
	
				SALVATORE  
		You never used to do that! 
	
	She smiles like a little girl who is about to confess the fibs she has told.
	
				MARIA  
		No, no...When you used to work at 
		the movies, I could never get to 
		sleep at night until you came home. 
		Then when you arrived, I pretended to 
		be asleep, but I heard all your 
		movements. Then when you fell asleep, 
		I'd get up and bolt the door. Then, 
		when you left, every time I did it, I 
		felt as if I had left somebody 
		outside the door, far away.... 
			(SALVATORE listens to his 
			MOTHER'S words, surprised 
			and entranced by the 
			poetry of her way of 
			speaking...) 
		But you were right to leave. You 
		succeeded in doing what you wanted to 
		do...
			(Sighing) 
		When I call you, a different, woman 
		always answers. I pretend I know them 
		so they won't have to go through the 
		embarrassment of introducing 
		themselves. 
			(Smiling) 
		I'm sure they take me for a crazy old 
		woman. But so far I've never heard 
		one voice that really loves you...I 
		would have known. And yet, I'd like 
		to see you...settled down...fall in 
		love...
			(Gazing into his eyes) 
		But your life's there. Here there are 
		nothing but ghosts, Toto! Let it go. 
	
	She has said this with a subtle allusiveness in her voice. And SALVATORE 
	realizes she has always known everything. But he doesn't' answer her. 
	They look at each other a Long time without speaking. Their rule of conniving 
	silence has come back into play, as before, forever. It is her expression that 
	tells him to leave, to take the plane and fly away...
	
	110  SMALL SQUARE AND HOUSE. INT/EXT. EVENING 
	
	But SALVATORE has not taken his MOTHER'S advice. Re has not left. Something 
	holds him there still, leads him to go on looking. 
	
	The GIRL'S motorcycle is parked in the courtyard beyond the gate of a small 
	house. He is studying it from inside the car parked in a corner of the small 
	square, near a café. Re has been there some while, but is not nervous, waits 
	there with determination...
	
	Several windows in the house are lit, but no one can be seen through 
	the curtains. Nothing but shadows pass by every now and then. Now the light in 
	one of the windows goes out, and the light on the stair goes on. The front door 
	opens and the GIRL comes out with a tall, sturdy- looking, elegantly dressed 
	GENTLEMAN around fifty. 
	
	They converse bur are too far away for their voices to be heard. SALVATORE 
	watches them come out the gate and climb into a car. They look like father and 
	daughter. The car now drives off and passes right by him. A gleam of light, 
	the reflection from the headlights, falls on the GENTLEMAN'S face. He recognizes 
	him at once, from the birthmark on his temple...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(To himself) 
		Boccia! 
	
	His eyes flash, he's afraid he's understood. And now the craze to get to the 
	bottom of it all gnaws away at him. There is no turning back. 
	
	111 CAFÉ. AND SMALL SQUARE. INT/EXT. EVENING 
	
	SALVATORE'S hands rifle through a phone directory. He is in the cafe, on the 
	other side of the glass door leading to the little square. His finger 
	runs down the column of names...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Mumbling) 
		His last name was Lo Meo, Vincenzo. 
	
	He has already put the token into the slot and dials the number, looking at the 
	two lit upstairs windows of that house, where the mystery of his life may be 
	hiding. SALVATORE hears the first ring, his heart in his throat...A shadow 
	appears in one of the windows. And a voice answers. 
	
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		Hello? 
			(It's a woman's voice. 
			SALVATORE shuts his eyes, 
			is about to speak, but the 
			lump in his throat 
			silences him...) 
	
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		Hello? Hello? 
	
	He still hesitates, can' t get a word out, as if he had lost his voice or 
	didn't know what to say. He hangs up. The shadow at the window also hangs up, 
	then disappears... 
	
	SALVATORE is at a loss, sits down at one of the rabies near the 
	phone in the almost empty cafe. At the far end, a group of five people watching 
	television.
	
				BARMAN  
		You want something? 
	
	And he turns back to the television. SALVATORE lights a cigarette. He is 
	uncertain. Once again he has to lake an important decision  redial the number 
	and seek a face behind that shadow? Or forget the whole thing, the GIRL, BOCCIA, 
	the shadow, and go away? Yes, best go away. He gets up and leaves. He can be 
	seen through the window turning the comer. A pack of cigarettes and a lighter 
	lie on the table, he has forgotten them. And the lighted cigarette bums down in 
	the ashtray. A few moments have gone by. Footsteps, and a hand picks up the 
	lighter and the cigarettes. It is SALVATORE who now, on a sudden urge, slips 
	another token into the slot. The shadow reappears at the window. The same voice 
	as before.
	 
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		Hello, who's speaking? 
	
	SALVATORE answers at last, keeping his eyes shut, whispering:
	 
				SALVATORE  
		I'd like to speak to Signora Elena...
	
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		Speaking. Who is it, please? 
	
	SALVATORE feels a terrible pang, continues:
	
				SALVATORE  
		Salvatore. 
	
	Silence, charged with tension. Then the voice continues weakly, as if puzzled.
	
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		Salvatore...who? 
	
	He runs his hand over his forehead, his eyes, as if to soothe the turmoil he 
	feels inside.
	
				SALVATORE 
		Di Vita. Salvatore Di Vita. Do you 
		remember? 
			(Another pause chilly, 
			heavy. SALVATORE opens his 
			eyes, looks at the window. 
			Her shadow is motionless, 
			as if cut out of 
			cardboard.) 
		Elena, I'm here, in the bar, across 
		the street from your house. 
	
	The shadow moves slowly, a hand pulls aside the curtain. It's a moment of heart-
	rending emotion...She appears. And they see each other from a distance, after 
	thirty years, each of them with a phone receiver to their ear. But she is 
	somewhat in the dark, against the light, it's impossible to make out her 
	features. Her voice gives a sudden start, instantly controlled.
	 
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		Certainly, I remember...
	
	SALVATORE'S eyes glisten, try to pierce the distance and the darkness to get a 
	better look, but in vain. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Elena. I'd like to see you...Let's 
		meet. 
	
	ELENA lets the curtain drop and goes back to being a shadow. She whispers the 
	words.
	
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		It's been so long. Why should we 
		meet? What good would it do? 
	
				SALVATORE 
		Please, don't say no.. . 
	
	But her voice is firm, unshakeable, even if quivering with emotion.
	
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		I'm old, Salvatore. And you too. It's 
		best not to meet. Goodbye. 
	
	The shadow hangs up, disappears. The light goes off.
	
	112  DIFFERENT SETTINGS. INT/EXT. EVENING 
	
	The wind is stronger now, the streets and the square are empty. SALVATORE 
	is at the wheel of the car, driving aimlessly around the town. He has 
	rediscovered the woman who conditioned his whole life and they hadn't had the 
	courage to meet. An obsessive musical heat, fraught with rage, pours out of the 
	car radio. 
	
	113  SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. INT. EVENING 
	
	A phone ringing drowns out the sound of the television and the wind  
	whistling outside. In the half-darkened room, MARIA picks up the receiver...  
	
				MARIA  
		Hello?
	
	No one answers, but she can sense the presence of someone who now hangs up. 
	MARIA is alarmed. Who could it be at this hour? And where is Toto?
	
	114  SEAFRONT AND PIER. EXT/INT. CAR. EVENING 
	
	SALVATORE stands motionless on the pier, facing the storm-tossed sea. He feels 
	relieved by the roar of the waves that dispels his bitter thoughts, blurs them, 
	but does not wipe out the look of suffering in his eyes. A flashing light seems 
	to approach behind his back. SALVATORE turns and is blinded by the headlights of 
	a car parked at the beginning of the pier. The splattering waves lend the scene 
	a hazy cast and diffuse the glare of the flashing headlights. Now the lights 
	move towards him. And SALVATORE also lakes a few timid steps forward... 
	They are close. The car has almost stopped. But it is impossible to make out the 
	person at the wheel who now reaches over to open the other door. A voice can be 
	barely heard over the raging sea. It is ELENA's voice. 
	
				ELENA  
		Salvatore! 
	
	SALVATORE approaches, accepting the invitation, enters the car and shuts the 
	door. The headlights go off and the car remains there suspended between the open 
	sea and the harbor with its rocking boats. Inside the car, not a word. Two dark 
	figures gaze at each other, unintelligible, as if the night were trying to 
	further delay that meeting. The glowing reflection of a wave higher than the 
	others now lights up their faces. ELENA was right, they are no longer the faces 
	of teenagers, but of people on in years who study each other, searching for a 
	truth. The howling of the wind and the crashing of the waves are louder, but 
	ELENA and SALVATORE /rear nothing, sit glued to their seats, fixed in the 
	endless gaze that envelops them. He is the first to break the silence in a faint  
	voice.
	
				SALVATORE  
		How'd you know I'd be here? 
	
	ELENA  I don't know how many years have gone by, but some things about you I do 
	remember. There weren't many, places you could have gone. I looked around...
	
	SALVATORE turns on the light of the rear-view mirror. Finally 
	they can see better. They look at each other a little ill at ease, 
	making the inevitable comparisons with the memory of their young faces. 
	SALVATORE carefully observes her graying hair, her blue eyes lined 
	with wrinkles, the somewhat faded beauty mark on her lip.
	
				SALVATORE  
		You're still beautiful...
	
				ELENA  
		Don't be silly...I'm old.
			(She looks down troubled 
			by the way he has of 
			gazing into her eyes, 
			speaks almost mumbling her 
			words.) 
		Don't look at me like that, please. 
			(And she switches off the 
			light. But this time it is 
			less dark, things can be 
			seen.) 
		Why'd you come back? 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo died. Do you remember him? 
	
				ELENA  
		Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. 
		You were terribly fond of him. 
	
	A moment of silence. It's hard to find something to say.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! 
		Who knows how many Salvatores 
		must be running after her...
	
				ELENA  
			(Smiling) 
		One or two. Bur there're not all that 
		many Salvatores. 
			(SALVATORE also smiles, 
			but a puzzled smile as if 
			what she has said had 
			thrown him off-guard.) 
		I've got a son, too...he's older. 
		And you, do you have children? 
	
				SALVATORE  
		No. And I'm not married. 
			(ELENA sits there in 
			silence. A veil of sadness 
			clouds her eyes. 
			SALVATORE'S 
			too...) 
		Are you happy? 
	
				ELENA  
		All things considered, yes. Even if 
		it wasn't what I dreamt of then...
	
	Again SALVATORE is thrown off-guard, as if the round key of 
	his enquiry had met with only square locks. She continues.
	 
				ELENA  
		My husband...you know him. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Sure, sure! Boccia...
			(With a bitter smile) 
		What's he do? 
	
				ELENA  
		Politics. He's the district 
		representative. We met at the 
		University in Pisa. 
	
	Then instinctively, in a shy voice, SALVATORE asks the question 
	that he probably wouldn't have asked a moment later.
	
				SALVATORE  
		And...how come you never married 
		that guy from Tuscany? 
	
	The white foam of the waves splashes up over the wall of the pier, dashing 
	against the car windows. The shadow of the trickling water is superimposed on 
	the agony of their faces. ELENA hides her embarrassment beneath a faint but 
	haughty smile.
	
				ELENA  
		I didn't want to...I had to fight 
		tooth and nail. But in the end I 
		won...
			(SALVATORE is unable to 
			smile. It's as if the void 
			were growing and swelling 
			within. Thunder and 
			lightning shatter the 
			roaring of the wind and 
			sea, hut it does not rain. 
			Now her smile Jades away.)
		At that time...I was waiting for 
		you...
	
	There is no resentment in her words. She has said them fondly. With the serenity 
	of someone who has suffered greatly and then found a strong convincing way of 
	suffering no more. For SALVATORE, it's as if one of those thunderbolts had 
	pierced his heart. He leans over, gazing into her shining eyes. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		But I've never forgotten you, Elena! 
	
				ELENA  
			(Whispering) 
		Nor have I. Even though you 
		disappeared...
			(SALVATORE is staggered, 
			feels as if he were 
			plunging into the void. 
			What she has said strikes 
			him as grotesque. ELENA 
			strokes his hair, as if to 
			restrain his sinking 
			heart, gives a sweet 
			smile.) 
		But what's the point of talking about 
		it? We risk being pathetic and 
		ridiculous. 
			(And she tries to change 
			the subject.) 
		You still live in Rome? 
	
	But SALVATORE ignores the question. He doesn't want to change the subject. 
	He feels that everything is crumbling inside him, the alibis and excuses he had 
	had to give himself in order to accept the end of their romance. And instead, 
	now the tables seem to have completely turned. Without realizing, he shouts 
	desperately, staring wildly at her and shaking her by the 
	shoulders.
	
				SALVATORE  
		What do you mean, you were waiting 
		for me?! What are you saying? 
			(He controls himself at 
			once, continues, breathing 
			heavily.) 
		The last time we saw each other, we 
		made a date to meet at the Cinema 
		Paradiso. You remember? And you 
		didn't come, you disappeared without 
		leaving a trace, nothing! I'll tell 
		you how many years have gone by: more 
		than thirty!!! 
	
	Quiet rears stream down Elena's face, glisten with the reflections of the 
	lightning and the waves.
	
				ELENA  
		I kept that date. 
			(SALVATORE laughs at the 
			absurdity of it. A 
			nervous, heartbroken 
			laugh, which slowly melts 
			away as she goes on to 
			say:) 
		But I was late...
			(Tears continue to stream 
			out of her blue eyes, but 
			she tells her story in a 
			calm voice.) 
		I had a fight with my family. I tried 
		to convince them again that they 
		couldn't separate us. But it was 
		futile. They had decided to leave 
		Sicily once and for all. Which is 
		what we did. I didn't know what to do 
		any more, what to say. And I said 
		yes, I'd do whatever they wanted. In 
		return, my father promised to let me 
		see you one last time, to say 
		goodbye. But I hoped that by seeing 
		each other we could take advantage of 
		it and make a decision...I thought 
		we would run away together. 
			(She holds back her sobs. 
			Dries her tears with the 
			back of her hand, and 
			continues:) 
		My father drove me to the movie 
		theatre. But you weren't in the 
		projection booth. Only Alfredo...
	
	Her voice continues over the scene of same thirty years before...
	
	115  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. AFTERNOON Flashback. 
	
				ELENA'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		And I didn't have time to wait for 
		you to comeback... 
	
	From the bottom of the spiral staircase, ELENA'S FATHER is waiting nervously, 
	yells up at the projection booth.
	
				ELENA' S FATHER  
		Elena! Hurry up!! 
	
				YOUNG ELENA  
		All right, Daddy!...
	
	In the projection booth, ALFREDO is sitting on a stool, near the
	projector. Seen from the rear, the YOUNG ELENA is leaning over 
	beside him, she is excited, her eyes are red and swollen with tears.
	
				ELENA'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		So I told Alfredo how things stood 
		and fiat I was leaving the same 
		evening, and I asked him to tell you 
		everything. He was very kind, he 
		listened carefully, then... 
	
	ALFREDO answers YOUNG ELENA, stroking her hair.
	
				ALFREDO  
		Easy, easy. 
			(Sighing) 
		Listen carefully to what I have to 
		say. If you want me to tell Toto what 
		you've told me, I will. But if you 
		want my advice, forget it. It's 
		better for both of you if you don't 
		see each other...
			(YOUNG ELENA gives a start 
			of resentment, listens 
			with surprise.) 
		Dear girl, fire always turns into 
		ashes! Even the deepest love ends 
		sooner or later. And after that other 
		loves appear, lots of them. Toto, he 
		can't understand fiat now. If I tell 
		him he won't believe it, he' d be 
		capable of killing me...But you can 
		understand, you've got to 
		understand...Do it for him! 
	
	116  WATERFRONT. INT. CAR. EVENING 
	
	SALVATORE sits there without moving, pale as a sheet, looks as if he had
	grown even older. As if the whole world has fallen in on him. For ELENA, it was 
	a painful but liberating story. She dries her last tears. 
	
				ELENA  
		It's the first time I've had to 
		chance to tell the story. I never 
		mentioned it to anybody. 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(In a daze) 
		Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell 
		on you too! 
	
				ELENA  
		I told him I'd take his advice. But 
		before I went away I left you that 
		note...
			(SALVATORE gives her a 
			quick look, a questioning 
			look. He listens.) 
		I was on my way down the stairs...
			(Her voice continues, laid 
			over the...) 
	
	117  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. AFTERNOON Flashback
	
	ELENA has already said goodbye to ALFREDO, is on her way down the stairs, but 
	stops short. 
	
				ELENA' S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		I thought Alfredo couldn't see me. So 
		I snuck back up...
			(She tip-toes back without 
			making any noise. Goes 
			over to the film-winder. 
			Takes out a pen, looks for 
			a scrap of paper, but 
			doesn't see any. Her eyes 
			fall on the film receipts 
			hanging on the nail. She 
			tears off the top one, 
			turns it over and 
			scribbles a message on the 
			back.) 
		I wrote you where you could find me, 
		and that I'd wait for you. 
	
	She hangs the scrap of paper back on the nail, well in sight. She creeps out, 
	glancing at ALFREDO, who hasn't noticed a thing.
	
	118  WATERFRONT. EXT/INT. CAR. EVENING 
	
	ELENA finishes telling her story. She heaves a Jeep sigh. 
	
				ELENA  
		But you disappeared all the same. 
	
	There is a haunted look in SALVATORE's eyes, he is searching his memory for 
	something he can't find, then suddenly sees, as if in a dream...his hand thirty 
	years before going through the routine gesture of hanging a receipt on the nail, 
	over the others, mechanically, without even looking...and he shuts his eyes as 
	if fearing the truth. Her last words have wounded him. He shakes his head, then 
	in a faint voice:
	
				SALVATORE  
		Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! 
		You'll never know. I wrote, 
		telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever 
		answered. But I dreamt of you for 
		years! That's why I went away...and 
		never came back here. 
			(And his anguish breaks 
			free, dissolving into 
			quiet, almost childish 
			tears. ELENA is startled 
			by his reaction. She 
			caresses him, 	
			passionately. They embrace 
			and remain like that, she 
			with her face buried in 
			his shoulder, he leaning 
			on hers with his tear-
			filled eyes.)
		Even as the years passed, in all the 
		women I met, I was only looking for 
		you. I had success it's true, but 
		there was always something missing...
			(She is deeply moved, goes 
			on caressing him gently 
			until he calms down. The 
			car windows are steamed 
			up. The sea, the harbor, 
			the waves have 	
			disappeared. Nothing 
			remains but the sound of  
			the storm. SALVATORE takes 
			her face between his 
			hands. They gaze at each 
			other, their faces 
			practically touching. He 
			murmurs:) 
		I'd never have imagined that all this 
		had to end because of the man who was 
		like a father to me. A crazy lunatic!  
			(She gives a faint smile.) 
	
				ELENA  
		He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I 
		was upset. I think I really hated 
		him. But then, with time, I 
		understood what he said...and your 
		silence too. 
	
	SALVATORE whispers one last dreadful revelation. And it's as if he had got a 
	terrible weight off his chest.
	
				SALVATORE  
		But I never saw that note! 
			(He squints, as if to 
			stress the absurdity of 
			the idea.) 
		I must have covered it with my hand, 
		without realizing it, that's the only 
		explanation...
			(But strangely enough, 
			ELENA is not surprised.) 
	
				ELENA  
		What difference does it make to find 
		an explanation? That's the way it 
		went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, 
		he was the only one who really 
		understood you. Salvatore, if you had 
		chosen to be with me, you'd have 
		never made your films. And that would 
		have been a pity! Because they're 
		wonderful, I've seen them all. 
			(Her eyes glitter with 
			joy, then she smiles, 
			almost ironically.) 
		But you shouldn't have gone and 
		changed your name. You should have 
		kept your own. 
	
	Tears stream down Salvatore's cheeks. He gives her a look of longing, of 
	desire. 
	
	ELENA embraces him. They kiss with heartrending tenderness, with the same 
	passion of their first kiss amidst the strips of film brushing their faces, so 
	many years ago. And they make love, clasped in the cramped quarters of the car, 
	like two teenagers. Passionate kisses, embraces, deep sighs. Their hair 
	damp with sweat, their hands clasping, their fingers interweaving. Then the 
	frenzy subsides into a deep, tumultuous pleasure, of immense loving and immense 
	grief...As outside the wind and the waves go on rating around that car which 
	seems suspended in empty space.) 
	
	 
	119  ALFREDO'S WIDOW'S HOUSE. INT. DAY 
	
	SIGNORA ANNA'S hands place an old wooden stool and a rusty round 
	metal can on the table.
	
				ANNA  
		These are the things he left to 
		you...
	
	SALVATORE is sitting by the table. He has finished the cup of coffee SIGNORA 
	ANNA has prepared for him. He picks up the stool, recognizes it at once: it's 
	the one ALFREDO had made for him as a little boy so he could climb up and put 
	the reels on the projector. 
	
				ANNA  
		When they showed your films on 
		television, he was happy. He'd plop 
		himself down there and all his 
		ailments were forgotten. He knew all 
		the words by heart, every one, and 
		I'd describe what was going on. And 
		when the papers talked about 
		you, I had to read them two or three 
		times...
	
	SALVATORE examines the can, wonders what it can be. He opens it: inside is a 
	reel of film, wrapped in a plastic bag, well preserved. Those objects bring a 
	pang to his heart, and the things that ANNA said, but he feels disappointed, as 
	if he expected to find something else.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Did he ever think of meeting me? 
	
				ANNA  
		No, never! One time your mother said 
		that if he wanted, you'd have surely 
		come. He got furious and said  'No, 
		Toto mustn't come back to Giancaldo, 
		never!!' He didn't say it to be mean. 
		He was a decent man. Who knows what 
		he could have been thinking? Towards 
		the end he'd say such strange things. 
		And a moment before he shut his eyes, 
		he told your mother not to let you 
		know. 
	
	120  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY 
	
	A cloud of yellowed scraps of paper flutters into the air and as it falls slowly 
	to the ground another handful is flung up. SALVATORE is in the projection booth, 
	looking through the countless yellowed receipts, stuffed away in boxes. He looks 
	at them one by one, then throws them into the air. A desperate search, almost a 
	defiance of the passing of time. He continues with greater determination, flings 
	piles of receipts into the air, glances at a few dates, a film title, tries to 
	discover the oldest dates at the bottom. He moves swiftly, his hands plunge in, 
	then fling up a nimbus of paper and dust. But to no avail...He stops, short of 
	breath. His eyes go over to the nails in the wall, where other stacks of 
	receipts are hanging. He gets up and goes to look at them, thumbs " it through 
	them hastily, in anger... 
	
	He yanks off two or three packs, which come off, nail and all. Only then does he 
	notice that at the bottom of those blocks of yellowed paper, there are same more 
	sheets, much older, almost brown. His eyes concentrate on the mildewed scraps of 
	paper. He leans over, picks themup and goes through them one by one, delicately, 
	because they crumble in his fingers...And then all of a sudden, some film 
	titles 
	he recognizes from that time. He goes on thumbing through them, and all at once 
	an astonished look appears on his face  in his hands is a receipt that has been 
	turned over. It's the one! The message scribbled on it can still be seen. He 
	reads it. 
	
				SALVATORE'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		Salvatore, forgive me. I'll explain 
		later what happened. Not finding you 
		here was terrible. Unfortunately, 
		this evening, my mother and I are 
		leaving for Tuscany. We're moving 
		there. But you' re the only one I 
		love, I'll never be with anybody 
		else, I promise. Here's the address 
		of a girlfriend of mine where you 
		can write to me. Don't abandon me. 
		Love and kisses, Elena. 
	
	He clasps the scrap of paper, and his brimming eyes darken with regret.
	
	121  CAFÉ~ IN SQUARE AND ELENA'S HOUSE. INT/EXT. DAY 
	
	ELENA stands near the window overlooking the little square, listening on the 
	phone to SALVATORE'S voice. She can see him through the transparent curtain 
	speaking on the phone down below in the café. 
	
				ELENA  
		When are you leaving? 
	
	SALVATORE opens his eyes, tosses away his cigarette.
	
				SALVATORE  
		This afternoon. Elena, in the future 
		maybe we could...
	
	ELENA interrupts him, speaks softly, tenderly.
	
				ELENA  
		No, Salvatore...there is no future. 
		There's only the past. Even meeting 
		last night was nothing but a dream, a 
		beautiful dream. 
			(Smiling) 
		We never did it when we were kids, 
		remember? 
			(Down in the cafe, 
			SALVATORE nods his head 
			slowly, desperately.) 
		Now that it's happened, I don't think 
		there could have been a better 
		ending.
			(It's farewell. SALVATORE 
			glances one last time at 
			that window.) 
	
				SALVATORE  
		I'll never agree with you. Never, 
		Elena. 
	
	122  CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. DAY 
	
	The square, unusually empty. There is no one, and no cars and motorcycles are 
	parked in the middle. The stores are shut. And there is an unreal silence. The 
	houses on the two streets on either side of the theatre are covered by enormous 
	pieces of gray canvas. 
	
	Only now does the camera discover in the distance, a crowd of curious onlookers 
	waiting in front of the movie house, kept at a safe distance by firemen and 
	policemen. Old SPACCAFICO is in the crowd. SALVATORE is also there. Be gazes at 
	the front of the old movie theatre...
	
	123  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. DAY 
	
	The inside of the theatre, completely empty...All of a sudden, a blinding flash 
	and...
	
	124  SQUARE AND CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. DAY 
	
	...a deafening roar rends the air, accompanied by a surge of amazement in the 
	crowd. And the Cinema Paradiso suddenly collapses, folds inward and disappears 
	for ever in a gigantic cloud of white smoke that rises into the air, carried by 
	the wind towards the crowd...
	
	125  ELENA' S HOUSE. INT. DAY 
	
	The echo of the explosion is also heard in ELENA'S house. She is alone. 
	And the bang distresses her, as if something had burst inside her. From her face 
	to...
	
	126  SQUARE AND CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. DAY 
	
	SALVATORE's face, stiff, unmoving, his eyes fixed on those falling ruins, on 
	that season of his life turning into smoke and dust. Enveloped in the white 
	cloud, SPACCAFICO stands crying in silence. 
	
	Mice dart out of the ruins in terror, scamper nervously into the square. A group 
	of youngsters scream, amused and excited. Among them, ELENA'S DAUGHTER, 
	smiling... SALVATORE sees her joking with friends and pointing to some boys  
	chasing the mice across the square, hooting and laughing. As a white-haired OLD 
	TRAMP, filthy and covered in rags, makes his way through the crowd. There is an 
	empty look in his eyes and he repeats obsessively in a low voice:
	
				VILLAGE IDIOT  
		The square's mine, the square's mine, 
		the square's mine... 
	
	SALVATORE recognizes him, it's the VILLAGE IDIOT, the one who used to close down 
	the square at night. Be watches him walk off, raving, with nobody even noticing. 
	The crowd now moves over to the huge empty space where the movie house once 
	stood. The murmuring voices are drowned out by the deafening roar of an 
	airplane. From the ruins of the Cinema Paradiso, fade to...
	
	127  ROME. STUDIO VIEWING-ROOM. INT. DAY 
	
	...SALVATORE'S hands giving a STUDIO PROJECTIONIST the rusty metal can left him 
	by ALFREDO. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Please check the splices. As soon as 
		you're ready you can start. 
	
				PROJECTIONIST  
		OK. Congratulations on your film. 
		It's terrific. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Thanks. 
	
	A COLLEAGUE of SALVATORE comes up behind him.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Well? 
	
				COLLEAGUE  
		The distributor is opening up the 
		film earlier. The press conference is 
		in the afternoon. The actors will 
		also be there, the producer, just 
		about everyone. 
	
	An ASSISTANT comes up to them.
	
				ASSISTANT  
		The official notification of the 
		award just came out, but we've 
		already received a mountain of 
		telegrams. Aren't you happy? 
	
				SALVATORE  
		It's all right. We'll talk about it 
		later. 
	
	SALVATORE walks off towards the viewing theatre. 
	
	SALVATORE is by himself in the small viewing theatre. Now the lights go down. 
	The beam of light shines out of the little square hole of the projection booth 
	and the screen lights up. A number trailer goes by and then SALVATORE sees the 
	first shots. 
	
	A start of intense amazement and joy suddenly runs through him, astounds him, 
	delights him. It's the best piece of film he has ever seen...  
	
	It consists of all the kisses ALFREDO cut out of the films and kept for him, 
	when he was a little boy. They have been spliced together, one , after the 
	other, at random, same of them even upside down. And yet it looks like a first-
	rate editing job. 
	
	In rapid sequence the passionate kisses between actors and actresses, names 
	famous and names unknown in the history of movies. Greta Garbo, Gary Cooper, 
	Alida Valii, Rudolph Valentino, Ingrid Bergman, Clark Gable, Anna Magnani, 
	Humphrey Bogart, Marlene Dietrich, Amedeo Nazzari, Luisa Ferida, Vittorio De 
	Sica, Rita Hayworth, Tyrone Power, Doris Durante, Massimo Gironi, Marta Abba, 
	Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Assia Noris...
	
	A whole movie season summed up in a few fragments, a few seconds. A bizarre, 
	poignant, melancholy parade. 
	
	SALVATORE is overwhelmed, moved to tears. It is the most profound act of love he 
	has ever seen. He laughs as tears shine in his eyes. Up on the screen, another 
	kiss, the last kiss marking the happy ending of a film. And the age-old words 
	appear 'THE END'.

          FADE IN:

          EXT. XANADU - FAINT DAWN - 1940 (MINIATURE)

          Window, very small in the distance, illuminated.

          All around this is an almost totally black screen.  Now, as 
          the camera moves slowly towards the window which is almost a 
          postage stamp in the frame, other forms appear; barbed wire, 
          cyclone fencing, and now, looming up against an early morning 
          sky, enormous iron grille work.  Camera travels up what is now 
          shown to be a gateway of gigantic proportions and holds on the 
          top of it - a huge initial "K" showing darker and darker against 
          the dawn sky.  Through this and beyond we see the fairy-tale 
          mountaintop of Xanadu, the great castle a sillhouette as its 
          summit, the little window a distant accent in the darkness.

                                     

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          A SERIES OF SET -UPS, EACH CLOSER TO THE GREAT WINDOW, ALL 
          TELLING SOMETHING OF: 

          The literally incredible domain of CHARLES FOSTER KANE.

          Its right flank resting for nearly forty miles on the Gulf 
          Coast, it truly extends in all directions farther than the eye 
          can see.  Designed by nature to be almost completely bare and 
          flat - it was, as will develop, practically all marshland when 
          Kane acquired and changed its face - it is now pleasantly 
          uneven, with its fair share of rolling hills and one very good-
          sized mountain, all man-made.  Almost all the land is improved, 
          either through cultivation for farming purposes of through 
          careful landscaping, in the shape of parks and lakes.  The 
          castle dominates itself, an enormous pile, compounded of several 
          genuine castles, of European origin, of varying architecture - 
          dominates the scene, from the very peak of the mountain.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          GOLF LINKS (MINIATURE)

          Past which we move.  The greens are straggly and overgrown, 
          the fairways wild with tropical weeds, the links unused and 
          not seriously tended for a long time.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

                                                               DISSOLVE IN:

          WHAT WAS ONCE A GOOD-SIZED ZOO (MINIATURE)

          Of the Hagenbeck type.  All that now remains, with one 
          exception, are the individual plots, surrounded by moats, on 
          which the animals are kept, free and yet safe from each other 
          and the landscape at large.  (Signs on several of the plots 
          indicate that here there were once tigers, lions, girrafes.)

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          THE MONKEY TERRACE (MINIATURE)

          In the foreground, a great obscene ape is outlined against the 
          dawn murk.  He is scratching himself slowly, thoughtfully, 
          looking out across the estates of Charles Foster Kane, to the 
          distant light glowing in the castle on the hill.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          THE ALLIGATOR PIT (MINIATURE)

          The idiot pile of sleepy dragons.  Reflected in the muddy water - 
          the lighted window.

          THE LAGOON (MINIATURE)

          The boat landing sags.  An old newspaper floats on the surface 
          of the water - a copy of the New York Enquirer."  As it moves 
          across the frame, it discloses again the reflection of the 
          window in the castle, closer than before.

          THE GREAT SWIMMING POOL (MINIATURE)

          It is empty.  A newspaper blows across the cracked floor of 
          the tank.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          THE COTTAGES (MINIATURE)

          In the shadows, literally the shadows, of the castle.  As we 
          move by, we see that their doors and windows are boarded up 
          and locked, with heavy bars as further protection and sealing.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

                                                               DISSOLVE IN:

          A DRAWBRIDGE (MINIATURE)

          Over a wide moat, now stagnant and choked with weeds.  We move 
          across it and through a huge solid gateway into a formal garden, 
          perhaps thirty yards wide and one hundred yards deep, which 
          extends right up to the very wall of the castle.  The 
          landscaping surrounding it has been sloppy and causal for a 
          long time, but this particular garden has been kept up in 
          perfect shape.  As the camera makes its way through it, towards 
          the lighted window of the castle, there are revealed rare and 
          exotic blooms of all kinds.  The dominating note is one of 
          almost exaggerated tropical lushness, hanging limp and 
          despairing.  Moss, moss, moss.  Ankor Wat, the night the last 
          King died.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          THE WINDOW (MINIATURE)

          Camera moves in until the frame of the window fills the frame 
          of the screen.  Suddenly, the light within goes out.  This 
          stops the action of the camera and cuts the music which has 
          been accompanying the sequence.  In the glass panes of the 
          window, we see reflected the ripe, dreary landscape of Mr. 
          Kane's estate behind and the dawn sky.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. KANE'S BEDROOM - FAINT DAWN -

          A very long shot of Kane's enormous bed, silhouetted against 
          the enormous window.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. KANE'S BEDROOM - FAINT DAWN - SNOW SCENE.  

          An incredible one.  Big, impossible flakes of snow, a too 
          picturesque farmhouse and a snow man.  The jingling of sleigh 
          bells in the musical score now makes an ironic reference to 
          Indian Temple bells - the music freezes -

           

                                    KANE'S OLD OLD VOICE
                        Rosebud...

          The camera pulls back, showing the whole scene to be contained 
          in one of those glass balls which are sold in novelty stores 
          all over the world.  A hand - Kane's hand, which has been 
          holding the ball, relaxes.  The ball falls out of his hand and 
          bounds down two carpeted steps leading to the bed, the camera 
          following.  The ball falls off the last step onto the marble 
          floor where it breaks, the fragments glittering in the first 
          rays of the morning sun.  This ray cuts an angular pattern 
          across the floor, suddenly crossed with a thousand bars of 
          light as the blinds are pulled across the window.

          The foot of Kane's bed.  The camera very close.  Outlined 
          against the shuttered window, we can see a form - the form of 
          a nurse, as she pulls the sheet up over his head.  The camera

          INT. OF A MOTION PICTURE PROJECTION ROOM

          On the screen as the camera moves in are the words:

                                   "MAIN TITLE"

          Stirring, brassy music is heard on the soundtrack (which, of 
          course, sounds more like a soundtrack than ours.)

          The screen in the projection room fills our screen as the second 
          title appears:

          NOTE:  Here follows a typical news digest short, one of the 
          regular monthly or bi-monthly features, based on public events 
          or personalities.  These are distinguished from ordinary 
          newsreels and short subjects in that they have a fully developed 
          editorial or storyline.  Some of the more obvious 
          characteristics of the "March of Time," for example, as well 
          as other documentary shorts, will be combined to give an 
          authentic impression of this now familiar type of short subject.  
          As is the accepted procedure in these short subjects, a narrator 
          is used as well as explanatory titles.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                               (with quotes in his 
                               voice)
                        "Where twice five miles of fertile 
                        ground, with walls and towers were 
                        girdled 'round."

                        Today, almost as legendary is 
                        Florida's XANADU - world's largest 
                        private pleasure ground.  Here, on 
                        the deserts of the Gulf Coast, a 
                        private mountain was commissioned, 
                        successfully built for its landlord.  
                        Here in a private valley, as in 
                        the Coleridge poem, "blossoms many 
                        an incense-bearing tree."  Verily, 
                        "a miracle of rare device."

          Series of shots showing various aspects of Xanadu, all as they 
          might be photographed by an ordinary newsreel cameraman - nicely 
          photographed, but not atmospheric to the extreme extent of the 
          Prologue (1940).

                        Foster Kane.  In journalism's 
                        history, other names are honored 
                        more than Charles Foster Kane's, 
                        more justly revered.  Among

          TITLE:

          TO FORTY-FOUR MILLION U.S. NEWS BUYERS, MORE NEWSWORTHY THAN 
          THE NAMES IN HIS OWN HEADLINES, WAS KANE HIMSELF, GREATEST

          Shot of a huge, screen-filling picture of Kane.  Pull back to 
          show that it is a picture on the front page of the "Enquirer," 
          surrounded by the reversed rules of mourning, with masthead

          A great number of headlines, set in different types and 
          different styles, obviously from different papers, all 
          announcing Kane's death, all appearing over photographs of 
          Kane himself (perhaps a fifth of the headlines are in foreign 
          languages).  An important item in connection with the headlines 
          is that many of them - positively not all - reveal passionately 
          conflicting opinions about Kane.  Thus, they contain variously 
          the words "patriot," "democrat," "pacifist," "war-monger," 
          "traitor," "idealist," "American," etc.

          Shot of Congressional Investigating Committee (reproduction of 
          existing J.P. Morgan newsreel).  This runs silent under 
          narration.  Walter P. Thatcher is on the stand.  He is flanked 
          by his son, Walter P. Thatcher Jr., and other partners.  He is 
          being questioned by some Merry Andrew congressmen.  At this 
          moment, a baby alligator has just been placed in his lap, 
          causing considerable confusion and embarrassment.

          Newsreel close-up of Thatcher, the soundtrack of which now

                        ...  because of that trivial 
                        incident...

                                    INVESTIGATOR
                        It is a fact, however, is it not, 
                        that in 1870, you did go to 
                        Colorado?

                                    THATCHER
                        I did.

                        Yes.  My firm had been appointed 
                        trustees by Mrs. Kane for the 
                        fortune, which she had recently 
                        acquired.  It was her wish that I 
                        should take charge of this boy, 
                        Charles Foster Kane.

                        That same month in Union Square -

                                    INVESTIGATOR
                        Is it not a fact that on that 
                        occasion, the boy personally 
                        attacked you after striking you in 
                        the stomach with a sled?

          Loud laughter and confusion.

                                    THATCHER
                        Mr. Chairman, I will read to this 
                        committee a prepared statement I 
                        have brought with me - and I will 
                        then refuse to answer any further 
                        questions.  Mr.  Johnson, please!

                               (reading it)
                        "With full awareness of the meaning 
                        of my words and the responsibility 
                        of what I am about to say, it is 
                        my considered belief that Mr.  
                        Charles Foster Kane, in every 
                        essence of his social beliefs and
                        by the dangerous manner in which 
                        he has persistently attacked the 
                        American traditions of private 
                        property, initiative and opportunity 
                        for advancement, is - in fact - 
                        nothing more or less than a 
                        Communist."

          Newsreel of Union Square meeting, section of crowd carrying 
          banners urging the boycott of Kane papers.  A speaker is on 
          the platform above the crowd.

                        - till the words "Charles Foster 
                        Kane" are a menace to every working 
                        man in this land.  He is today 
                        what he has always been and always 
                        will be - A FASCIST!

                                    NARRATOR
                        And yet another opinion - Kane's 
                        own.

          Silent newsreel on a windy platform, flag-draped, in front of 
          the magnificent Enquirer building.  On platform, in full 
          ceremonial dress, is Charles Foster Kane.  He orates silently.

          Another newsreel shot, much later, very brief, showing Kane, 
          older and much fatter, very tired-looking, seated with his 
          second wife in a nightclub.  He looks lonely and unhappy in 
          the midst of the gaiety.

                                    NARRATOR
                        Twice married, twice divorced - 
                        first to a president's niece, Emily 
                        Norton - today, by her second 
                        marriage, chatelaine of the oldest 
                        of England's stately homes.  Sixteen 
                        years after that - two weeks after
                        his divorce from Emily Norton - 
                        Kane married Susan Alexander, 
                        singer, at the Town Hall in Trenton, 
                        New Jersey.

          TITLE: 

          FEW PRIVATE LIVES WERE MORE PUBLIC.

          Period still of Emily Norton (1900).

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Reconstructed silent newsreel.  Kane, Susan, and Bernstein 
          emerging from side doorway of City Hall into a ring of press 
          photographers, reporters, etc.  Kane looks startled, recoils 
          for an instance, then charges down upon the photographers, 
          laying about him with his stick, smashing whatever he can hit.

                                    NARRATOR
                        For wife two, one-time opera singing 
                        Susan Alexander, Kane built 
                        Chicago's Municipal Opera House.  
                        Cost: three million dollars.  
                        Conceived for Susan Alexander Kane, 
                        half-finished before she divorced 
                        him, the still unfinished Xanadu.  
                        Cost: no man can say.

          Still of architect's sketch with typically glorified "rendering" 
          of the Chicago Municipal Opera House.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          A glamorous shot of the almost-finished Xanadu, a magnificent 
          fairy-tale estate built on a mountain. (1920)

          Then shots of its preparation. (1917)

          Shots of truck after truck, train after train, flashing by 
          with tremendous noise.

          Shots of vast dredges, steamshovels.

          Shot of ship standing offshore unloading its lighters.

          In quick succession, shots follow each other, some 
          reconstructed, some in miniature, some real shots (maybe from 
          the dam projects) of building, digging, pouring concrete, etc.

                                    NARRATOR
                        One hundred thousand trees, twenty 
                        thousand tons of marble, are the 
                        ingredients of Xanadu's mountain.
                        Xanadu's livestock: the fowl of 
                        the air, the fish of the sea, the 
                        beast of the field and jungle - 
                        two of each; the biggest private 
                        zoo since Noah.  Contents of Kane's 
                        palace: paintings, pictures, 
                        statues, the very stones of many 
                        another palace, shipped to Florida 
                        from every corner of the earth, 
                        from other Kane houses, warehouses, 
                        where they mouldered for years.  
                        Enough for ten museums - the loot 
                        of the world.

          More shots as before, only this time we see (in miniature) a 
          large mountain - at different periods in its development - 
          rising out of the sands.

          Shots of elephants, apes, zebras, etc. being herded, unloaded, 
          shipped, etc. in various ways.

          Shots of packing cases being unloaded from ships, from trains, 
          from trucks, with various kinds of lettering on them (Italian, 
          Arabian, Chinese, etc.) but all consigned to Charles Foster 
          Kane, Xanadu, Florida.

          A reconstructed still of Xanadu - the main terrace.  A group 
          of persons in clothes of the period of 1917.  In their midst, 
          clearly recognizable, are Kane and Susan.

                                    NARRATOR
                        Kane urged his country's entry 
                        into one war, opposed participation 
                        in another.  Swung the election to 
                        one American President at least, 
                        was called another's assassin.  
                        Thus, Kane's papers might never 
                        have survived - had not the 
                        President.

          TITLE:

          FROM XANADU, FOR THE PAST TWENTY-FIVE YEARS, ALL KANE 
          ENTERPRISES HAVE BEEN DIRECTED, MANY OF THE NATIONS DESTINIES 
          SHAPED.

          Shots of various authentically worded headlines of American 
          papers since 1895.

          Spanish-American War shots. (1898)

          A graveyard in France of the World War and hundreds of crosses. 
          (1919)

          Old newsreels of a political campaign.

          Insert of a particularly virulent headline and/or cartoon.

          HEADLINE: "PRESIDENT SHOT"

                                    NARRATOR
                        Kane, molder of mass opinion though 
                        he was, in all his life was never 
                        granted elective office by the 
                        voters of his country.  Few U.S. 
                        news publishers have been.
                        Few, like one-time Congressman 
                        Hearst, have ever run for any office - 
                        most know better - conclude with 
                        other political observers that one 
                        man's press has power enough for 
                        himself.  But Kane papers were 
                        once strong indeed, and once the 
                        prize seemed almost his.  In 1910, 
                        as Independent Candidate for 
                        governor, the best elements of the 
                        state behind him - the White House 
                        seemingly the next easy step in a 
                        lightning political career -

          NIGHT SHOT OF CROWD BURNING CHARLES FOSTER KANE IN EFFIGY.  
          THE DUMMY BEARS A GROTESQUE, COMIC RESEMBLANCE TO KANE.  IT IS 
          TOSSED INTO THE FLAMES, WHICH BURN UP -

          AND THEN DOWN...  (1910)

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          TITLE:

          IN POLITICS - ALWAYS A BRIDESMAID, NEVER A BRIDE

          Newsreel shots of great crowds streaming into a building - 
          Madison Square Garden - then shots inside the vast auditorium, 
          at one end of which is a huge picture of Kane.  (1910)

          Shot of box containing the first Mrs. Kane and young Howard 
          Kane, age five.  They are acknowledging the cheers of the crowd.  
          (Silent Shot)  (1910)

          Newreel shot of dignitaries on platform, with Kane, alongside 
          of speaker's table, beaming, hand upraised to silence the crowd.

                                    NARRATOR
                        Then, suddenly - less than one 
                        week before election - defeat!  
                        Shameful, ignominious - defeat 
                        that set back for twenty years the 
                        cause of reform in the U.S., forever 
                        cancelled political chances for 
                        Charles Foster Kane.  Then, in the 
                        third year of the Great 
                        Depression...  As to all publishers, 
                        it sometimes must - to Bennett, to 
                        Munsey and Hearst it did - a paper 
                        closes!  For Kane, in four short 
                        years: collapse!
                        Eleven Kane papers, four Kane 
                        magazines merged, more sold, 
                        scrapped -

          Newreel shot - closeup of Kane delivering a speech...  (1910)

          The front page of a contemporary paper - a screaming headline.  
          Twin phots of Kane and Susan.  (1910)

          Printed title about Depression.

          Once more repeat the map of the USA 1932-1939.  Suddenly, the 
          cartoon goes into reverse, the empire begins to shrink, 
          illustrating the narrator's words.

          The door of a newspaper office with the signs: "Closed."

                                    NARRATOR
                        Then four long years more - alone 
                        in his never-finished, already 
                        decaying, pleasure palace, aloof, 
                        seldom visited, never photographed, 
                        Charles Foster Kane continued to 
                        direct his falling empire ... vainly 
                        attempting to sway, as he once 
                        did, the destinies of a nation 
                        that has ceased to listen to him 
                        ... ceased to trust him...

          SHOTS OF XANADU.  (1940)

          Series of shots, entirely modern, but rather jumpy and obviously 
          bootlegged, showing Kane in a bath chair, swathed in summer 
          rugs, being perambulated through his rose garden, a desolate 
          figure in the sunshine.  (1935)

                                    NARRATOR
                        Last week, death came to sit upon 
                        the throne of America's Kubla Khan - 
                        last week, as it must to all men, 
                        death came to Charles Foster Kane.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Cabinent Photograph (Full Screen) of Kane as an old, old man.  
          This image remains constant on the screen (as camera pulls 
          back, taking in the interior of a dark projection room.

          INT. PROJECTION ROOM - DAY -

          A fairly large one, with a long throw to the screen.  It is 
          dark.

          The image of Kane as an old man remains constant on the screen 
          as camera pulls back, slowly taking in and registering 
          Projection Room.  This action occurs, however, only after the 
          first few lines of encuring dialogue have been spoken.  The 
          shadows of the men speaking appear as they rise from their 
          chairs - black against the image of Kane's face on the screen.

          NOTE:  These are the editors of a "News Digest" short, and of 
          the Rawlston magazines.  All his enterprises are represented 
          in the projection room, and Rawlston himself, that great man, 
          is present also and will shortly speak up.

          During the entire course of this scene, nobody's face is really 
          seen.  Sections of their bodies are picked out by a table light, 
          a silhouette is thrown on the screen, and their faces and bodies 
          are themselves thrown into silhouette against the brilliant 
          slanting rays of light from the projection room.

          A Third Man is on the telephone.  We see a corner of his head 
          and the phone.

                                    THIRD MAN
                               (at phone)
                        Stand by.  I'll tell you if we 
                        want to run it again.
                               (hangs up)

                                    THOMPSON'S VOICE
                        Well?

          A short pause.

                                    A MAN'S VOICE
                        It's a tough thing to do in a 
                        newsreel.  Seventy years of a man's 
                        life -

          Murmur of highly salaried assent at this.  Rawlston walks toward 
          camera and out of the picture.  Others are rising.  Camera 
          during all of this, apparently does its best to follow action 
          and pick up faces, but fails.  Actually, all set-ups are to be 
          planned very carefully to exclude the element of personality 
          from this scene; which is expressed entirely by voices, shadows, 
          sillhouettes and the big, bright image of Kane himself on the 
          screen.

                                    A VOICE
                        See what Arthur Ellis wrote about 
                        him in the American review?

                                    THIRD MAN
                        I read it.

                                    THE VOICE
                               (its owner is already 
                               leaning across the 
                               table, holding a 
                               piece of paper 
                               under the desk 
                               light and reading 
                               from it)
                        Listen:  Kane is dead.  He 
                        contributed to the journalism of 
                        his day - the talent of a 
                        mountebank, the morals of a 
                        bootlegger, and the manners of a 
                        pasha.  He and his kind have almost 
                        succeeded in transforming a once 
                        noble profession into a seven 
                        percent security - no longer secure.

                                    ANOTHER VOICE
                        That's what Arthur Ellis is writing 
                        now.  Thirty years ago, when Kane 
                        gave him his chance to clean up 
                        Detroit and Chicago and St. Louis, 
                        Kane was the greatest guy in the
                        world.  If you ask me -

                                    ANOTHER VOICE
                        Charles Foster Kane was a...

          Then observations are made almost simultaneous.

                                    RAWLSTON'S VOICE
                        Just a minute!

          Camera moves to take in his bulk outlined against the glow 
          from the projection room.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        What were Kane's last words?

          A silence greets this.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        What were the last words he said 
                        on earth?  Thompson, you've made 
                        us a good short, but it needs 
                        character -

                                    SOMEBODY'S VOICE
                        Motivation -

                                    RAWLSTON
                        That's it - motivation.  What made 
                        Kane what he was?  And, for that 
                        matter, what was he?  What we've 
                        just seen are the outlines of a 
                        career - what's behind the career?  
                        What's the man?  Was he good or 
                        bad?  Strong or foolish?  Tragic 
                        or silly?  Why did he do all those 
                        things?  What was he after?
                               (then, appreciating 
                               his point)
                        Maybe he told us on his death bed.

                                    THOMPSON
                        Yes, and maybe he didn't.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        Ask the question anyway, Thompson!
                        Build the picture around the 
                        question, even if you can't answer 
                        it.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I know, but -

                                    RAWLSTON
                               (riding over him 
                               like any other 
                               producer)
                        All we saw on that screen was a 
                        big American -

                                    A VOICE
                        One of the biggest.

                                    RAWLSTON
                               (without pausing 
                               for this)
                        But how is he different from Ford?
                        Or Hearst for that matter?  Or 
                        Rockefeller - or John Doe?

                                    A VOICE
                        I know people worked for Kane will 
                        tell you - not only in the newspaper 
                        business - look how he raised 
                        salaries.  You don't want to forget -

                                    ANOTHER VOICE
                        You take his labor record alone, 
                        they ought to hang him up like a 
                        dog.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        I tell you, Thompson - a man's 
                        dying words -

                                    SOMEBODY'S VOICE
                        What were they?

          Silence.

                                    SOMEBODY'S VOICE
                               (hesitant)
                        Yes, Mr. Rawlston, what were Kane's 
                        dying words?

                                    RAWLSTON
                               (with disgust)
                        Rosebud!

          A little ripple of laughter at this, which is promptly silenced 
          by Rawlston.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        That's right.

                                    A VOICE
                        Tough guy, huh?
                               (derisively)
                        Dies calling for Rosebud!

                                    RAWLSTON
                        Here's a man who might have been 
                        President.  He's been loved and 
                        hated and talked about as much as 
                        any man in our time - but when he 
                        comes to die, he's got something 
                        on his mind called "Rosebud."  
                        What does that mean?

                                    ANOTHER VOICE
                        A racehorse he bet on once, 
                        probably, that didn't come in - 
                        Rosebud!

                                    RAWLSTON
                        All right.  But what was the race?

          There is a short silence.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        Thompson!

                                    THOMPSON
                        Yes, sir.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        Hold this thing up for a week.  
                        Two weeks if you have to...

                                    THOMPSON
                               (feebly)
                        But don't you think if we release 
                        it now - he's only been dead four 
                        days it might be better than if -

                                    RAWLSTON
                               (decisively)
                        Nothing is ever better than finding 
                        out what makes people tick.  Go 
                        after the people that knew Kane 
                        well.  That manager of his - the 
                        little guy, Bernstein, those two 
                        wives, all the people who knew 
                        him, had worked for him, who loved 
                        him, who hated his guts -
                               (pauses)
                        I don't mean go through the City
                        Directory, of course -

          The Third Man gives a hearty "yes-man" laugh.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'll get to it right away, Mr.
                        Rawlston.

                                    RAWLSTON
                               (rising)
                        Good!

          The camera from behind him, outlines his back against Kane's 
          picture on the screen.

                                    RAWLSTON'S VOICE
                        It'll probably turn out to be a 
                        very simple thing...

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          NOTE:  Now begins the story proper - the seach by Thompson for 
          the facts about Kane - his researches ... his interviews with 
          the people who knew Kane.

          It is important to remember always that only at the very end 
          of the story is Thompson himself a personality.  Until then, 
          throughout the picture, we photograph only Thompson's back, 
          shoulders, or his shadow - sometimes we only record his voice.  
          He is not until the final scene a "character".  He is the 
          personification of the search for the truth about Charles Foster 
          Kane.  He is the investigator.

          FADE IN:

          EXT. CHEAP CABARET - "EL RANCHO" - ATLANTIC CITY - NIGHT - 
          1940 (MINIATURE) - RAIN

          The first image to register is a sign:

          "EL RANCHO"

          FLOOR SHOW

          SUSAN ALEXANDER KANE

          TWICE NIGHTLY

          These words, spelled out in neon, glow out of the darkness at 
          the end of the fade out.  Then there is lightning which reveals 
          a squalid roof-top on which the sign stands.  Thunder again, 
          and faintly the sound of music from within.  A light glows 
          from a skylight.  The camera moves to this and closes in.  
          Through the splashes of rain, we see through the skylight down 
          into the interior of the cabaret.  Directly below us at a table 
          sits the lone figure of a woman, drinking by herself.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. "EL RANCO" CABARET - NIGHT -

          Medium shot of the same woman as before, finishing the drink 
          she started to take above.  It is Susie.  The music, of course, 
          is now very loud.  Thompson, his back to the camera, moves 
          into the picture in the close foreground.  A Captain appears 
          behind Susie, speaking across her to Thompson.

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                               (a Greek)
                        This is Mr. Thompson, Miss 
                        Alexander.

          Susan looks up into Thompson's face.  She is fifty, trying to 
          look much younger, cheaply blonded, in a cheap, enormously 
          generous evening dress.  Blinking up into Thompson's face, she 
          throws a crink into ther mouth.  Her eyes, which she thinks is 
          keeping commandingly on his, are bleared and watery.

                                    SUSAN
                               (to the Captain)
                        I want another drink, John.

          Low thunder from outside.

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                               (seeing his chance)
                        Right away.  Will you have 
                        something, Mr. Thompson?

                                    THOMPSON
                               (staring to sit 
                               down)
                        I'll have a highball.

                                    SUSAN
                               (so insistently as 
                               to make Thompson 
                               change his mind 
                               and stand up again)
                        Who told you you could sit down 
                        here?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Oh!  I thought maybe we could have 
                        a drink together?

                                    SUSAN
                        Think again!

          There is an awkward pause as Thompson looks from her to the 
          Captain.

                                    SUSAN
                        Why don't you people let me alone?
                        I'm minding my own business.  You 
                        mind yours.

                                    THOMPSON
                        If you'd just let me talk to you 
                        for a little while, Miss Alexander.
                        All I want to ask you...

                                    SUSAN
                        Get out of here!
                               (almost hysterical)
                        Get out!  Get out!

          Thompson looks at the Captain, who shrugs his shoulders.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'm sorry.  Maybe some other time -

          If he thought he would get a response from Susan, who thinks 
          she is looking at him steelily, he realizes his error.  He 
          nods and walks off, following the Captain out the door.

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                        She's just not talking to anybody 
                        from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'm not from a newspaper exactly, 
                        I -

          They have come upon a waiter standing in front of a booth.

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                               (to the waiter)
                        Get her another highball.

                                    THE WAITER
                        Another double?

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                               (after a moment, 
                               pityingly)
                        Yes.

          They walk to the door.

                                    THOMPSON
                        She's plastered, isn't she?

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                        She'll snap out of it.  Why, until 
                        he died, she'd just as soon talk 
                        about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  
                        Sooner.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'll come down in a week or so and 
                        see her again.  Say, you might be 
                        able to help me.  When she used to 
                        talk about Kane - did she ever 
                        happen to say anything - about 
                        Rosebud?

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                        Rosebud?

          Thompson has just handed him a bill.  The Captain pockets it.

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                        Thank you, sir.  As a matter of 
                        fact, yesterday afternoon, when it 
                        was in all the papers - I asked 
                        her.  She never heard of Rosebud.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:

          INT. THATCHER MEMORIAL LIBRARY - DAY -

          An excruciatingly noble interpretation of Mr. Thatcher himself 
          executed in expensive marble.  He is shown seated on one of 
          those improbable Edwin Booth chairs and is looking down, his 
          stone eyes fixed on the camera.

          We move down off of this, showing the impressive pedestal on 
          which the monument is founded.  The words, "Walter Parks 
          Thatcher" are prominently and elegantly engraved thereon.  
          Immediately below the inscription we encounter, in a medium 
          shot, the person of Bertha Anderson, an elderly, manish 
          spinnster, seated behind her desk.  Thompson, his hat in his 
          hand, is standing before her.  Bertha is on the phone.

                                    BERTHA
                               (into phone)
                        Yes.  I'll take him in now.
                               (hangs up and looks 
                               at Thompson)
                        The directors of the Thatcher 
                        Library have asked me to remind 
                        you again of the condition under 
                        which you may inspect certain 
                        portions of Mr. Thatcher's 
                        unpublished memoirs.  Under no 
                        circumstances are direct quotations 
                        from his manuscript to be used by 
                        you.

                                    THOMPSON
                        That's all right.

                                    BERTHA
                        You may come with me.

          Without watching whether he is following her or not, she rises 
          and starts towards a distant and imposingly framed door.  
          Thompson, with a bit of a sigh, follows.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          INT. THE VAULT ROOM - THATCHER MEMORIAL LIBRARY - DAY -

          A room with all the warmth and charm of Napolean's tomb.

          As we dissolve in, the door opens in and we see past Thompson's 
          shoulders the length of the room.  Everything very plain, very 
          much made out of marble and very gloomy.  Illumination from a 
          skylight above adds to the general air of expensive and 
          classical despair.  The floor is marble, and there is a 
          gigantic, mahogany table in the center of everything.  Beyond 
          this is to be seen, sunk in the marble wall at the far end of 
          the room, the safe from which a guard, in a khaki uniform, 
          with a revolver holster at his hip, is extracting the journal 
          of Walter P. Thatcher.  He brings it to Bertha as if he were 
          the guardian of a bullion shipment.  During this, Bertha has 
          been speaking.

                                    BERTHA
                               (to the guard)
                        Pages eighty-three to one hundred 
                        and forty-two, Jennings.

                                    GUARD
                        Yes, Miss Anderson.

                                    BERTHA
                               (to Thompson)
                        You will confine yourself, it is 
                        our understanding, to the chapter 
                        dealing with Mr. Kane.

                                    THOMPSON
                        That's all I'm interested in.

          The guard has, by this time, delivered the precious journal.  
          Bertha places it reverently on the table before Thompson.

                                    BERTHA
                        You will be required to leave this 
                        room at four-thirty promptly.

          She leaves.  Thompson starts to light a cigarette.  The guard 
          shakes his head.  With a sigh, Thompson bends over to read the 
          manuscript.  Camera moves down over his shoulder onto page of 
          manuscript.

          Manuscript, neatly and precisely written:

          "CHARLES FOSTER KANE

          WHEN THESE LINES APPEAR IN PRINT, FIFTY YEARS AFTER MY DEATH, 
          I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD WILL AGREE WITH MY OPINION 
          OF CHARLES FOSTER KANE, ASSUMING THAT HE IS NOT THEN COMPLETELY 
          FORGOTTEN, WHICH I REGARD AS EXTREMELY LIKELY.  A GOOD DEAL OF 
          NONSENSE HAS APPEARED ABOUT MY FIRST MEETING WITH KANE, WHEN 
          HE WAS SIX YEARS OLD...  THE FACTS ARE SIMPLE.  IN THE WINTER 
          OF 1870..."

          The camera has not held on the entire page.  It has been 
          following the words with the same action that the eye does the 
          reading.  On the last words, the white page of the paper

                                                            DISSOLVES INTO:

          EXT. MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          The white of a great field of snow, seen from the angle of a 
          parlor window.

          In the same position of the last word in above Insert, appears 
          the tiny figure of Charles Foster Kane, aged five (almost like 
          an animated cartoon).  He is in the act of throwing a snowball 
          at the camera.  It sails toward us and over our heads, out of 
          scene.

          Reverse angle - on the house featuring a large sign reading:

          MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE

          HIGH CLASS MEALS AND LODGING

          INQUIRE WITHIN

          Charles Kane's snowball hits the sign.

          INT. PARLOR - MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          Camera is angling through the window, but the window-frame is 
          not cut into scene.  We see only the field of snow again, same 
          angle as in previous scene.  Charles is manufacturing another 
          snowball.  Now -

          Camera pulls back, the frame of the window appearing, and we 
          are inside the parlor of the boardinghouse.  Mrs. Kane, aged 
          about 28, is looking out towards her son.  Just as we take her 
          in she speaks:

                                    MRS. KANE
                               (calling out)
                        Be careful, Charles!

                                    THATCHER'S VOICE
                        Mrs. Kane -

                                    MRS. KANE
                               (Calling out the 
                               window almost on 
                               top of this)
                        Pull your muffler around your neck, 
                        Charles -

          But Charles, deliriously happy in the snow, is oblivious to 
          this and is running away.  Mrs. Kane turns into camera and we 
          see her face - a strong face, worn and kind.

                                    THATCHER'S VOICE
                        think we'll have to tell him now -

          Camera now pulls back further, showing Thatcher standing before 
          a table on which is his stove-pipe hat and an imposing 
          multiplicity of official-looking documents.  He is 26 and, as 
          might be expected, a very stuffy young man, already very 
          expensive and conservative looking, even in Colorado.

                                    MRS. KANE
                        I'll sign those papers -

                                    KANE SR.
                        You people seem to forget that I'm 
                        the boy's father.

          At the sound of Kane Sr.'s voice, both have turned to him and 
          the camera pulls back still further, taking him in.

          Kane Sr., who is the assistant curator in a livery stable, has 
          been groomed as elegantly as is likely for this meeting ever 
          since daybreak.

          From outside the window can be heard faintly the wild and 
          cheerful cries of the boy, blissfully cavorting in the snow.

                                    MRS. KANE
                        It's going to be done exactly the
                        way I've told Mr. Thatcher -

                                    KANE SR.
                        If I want to, I can go to court.
                        father has a right to -

                                    THATCHER
                               (annoyed)
                        Mr. Kane, the certificates that 
                        Mr.  Graves left here are made out 
                        to Mrs.  Kane, in her name.  Hers 
                        to do with as she pleases -

                                    KANE SR.
                        Well, I don't hold with signing my 
                        boy away to any bank as guardian
                        just because -

                                    MRS. KANE
                               (quietly)
                        I want you to stop all this 
                        nonsense, Jim.

                                    THATCHER
                        The Bank's decision in all matters 
                        concerning his education, his place 
                        of residence and similar subjects 
                        will be final.
                               (clears his throat)

                                    KANE SR.
                        The idea of a bank being the 
                        guardian -

          Mrs. Kane has met his eye.  Her triumph over him finds 
          expression in his failure to finish his sentence.

                                    MRS. KANE
                               (even more quietly)
                        I want you to stop all this 
                        nonsense, Jim.

                                    THATCHER
                        We will assume full management of 
                        the Colorado Lode - of which you, 
                        Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.

          Kane Sr. opens his mouth once or twice, as if to say something, 
          but chokes down his opinion.

                                    MRS. KANE
                               (has been reading 
                               past Thatcher's 
                               shoulder as he 
                               talked)
                        Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?

                                    THATCHER
                        Right here, Mrs. Kane.

                                    KANE SR.
                               (sulkily)
                        Don't say I didn't warn you.

          Mrs. Kane lifts the quill pen.

                                    KANE SR.
                        Mary, I'm asking you for the last 
                        time - anyon'd think I hadn't been
                        a good husband and a -

          Mrs. Kane looks at him slowly.  He stops his speech.

                                    THATCHER
                        The sum of fifty thousand dollars 
                        a year is to be paid to yourself 
                        and Mr. Kane as long as you both 
                        live, and thereafter the survivor -

          Mrs. Kane puts pen to the paper and signs.

                                    KANE SR.
                        Well, let's hope it's all for the 
                        best.

                                    MRS. KANE
                        It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher -

          Mrs. Kane, listening to Thatcher, of course has had her other 
          ear bent in the direction of the boy's voice.  Thatcher is 
          aware both of the boy's voice, which is counter to his own, 
          and of Mrs. Kane's divided attention.  As he pauses, Kane Sr. 
          genteelly walks over to close the window.

          EXT. MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          Kane Jr., seen from Kane Sr.'s position at the window.  He is 
          advancing on the snowman, snowballs in his hands, dropping to 
          one knee the better to confound his adversary.

                                    KANE
                        If the rebels want a fight boys, 
                        let's give it to 'em!

          He throws two snowballs, missing widely, and gets up and 
          advances another five feet before getting on his knees again.

                                    KANE
                        The terms are underconditional 
                        surrender.  Up and at 'em!  The 
                        Union forever!

          INT. PARLOR - MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          Kane Sr. closes the window.

                                    THATCHER
                               (over the boy's 
                               voice)
                        Everything else - the principal as 
                        well as all monies earned - is to 
                        be administered by the bank in 
                        trust for your son, Charles Foster 
                        Kane, until his twenty-fifth 
                        birthday, at which time he is to 
                        come into complete possession.

          Mrs. Kane rises and goes to the window.

                                    MRS. KANE
                        Go on, Mr. Thatcher.

          Thatcher continues as she opens the window.  His voice, as 
          before, is heard with overtones of the boy's.

          EXT. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          Kane Jr., seen from Mrs. Kane's position at the window.  He is 
          now within ten feet of the snowman, with one snowball left 
          which he is holding back in his right hand.

                                    KANE
                        You can't lick Andy Jackson!  Old 
                        Hickory, that's me!

          He fires his snowball, well wide of the mark and falls flat on 
          his stomach, starting to crawl carefully toward the snowman.

                                    THATCHER'S VOICE
                        It's nearly five, Mrs. Kane, don't
                        you think I'd better meet the boy -

          INT. PARLOR - MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          Mrs. Kane at the window.  Thatcher is now standing at her side.

                                    MRS. KANE
                        I've got his trunk all packed -
                               (she chokes a little)
                        I've it packed for a couple of 
                        weeks -

          She can't say anymore.  She starts for the hall day.  Kane 
          Sr., ill at ease, has no idea of how to comfort her.

                                    THATCHER
                        I've arranged for a tutor to meet 
                        us in Chicago.  I'd have brought 
                        him along with me, but you were so
                        anxious to keep everything secret -

          He stops as he realizes that Mrs. Kane has paid no attention 
          to him and, having opened the door, is already well into the 
          hall that leads to the side door of the house.  He takes a 
          look at Kane Sr., tightens his lips and follows Mrs. Kane.  
          Kane, shoulders thrown back like one who bears defeat bravely, 
          follows him.

          EXT. MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          Kane, in the snow-covered field.  With the snowman between him 
          and the house, he is holding the sled in his hand, just about 
          to make the little run that prefaces a belly-flop.  The Kane 
          house, in the background, is a dilapidated, shabby, two-story 
          frame building, with a wooden outhouse.  Kane looks up as he 
          sees the single file procession, Mrs. Kane at its head, coming 
          toward him.

                                    KANE
                        H'ya, Mom.

          Mrs. Kane smiles.

                                    KANE
                               (gesturing at the 
                               snowman)
                        See, Mom?  I took the pipe out of 
                        his mouth.  If it keeps on snowin',
                        maybe I'll make some teeth and -

                                    MRS. KANE
                        You better come inside, son.  You 
                        and I have got to get you all ready
                        for - for -

                                    THATCHER
                        Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -

                                    MRS. KANE
                        This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.

                                    THATCHER
                        How do you do, Charles?

                                    KANE SR.
                        He comes from the east.

                                    KANE
                        Hello.  Hello, Pop.

                                    KANE SR.
                        Hello, Charlie!

                                    MRS. KANE
                        Mr. Thatcher is going to take you 
                        on a trip with him tonight, Charles.
                        You'll be leaving on Number Ten.

                                    KANE SR.
                        That's the train with all the 
                        lights.

                                    KANE
                        You goin', Mom?

                                    THATCHER
                        Your mother won't be going right 
                        away, Charles -

                                    KANE
                        Where'm I going?

                                    KANE SR.
                        You're going to see Chicago and 
                        New York - and Washington, maybe...
                        Isn't he, Mr. Thatcher?

                                    THATCHER
                               (heartily)
                        He certainly is.  I wish I were a 
                        little boy and going to make a 
                        trip like that for the first time.

                                    KANE
                        Why aren't you comin' with us, 
                        Mom?

                                    MRS. KANE
                        We have to stay here, Charles.

                                    KANE SR.
                        You're going to live with Mr. 
                        Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  
                        You're going to be rich.  Your Ma 
                        figures - that is, re - she and I 
                        have decided that this isn't the 
                        place for you to grow up in.
                        You'll probably be the richest man 
                        in America someday and you ought 
                        to -

                                    MRS. KANE
                        You won't be lonely, Charles...

                                    THATCHER
                        We're going to have a lot of good 
                        times together, Charles...  Really 
                        we are.

          Kane stares at him.

                                    THATCHER
                        Come on, Charles.  Let's shake 
                        hands.
                               (extends his hand.  
                               Charles continues 
                               to look at him)
                        Now, now!  I'm not as frightening 
                        as all that!  Let's shake, what do 
                        you say?

          He reaches out for Charles's hand.  Without a word, Charles 
          hits him in the stomach with the sled.  Thatcher stumbles back 
          a few feet, gasping.

                                    THATCHER
                               (with a sickly grin)
                        You almost hurt me, Charles.
                               (moves towards him)
                        Sleds aren't to hit people with.
                        Sleds are to - to sleigh on.  When 
                        we get to New York, Charles, we'll
                        get you a sled that will -

          He's near enough to try to put a hand on Kane's shoulder.  As 
          he does, Kane kicks him in the ankle.

                                    MRS. KANE
                        Charles!

          He throws himself on her, his arms around her.  Slowly Mrs. 
          Kane puts her arms around him.

                                    KANE
                               (frightened)
                        Mom!  Mom!

                                    MRS. KANE
                        It's all right, Charles, it's all 
                        right.

          Thatcher is looking on indignantly, occasionally bending over 
          to rub his ankle.

                                    KANE SR.
                        Sorry, Mr. Thatcher!  What the kid 
                        needs is a good thrashing!

                                    MRS. KANE
                        That's what you think, is it, Jim?

                                    KANE SR.
                        Yes.

          Mrs. Kane looks slowly at Mr. Kane.

                                    MRS. KANE
                               (slowly)
                        That's why he's going to be brought 
                        up where you can't get at him.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          1870 - NIGHT (STOCK OR MINIATURE)

          Old-fashioned railroad wheels underneath a sleeper, spinning 
          along the track.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. TRAIN - OLD-FASHIONED DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT -

          Thatcher, with a look of mingled exasperation, annoyance, 
          sympathy and inability to handle the situation, is standing 
          alongside a berth, looking at Kane.  Kane, his face in the 
          pillow, is crying with heartbreaking sobs.

                                    KANE
                        Mom!  Mom!

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          The white page of the Thatcher manuscript.  We pick up the 
          words:

          "HE WAS, I REPEAT, A COMMON ADVENTURER, SPOILED, UNSCRUPULOUS, 
          IRRESPONSIBLE."

          The words are followed by printed headline on "Enquirer" copy 
          (as in following scene).

          INT. ENQUIRER CITY ROOM - DAY -

          Close-up on printed headline which reads:

          "ENEMY ARMADA OFF JERSEY COAST"

          Camera pulls back to reveal Thatcher holding the "Enquirer" 
          copy, on which we read the headline.  He is standing near the 
          editorial round table around which a section of the staff, 
          including Reilly, Leland and Kane are eating lunch.

                                    THATCHER
                               (coldly)
                        Is that really your idea of how to 
                        run a newspaper?

                                    KANE
                        I don't know how to run a newspaper, 
                        Mr. Thatcher.  I just try everything 
                        I can think of.

                                    THATCHER
                               (reading headline 
                               of paper he is 
                               still holding)
                        "Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  
                        You know you haven't the slightest 
                        proof that this - this armada - is 
                        off the Jersey Coast.

                                    KANE
                        Can you prove it isn't?

          Bernstein has come into the picture.  He has a cable in his 
          hand.  He stops when he sees Thatcher.

                                    KANE
                        Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        How are you, Mr. Thatcher?

                                    THATCHER
                        How do you do? -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        We just had a wire from Cuba, Mr. 
                        Kane -
                               (stops, embarrassed)

                                    KANE
                        That's all right.  We have no 
                        secrets from our readers.  Mr. 
                        Thatcher is one of our most devoted 
                        readers, Mr.  Bernstein.  He knows 
                        what's wrong with every issue since 
                        I've taken charge.  What's the 
                        cable?

                        senoritas are beautiful stop I 
                        could send you prose poems of palm 
                        trees and sunrises and tropical 
                        colors blending in far off

                        You see!  There hasn't been a true 
                        word -

                                    KANE
                        I think we'll have to send our 
                        friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. 
                        Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have 
                        to make it shorter than his, because 
                        he's working on an expense account 
                        and we're not.  Let me see -
                               (snaps his fingers)
                        Mike!

                                    MIKE
                               (a fairly tough 
                               customer prepares 
                               to take dictation, 
                               his mouth still 
                               full of food)
                        Go ahead, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        Dear Wheeler -
                               (pauses a moment)
                        You provide the prose poems - I'll 
                        provide the war.

          Laughter from the boys and girls at the table.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        That's fine, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        I rather like it myself.  Send it 
                        right away.

                                    MIKE
                        Right away.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Right away.

          Mike and Bernstein leave.  Kane looks up, grinning at Thatcher, 
          who is bursting with indignation but controls himself.  After 
          a moment of indecision, he decides to make one last try.

                                    THATCHER
                        I came to see you, Charles, about 
                        your - about the Enquirer's campaign 
                        against the Metropolitan Transfer 
                        Company.

                                    KANE
                        Won't you step into my office, Mr.
                        Thatcher?

          They cross the City Room together.

                                    THATCHER
                        I think I should remind you, 
                        Charles, of a fact you seem to 
                        have forgotten.  You are yourself 
                        one of the largest individual 
                        stockholders.

          INT. KANE'S OFFICE - DAY -

          Kane holds the door open for Thatcher.  They come in together.

                                    KANE
                        Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything 
                        I've been saying in the Enquirer 
                        about the traction trust absolutely 
                        true?

                                    THATCHER
                               (angrily)
                        They're all part of your general
                        attack - your senseless attack -
                        on everything and everybody who's 
                        got more than ten cents in his 
                        pocket.  They're -

                                    KANE
                        The trouble is, Mr. Thatcher, you 
                        don't realize you're talking to
                        two people.

          Kane moves around behind his desk.  Thatcher doesn't understand, 
          looks at him.

                                    KANE
                        As Charles Foster Kane, who has                         
                        eighty-two thousand, six hundred 
                        and thirty-one shares of 
                        Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I 
                        do have a rough idea of my holdings -
                        I sympathize with you.  Charles 
                        Foster Kane is a dangerous 
                        scoundrel, his paper should be run 
                        out of town and a committee should 
                        be formed to boycott him.  You 
                        may, if you can form such a 
                        committee, put me down for a 
                        contribution of one thousand 
                        dollars.

                                    THATCHER
                               (angrily)
                        Charles, my time is too valuable 
                        for me -

                                    KANE
                        On the other hand -
                               (his manner becomes 
                               serious)
                        I am the publisher of the Enquirer.
                        As such, it is my duty - I'll let 
                        you in on a little secret, it is 
                        also my pleasure - to see to it 
                        that decent, hard-working people 
                        of this city are not robbed blind 
                        by a group of money - mad pirates 
                        because, God help them, they have 
                        no one to look after their 
                        interests!  I'll let you in on 
                        another little secret, Mr. Thatcher.  
                        I think I'm the man to do it.  You 
                        see, I have money and property -

          Thatcher doesn't understand him.

                                    KANE
                        If I don't defend the interests of 
                        the underprivileged, somebody else 
                        will - maybe somebody without any 
                        money or any property and that 
                        would be too bad.

          Thatcher glares at him, unable to answer.  Kane starts to dance.

                                    KANE
                        Do you know how to tap, Mr. 
                        Thatcher?  You ought to learn -
                               (humming quietly, 
                               he continues to 
                               dance)

          Thatcher puts on his hat.

                                    THATCHER
                        I happened to see your consolidated 
                        statement yesterday, Charles.  
                        Could I not suggest to you that it 
                        is unwise for you to continue this 
                        philanthropic enterprise -
                               (sneeringly)
                        this Enquirer - that is costing 
                        you one million dollars a year?

                                    KANE
                        You're right.  We did lose a million 
                        dollars last year.

          Thatcher thinks maybe the point has registered.

                                    KANE
                        We expect to lost a million next
                        year, too.  You know, Mr. Thatcher -
                               (starts tapping 
                               quietly)
                        at the rate of a million a year -
                        we'll have to close this place in 
                        sixty years.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. THE VAULT ROOM - THATCHER MEMORIAL LIBRARY - DAY

          Thompson - at the desk.  With a gesture of annoyance, he is 
          closing the manuscript.

          Camera arcs quickly around from over his shoulder to hold on 
          door behind him, missing his face as he rises and turns to 
          confront Miss Anderson, who has come into the room to shoo him 
          out.  Very prominent on this wall is an over-sized oil painting 
          of Thatcher in the best Union League Club renaissance style.

                                    MISS ANDERSON
                        You have enjoyed a very rare 
                        privilege, young man.  Did you 
                        find what you were looking for?

                                    THOMPSON
                        No.  Tell me something, Miss 
                        Anderson.  You're not Rosebud, are 
                        you?

                                    MISS ANDERSON
                        What?

                                    THOMPSON
                        I didn't think you were.  Well, 
                        thanks for the use of the hall.

          He puts his hat on his head and starts out, lighting a cigarette 
          as he goes.  Miss Anderson, scandalized, watches him.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:

          INT. BERNSTEIN'S OFFICE - ENQUIRER SKYSCRAPER - DAY -

          Closeup of a still of Kane, aged about sixty-five.  Camera 
          pulls back, showing it is a framed photograph on the wall.  
          Over the picture are crossed American flags.  Under it sits 
          Bernstein, back of his desk.  Bernstein, always an undersized 
          Jew, now seems even smaller than in his youth.  He is bald as 
          an egg, spry, with remarkably intense eyes.  As camera continues 
          to travel back, the back of Thompson's head and his shoulders 
          come into the picture.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (wryly)
                        Who's a busy man?  Me?  I'm Chairman 
                        of the Board.  I got nothing but 
                        time ...  What do you want to know?

                                    THOMPSON
                               (still explaining)
                        Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with 
                        Mr.  Kane from the very beginning -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        From before the beginning, young 
                        fellow.  And now it's after the 
                        end.
                               (turns to Thompson)
                        Anything you want to know about 
                        him - about the paper -

                                    THOMPSON
                        -  We thought maybe, if we can 
                        find out what he meant by that 
                        last word - as he was dying -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?  
                        There were a lot of them back in 
                        the early days, and -

                                    THOMPSON
                        Not some girl he knew casually and 
                        then remembered after fifty years,
                        on his death bed -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        You're pretty young, Mr. -
                               (remembers the name)
                        Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will 
                        remember things you wouldn't think 
                        he'd remember.  You take me.  One 
                        day, back in 1896, I was crossing 
                        over to Jersey on a ferry and as 
                        we pulled out, there was another
                        ferry pulling in -
                               (slowly)
                        - and on it, there was a girl 
                        waiting to get off.  A white dress 
                        she had on - and she was carrying 
                        a white pastrol - and I only saw 
                        her for one second and she didn't 
                        see me at all - but I'll bet a 
                        month hasn't gone by since that I 
                        haven't thought of that girl.
                               (triumphantly)
                        See what I mean?
                               (smiles)
                        Well, so what are you doing about 
                        this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'm calling on people who knew Mr. 
                        Kane.  I'm calling on you.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Who else you been to see?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Well, I went down to Atlantic City -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Susie?  I called her myself the 
                        day after he died.  I thought maybe 
                        somebody ought to...
                               (sadly)
                        She couldn't even come to the 
                        'phone.

                                    THOMPSON
                        You know why?  She was so -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Sure, sure.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'm going back there.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Who else did you see?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Nobody else, but I've been through 
                        that stuff of Walter Thatcher's.
                        That journal of his -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Thatcher!  That man was the biggest
                        darn fool I ever met -

                                    THOMPSON
                        He made an awful lot of money.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        It's not trick to make an awful 
                        lot of money if all you want is to 
                        make a lot of money.
                               (his eyes get 
                               reflective)
                        Thatcher!

          Bernstein looks out of the window and keeps on looking, seeming 
          to see something as he talks.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        He never knew there was anything 
                        in the world but money.  That kind 
                        of fellow you can fool every day 
                        in the week - and twice on Sundays!
                               (reflectively)
                        The time he came to Rome for Mr. 
                        Kane's twenty-fifth birthday...  
                        You know, when Mr. Kane got control 
                        of his own
                        money...  Such a fool like Thatcher -
                        I tell you, nobody's business!

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          Bernstein speaking to Thompson.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        He knew what he wanted, Mr. Kane 
                        did, and he got it!  Thatcher never 
                        did figure him out.  He was hard 
                        to figure sometimes, even for me.  
                        Mr. Kane was a genius like he said.  
                        He had that funny sense of humor.  
                        Sometimes even I didn't get the 
                        joke.  Like that night the opera 
                        house of his opened in Chicago...  
                        You know, the opera house he built 
                        for Susie, she should be an opera 
                        singer...
                               (indicates with a 
                               little wave of his 
                               hand what he thinks 
                               of that; sighing)
                        That was years later, of course - 
                        1914 it was.  Mrs. Kane took the 
                        leading part in the opera, and she 
                        was terrible.  But nobody had the 
                        nerve to say so - not even the 
                        critics.  Mr. Kane was a big man 
                        in those days.  But this one fellow, 
                        this friend of his, Branford Leland -

          He leaves the sentence up in the air, as we

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CITY ROOM - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          It is late.  The room is almost empty.  Nobody is at work at 
          the desks.  Bernstein, fifty, is waiting anxiously with a little 
          group of Kane's hirelings, most of them in evening dress with 
          overcoats and hats.  Eveybody is tense and expectant.

                                    CITY EDITOR
                               (turns to a young 
                               hireling; quietly)
                        What about Branford Leland?  Has 
                        he got in his copy?

                                    HIRELING
                        Not yet.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Go in and ask him to hurry.

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein?
                        You know Mr. Leland.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (looks at him for a 
                               moment; then slowly)
                        I might make him nervous.

                                    CITY EDITOR
                               (after a pause)
                        You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you 
                        were great friends back in the old 
                        days, I understand.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (with a smile)
                        That's right.  They called us the 
                        "Three Musketeers."

          Somebody behind Bernstein has trouble concealing his laughter.  
          The City Editor speaks quickly to cover the situation.

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        He's a great guy - Leland.
                               (another little 
                               pause)
                        Why'd he ever leave New York?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (he isn't saying)
                        That's a long story.

                                    ANOTHER HIRELING
                               (a tactless one)
                        Wasn't there some sort of quarrel 
                        between -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (quickly)
                        I had nothing to do with it.
                               (then, somberly)
                        It was Leland and Mr. Kane, and 
                        you couldn't call it a quarrel 
                        exactly.  Better we should forget 
                        such things -
                               (turning to City 
                               Editor)
                        Leland is writing it up from the 
                        dramatic angle?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Yes.  I thought it was a good idea.
                        We've covered it from the news 
                        end, of course.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        And the social.  How about the 
                        music notice?  You got that in?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Oh, yes, it's already made up.  
                        Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Enthusiastic?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Yes, very!
                               (quietly)
                        Naturally.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Well, well - isn't that nice?

                                    KANE'S VOICE
                        Mr. Bernstein -

          Bernstein turns.

          Medium long shot of Kane, now forty-nine, already quite stout.  
          He is in white tie, wearing his overcoat and carrying a folded 
          opera hat.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Hello, Mr. Kane.

          The Hirelings rush, with Bernstein, to Kane's side.  Widespread, 
          half-suppressed sensation.

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!

                                    KANE
                        We've got a nice plant here.

          Everybody falls silent.  There isn't anything to say.

                                    KANE
                        Was the show covered by every 
                        department?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Exactly according to your 
                        instructions, Mr. Kane.  We've got 
                        two spreads of pictures.

                                    KANE
                               (very, very casually)
                        And the notice?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Yes - Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                               (quietly)
                        Is it good?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Yes, Mr. kane.

          Kane looks at him for a minute.

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        But there's another one still to 
                        come - the dramatic notice.

                                    KANE
                               (sharply)
                        It isn't finished?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        No, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        That's Leland, isn't it?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Yes, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        Has he said when he'll finish?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        We haven't heard from him.

                                    KANE
                        He used to work fast - didn't he, 
                        Mr. Bernstein?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        He sure did, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        Where is he?

                                    ANOTHER HIRELING
                        Right in there, Mr. Kane.

          The Hireling indicates the closed glass door of a little office 
          at the other end of the City Room.  Kane takes it in.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (helpless, but very 
                               concerned)
                        MR. KANE -

                                    KANE
                        That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.

          Kane crosses the length of the long City Room to the glass 
          door indicated before by the Hireling.  The City Editor looks 
          at Bernstein.  Kane opens the door and goes into the office, 
          closing the door behind him.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Leland and Mr. Kane - they haven't 
                        spoke together for ten years.
                               (long pause; finally)
                        Excuse me.
                               (starts toward the 
                               door)

          INT. LELAND'S OFFICE - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          Bernstein comes in.  An empty bottle is standing on Leland's 
          desk.  He has fallen over his typewriter, his face on the keys.  
          A sheet of paper is in the machine.  A paragraph has been typed.  
          Kane is standing at the other side of the desk looking down on 
          him.  This is the first time we see murder in Kane's face.  
          Bernstein looks at Kane, then crosses to Leland.  He shakes 
          him.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Hey, Brad!  Brad!
                               (he straightens, 
                               looks at Kane; 
                               pause)
                        He ain't been drinking before, Mr. 
                        Kane.  Never.  We would have heard.

                                    KANE
                               (finally; after a 
                               pause)
                        What does it say there?

          Bernstein stares at him.

                                    KANE
                        What's he written?

          Bernstein looks over nearsightedly, painfully reading the 
          paragraph written on the page.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (reading)
                        "Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty 
                        but hopelessly incompetent amateur -
                               (he waits for a 
                               minute to catch 
                               his breath; he 
                               doesn't like it)
                        - last night opened the new Chicago 
                        Opera House in a performance of - 
                        of -"
                               (looks up miserably)
                        I can't pronounce that name, Mr. 
                        Kane.

                                    KANE
                        Thais.

          Bernstein looks at Kane for a moment, then looks back, tortured.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (reading again)
                        "Her singing, happily, is no concern 
                        of this department.  Of her acting, 
                        it is absolutely impossible to..."
                               (he continues to 
                               stare at the page)

                                    KANE
                               (after a short 
                               silence)
                        Go on!

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (without looking up)
                        That's all there is.

          Kane snatches the paper from the roller and reads it for 
          himself.  Slowly, a queer look comes over his face.  Then he 
          speaks, very quietly.

                                    KANE
                        Of her acting, it is absolutely 
                        impossible to say anything except 
                        that it represents a new low...
                               (then sharply)
                        Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein?
                        In the opinion of this reviewer -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (miserably)
                        I didn't see that.

                        It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm 
                        dictating it.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (looks at him)
                        I can't take shorthand.

                                    KANE
                        Get me a typewriter.  I'll finish 
                        the notice.

          Bernstein retreats from the room.

          Bernstein speaking to Thompson.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        He finished it.  He wrote the worst 
                        notice I ever read about the girl 
                        he loved.  We ran it in every paper.

                                    THOMPSON
                               (after a pause)
                        I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so 
                        well of Susie's art anyway.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (looks at him very 
                               soberly)
                        He thought she was great, Mr. 
                        Thompson.  He really believed that.  
                        He put all his ambition on that 
                        girl.  After she came along, he 
                        never really cared for himself 
                        like he used to.  Oh, I don't
                        blame Susie -

                                    THOMPSON
                        Well, then, how could he write 
                        that roast?  The notices in the 
                        Kane papers were always very kind 
                        to her.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Oh, yes.  He saw to that.  I tell 
                        you, Mr. Thompson, he was a hard 
                        man to figure out.  He had that 
                        funny sense of humor.  And then, 
                        too, maybe he thought by finishing 
                        that piece he could show Leland he 
                        was an honest man.  You see, Leland 
                        didn't think so.  I guess he showed 
                        him all right.  He's a nice fellow, 
                        but he's a dreamer.  They were 
                        always together in those early 
                        days when we just started the 
                        Enquirer.

          On these last words, we

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CITY ROOM - ENQUIRER BUILDING - DAY -

          The front half of the second floor constitutes one large City 
          Room.  Despite the brilliant sunshine outside, very little of 
          it is actually getting into the room because the windows are 
          small and narrow.  There are about a dozen tables and desks, 
          of the old-fashioned type, not flat, available for reporters.  
          Two tables, on a raised platform at the end of the room, 
          obviously serve the city room executives.  To the left of the 
          platform is an open door which leads into the Sanctrum.

          As Kane and Leland enter the room, an elderly, stout gent on 
          the raised platform, strikes a bell and the other eight 
          occupants of the room - all men - rise and face the new 
          arrivals.  Carter, the elderly gent, in formal clothes, rises 
          and starts toward them.

                                    CARTER
                        Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the 
                        "Enquirer."  I am Herbert Carter.

                                    KANE
                        Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr.
                        Leland.

                                    CARTER
                               (bowing)
                        How do you do, Mr. Leland?

                                    KANE
                               (pointing to the 
                               standing reporters)
                        Are they standing for me?

                                    CARTER
                        I thought it would be a nice gesture
                        the new publisher -

                                    KANE
                               (grinning)
                        Ask them to sit down.

                                    CARTER
                        You may resume your work, gentlemen.
                               (to Kane)
                        I didn't know your plans and so I 
                        was unable to make any preparations.

                                    KANE
                        I don't my plans myself.

          They are following Carter to his raised platform.

                                    KANE
                        As a matter of fact, I haven't got 
                        any.  Except to get out a newspaper.

          There is a terrific crash at the doorway.  They all turn to 
          see Bernstein sprawled at the entrance.  A roll of bedding, a 
          suitcase, and two framed pictures were too much for him.

                                    KANE
                        Oh, Mr. Bernstein!

          Bernstein looks up.

                                    KANE
                        If you would come here a moment,
                        please, Mr. Bernstein?

          Bernstein rises and comes over, tidying himself as he comes.

                                    KANE
                        Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein.
                        Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.

                                    CARTER
                               (frigidly)
                        How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?

                                    KANE
                        You've got a private office here, 
                        haven't you?

          The delivery wagon driver has now appeared in the entrance 
          with parts of the bedstead and other furniture.  He is looking 
          about, a bit bewildered.

                                    CARTER
                               (indicating open 
                               door to left of 
                               platform)
                        My little sanctum is at your 
                        disposal.  But I don't think I 
                        understand -

                                    KANE
                        I'm going to live right here.
                               (reflectively)
                        As long as I have to.

                                    CARTER
                        But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane.
                        After all, we're practically closed 
                        twelve hours a day - except for 
                        the business offices -

                                    KANE
                        That's one of the things I think 
                        must be changed, Mr. Carter.  The 
                        news goes on for twenty-four hours 
                        a day.

          INT. KANE'S OFFICE - LATE DAY -

          Kane, in his shirt sleeves, at a roll-top desk in the Sanctum, 
          is working feverishly on copy and eating a very sizeable meal 
          at the same time.  Carter, still formally coated, is seated 
          alongside him.  Leland, seated in a corner, is looking on, 
          detached, amused.  The furniture has been pushed around and 
          Kane's effects are somewhat in place.  On a corner of the desk, 
          Bernstein is writing down figures.  No one pays any attention 
          to him.

                                    KANE
                        I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, 
                        but here's what I mean.  There's a 
                        front page story in the "Chronicle,"
                               (points to it)
                        and a picture - of a woman in 
                        Brooklyn who is missing.  Probably 
                        murdered.
                               (looks to make sure 
                               of the name)
                        A Mrs. Harry Silverstone.  Why 
                        didn't the "Enquirer" have that 
                        this morning?

                                    CARTER
                               (stiffly)
                        Because we're running a newspaper, 
                        Mr.  Kane, not a scandal sheet.

          Kane has finished eating.  He pushes away his plates.

                                    KANE
                        I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go 
                        to Rector's and get something 
                        decent.
                               (pointing to the 
                               "Chronicle" before 
                               him)
                        The "Chronicle" has a two-column 
                        headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't 
                        we?

                                    CARTER
                        There is no news big enough.

                                    KANE
                        If the headline is big enough, it 
                        makes the new big enough.  The 
                        murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -

                                    CARTER
                               (hotly)
                        As a matter of fact, we sent a man 
                        to the Silverstone home yesterday 
                        afternoon.
                               (triumphantly)
                        Our man even arrived before the 
                        "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's 
                        no proof that the woman was murdered -
                        or even that she's dead.

                                    KANE
                               (smiling a bit)
                        The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's 
                        murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the 
                        neighbors are getting suspicious.

                                    CARTER
                               (stiffly)
                        It's not our function to report 
                        the gossip of housewives.  If we 
                        were interested in that kind of 
                        thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the 
                        paper twice over daily -

                                    KANE
                               (gently)
                        That's the kind of thing we are 
                        going to be interested in from now 
                        on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish 
                        you'd send your best man up to see 
                        Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell 
                        Mr.  Silverstone if he doesn't 
                        produce his wife at once, the 
                        "Enquirer" will have him arrested.
                               (he gets an idea)
                        Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's 
                        a detective from the Central Office.
                        If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his 
                        badge, your man is to get indignant 
                        and call Mr. Silverstone an 
                        anarchist.

          Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.

                                    CARTER
                        Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the
                        function of a respectable newspaper -

          Kane isn't listening to him.

                                    KANE
                        Oh, Mr. Bernstein!

          Bernstein looks up from his figures.

                                    KANE
                        I've just made a shocking discovery.
                        The "Enquirer" is without a 
                        telephone.  Have two installed at 
                        once!

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        I ordered six already this morning!
                        Got a discount!

          Kane looks at Leland with a fond nod of his head at Bernstein.  
          Leland grins back.  Mr. Carter, meantime, has risen stiffly.

                                    CARTER
                        But, Mr. Kane -

                                    KANE
                        That'll be all today, Mr. Carter.
                        You've been most understanding.
                        Good day, Mr. Carter!

          Carter, with a look that runs just short of apoplexy, leaves 
          the room, closing the door behind him.

                                    LELAND
                        Poor Mr. Carter!

                                    KANE
                               (shakes his head)
                        What makes those fellows think 
                        that a newspaper is something rigid, 
                        something inflexible, that people
                        are supposed to pay two cents for -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (without looking up)
                        Three cents.

                                    KANE
                               (calmly)
                        Two cents.

          Bernstein lifts his head and looks at Kane.  Kane gazes back 
          at him.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (tapping on the 
                               paper)
                        This is all figured at three cents 
                        a copy.

                                    KANE
                        Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at 
                        two cents.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (sighs and puts 
                               papers in his pocket)
                        All right, but I'll keep these 
                        figures, too, just in case.

                                    KANE
                        Ready for dinner, Brad?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Mr. Leland, if Mr. Kane, he should 
                        decide to drop the price to one 
                        cent, or maybe even he should make 
                        up his mind to give the paper away 
                        with a half-pound of tea - you'll 
                        just hold him until I get back, 
                        won't you?

                                    LELAND
                        I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr.
                        Bernstein.  You people work too 
                        fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Who said anything about brooms?

                                    KANE
                        It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein.  A 
                        new broom sweeps clean.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Oh!

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT.PRIMITIVE COMPOSING AND PRESSROOM - NEW YORK ENQUIRER - 
          NIGHT -

          The ground floor witht he windows on the street - of the 
          "Enquirer."  It is almost midnight by an old-fashioned clock 
          on the wall.  Grouped around a large table, on which are several 
          locked forms of type, very old-fashioned of course, but true 
          to the period - are Kane and Leland in elegant evening clothes, 
          Bernstein, unchanged from the afternoon, and Smathers, the 
          composing room foreman, nervous and harassed.

                                    SMATHERS
                        But it's impossible, Mr. Kane.  We 
                        can't remake these pages.

                                    KANE
                        These pages aren't made up as I 
                        want them, Mr. Smathers.  We go to 
                        press in five minutes.

                                    CARTER
                               (about to crack up)
                        The "Enquirer" has an old and 
                        honored tradition, Mr. Kane...  
                        The "Enquirer" is not in competition 
                        with those other rags.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        We should be publishing such rags,
                        that's all I wish.  Why, the 
                        "Enquirer" - I wouldn't wrap up 
                        the liver for the cat in the 
                        "Enquirer" -

                                    CARTER
                               (enraged)
                        Mr. Kane, I must ask you to see to 
                        it that this - this person learns 
                        to control his tongue.

          Kane looks up.

                                    CARTER
                        I've been a newspaperman my whole 
                        life and I don't intend -
                               (he starts to sputter)
                        - if it's your intention that I 
                        should continue to be harassed by 
                        this - this -
                               (he's really sore)
                        I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go 
                        against my grain to desert you 
                        when you need me so badly - but I 
                        would feel obliged to ask that my 
                        resignation be accepted.

                                    KANE
                        It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with 
                        assurances of my deepest regard.

                                    CARTER
                        But Mr. Kane, I meant -

          Kane turns his back on him, speaks again to the composing room 
          foreman.

                                    KANE
                               (quietly)
                        Let's remake these pages, Mr. 
                        Smathers.  We'll have to publish a 
                        half hour late, that's all.

                                    SMATHERS
                               (as though Kane 
                               were talking Greek)
                        We can't remake them, Mr. Kane.  
                        We go to press in five minutes.

          Kane sighs, unperturbed, as he reaches out his hand and shoves 
          the forms off the table onto the floor, where they scatter 
          into hundreds of bits.

                                    KANE
                        You can remake them now, can't 
                        you, Mr. Smathers?

          Smather's mouth opens wider and wider.  Bradford and Bernstein 
          are grinning.

                                    KANE
                        After the types 've been reset and 
                        the pages have been remade according 
                        to the way I told you before, Mr.
                        Smathers, kindly have proofs pulled 
                        and bring them to me.  Then, if I 
                        can't find any way to improve them
                        again -
                               (almost as if 
                               reluctantly)
                        - I suppose we'll have to go to 
                        press.

          He starts out of the room, followed by Leland.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (to Smathers)
                        In case you don't understand, Mr.
                        Smathers - he's a new broom.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - VERY EARLY DAWN -

          The picture is mainly occupied by a large building, on the 
          roof of which the lights spell out the word "Enquirer" against 
          the sunrise.  We do not see the street or the first few stories 
          of this building, the windows of which would be certainly 
          illuminated.  What we do see is the floor on which is located 
          the City Room.  Over this scene, newboys are heard selling the 
          Chronicle, their voices growing in volume.

          As the dissolve complete itself, camera moves toward the one 
          lighted window - the window of the Sanctrum.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. KANE'S OFFICE - VERY EARLY DAWN -

          The newsboys are still heard from the street below - fainter 
          but very insistent.

          Kane's office is gas-lit, of course, as is the rest of the 
          Enquirer building.

          Kane, in his shirt sleeves, stands at the open window looking 
          out.  The bed is already made up.  On it is seated Bernstein, 
          smoking the end of a cigar.  Leland is in a chair.

                                    NEWSBOYS' VOICES
                        CHRONICLE!  CHRONICLE!  H'YA - THE 
                        CHRONICLE - GET YA!  CHRONICLE!

          Kane, taking a deep breath of the morning air, closes the window 
          and turns to the others.  The voices of the newsboys, naturally, 
          are very much fainter after this.

                                    LELAND
                        We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - 
                        another ten minutes.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (looking at his 
                               watch)
                        It's three hours and fifty minutes
                        late - but we did it -

          Leland rises from the chair, stretching painfully.

                                    KANE
                        Tired?

                                    LELAND
                        It's been a tough day.

                                    KANE
                        A wasted day.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (looking up)
                        Wasted?

                                    LELAND
                               (incredulously)
                        Charlie?!

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        You just made the paper over four
                        times today, Mr. Kane.  That's all -

                                    KANE
                        I've changed the front page a 
                        little, Mr. Bernstein.  That's not 
                        enough - There's something I've 
                        got to get into this paper besides 
                        pictures and print -  I've got to 
                        make the "New York Enquirer" as 
                        important to New York as the gas 
                        in that light.

                                    LELAND
                               (quietly)
                        What're you going to do, Charlie?

          Kane looks at him for a minute with a queer smile of happy 
          concentration.

                                    KANE
                        My Declaration of Principles -
                               (he says it with 
                               quotes around it)
                        Don't smile, Brad -
                               (getting the idea)
                        Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -

                                    KANE
                        I'll write it myself.

          Kane grabs a piece of rough paper and a grease crayon.  Sitting 
          down on the bed next to Bernstein, he starts to write.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (looking over his 
                               shoulder)
                        You don't wanta make any promises, 
                        Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.

                                    KANE
                               (as he writes)
                        These'll be kept.
                               (stops for a minute 
                               and reads what he 
                               has written; reading)
                        I'll provide the people of this 
                        city with a daily paper that will 
                        tell all the news honestly.
                               (starts to write 
                               again; reading as 
                               he writes)
                        will also provide them -

                                    LELAND
                        That's the second sentence you've
                        started with "I" -

                                    KANE
                               (looking up)
                        People are going to know who's 
                        responsible.  And they're going to
                        get the news - the true news -
                        quickly and simply and 
                        entertainingly.
                               (he speaks with 
                               real conviction)
                        And no special interests will be 
                        allowed to interfere with the truth 
                        of that news.

          He looks at Leland for a minute and goes back to his writing, 
          reading as he writes.

          Bernstein has risen and crossed to one side of Kane.  They 
          both stand looking out.  Leland joins him on the other side.  
          Their three heads are silhouetted against the sky.  Leland's 
          head is seen to turn slightly as he looks into Kane's face - 
          camera very close on this - Kane turns to him and we know their 
          eyes have met, although their faces are almost in sillhouette.  
          Bernstein is still smoking a cigar.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Front page of the "Enquirer" shows big boxed editorial with 
          heading:

          MY PRINCIPLES - A DECLARATION BY CHARLES FOSTER KANE

          Camera continues pulling back and shows newspaper to be on the 
          top of a pile of newspapers.  As we draw further back, we see 
          four piles, and as camera contines to pull back, we see six 
          piles and go on back until we see a big field of "Enquirers" - 
          piles of "Enquirers" - all 26,000 copies ready for distribution.

          A wagon with a huge sign on its side reading

          "ENQUIRER - CIRCULATION 26,000"

          passes through foreground, and we wipe to:

          A pile of "Enquirers" for sale on a broken down wooden box on 
          a street corner, obviously a poor district.  A couple of coins 
          fall on the pile.

          The stoop of a period door with old-fashioned enamel milk can 
          and a bag of rolls.  Across the sidewalk before this, moves 
          the shadow of an old-fashioned bicycle with an enormous front 
          wheel.  A copy of the "Enquirer" is tossed on the stoop.

          A breakfast table - beautiful linen and beautiful silver - 
          everything very expensive, gleaming in the sunshine.  Into a 
          silver newspaper rack there is slipped a copy of the "Enquirer".  
          Here, as before, the boxed editorial reading MY PRINCIPLES - A 
          DECLARATION BY CHARLES FOSTER KANE, is very prominent on the 
          front page.

          The wooden floor of a railroad station, flashing light and 
          dark as a train behind the camera rushes by.  On the floor, 
          there is tossed a bound bundle of the "New York Enquirer" - 
          the Declaration of Principles still prominent.

          Rural Delivery - a copy of the "Enquirer"s being put into bins, 
          showing state distribution.

          The railroad platform again.  We stay here for four images.  
          On each image, the speed of the train is faster and the piles 
          of the "Enquirer" are larger.  On the first image, we move in 
          to hold on the words "CIRCULATION - 31,000."  We are this close 
          for the next pile which reads 40,000; the next one which reads 
          55,000, and the last which is 62,000.  In each instance, the 
          bundles of newspapers are thicker and the speed of the moving 
          train behind the camera is increased.

          The entire montage above indicated is accompanied by a 
          descriptive complement of sound - the traffic noises of New 
          York in the 1890's; wheels on cobblestones and horses' hooves; 
          bicycle bells; the mooning of cattle and the crowing of roosters 
          (in the RFD shot), and in all cases where the railroad platform 
          is used - the mounting sound of the railroad train.

          The last figure "62,000" opposite the word "CIRCULATION" on 
          the "Enquirer" masthead changes to:

          EXT. STREET AND CHRONICLE BUIDING - DAY -

          Angle up to wall of building - a painter on a cradle is putting 
          the last zero to the figure "62,000" on an enormous sign 
          advertising the "Enquirer."  It reads:

          THE ENQUIRER  THE PEOPLE'S NEWSPAPER  CIRCULATION 62,000

          Camera travels down side of building - takes in another building 
          on which there is a sign which reads:

          READ THE ENQUIRER  AMERICA'S FINEST  CIRCULATION 62,000

          Camera continues to travel down to sidewalk in front of the 
          Chronicle office.  The Chronicle office has a plateglass window 
          in which is reflected traffic moving up and down the street, 
          also the figures of Kane, Leland and Bernstein, who are munching 
          peanuts.

          Inside the window, almost filling it, is a large photograph of 
          the "Chronicle" staff, with Reilly prominently seated in the 
          center.  A sign over the photo reads: EDITORIAL AND EXECUTIVE 
          STAFF OF THE NEW YORK CHRONICLE.  A sign beneath it reads: 
          GREATEST NEWSPAPER STAFF IN THE WORLD.  The sign also includes 
          the "Chronicle" circulation figure.  There are nine men in the 
          photo.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (looking up at the 
                               sign - happily)
                        Sixty-two thousand -

                                    LELAND
                        That looks pretty nice.

                                    KANE
                               (indicating the 
                               Chronicle Building)
                        Let's hope they like it there.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        From the Chronicle Building that 
                        sign is the biggest thing you can 
                        see - every floor guaranteed - 
                        let's hope it bothers them - it 
                        cost us enough.

                                    KANE
                               (pointing to the 
                               sign over the 
                               photograph in the 
                               window)
                        Look at that.

                                    LELAND
                        The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.

                                    KANE
                        It's a good idea for a newspaper.
                               (reading the figures)
                        Four hundred sixy thousand.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Say, with them fellows -
                               (referring to the 
                               photo)
                        - it's no trick to get circulation.

                                    KANE
                        You're right, Mr. Bernstein.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (sighs)
                        You know how long it took the 
                        "Chronicle" to get that staff 
                        together?  Twenty years.

                                    KANE
                        I know.

          Kane, smiling, lights a cigarette, at the same time looking 
          into the window.  Camera moves in to hold on the photograph of 
          nine men, still holding the reflection of Kane's smiling face.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CITY ROOM - THE ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          Nine men, arrayed as in the photograph, but with Kane beaming 
          in the center of the first row.  The men, variously with 
          mustaches, beards, bald heads, etc. are easily identified as 
          being the same men, Reilly prominent amongst them.

          As camera pulls back, it is revealed that they are being 
          photographed - by an old-type professional photographer, big 
          box, black hood and all - in a corner of the room.  It is 1:30 
          at night.  Desks, etc. have been pushed against the wall.  
          Running down the center of the room is a long banquet table, 
          at which twenty diners have finished their meals.  The eleven 
          remaining at their seats - these include Bernstein and Leland - 
          are amusedly watching the photographic ceremonies.

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        That's all.  Thank you.

          The photographic subjects rise.

                                    KANE
                               (a sudden thought)
                        Make up an extra copy and mail it 
                        to the "Chronicle."

          Chuckling and beaming, he makes his way to his place at the 
          head of the table.  The others have already sat down.  Kane 
          gets his guests' attention by rapping on the table with a knife.

                                    KANE
                        Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This 
                        has, I think, been a fitting welcome
                        to those distinguished journalists -
                               (indicates the eight 
                               men)
                        Mr. Reilly in particular - who are 
                        the latest additions to our ranks.
                        It will make them happy to learn 
                        that the "Enquirer's" circulation 
                        this morning passed the two hundred 
                        thousand mark.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Two hundred and one thousand, six 
                        hundred and forty-seven.

          General applause.

                                    KANE
                        All of you - new and old -  You're 
                        all getting the best salaries in 
                        town.  Not one of you has been 
                        hired because of his loyalty.  
                        It's your talent I'm interested 
                        in.  That talent that's going to 
                        make the "Enquirer" the kind of 
                        paper I want - the best newspaper 
                        in the world!

          Applause.

                                    KANE
                        However, I think you'll agree we've 
                        heard enough about newspapers and 
                        the newspaper business for one 
                        night.  There are other subjects 
                        in the world.

          He puts his two fingers in his mouth and lets out a shrill 
          whistle.  This is a signal.  A band strikes up a lively ditty 
          of the period and enters in advance a regiment of very 
          magnificent maidens, as daringly arrayed as possible in the 
          chorus costumes of the day.  The rest of this episode will be 
          planned and staged later.  Its essence is that Kane is just a 
          healthy and happy young man having a wonderful time.

          As some of the girls are detached from the line and made into 
          partners for individual dancing -

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          THE "ENQUIRER" SIGN:  THE ENQUIRER  AMERICA'S FINEST  
          CIRCULATION 274,321

          Dissolve just completes itself - the image of Kane dancing 
          with a girl on each arm just disappears as camera pans down 
          off the Temple Bldg. in the same action as the previous street 
          scene.  There is a new sign on the side of the building below.  
          It reads:

          READ THE ENQUIRER GREATEST STAFF IN THE WORLD

          Camera continues panning as we

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          A montage of various scenes, between the years 1891-1900.

          The scenes indicate the growth of the "Enquirer" under the 
          impulse of Kane's personal drive.  Kane is shown, thus, at 
          various activities:

          Move down from the sign: READ THE ENQUIRER  GREATEST STAFF IN 
          THE WORLD to street in front of saloon with parade passing 
          (boys going off to the Spanish-American War)-  A torchlight 
          parade with the torches reflected in the glass window of the 
          saloon - the sound of brass band playing "It's a Hot Time."  
          In the window of the saloon is a large sign or poster "REMEMBER 
          THE MAINE"

          INSERT:  Remington drawing of American boys, similar to the 
          parade above, in which "Our Boys" in the expeditionary hats 
          are seen marching off to war.

          Back of observation car.  Shot of Kane congratulating Teddy 
          Roosevelt (the same shot as in the News Digest - without 
          flickering).

          The wooden floor of the railroad platform again - a bundle of 
          "Enquirers" - this time an enormous bundle - is thrown down, 
          and the moving shadows of the train behind the camera indicate 
          that it is going like a bat out of hell.  A reproduction of 
          Kane and Teddy shaking hands as above is very prominent in the 
          frame and almost hogs the entire front page.  The headline 
          indicates the surrender of Cuba.

          INT. ENQUIRER OFFICE

          Cartoon, highly dramatic and very involved as to content - 
          lousy with captions, labels, and symbolic figures, the most 
          gruesome and recognizable - "Capitalistic Greed."  This cartoon 
          is almost finished and is on a drawing board before which stand 
          Kane and the artist himself.  Kane is grinning over some 
          suggestion he has made.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          The cartoon finished and reproduced on the editorial page of 
          the "Enquirer" - in quite close, with an editorial and several 
          faces of caps shown underneath.  The entire newspaper is crushed 
          with an angry gesture and thrown down into an expensive-looking 
          wastebasket (which is primarily for ticker tape) tape is 
          pouring.

          INT. ENQUIRER OFFICE

          Cartoonist and Kane working on comic strip of "Johnny the Monk."

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Floor of room -  Two kids on floor, with newspaper spread out, 
          looking at the same comic strip.

          Kane's photographic gallery with photographers, stooges, and 
          Kane himself in attendance on a very hot-looking item of the 
          period.  A sob sister is interviewing this hot number and Kane 
          is arranging her dress to look more seductive.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          The hot number reproduced and prominently displayed and covering 
          almost half a page of the "Enquirer."  It is being read in a 
          barber shop and is seen in an over-shoulder shot of the man 
          who is reading it.  He is getting a shine, a manicure, and a 
          haircut.  The sob-sister caption over the photograph reveals: 
          "I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING, SAYS DANCER.  EVERYTHING WENT 
          RED."  An oval photograph of the gun is included in the lay-
          out of the pretty lady with a headline which says: "DEATH GUN."

          STREET - SHOT OF BUCKET BRIGADE

          Shot of Kane, in evening clothes, in obvious position of danger, 
          grabbing camera from photographer.  Before him rages a terrific 
          tenement fire.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Final shot of a new horse-drawn steam engine roaring around a 
          street corner (Stock).

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          A black pattern of iron bars.  We are in a prison cell.  The 
          door is opened and a condemned man, with priest, warden and 
          the usual attendants, moves into foreground and starts up the 
          hall past a group which includes phtographers, Kane's sob-
          sister, and Kane.  The photographers take pictures with a mighty 
          flash of old-fashioned flash powder.  The condemned man in the 
          foreground (in silhouette) is startled by this.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          A copy of the "Enquirer" spread out on a table.  A big lay-out 
          of the execution story includes the killer as photographed by 
          Kane's photographers, and nearby on the other page there is a 
          large picture of the new steam fire engine (made from the stock 
          shot) with a headline indicating that the "Enquirer" has won 
          its campaign for better equipment.  A cup of coffee and a 
          doughnut are on the newspaper, and a servant girl - over whose 
          shoulder we see the paper - is stirring the coffee.

          The Beaux Art Ball.  A number of elderly swells are jammed 
          into a hallway.  Servants suddenly divest them of their furs, 
          overcoats and wraps, revealing them to be in fancy dress 
          costume, pink fleshings, etc., the effect to be very surprising, 
          very lavish and very very ridiculous.  We see, among others, 
          Mr. Thatcher himself (as Ben Hur) ribbon around, his bald head 
          and all.  At the conclusion of this tableau, the image freezes 
          and we pull back to show it reproduced on the society page of 
          the "New York Enquirer."

          Over the "Enquirer"'s pictorial version of the Beaux Art Ball 
          is thrown a huge fish - then coffee grounds - altogether a 
          pretty repulsive sight.

          The whole thing is bundled up and thrown into a garbage can.

          Extreme close-up of the words: "OCCUPATION - JOUNALIST."

          Camera pulls back to show passport open to the photograph page 
          which shows Kane, registering birth, race, and nationality.  
          Passport cover is closed, showing it to be an American passport.

          EXT. CUNARD DOCKS - GANGPLANK AND DECK OF BOAT - NIGHT -

          As camera pulls back over shoulder of official, taking in Kane, 
          Leland, and Bernstein, we see the bustle and noise of departing 
          ocean liner.  Behind the principles can be seen an enormous 
          plain sign which reads: "FIRST CLASS."  From offstage can be 
          heard the steward's cry, indispensable in any Mercury 
          production, the old familiar cry, "All Ashore That's Going 
          Ashore!" - gongs, also blasts of the great whistle and all the 
          rest of it.

                                    THE OFFICIAL
                        There you are, Mr. Kane.  Everything 
                        in order.

                                    KANE
                        Thank you.

          Kane and Leland and Bernstein start up the gangplank.

                                    THE OFFICIAL
                               (calling)
                        Have a good rest, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        Thanks.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        But please, Mr. Kane, don't buy 
                        any more paintings.  Nine Venuses 
                        already we got, twenty-six Virgins - 
                        two whole warehouses full of stuff -

                                    KANE
                        I promise not to bring any more 
                        Venuses and not to worry - and not 
                        to try to get in touch with any of
                        the papers -

                                    STEWARD'S VOICE
                        All ashore!

                                    KANE
                        - and to forget about the new 
                        feature sections - and not to try 
                        to think up and ideas for comic 
                        sections.

                                    STEWARD'S VOICE
                        All ashore that's going ashore!

          Kane leaves Leland and Bernstein midway up gangplank, as he 
          rushes up to it, calling back with a wave:

                                    KANE
                        Goodbye, gents!
                               (at the top of the 
                               gangplank, he turns 
                               and calls down)
                        Hey!

                                    KANE
                               (calling down to 
                               them)
                        You don't expect me to keep any of 
                        those promises, do you?

          A band on deck strikes up "Auld Lang Syne."  Bernstein and 
          Leland turn to each other.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Do you, Mr. Leland?

                                    LELAND
                               (smiling)
                        Certainly not.

          They start down the gangplank together.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          LONG SHOT OF THE ENQUIRER BUILDING - NIGHT

          The pattern of telegraph wires, dripping with rain, through 
          which we see the same old building but now rendered fairly 
          remarkable by tremendous outline sign in gold which reads "THE 
          NEW YORK DAILY ENQUIRER."  A couple of lights show in the 
          building.  We start toward the window where the lights show, 
          as we -

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          EXT. OUTSIDE THE WINDOW AT BERNSTEIN'S DESK - NIGHT

          The light in the window in the former shot was showing behind 
          the letter "E" of the Enquirer sign.  Now the letter "E" is 
          even larger than the frame of the camera.  Rain drips 
          disconsolately off the middle part of the figure.  We see 
          through this and through the drizzle of the window to 
          Bernstein's desk where he sits working under a blue shaded 
          light.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          Same setup as before except that it is now late afternoon and 
          late in the winter of the year.  The outline "E" is hung with 
          icicles which are melting, dripping despairingly between us 
          and Mr. Bernstein, still seated at his desk - still working.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Same setup as before except that it is spring.  Instead of the 
          sad sounds of dripping rain or dripping icicles, we hear the 
          melancholy cry of a hurdy-gurdy in the street below.  It is 
          spring and through the letter "E" we can see Bernstein working 
          at his desk.  Pigeons are gathering on the "E" and on the sill.  
          Bernstein looks up and sees them.  He takes some crumbs from 
          his little homemade lunch which is spread out on the desk before 
          him, carries them to the windows and feeds the pigeons, looking 
          moodily out on the prospect of spring on Park Row.  The birds 
          eat the crumbs - the hurdy-gurdy continues to play.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          The same setup again, it is now summer.  The window was half-
          open before .. now it's open all the way and Bernstein has 
          gone so far as to take off his coat.  His shirt and his 
          celluloid collar are wringing wet.  Camera moves toward the 
          window to tighten on Bernstein and to take in the City Room 
          behind him, which is absolutely deserted.  It is clear that 
          there is almost nothing more for Bernstein to do.  The hurdy-
          gurdy in the street is playing as before, but a new tune.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          A beach on Coney Island.

          Bernstein in a rented period bathing suit sits alone in the 
          sand, reading a copy of the "Enquirer."

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          INT. CITY ROOM - ENQUIRER BUILDING - DAY -

          The whole floor is now a City Room.  It is twice its former 
          size, yet not too large for all the desks and the people using 
          them.  The windows have been enlarged, providing a good deal 
          more light and air.  A wall calendar says September 9th.

          Kane and Bernstein enter and stand in the entrance a moment.  
          Kane, who really did look a bit peaked before, is now clear-
          eyed and tanned.  He is wearing new English clothes.  As they 
          come into the room, Bernstein practically walking sideways, is 
          doing nothing but beaming and admiring Kane, quelling like a 
          mother at the Carnegie Hall debut of her son.  Seeing and 
          recognizing Kane, the entire staff rises to its feet.

                                    KANE
                               (referring to the 
                               staff; with a smile)
                        Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Sit down, everybody - for heaven's 
                        sake!

          The order is immediately obeyed, everybody going into business 
          of feverish activity.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        So then, tonight, we go over 
                        everything thoroughly, eh?  
                        Especially the new papers -

                                    KANE
                        We certainly do.  Vacation's over -
                        starting right after dinner.  But
                        right now - that lady over there -
                               (he indicates a 
                               woman at the desk)
                        - that's the new society editor, I 
                        take it?  You think I could 
                        interrupt her a moment, Mr. 
                        Bernstein?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Huh?  Oh, I forgot - you've been 
                        away so long I forgot about your
                        joking -

          He trails after Kane as he approaches the Society Editor's 
          desk.  The Society Editor, a middle-aged spinster, sees him 
          approaching and starts to quake all over, but tries to pretend 
          she isn't aware of him.  An envelope in her hand shakes 
          violently.  Kane and Bernstein stop at her desk.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Miss Townsend -

          Miss Townsend looks up and is so surprised to see Bernstein 
          with a stranger.

                                    MISS TOWNSEND
                        Good afternoon, Mr. Bernstein.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        This is Mr. Kane, Miss Townsend.

          Miss Townsend can't stick to her plan.  She starts to rise, 
          but her legs are none too good under her.  She knocks over a 
          tray of copy paper as she rises, and bends to pick it up.

                                    KANE
                               (very hesitatingly 
                               and very softly)
                        Miss Townsend -

          At the sound of his voice, she straightens up.  She is very 
          close to death from excitement.

                                    KANE
                        I've been away for several months, 
                        and I don't know exactly how these 
                        things are handled now.  But one 
                        thing I wanted to be sure of is 
                        that you won't treat this little 
                        announcement any differently than 
                        you would any other similar 
                        announcement.

          He hands her an envelope.  She has difficulty in holding on to 
          it.

                                    KANE
                               (gently)
                        Read it, Miss Townsend.  And 
                        remember - just the regular 
                        treatment!  See you at nine o'clock, 
                        Mr. Bernstein!

          Kane leaves.  Bernstein looks after him, then at the paper.  
          Miss Townsend finally manages to open the envelope.  A piece 
          of flimsy paper, with a few written lines, is her reward.

                                    MISS TOWNSEND
                               (reading)
                        Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Moore Norton 
                        announce the engagement of their 
                        daughter, Emily Monroe Norton, to 
                        Mr.  Charles Foster Kane.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (starts to read it)
                        Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Moore Norton
                        announce -

                                    MISS TOWNSEND
                               (fluttering - on 
                               top of him)
                        She's - she's the niece of - of 
                        the President of the United States -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (nodding proudly)
                        know.  Come on, Miss Townsend -
                        From the window, maybe we can get 
                        a look.

          He takes her by the hand and leads her off.

          Angle toward open window.  Bernstein and Miss Townsend, backs 
          to camera, rushing to the window.

          EXT. STREET OUTSIDE ENQUIRER BUILDING - DAY -

          High angle downward - what Bernstein and Miss Townsend see 
          from the window.

          Kane is just stepping into an elegant barouch, drawn up at the 
          curb, in which sits Miss Emily Norton.  He kisses her full on 
          the lips before he sits down.  She acts a bit taken aback, 
          because of the public nature of the scene, but she isn't really 
          annoyed.  As the barouche starts off, she is looking at him 
          adoringly.  He, however, has turned his head and is looking 
          adoringly at the "Enquirer."  He apparently sees Bernstein and 
          Miss Townsed and waves his hand.

          INT. CITY ROOM - ENQUIRER - DAY -

          Bernstein and Miss Townsend at window.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        A girl like that, believe me, she's 
                        lucky!  Presiden't niece, huh!  
                        Say, before he's through, she'll 
                        be a Presiden't wife.

          Miss Townsend is now dewey-eyed.  She looks at Bernstein, who 
          has turned away, gazing down at the departing couple.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Front page of the "Enquirer."  Large picture of the young couple - 
          Kane and Emily - occupying four columns - very happy.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. BERNSTEIN'S OFFICE - ENQUIRER - DAY -

          Bernstein and Thompson.  As the dissolve comes, Bernstein's 
          voice is heard.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        The way things turned out, I don't 
                        need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton 
                        was no rosebud!

                                    THOMPSON
                        It didn't end very well, did it?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (shaking his head)
                        It ended -
                               (a slight pause)
                        Then there was Susie - that ended, 
                        too.
                               (shrugs, a pause; 
                               then looking up 
                               into Thompson's 
                               eyes)
                        guess he didn't make her very happy -

                                    (A PAUSE)
                        You know, I was thinking - that 
                        Rosebud you're trying to find out 
                        about -

                                    THOMPSON
                        Yes -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Maybe that was something he lost.  
                        Mr. Kane was a man that lost - 
                        almost everything he had -
                               (a pause)
                        You ought to talk to Bradford 
                        Leland.  He could tell you a lot.  
                        I wish I could tell you where Leland 
                        is, but I don't know myself.  He 
                        may be out of town somewhere - he 
                        may be dead.

                                    THOMPSON
                        In case you'd like to know, Mr.
                        Bernstein, he's at the Huntington 
                        Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        You don't say!  Why I had no idea -

                                    THOMPSON
                        Nothing particular the matter with
                        him, they tell me.  Just -
                               (controls himself)

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Just old age.
                               (smiles sadly)
                        It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson, 
                        you don't look forward to being 
                        cured of.
                               (pauses)
                        You ought to see Mr. Leland.  
                        There's a whole lot of things he 
                        could tell you - if he wanted to.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:

          EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF - DAY -

          Close shot - Thompson.  He is tilted back in a chair which 
          seems to be, and is, leaning against a chimney.  Leland's voice 
          is heard for a few moments before Leland is seen.

                                    LELAND'S VOICE
                        When you get to my age, young man, 
                        you don't miss anything.  Unless 
                        maybe it's a good drink of bourbon.
                        Even that doesn't make much 
                        difference, if you remember there 
                        hasn't been any good bourbon in 
                        this country for twenty years.

          Camera has pulled back, during above speech, revealing that 
          Leland, wrapped in a blanket, is in a wheel chair, talking to 
          Thompson.  They are on the flat roof of a hospital.  Other 
          people in wheel chairs can be seen in the background, along 
          with a nurse or two.  They are all sunning themselves.

                                    THOMPSON
                        Mr. Leland, you were -

                                    LELAND
                        You don't happen to have a cigar, 
                        do you?  I've got a young physician - 
                        must remember to ask to see his 
                        license - the odds are a hundred 
                        to one he hasn't got one - who 
                        thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  
                        I changed the subject, didn't I?  
                        Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable 
                        old man I've become.  You want to 
                        know what I think of Charlie Kane?  
                        Well - I suppose he has some private 
                        sort of greatness.  But he kept it 
                        to himself.
                               (grinning)
                        He never - gave himself away -  He
                        never gave anything away.  He just -
                        left you a tip.  He had a generous 
                        mind.  I don't suppose anybody 
                        ever had so many opinions.  That 
                        was because he had the power to 
                        express them, and Charlie lived on 
                        power and the excitement of using 
                        it -  But he didn't believe in
                        anything except Charlie Kane.  He 
                        never had a conviction in his life.  
                        I guess he died without one -  
                        That must have been pretty 
                        unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of 
                        us check out with no special 
                        conviction about death.  But we do 
                        know what we're leaving ... we 
                        believe in something.
                               (looks sharply at 
                               Thompson)
                        You're absolutely sure you haven't 
                        got a cigar?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Sorry, Mr. Leland.

                                    LELAND
                        Never mind -  Bernstein told you 
                        about the first days at the office, 
                        didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a 
                        bad newspaper man even then.  He 
                        entertained his readers, but he 
                        never told them the truth.

                                    THOMPSON
                        Maybe you could remember something
                        that -

                                    LELAND
                        I can remember everything.  That's 
                        my curse, young man.  It's the 
                        greatest curse that's ever been 
                        inflicted on the human race.  Memory -  
                        I was his oldest friend.
                               (slowly)
                        As far as I was concerned, he 
                        behaved like swine.  Maybe I wasnt' 
                        his friend.  If I wasn't, he never 
                        had one.  Maybe I was what nowadays
                        you call a stooge -

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          INT. CITY ROOM - THE ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          The party (previously shown in the Bernstein sequence).

          We start this sequence toward the end of the former one, but 
          from a fresh angle, holding on Leland, who is at the end of 
          the table.  Kane is heard off, making a speech.

                                    KANE'S VOICE
                        Not one of you has been hired 
                        because of his loyalty.  It's your 
                        talent I'm interested in.  That 
                        talent that's going to make the 
                        "Enquirer" the kind of paper I 
                        want - the best newspaper in the 
                        world!

          Applause.  During above, Bernstein has come to Leland's side.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party!

                                    LELAND
                        Yes.

          His tone causes Bernstein to look at him.

                                    KANE'S VOICE
                        However, I think you'll agree we've 
                        heard enough about newspapers and 
                        the newspaper business for one 
                        night.

          The above speeches are heard under the following dialogue.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (to Leland)
                        What's the matter?

                                    LELAND
                        Mr. Bernstein, these men who are 
                        now with the "Enquirer" - who were 
                        with the "Chronicle" until yesterday -
                        weren't they just as devoted to 
                        the "Chronicle" kind of paper as 
                        they are now to - our kind of paper?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Sure.  They're like anybody else.
                        They got work to do.  They do it.
                               (proudly)
                        Only they happen to be the best 
                        men in the business.

                                    KANE
                               (finishing his speech)
                        There are other subjects in the 
                        world -

          Kane whistles.  The band and the chorus girls enter and hell 
          breaks loose all around Leland and Bernstein.

                                    LELAND
                               (after a minute)
                        Do we stand for the same things 
                        that the "Chronicle" stands for, 
                        Mr. Bernstein?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (indignantly)
                        Certainly not.  So what's that got 
                        to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll 
                        have them changed to his kind of 
                        newspapermen in a week.

                                    LELAND
                        Probably.  There's always a chance, 
                        of course, that they'll change Mr.
                        Kane - without his knowing it.

          Kane has come up to Leland and Bernstein.  He sits down next 
          to them, lighting a cigarette.

                                    KANE
                        Well, gentlemen, are we going to 
                        war?

                                    LELAND
                        Our readers are, anyway, I don't 
                        know about the rest of the country.

                                    KANE
                               (enthusiastically)
                        It'll be our first foreign war in 
                        fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it 
                        the way the "Hickville Gazette" 
                        covers the church social!  The 
                        names of everybody there; what 
                        they wore; what they ate; who won 
                        the prizes; who gave the prizes -
                               (gets excited)
                        I tell you, Brad, I envy you.
                               (quoting)
                        By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's"
                        Special Correspondent at the Front.
                        I'm almost tempted -

                                    LELAND
                        But there is no Front, Charlie.
                        There's a very doubtful civil war.
                        Besides, I don't want the job.

                                    KANE
                        All right, Brad, all right - you 
                        don't have to be a war correspondent 
                        unless you want to - I'd want to.
                               (looking up)
                        Hello, Georgie.

          Georgie, a very handsome madam has walked into the picture, 
          stands behind him.  She leans over and speaks quietly in his 
          ear.

                                    GEORGIE
                        Is everything the way you want it, 
                        dear?

                                    KANE
                               (looking around)
                        If everybody's having fun, that's 
                        the way I want it.

                                    GEORGIE
                        I've got some other little girls
                        coming over -

                               (interrupting)
                        Charles, I tell you there is no 
                        war!  There's a condition that 
                        should be remedied - but between 
                        that and a -

                               (seriously)
                        How would the "Enquirer" look with 
                        no news about this non-existent 
                        war - with Benton, Pulitzer and 
                        Heart devoting twenty columns a 
                        day to it?

                                    LELAND
                        They do it only because you do!

                               (grins)
                        And I do it because they do it, 
                        and they do it - it's a vicious 
                        circle, isn't it?
                               (rises)
                        I'm going over to Georgie's, Brad -
                        you know, Georgie, don't you?

          Leland nods.

                                    GEORGIE
                               (over Kane's next 
                               lines)
                        Glad to meet you, Brad.

          Leland shudders.

                                    KANE
                        I told you about Brad, Georgie.
                        He needs to relax.

          Brad doesn't answer.

          INT. GEORGIE'S PLACE - NIGHT -

          Georgie is introducing a young lady to Branford Leland.  On 
          sound track we hear piano music.

                                    GEORGIE
                               (right on cue from 
                               preceding scene)
                        Ethel - this gentlemen has been 
                        very anxious to meet you -  This 
                        is Ethel.

                                    ETHEL
                        Hello, Mr. Leland.

          Camera pans to include Kane, seated at piano, with girls 
          gathered around him.

                                    ONE OF THE GIRLS
                        Charlie!  Play the song about you.

                                    ANOTHER GIRL
                        Is there a song about Charlie?

          Kane has broken into "Oh, Mr. Kane!" and Charlie and the girls 
          start to sing.  Ethel leads the unhappy Leland over to the 
          group.  Kane, seeing Leland and taking his eye, motions to the 
          professor who has been standing next to him to take over.  The 
          professor does so.  The singing continues.  Kane rises and 
          crosses to Leland.

                                    KANE
                        Say, Brad.
                               (draws him slightly 
                               aside)
                        I've got an idea.

                                    LELAND
                        Yes?

                                    KANE
                        I mean I've got a job for you.

                                    LELAND
                        Good.

                                    KANE
                        You don't want to be a war 
                        correspondent - how about being a 
                        dramatic critic?

                                    LELAND
                               (sincerely, but not 
                               gushing; seriously)
                        I'd like that.

          Kane starts quietly to dance in time to the music.  Leland 
          smiles at him.

                                    KANE
                        You start tomorrow night.  Richard

                               (or supply show)
                        I'll get us some girls.  You get 
                        tickets.  A drama critic gets them 
                        free, you know.

                        Yes?

                                    LELAND
                               (still smiling)
                        It doesn't make any difference 
                        about me, but one of these days 
                        you're going to find out that all 
                        this charm of yours won't be enough -

                                    KANE
                               (has stopped dancing)
                        You're wrong.  It does make a 
                        difference to you -  Rector's, 
                        Brad?
                               (starts to dance 
                               again)
                        Come to think of it, I don't blame 
                        you for not wanting to be a war 
                        correspondent.  You won't miss 
                        anything.  It isn't much of a war.
                        Besides, they tell me there isn't 
                        a decent restaurant on the whole 
                        island.

          DISSOLVE IN:

          INT. RECTOR'S - NIGHT -

          Leland, Kane, two young ladies at Rector's.  Popular music is 
          heard over the soundtrack.  Everybody is laughing very, very 
          hard at something Kane has said.  The girls are hysterical.  
          Kane can hardly breathe.  As Leland's laughter becomes more 
          and more hearty, it only increases the laughter of the others.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          EXT. CUNARD LOCKS - GANGPLANK AND DECK OF BOAT - NIGHT -

          As told by Bernstein.  Kane is calling down to Leland and 
          Bernstein (as before).

                                    KANE
                        You don't expect me to keep any of 
                        those promises, do you?

          A band on deck strikes up "Auld Lang Syne" and further ship-to-
          shore conversation is rendered unfeasible.

          Bernstein and Leland on deck.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (turns to Leland)
                        Do you, Mr. Leland?

                                    LELAND
                               (smiling)
                        Certainly not.

          Slight pause.  They continue on their way.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to 
                        Europe with him?  He wanted you
                        to.  He said to me just yesterday -

                                    LELAND
                        I wanted him to have fun - and 
                        with me along -

          This stops Bernstein.  Bernstein looks at him.

                                    LELAND
                        Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me
                        ask you a few questions, and answer 
                        me truthfully.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Don't I always?  Most of the time?

                                    LELAND
                        Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt?  
                        Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am 
                        I a New England school-marm?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Yes.

          Leland is surprised.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        If you thought I'd answer different 
                        from what Mr. Kane tells you - 
                        well, I wouldn't.

                                    LELAND
                               (good naturedly)
                        You're in a conspiracy against me, 
                        you two.  You always have been.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Against me there should be such a 
                        conspiracy some time!

          He pauses.  "Auld Lang Syne" can still be heard from the deck 
          of the department steamer.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (with a hopeful 
                               look in his eyes)
                        Well, he'll be coming back in 
                        September.  The Majestic.  I got 
                        the reservations.  It gets in on 
                        the ninth.

                                    LELAND
                        September the ninth?

          Leland puts his hand in his pocket, pulls out a pencil and 
          small engagement book, opens the book and starts to write.

          Leland's pencil writing on a page in the engagement book open 
          to September 9: "Rector's - 8:30 p.m."

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Front page "Enquirer."  Large picture of the young couple - 
          Kane and Emily - occupying four columns - very happy.

          EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF - DAY -

          Leland and Thompson.  Leland is speaking as we dissolve.

                                    LELAND
                        I used to go to dancing school 
                        with her.

          Thompson had handed Leland a paper.

                                    LELAND
                        What's this?

                                    THOMPSON
                        It's a letter from her lawyers.

                                    LELAND
                               (reading aloud from 
                               the letter)
                        David, Grobleski & Davis -  My
                        dear Rawlston -
                               (looks up)

                                    THOMPSON
                        Rawlston is my boss.

                                    LELAND
                        Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.

                                    THOMPSON
                        He knows the first Mrs. Kane 
                        socially -  That's the answer we 
                        got.

                                    LELAND
                               (reading)
                        I am in receipt of your favor of 
                        yesterday.  I beg you to do me the 
                        courtesy of accepting my assurance 
                        that Mrs. Whitehall cannot be 
                        induced to contribute any more 
                        information on the career of Charles 
                        Foster Kane.

          She has authorized me to state on previous occasions that she 
          regards their brief marriage as a distateful episode in her 
          life that she prefers to forget.  With assurances of the highest 
          esteem - Leland hands the paper back to Thompson.

                        Was he in love?

                                    LELAND
                        He married for love -
                               (a little laugh)
                        That's why he did everything.  
                        That's why he went into politics.  
                        It seems we weren't enough.  He 
                        wanted all the voters to love him, 
                        too.  All he really wanted out of 
                        life was love.  That's Charlie's 
                        story - it's the story of how he 
                        lost it.  You see, he just didn't 
                        have any to give.  He loved Charlie 
                        Kane, of course, very dearly - and 
                        his mother, I guess he always loved 
                        her.  As for Emily - well, all I 
                        can tell you is Emily's story as 
                        she told it to me, which probably 
                        isn't fair - there's supposed to 
                        be two sides to every story - and 
                        I guess there are.  I guess there's
                        more than two sides -

          INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DAY -

          This scene is shot so as never to show the President - or at 
          least never his face.  There is present the President's 
          Secretary, sitting on one side of the desk, intently taking 
          notes.  Kane is on his feet, in front of the desk, tense and 
          glaring.

                                    THE PRESIDENT
                        It is the unanimous opinion of my 
                        Cabinent - in which I concur - 
                        that the proposed leases are in 
                        the best interests of the 
                        Governement and the people.
                               (pauses)
                        You are not, I hope, suggesting 
                        that these interests are not 
                        indentical?

                                    KANE
                        I'm not suggesting anything, Mr.
                        President!  I've come here to tell 
                        you that, unless some action is 
                        taken promptly - and you are the 
                        only one who can take it - the oil 
                        that is the property of the people 
                        of this country will be turned 
                        over for a song to a gang of high-
                        pressure crooks!

                                    THE PRESIDENT
                               (calmly)
                        I must refuse to allow you to 
                        continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                               (screaming)
                        It's the only vein I know.  I tell 
                        the facts the way I see them.  And
                        any man that knows that facts -

                                    THE PRESIDENT
                        I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I 
                        happen to have the incredible 
                        insolence to differ with you as to 
                        what they mean.
                               (pause)
                        You're a man of great talents, Mr. 
                        Kane.

                        Thanks.

                                    THE PRESIDENT
                        I understand that you have political 
                        ambitions.  Unfortunately, you 
                        seem incapable of allowing any 
                        other opinion but your own -

                               (building to a frenzy)
                        I'm much obliged, Mr. President, 
                        for your concern about me.  However, 
                        I happen to be concerned at this 
                        moment with the matter of extensive 
                        oil lands belonging to the people 
                        of the United States, and I say 
                        that if this lease goes through, 
                        the property of the people of the 
                        United States goes into the hands 
                        of -

                               (interrupting)
                        You've made your point perfectly 
                        clear, Mr. Kane.  Good day.

          The Secretary rises.  Kane, with every bit of will power 
          remotely at his disposal to control what might become an 
          hysterical outburst, manages to bow.

          He starts out of the office.

          INT. COMPOSING ROOM - ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          Kane, Reilly, Leland and a composing room Foreman, in working 
          clothes, bending over a table with several forms of type.  
          They are looking, at this moment, at a made-up headline - but 
          Kane's back is in the way ... so we can't read it.

                                    FOREMAN
                        How about it, Mr. Kane?

          Reilly glances at his wrist watch and makes a face.  Kane smiles 
          as he notices this.

                                    KANE
                        All right.  Let her slide!

          He turns away, and we can now read the headline.

          Insert of the headline, which reads: "OIL THEFT BECOMES LAW AS 
          PRESIDENT WITHOLDS VETO"

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Here follows a quick montage (presently to be worked out) of 
          no more than four or five images in which the President, by 
          means of cartoons, editorials, headlines (all faithfully 
          reproduced from period yellow journalism) is violently attacked.  
          The montage ends on the word TREASON.  The music cuts.

          A hand reaches in a side pocket which contains a newspaper - 
          recognizably the "Enquirer."  The hand removes a gun.  The gun 
          is shot.  Many arms seize the hand which is pulled up - gun 
          still firing.  As the arm is raised in the air, we see that 
          the other arms holding the arm and struggling with it are 
          uniformed, and we see the White House beyond.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          shows a crowd forming, looking angrily up toward the camera.  
          Crowd noises on the soundtrack under music.

          A hand snatches the ticker tape away and as the image of the 
          crowd dissolves out, we pull back to show:

          The camera is in tight on a box which contains Emily and 
          distinguished elderly ladies and gentlemen, obviously family 
          and friends.  On the soundtrack, very limpid opera music.  
          Another elderly gent, in white tie but still wearing an 
          overcoat, comes into the box and whispers to Emily.  He has a 
          copy of the "Enquirer" in his hand.  Emily rises.  He shows 
          the paper to her.

          An angry crowd seen from the window of Kane's office.  They

          following scene.  Across the heads of the crowd are two great 
          squares of light from the windows above them.  One of these 
          disappears as the blind is pulled.  As the dissolve completes 
          itself, the second square of light commences to reduce in size, 
          and then the entire street is cut off by a blind which Leland 
          pulls down, covering the entire frame.

                        Because the crackpot who did it

                        I said treason was a capital offense

                        They're true!  Everything I said!
                        Witholding that veto was treason!

                               (interrupting)
                        Charlie!

                               (riding over him)
                        Oil belonging to the people of the 
                        United States was leased out for a 
                        song to a gang of high-pressure
                        crooks -  Nobody can blame me 
                        because -

                                    LELAND
                        Look out that window.

          Kane stops - looks at him.

                                    LELAND
                        There are the people of the United
                        States, and they are blaming you -
                        Oh, I know it doesn't make any 
                        sense, but at least you can learn 
                        a lesson from it.

                                    KANE
                               (snarling)
                        What lesson?  Not to expose fraud 
                        when I see it?  Not to fight for 
                        the right of the people to own 
                        their own property?
                               (he turns to Reilly)
                        Run it the way I said, Reilly - 
                        "This afternoon a great man was 
                        assassinated -"

                                    LELAND
                        Charlie!  Now you're not making 
                        sense.

                                    KANE
                               (sharply)
                        I don't have to.  I run a newspaper 
                        with half a million readers and 
                        they're getting a martyred president 
                        this morning with their breakfast.
                        I can't help that.  Besides, they 
                        all know I'm married to his niece.  
                        I've got to think of her.

                                    LELAND
                        What?

                                    KANE
                        I've got to think of Emily -

                                    LELAND
                               (after a silence)
                        I'd like to talk to you about that.

                                    KANE
                        Go ahead.

          Leland looks back at Kane, is conscious of the boys standing 
          around.

                                    LELAND
                        Finish your editorial.

          Leland walks out in to the City Room.  More staff members in 
          shirt sleeves in a state of panic.  Leland goes to his desk, 
          takes out a bottle, pours himself a very stiff drink.  A door 
          opens.  A Policeman enters with Bernstein.  Bernstein is badly 
          battered.  The boys crowd around.

                                    LELAND
                               (worried)
                        What's happened?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (smiling)
                        I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only 
                        there was some fellows out front 
                        that thought they ought to take 
                        things up with me.  I learned 'em!
                        Didn't I, officer?

                                    THE COP
                               (grinning)
                        You sure did -  Say, the 
                        Commissioner said I was to stand 
                        by and protect Mr. Kane until 
                        further orders, no matter how he 
                        felt about it.  Where is he?

                                    LELAND
                               (finishing his drink)
                        In there.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        If you hadn't come along and 
                        protected me when you did, I'd 
                        have killed them fellows.

                                    LELAND
                               (pouring himself 
                               another drink)
                        Go and get yourself washed up, Mr.
                        Bernstein.
                               (he looks his face 
                               over thoroughly)
                        There doesn't seem to be an serious 
                        injury.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Not to me.  But you will let that 
                        cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't 
                        you?

                                    LELAND
                        Yes, Mr. Bernstein.

          Bernstein leaves the picture with sympathetic attendance.  
          Leland finishes his second drink.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. KANE'S OFFICE - NIGHT -

          The bottle is finished.  The door in the Sanctrum opens.  Reilly 
          and the others leave.

                                    REILLY
                               (as they go)
                        Goodnight, Mr. Kane.

          Kane stands in the door, waiting for Leland.  Leland gets up 
          and moves toward the office - goes in, sits down across from 
          Kane at the desk.  An uncomfortable pause.  Then Kane smiles 
          ingratiatingly.  Leland tries to cope with this.

                                    LELAND
                        First of all -
                               (he can't go on)

                                    KANE
                               (not cruelly - 
                               genuinely kind)
                        What's wrong, Brad?

                                    LELAND
                        I'm drunk.

                                    KANE
                        I'll get you some coffee.

          He rises and goes to the door.

                                    LELAND
                        First of all, I will not write a 
                        good review of a play because 
                        somebody paid a thousand dollars 
                        for an advertisement in the 
                        "Enquirer."

                                    KANE
                               (gently - opening 
                               the door)
                        That's just a little promotion 
                        scheme.  Nobody expects you -
                               (calling)
                        Mike, will you try and get Mr. 
                        Leland some coffee?

                                    MIKE'S VOICE
                        Sure thing, Mr. Kane.

          Kane turns back to Leland.  Leland doesn't look up at him.

                                    LELAND
                        Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't 
                        agree anymore.  I wish you'd let 
                        me go to Chicago.

                                    KANE
                        Why, Brad?

                                    LELAND
                        I want to be transferred to the 
                        new paper.  You've been saying 
                        yourself you wish you had somebody 
                        to -
                               (he is heartsick, 
                               inarticulate)
                        That's not what I wanted to talk 
                        about.

          Kane goes around behind the desk and sits down.

                                    KANE
                        I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad -
                        I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll 
                        help.

                                    LELAND
                        No, that won't help.  Besides, you 
                        never get drunk.  I wanted to talk 
                        about you and Emily.

          Kane looks at Leland sharply before he speaks.

                                    KANE
                               (quietly)
                        All right.

                                    LELAND
                               (without looking at 
                               him)
                        She's going to leave you -

                                    KANE
                        I don't think so, Brad.  We've 
                        just had word that the President 
                        is out of danger.
                               (ruefully)
                        It seems I didn't kill him after 
                        all.

                                    LELAND
                               (takes his eye)
                        She was going to leave you anyway -

          Kane takes this in.

                                    LELAND
                        Emily's going south next week with 
                        the child.  As far as anybody's to 
                        know, it's a holiday.  When they 
                        get back -

                                    KANE
                               (sharply)
                        Brad, you are drunk.

                                    LELAND
                        Sure I am.  She wants full custody 
                        of the child no matter what happens.
                        If you won't agree to that, she'll 
                        apply for a divorce regardless of 
                        the President's wishes.  I can't 
                        tell her she's wrong, because she 
                        isn't wrong -

                                    KANE
                        Why is she leaving me?

                                    LELAND
                               (it's very hard for 
                               him to say all 
                               this)
                        She hasn't any friends left sine 
                        you started this oil business, and 
                        she never sees you.

                                    KANE
                        Do you think the "Enquirer" 
                        shouldn't have campaigned against 
                        the oil leases?

                                    LELAND
                               (hesitating)
                        You might have made the whole thing 
                        less personal!

          No answer from Kane.

                                    LELAND
                        It isn't just that the President 
                        was her uncle - everyone she knows, 
                        all the people she's been brought 
                        up with, everything she's ever 
                        been taught to believe is important -

          Still no answer from Kane.

                                    LELAND
                        There's no reason why this - this
                        savage personal note -

                                    KANE
                        The personal note is all there is 
                        to it.  It's all there ever is to 
                        it.  It's all there every is to 
                        anything!  Stupidity in our 
                        government, complacency and self-
                        satisfaction and unwillingness to 
                        believe that anything done by a 
                        certain class of people can be 
                        wrong - you can't fight those things 
                        impersonally.  They're not 
                        impersonal crimes against people.  
                        They're being done by actual persons - 
                        with actual names and positions 
                        and - the right of the American 
                        people to own their own country is 
                        not an academic issue, Brad, that 
                        you debate - and then the judges 
                        retire to return a verdict and the 
                        winners give a dinner for the 
                        losers.

                                    LELAND
                        You almost convince me.
                               (rising)
                        I'm just drunk enough to tell you 
                        the truth.  I have to be a little 
                        drunk for that because I'm a coward.  
                        You know that.  That's why you 
                        keep me around.
                               (smiles)
                        You only associate with your 
                        inferiors, Charlie.  I guess that's 
                        why you ran away from Emily.  
                        Because you can't stand the company 
                        of your equals.  You don't like to 
                        admit they exist - the other big 
                        people in your world are dead.
                        I told you that.

          Kane looks at Leland, but Leland can't be stopped now.  He 
          speaks very quietly - no poison in his voice - no personal 
          indignation - as though he were explaining the nature of a 
          disease.

                                    LELAND
                        You talk about the people of the 
                        United States as though they 
                        belonged to you.  When you find 
                        out they don't think they are, 
                        you'll lose interest.  You talk 
                        about giving them their rights as 
                        though you could make a present of 
                        liberty.  Remember the working 
                        man?  You used to defend him quite 
                        a good deal.  Well, he's turning 
                        into something called organized 
                        labor and you don't like that at 
                        all.  And listen, when your precious 
                        underprivileged really get together - 
                        that's going to add up to something 
                        bigger than - than your privilege 
                        and then I don't know what you'll 
                        do - sail away to a desert island, 
                        probably, and lord it over the 
                        monkeys.

                        Yes.

                        Now, will you let me go to Chicago?

                        You're not going to like it in 
                        Chicago.  They wind comes howling 
                        in from the lake.  And there's
                        practically no opera season at all -
                        and the Lord only knows whether
                        they've ever heard of Lobster

                               a little)
                        Nothing - if she dosen't love me -

          Leland has risen.  He speaks as he turns away, starting towards 
          the door.

                        You want love on your own terms,

                               back turned to 
                               Kane)
                        Love according to your own rules.

                        and you've got to be soothed and 
                        nursed, no matter what else is 
                        happening - and no matter who else

                        It's simpler than that, Brad.  A 
                        society girl can't stand the gaff, 
                        that's all.  Other things are 
                        important to her - social position, 
                        what they're saying on the front 
                        porches at Southampton, is it going 
                        to be embarrassing to meet somebody
                        or the other at dinner -

          Leland has turned, taking his eye again.  Now Kane stops and 
          smiles.

                        She can leave me.  As a matter of 
                        fact, I've already left her.  Don't 
                        worry, Brad - I'll live.

                                    LELAND

                        another brandy.

          Leland shakes his head.  Kane lifts his glass.

                        To love on my terms.  Those are

          EXT. ENQUIRER BUILDING - NIGHT -

          Kane, Leland, and a couple of policemen make their way out of 
          the front toward a hansom cab.

                                    A VOICE FROM THE CROWD
                        You moiderer!

          A rock is thrown.  It hits Leland on the face.  A little blood 
          flows.  Kane doesn't see it at first.  Then when he's in the 
          hansom cab, he turns and notices it.

          Leland has a handkerchief to his face.

                        No.  I wish you'd go home to Emily.
                        She'll be pretty upset by all this -
                        She still loves you -

          The crowd, pushed by the cops, retreats in the background, but 
          still hard by.

                        low salary here in New York.  It 
                        seems to me that the new dramatic 
                        critic of our Chicago paper should 
                        get what he's worth.

                        let the salary stay where it is.

          The hansom cab starts up.  We hold on Leland's face as we

          DISSOLVE IN:

          INT. KANE'S NEW YORK HOME - KANE'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING -

          Emily is in bed, a damp cloth over her temples.  Kane is 
          standing at the foot of the bed.  The baby's bed is in a corner 
          of the room.  The baby's nurse is standing near the crib, a 
          nurse for Emily is near her.  Kane is looking fixedly on Emily, 
          who is staring tiredly at the ceiling.

                                    KANE
                               (to the nurse)
                        Excuse us a moment, please.

          The nurse looks at Emily.

                               (peremptorily)
                        I said, excuse us a moment.

          The nurse, unwilling, leaves.

                        I've been talking to Leland.  Emily -
                        You can't leave me now - not now -

          Silence.

                        It isn't what it would do to my 
                        changes in politics, Emily -  That 
                        isn't it -  They were talking of 
                        running me for governor, but now,
                        of course, we'll have to wait -
                        It isn't that, Emily -  It's just -
                        the president is your uncle and 
                        they're saying I killed him.

          Still silence.

          He stops.  He sees that he's getting no place with Emily.

                        Do you really think -

                        they really -

          She sits up and looks at the crib.  She almost continues to 
          look at the crib, with almost unseeing eyes.

                        Please don't talk any more, Charles.

          Kane is about to say something, but bites his lips instead.  
          Emily keeps staring at him.

                                    EMILY
                        Have they heard from father yet?

                        I've tried to tell you, Emily.
                        The President's going to be all 
                        right.  He had a comfortable night.
                        There's no danger of any kind.

          Emily nods several times.  There is an uncomforable silence.  
          Suddenly there is a cry from the crib.  Emily leaps from the 
          bed and rushes to him.  She bends over the crib.

                                    EMILY

                        Emily - you musn't leave me now -
                        you can't do that to me.

                                    EMILY
                        They won't hurt you, darling.
                        Mother's with you!  Mother's looking 
                        after you!

          Kane, unwanted, ignored, looks on.  Tightening his lips, he 
          walks out.

          INT. KANE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

          By the desk light, Kane is seen working with his usual 
          intensity,  Reilly standing beside him at the desk.

                                    KANE
                        We'll withdraw support completely.
                        Anything else?

                                    REILLY
                        Mr. Leland sent back that check.

                                    KANE
                        What check?

                                    REILLY
                        You made it out to him last week 
                        after he left for Chicago.

                                    KANE
                        Oh, yes, the bonus.

                                    REILLY
                        It was for twenty-five thousand 
                        dollars.

          Kane is perplexed and worried, but we can see in a moment his 
          mind will be on something else.

                                    REILLY
                        He sent it back torn up - all torn 
                        up into little bits, and he enclosed 
                        something else -  I can't make it 
                        out.

          Kane doesn't answer.  Reilly goes on.  He has brought out a 
          piece of paper and is reading it.

                                    REILLY
                        It says here, "A Declaration of
                        Principles" -
                               (he still reads)
                        "I will provide the people of this 
                        city with a daily paper that will
                        tell all the news honestly" -

          Kane has looked up sharply.  Reilly, sensing his look, stops 
          reading and meets his eye.  Slowly, Kane reaches out his hand.  
          Reilly hands him the piece of paper.  Without reading it, Kane 
          tears it up, throws it into the wastebasket at his side.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT -

          The evening of the final great rally.  These shots remind us 
          of and are identical with and supplementary to the "News Digest" 
          scenes earlier.  The vast auditorium with a huge picture of 
          Kane, cheering crowds, etc.  Emily and Junior are to be seen 
          in the front of a box.  Emily is tired and wears a forced smile 
          on her face.  Junior, now aged nine and a half, is eager, bright-
          eyed and excited.  Kane is just finishing his speech.

                                    KANE
                        It is no secret that I entered 
                        upon this campaign with no thought 
                        that I could be elected Governor 
                        of this state!  It is now no secret 
                        that every straw vote, every 
                        independent pole, shows that I 
                        will be elected.  And I repeat to 
                        you - my first official act as 
                        Governor will be to appoint a 
                        special District Attorney to arrange 
                        for the indictment, prosecution 
                        and conviction of Boss Edward G. 
                        Rogers!

          Terrific screaming and cheering from the audience.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT -

          The Speaker's Platform.  Numerous officials and civic leaders 
          are crowding around Kane.  Cameramen take flash photographs 
          with old-fashioined flash powder.

                                    FIRST CIVIC LEADER
                        Great speech, Mr. Kane.

                                    SECOND LEADER
                               (pompous)
                        One of the most notable public 
                        utterances ever made by a candidate
                        in this state -

                                    KANE
                        Thank you, gentlemen.  Thank you.

          He looks up and notices that the box in which Emily and the 
          boy were sitting is now empty.  He starts toward the rear of 
          the platform, through the press of people, Reilly approaches 
          him.

                                    REILLY
                        A wonderful speech, Mr. Kane.

          Kane pats him on the shoulder as he walks along.

                                    REILLY
                        I just got word from Buffalo, Mr.
                        Kane.  They're going to throw you 
                        the organization vote - and take a 
                        chance maybe you'll give them a
                        break -

          This is said almost inquiringly, as if he were hoping that 
          Kane would give him some assurance that McDonald is not making 
          a mistake.  There is no answer from Kane.

                                    REILLY
                        On an independent ticket there's 
                        never been anything like it!  If 
                        the election were held today, you'd 
                        be elected by a hundred thousand 
                        votes - and every day between now 
                        and November 7th is just going to 
                        add to your majority.

          Kane is very pleased.  He continues with Reilly slowly through 
          the crowd - a band playing off.  Bernstein joins him.

                                    KANE
                        It does seem too good to be true, 
                        doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?

                                    REILLY
                        Rogers isn't even pretending.  He 
                        isn't just scared anymore.  He's 
                        sick.  Frank Norris told me last 
                        night he hasn't known Rogers to be 
                        that worried in twenty-five years.

                                    KANE
                        I think it's beginning to dawn on 
                        Mr. Rogers that I mean what I say.
                        With Mr. Rogers out of the way, 
                        Reilly, I think we may really begin 
                        to hope for a good government in 
                        this state.
                               (stopping)
                        Well, Mr. Bernstein?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (clearly not meaning 
                               it)
                        It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  
                        Wonderful.  Wonderful.

                                    KANE
                        You don't really think so?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're 
                        running for Governor - and you 
                        want to be elected -  I think it's 
                        wonderful you're going to be 
                        elected.  Only -
                               (interrupts himself)
                        -  Can I say something?

                                    KANE
                        Please, Mr. Bernstein.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Well, the way I look at it -
                               (comes out with it)
                        -  You want to know what I really 
                        think would be wonderful?

          Kane indicates he is to proceed.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Well, you're running for Governor 
                        and going to be elected - my idea 
                        is how wonderful it would be if 
                        you don't run at all and don't get 
                        elected.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          EXT. ONE OF THE EXITS - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT -

          Emily and Junior are standing, waiting for Kane.

                                    JUNIOR
                        Is Pop Governor yet, Mom?

          Just then, Kane appears, with Reilly and several other men.  
          Kane rushes toward Emily and Junior, as the men politely greet 
          Emily.

                                    KANE
                        Hello, Butch!  Did you like your 
                        old man's speech?

                                    JUNIOR
                        Hello, Pop!  I was in a box.  I 
                        could hear every word.

                                    KANE
                        I saw you!
                               (he has his arm 
                               around Junior's 
                               shoulder)
                        Good night, gentlemen.

          There are good nights.  Kane's car is at the curb and he starts 
          to walk toward it with Junior and Emily.

                                    EMILY
                        I'm sending Junior home in the
                        car, Charles - with Oliver -

                                    KANE
                        But I'd arranged to go home with 
                        you myself.

                                    EMILY
                        There's a call I want you to make 
                        with me, Charles.

                                    KANE
                        It can wait.

                                    EMILY
                        No, it can't.
                               (she bends down and 
                               kisses Junior)
                        Good night, darling.

                                    JUNIOR
                        Good night, Mom.

          The driver is holding the rear door open as Emily guides Junior 
          in.

                                    KANE
                               (as car starts to 
                               drive off)
                        What's this all about, Emily?  
                        I've had a very tiring day and -

                                    EMILY
                        It may not be about anything at 
                        all.

          A cab has pulled up.

                                    THE DRIVER
                        Cab?

          Emily nods to him.

                                    EMILY
                        I intend to find out.

                                    KANE
                        I insist on being told exactly 
                        what you have in mind.

                                    EMILY
                        I'm going to -
                               (she looks at a 
                               slip of paper in 
                               her hand)
                        - 185 West 74th Street.

          Kane's reaction indicates that the address definitely means 
          something to him.

                                    EMILY
                        If you wish, you can come with 
                        me...

          Kane nods.

                                    KANE
                        I'll go with you.

          He opens the door and she enters the cab.  He follows her.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CAB - NIGHT -

          Kane and Emily.  He looks at her, in search of some kind of 
          enlightenment.  Her face is set and impassive.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          EXT. AND INT. APARTMENT HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT -

          Kane and Emily, in front of an apartment door.  Emily is 
          pressing the bell.

                                    KANE
                        I had no idea you had this flair 
                        for melodrama, Emiliy.

          Emily does not answer.  The door is opened by a maid, who 
          recognizes Kane.

                                    THE MAID
                        Come in, Mr. Kane, come in.

          They enter, Emily first.

          INT. SUSAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT -

          There is first a tiny reception room, through which an open 
          door shows the living room.  Kane and Emily enter from the 
          hallway and cross to the living room.  As they enter, Susan 
          rises from a chair.  The other person  in the room - a big, 
          heavyset man, a little past middle age - stays where he is, 
          leaning back in his chair, regarding Kane intently.

                                    SUSAN
                        It wasn't my fault, Charlie.  He 
                        made me send your wife a note.
                        He said I'd - oh, he's been saying 
                        the most terrible things, I didn't
                        know what to do...  I -
                               (she catches sight 
                               of Emily)

                                    ROGERS
                        Good evening, Mr. Kane.
                               (he rises)
                        I don't suppose anybody would 
                        introduce us.  Mrs. Kane, I am 
                        Edward Rogers.

                                    EMILY
                        How do you do?
                               (pauses)
                        I came here - and I made Mr. Kane 
                        come with me...
                               (she consults the 
                               note in her hand 
                               without reading it 
                               again)
                        because I recieved this note -

                                    ROGERS
                        I made Miss - Miss Alexander send 
                        you the note.  She was a little
                        unwilling at first -
                               (he smiles grimly)
                        but she did it.

                                    SUSAN
                        I can't tell you the things he 
                        said, Charlie.  You haven't got
                        any idea -

                                    KANE
                               (turning on Rogers)
                        Rogers, I don't think I will 
                        postpone doing something about you 
                        until I'm elected.
                               (he starts toward 
                               him)
                        To start with, I'll break your 
                        neck.

                                    ROGERS
                               (not giving way an 
                               inch)
                        Maybe you can do it and maybe you 
                        can't, Mr. Kane.

                                    EMILY
                        Charles!
                               (he stops to look 
                               at her)
                        Your - your breaking this man's
                        neck -
                               (she is clearly 
                               disgusted)
                        would scarcely explain this note -
                               (glancing at the 
                               note)
                        Serious consequences for Mr. Kane -
                               (slowly)
                        for myself, and for my son.  What
                        does this note mean, Miss -

                                    SUSAN
                               (stiffly)
                        I'm Susan Alexander.
                               (pauses)
                        I know what you think, Mrs. Kane,
                        but -

                                    EMILY
                               (ignoring this)
                        What does this note mean, Miss 
                        Alexander?

                                    ROGERS
                        She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane.  She 
                        just sent it - because I made her 
                        see it wouldn't be smart for her 
                        not to send it.

                                    KANE
                        In case you don't know, Emily,
                        this - this gentleman -
                               (he puts a world of 
                               scorn into the 
                               word)
                        is -

                                    ROGERS
                        I'm not a gentleman, Mrs. Kane, 
                        and your husband is just trying to 
                        be funny calling me one.  I don't 
                        even know what a gentleman is.
                               (tensely, with all 
                               the hatred and 
                               venom in the world)
                        You see, my idea of a gentleman, 
                        Mrs.  Kane - well, if I owned a 
                        newspaper and if I didn't like the 
                        way somebody else was doing things - 
                        some politican, say - I'd fight 
                        them with everything I had.  Only 
                        I wouldn't show him in a convict 
                        suit, with stripes - so his children 
                        could see the picture in the paper.  
                        Or his mother.
                               (he has to control 
                               himself from hurling 
                               himself at Kane)
                        It's pretty clear - I'm not a 
                        gentleman.

                                    EMILY
                        Oh!!

                                    KANE
                        You're a cheap, crooked grafter -
                        and your concern for your children
                        and your mother -

                                    ROGERS
                        Anything you say, Mr. Kane.  Only 
                        we're talking now about what you 
                        are.  That's what the note is about, 
                        Mrs. Kane.  Now I'm going to lay 
                        all my cards on the table.  I'm 
                        fighting for my life.  Not just my 
                        political life.  My life.  If your
                        husband is elected governor -

                                    KANE
                        I'm going to be elected governor.
                        And the first thing I'm going to
                        do -

                                    EMILY
                        Let him finish, Charles.

                                    ROGERS
                        I'm protecting myself every way I 
                        know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last 
                        week, I finally found out how I 
                        can stop your husband from being 
                        elected.  If the people of this 
                        state learn what I found out this 
                        week, he wouldn't have a chance to - 
                        he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  
                        Well, what I'm interested in is 
                        seeing that he's not elected.  I 
                        don't care whether they know what 
                        I know about him.  Let him keep 
                        right on being the Great, Noble, 
                        Moral -
                               (he stresses the 
                               world)
                        Champeen of the people.  Just as 
                        long as -

                                    EMILY
                        I think I understand, Mr. Rogers, 
                        but wonder if -
                               (she leaves her 
                               sentence unfinished)

                                    KANE
                        You can't blackmail me, Rogers, 
                        you can't -

                                    SUSAN
                               (excitedly)
                        Charlie, he said, unless you 
                        withdrew your name -

                                    ROGERS
                        That's the chance I'm willing to 
                        give you, Mr. Kane.  More of a 
                        chance than you'd give me.  Unless 
                        you make up your mind by tomorrow 
                        that you're so sick that you've 
                        got to go away for a year or two -
                        Monday morning every paper in this 
                        State will carry the story I'm 
                        going to give them.

          Kane starts to stare at him intently.

                                    EMILY
                        What story, Mr. Rogers?

                                    ROGERS
                        The story about him and Miss 
                        Alexander, Mrs. Kane.

          Emily looks at Kane.

                                    SUSAN
                        There is no story.  It's all lies.
                        Mr. Kane is just -

                                    ROGERS
                               (to Susan)
                        Shut up!
                               (to Kane)
                        I've had a dozen men doing nothing 
                        but run this thing down - we've 
                        got evidence enough to - well, the 
                        evidence would stand up in any 
                        court of law.  You want me to give 
                        you the evidence, Mr. Kane?

                                    KANE
                        You do anything you want to do.
                        The people of this state can decide 
                        which one of us to trust.  If you 
                        want to know, they've already 
                        decided.  The election Tuesday'll 
                        be only -

                                    ROGERS
                        Mrs. Kane, I'm not asking you to
                        believe me.  I'd like to show you -

                                    EMILY
                        You don't have to show me anything, 
                        Mr. Rogers.  I believe you.

                                    ROGERS
                        I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without 
                        having to get the story published.
                        Not that I care about him.  But 
                        I'd be better off that way -
                               (he pauses)
                        - and so would you, Mrs. Kane.

                                    SUSAN
                        What about me?
                               (to Kane)
                        He said my name'd be dragged through 
                        the mud.  He said everywhere I'd 
                        go from now on -

                                    EMILY
                        There seems to be only one decision 
                        you can make, Charles.  I'd say 
                        that it has been made for you.
                               (pauses)
                        I suppose the details can be 
                        arranged tomorrow, Mr. Rogers.  
                        About the statements by the doctors -

                                    KANE
                        Have you gone completely mad, Emily?

          Emily looks at him.

                                    KANE
                        You don't think I'm going to let 
                        this blackmailer intimidate me, do 
                        you?

                                    EMILY
                        I don't see what else you can do, 
                        Charles.  If he's right - and the
                        papers publish this story he has -

                                    KANE
                        Oh, they'll publish it all right.
                        But that's not going to stop me -

                                    EMILY
                        Charles, this - this story - doesn't 
                        concern only you.  I'll be in it, 
                        too, won't I?
                               (quickly)
                        And Junior?

                                    KANE
                               (squirming a bit)
                        I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid 
                        of the story.  You can't tell me
                        that the voters of this state -

                                    EMILY
                        I'm not interested in the voters 
                        of this state right now.  I am 
                        interested in - well, Junior, for 
                        one thing.

                                    SUSAN
                        Charlie!  If they publish this
                        story -

                                    EMILY
                        They won't.  Goodnight, Mr. Rogers.
                               (she starts out)
                        There's nothing more to be said, 
                        Charles.

                                    KANE
                        Oh yes, there is.

                                    EMILY
                        I don't think so.  Are you coming, 
                        Charles?

                                    KANE
                        No.

          She looks at him.  He starts to work himself into a rage.

                                    KANE
                        There's only one person in the 
                        world to decide what I'm going to 
                        do - and that's me.  And if
                        you think - if any of you think -

                                    EMILY
                        You decided what you were going to 
                        do, Charles - some time ago.
                               (she looks at Susan)
                        You can't always have it your own 
                        way, regardless of anything else 
                        that may have happened.
                               (she sighs)
                        Come on, Charles.

                                    KANE
                        Go on!  Get out!  I can fight this 
                        thing all alone!

                                    ROGERS
                        You're making a bigger fool of 
                        yourself than I thought you would, 
                        Mr. Kane.  You're licked.  Why 
                        don't you -

                                    KANE
                               (turning on him)
                        Get out!  I've got nothing to talk 
                        to you about.  If you want to see 
                        me, have the Warden write me a 
                        letter.

                                    ROGERS
                        I see!
                               (he starts toward 
                               the door)

                                    SUSAN
                               (starting to cry)
                        Charlie, you're just excited.  You
                        don't realize -

                                    KANE
                        I know exactly what I'm doing.
                               (he is screaming)
                        Get out!

                                    EMILY
                               (quietly)
                        Charles, if you don't listen to
                        reason, it may be too late -

                                    KANE
                        Too late for what?  Too late for
                        you and this -
                               (he can't find the 
                               adjective)
                        this public thief to take the love 
                        of the people of this state away 
                        from me?  Well, you won't do it, I 
                        tell you.  You won't do it!

                                    SUSAN
                        Charlie, there are other things to 
                        think of.
                               (a sly look comes 
                               into her eyes)
                        Your son - you don't want him to
                        read in the papers -

                                    EMILY
                        It is too late now, Charles.

                                    KANE
                               (rushes to the door 
                               and opens it)
                        Get out, both of you!

                                    SUSAN
                               (rushes to him)
                        Charlie, please don't -

                                    KANE
                        What are you waiting here for?
                        Why don't you go?

                                    EMILY
                        Goodnight, Charles.

          She walks out.  Rogers stops as he gets directly in front of 
          Kane.

                                    ROGERS
                        You're the greatest fool I've ever 
                        known, Kane.  If it was anybody 
                        else, I'd say what's going to happen 
                        to you would be a lesson to you.  
                        Only you're going to need more 
                        than one lesson.  And you're going 
                        to get more than one lesson.
                               (he walks past Kane)

                                    KANE
                        Don't you worry about me.  I'm 
                        Charles Foster Kane.  I'm no cheap, 
                        crooked politician, trying to save 
                        himself from the consequences of
                        his crimes -

          INT. APARTMENT HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT -

          Camera angling toward Kane from other end of the hall.  Rogers 
          and Emily are already down the hall, moving toward foreground.  
          Kane in apartment doorway background.

                                    KANE
                               (screams louder)
                        I'm going to send you to Sing Sing, 
                        Rogers.  Sing Sing!

          Kane is trembling with rage as he shakes his fist at Rogers's 
          back.  Susan, quieter now, has snuggled into the hollow of his 
          shoulder as they stand in the doorway.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Digest") revealing Kane's relations with Susan.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT -

          Emily is opening the door for Leland.

                                    EMILY
                        Hello, Brad -

                                    LELAND
                        Emily -

          He pauses.  Leland comes in.  Emily closes the door.

                                    EMILY
                        I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad -
                        didn't -

                                    LELAND
                        Chicago is pretty close to New
                        York nowadays - only twenty hours -

          She doesn't have anything to say.

                                    LELAND
                        I'm glad to see you.

          She smiles at him and we know that there isn't anybody else in 
          the world for her to smile at.  She's too grateful to talk.

                                    EMILY
                        Are all the returns in?

          Leland puts his hat unconsciously on his coat by the newspaper.

                                    EMILY
                        Let me see it.

          Leland takes the newspaper out of his pocket and hands it to 
          her.  She takes it.  We see the headline, not an insert, but 
          it registers.  It reads: "Fraud at Polls."  Emily is looking 
          at the paper with unseeing eyes, and a little smile.

                                    LELAND
                               (after a pause)
                        Almost two to one -

                                    EMILY
                        I'm surprised he got the votes he 
                        did.

                                    LELAND
                        Emily!

                                    EMILY
                        Why should anyone vote for him?  
                        He's made it quite clear to the 
                        people what he thinks of them.
                        Children - to be told one thing 
                        one day, something else the next, 
                        as the whim seizes him.  And they're 
                        supposed to be grateful and love 
                        and adore him - because he sees to 
                        it that they get cheap ice and 
                        only pay a nickel in the street 
                        cars.

                                    LELAND
                        Emily, you're being - a little 
                        unfair -  You know what I think of 
                        Charles' behavior - about your
                        personal lives -

                                    EMILY
                        There aren't any personal lives 
                        for people like us.  He made that
                        very clear to me nine years ago -
                        If I'd thought of my life with
                        Charles as a personal life, I'd
                        have left him then -

                                    LELAND
                        know that, Emily -

                                    EMILY
                               (on top of Leland)
                        Maybe I should have - the first 
                        time he showed me what a mad dog 
                        he really was.

                                    LELAND
                               (on the cue "dog")
                        Emily, you -

                                    EMILY
                        Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman
                        yet -

                                    LELAND
                        It's - all over -

          He stops himself.

                                    EMILY
                               (after a pause)
                        Know it is, Brad -

                                    LELAND
                        He's paying for it, Emily.  Those 
                        returns tonight - he's finished.
                        Politically -
                               (he thinks)
                        - socially, everywhere, I guess.
                        don't know about the papers, but -

                                    EMILY
                        If you're asking me to sympathize 
                        with him, Brad, you're wasting 
                        your time.
                               (pauses)
                        There's only one person I'm sorry
                        for, as a matter of fact.  That -
                        that shabby little girl.  I'm really 
                        sorry for her, Brad.

          Front page Chicago "Enquirer," with photograph proclaiming 
          that Susan Alexander opens at new Chicago Opera House in 
          "Thais," as in "News Digest."

          On soundtrack during above we hear the big, expectant murmur 
          of an opening night audience and the noodling of the orchestra.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CHICAGO OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT - SET FOR "THAIS" -

          The camera is just inside the curtain, angling upstage.  We 
          see the set for "Thais" - the principals in place - stage 
          managers, stage hands, etc., and in the center of all this, in 
          an elaborate costume, looking very small and very lost, is 
          Susan.  She is almost hysterical with fright.  Maids, singing 
          teacher, and the rest are in attendance.  Her throat is sprayed.  
          Applause is heard at the opening of the shot, and now the 
          orchestra starts thunderously.  The curtain starts to rise -
          the camera with it - the blinding glare of the foots moves up 
          Susan's body and hits her face.  She squints and starts to 
          sing.  Camera continues on up with the curtain, up past Susan, 
          up the full height of the proscenium arch and then on up into 
          the gridiron into a world of ropes, brick walls and hanging 
          canvas - Susan's voice still heard - but faintly.  The camera 
          stops at the top of the gridiron as the curtain stops.  Two 
          typical stage hands fill the frame.  They are looking down on 
          the stage below.  Some of the reflected light gleams on their 
          faces.  They look at each other.  One of them puts his hand to 
          his nose.

          INT. LELAND'S OFFICE - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          Leland, as in the same scene in the Bernstein sequence, is 
          sprawled across his typewriter, his head on the keys.  The 
          paper is gone from the roller.  Leland stirs and looks up 
          drunkenly, his eyes encountering Bernstein, who stands beside 
          him (also as in the previous scene).

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Hello, Mr. Leland.

                                    LELAND
                        Hello, Bernstein.

          Leland makes a terrific effort to pull himself together.  He 
          straightens and reaches for the keys - then sees the paper is 
          gone from the machine.

                                    LELAND
                        Where is it - where's my notice?
                        I've got to finish it!

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (quietly)
                        Mr. Kane is finishing it.

                                    LELAND
                        Kane?  Charlie?
                               (painfully, he rises 
                               to his feet)
                        Where is he?

          During all this, the sound of a typewriter has been heard off - 
          a busy typewriter.  Leland's eyes follow the sound.  Slowly he 
          registers Kane in the City Room beyond.  This is almost the 
          same shot as in the previous Bernstein story.

          INT. CITY ROOM - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          Kane, in white tie and shirt sleeves, is typing away at a 
          machine, his fingers working briskly and efficiently, his face, 
          seen by the desk light before him, set in a strange half-smile.

          Leland stands in the door of his office, staring across at 
          him.

                                    LELAND
                        I suppose he's fixing it up - I 
                        know I'd never get that through.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (moving to his side)
                        Mr. Kane is finishing your piece 
                        the way you started it.

          Leland turns incredulously to Bernstein.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        He's writing a roast like you wanted
                        it to be -
                               (then suddnely - 
                               with a kind of 
                               quiet passion rather 
                               than a triumph)
                        - I guess that'll show you.

          Leland picks his way across the City Room to Kane's side.  
          Kane goes on typing, without looking up.  After a pause, Kane 
          speaks.

                                    KANE
                        Hello, Brad.

                                    LELAND
                        Hello, Charlie -

                                    (ANOTHER PAUSE)
                        I didn't know we were speaking.

          Kane stops typing, but doesn't turn.

                                    KANE
                        Sure, we're speaking, Brad -
                        you're fired.

          He starts typing again, the expression on his face doesn't 
          change.

          EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF - DAY -

          Thompson and Leland on the roof, which is now deserted.  It is 
          getting late.  The sun has just about gone down.

                                    LELAND
                        Well, that's about all there is -
                        and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!
                               (pause)
                        Five years ago, he wrote from that
                        place of his down South -
                               (as if trying to 
                               think)
                        - you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?
                               (pauses)
                        Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of 
                        that place?  You know...  All right.  
                        Xanadu.  I knew what it was all 
                        the time.  You caught on, didn't 
                        you?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Yes.

                                    LELAND
                        I guess maybe I'm not as hard to 
                        see through as I think.  Anyway, I 
                        never even answered his letter.
                        Maybe I should have.  I guess he 
                        was pretty lonely down there those 
                        last years.  He hadn't finished it 
                        when she left him - he never 
                        finished it - he never finished 
                        anything.  Of course, he built it 
                        for her -

                                    THOMPSON
                        That must have been love.

                                    LELAND
                        I don't know.  He was disappointed 
                        in the world.  So he built one of 
                        his own -  An absolute monarchy -
                        It was something bigger than an 
                        opera house anyway -

                        can do for me, young fellow.

                                    THOMPSON
                        Sure.

                        On your way out, stop at a cigar 
                        store, will you, and send me up a 
                        couple of cigars?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad 
                        to.

                                    LELAND
                        Hey, Nurse!

          A Nurse appears.

                                    NURSE
                        Hello, Mr. Leland.

                                    LELAND
                        I'm ready to go in now.  You know 
                        when I was a young man, there was 
                        an impression around that nurses 
                        were pretty.  It was no truer then
                        than it is now.

                                    NURSE
                        Here, let me take your arm, Mr. 
                        Leland.

                                    LELAND
                               (testily)
                        All right, all right.
                               (he has begun to 
                               move forward on 
                               the Nurse's arm; 
                               turning to Thompson)
                        You won't forget, will you, about 
                        the cigars?  And tell them to wrap 
                        them up to look like toothpaste, 
                        or something, or they'll stop them 
                        at the desk.  That young doctor I 
                        was telling you about, he's got an 
                        idea he wants to keep me alive.

          Susan at her regular table,  Thompson seated across from her.

          Very faintly during this, idle piano music playing.

          INT. "EL RANCHO" CABARET - EARLY DAWN -

          Susan and Thompson are facing each other.  The place is almost 
          deserted.  Susan is sober.  On the other side of the room, 
          somebody is playing a piano.

                                    SUSAN
                        How do you want to handle the whole 
                        thing - ask questions?

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'd rather you just talked.  
                        Anything that comes into your mind - 
                        about yourself and Mr. Kane.

                                    SUSAN
                        You wouldn't want to hear a lot of 
                        what comes into my mind about myself 
                        and Mr. Charlie Kane.

          Susan is thinking.

                                    THOMPSON
                        How did you meet him?

                        I had a toothache.

          Thompson looks at her.

                        That was thiry years ago - and I 
                        still remember that toothache.
                        Boy!  That toothache was just 
                        driving me crazy...

          EXT. CORNER DRUG STORE AND STREET ON THE WEST SIDE OF NEW YORK - 
          NIGHT -

          Susan, aged twenty, neatly but cheaply dressed in the style of 
          the period, is leaving the drug store.  It's about 8 o'clock 
          at night.  With a large, man-sized handkerchief pressed to her 
          cheek, she is in considerable pain.  The street is wet - after 
          a recent rain.

          She walks a few steps towards the middle of the block, and can 
          stand it no longer.  She stops, opens a bottle of Oil of Cloves 
          that she has in her hand, applies some to her finger, and rubs 
          her gums.

          She walks on, the pain only a bit better.  Four or five houses 
          farther along, she comes to what is clearly her own doorway - 
          a shabby, old four-story apartment house.  She turns toward 
          the doorway, which is up a tiny stoop, about three steps.

          As she does so, Kane, coming from the opposite direction, almost 
          bumps into her and turns to his left to avoid her.  His shoulder 
          bumps hers and she turns.  As she does so, Kane, forced to 
          change his course, steps on the loose end of a plank which 
          covers a puddle in the bad sidewalk.  The plank rises up and 
          cracks him on the knee, also covering him with mud.

                                    KANE
                               (hopping up and 
                               down and rubbing 
                               his knee)
                        Ow!

          Susan, taking her handkerchief from her jaw, roars with 
          laughter.

                                    KANE
                        It's not funny.

          He bites his lip and rubs his knee again.  Susan tries to 
          control her laughter, but not very successfully.  Kane glares 
          at her.

                                    SUSAN
                        I'm sorry, mister - but you do 
                        look awful funny.

          Suddenly, the pain returns and she claps her hand to her jaw.

                                    SUSAN
                        Ow!

                                    KANE
                        What's the matter with you?

                                    SUSAN
                        Toothache.

                                    KANE
                        Hmm!

          He has been rubbing his clothes with his handkerchief.

                                    SUSAN
                        You've got some on your face.

                                    KANE
                        If these sidewalks were kept in 
                        condition - instead of the money
                        going to some cheap grafter -

          Susan starts to laugh again.

                                    KANE
                        What's funny now?

                                    SUSAN
                        You are.  You look like you've 
                        been making mud pies.

          In the middle of her smile, the pain returns.

                                    SUSAN
                        Oh!

                                    KANE
                        You're no Venus de Milo.

                                    SUSAN
                               (points to the 
                               downstair window)
                        If you want to come in and wash 
                        your face -  I can get you some 
                        hot water to get that dirt off
                        your trousers -

                                    KANE
                        Thanks.

          Susan starts, with Kane following her.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. SUSAN'S ROOM - NIGHT -

          It's in moderate disorder.  The Mansbach gas lights are on.  
          It's not really a classy room, but it's exactly what you're 
          entitled to in 1910, for $5.00 a week including breakfast.

          There is a bed, a couple of chairs, a chiffonier, and a few 
          personal belongings on the chiffonier.  These include a 
          photograph of a gent and lady, obviously Susan's parents, and 
          a few objets d'art.  One, "At the Japanese Rolling Ball Game 
          at Coney Island," and - perhaps this is part of the Japanese 
          loot - the glass globe with the snow scene Kane was holding in 
          his hand in the first sequence.

          Susan comes into the room, carrying a basin, with towels over 
          her arm.  Kane is waiting for her.  She doesn't close the door.

                                    SUSAN
                               (by way of 
                               explanation)
                        My landlady prefers me to keep 
                        this door open when I have a 
                        gentleman caller.
                               (starts to put the 
                               basin down)
                        She's a very decent woman.
                               (making a face)
                        Ow!

          Kane rushes to take the basin from her, putting it on the 
          chiffonier.  To do this, he has to shove the photograph to one 
          side of the basin.  Susan grabs the photograph as it is about 
          to fall over.

                                    SUSAN
                        Hey, you should be more careful.
                        That's my ma and pa.

                                    KANE
                        I'm sorry.  They live here, too?

                                    SUSAN
                        No.  They've passed on.

          Again she puts her hand to her jaw.

                                    KANE
                        Where's the soap?

                                    SUSAN
                        In the water.

          Kane fishes the soap out of the water.  It is slippery, however, 
          and slips out of his hand, hitting him in the chest before it 
          falls to the floor.  Susan laughs as he bends over.

                                    KANE
                               (starting to wash 
                               his hands)
                        You're very easily amused.

                                    SUSAN
                        I always like to see the funny 
                        side of things.  No sense crying 
                        when you don't have to.  And you're 
                        so funny.  Looking at you, I forget 
                        all about my toothache.

          Her face distorts in pain again.

                                    SUSAN
                        Oh!

                                    KANE
                        I can't stay here all night chasing 
                        your pain away.

                                    SUSAN
                               (laughs)
                        I know...  But you do look so silly.

          Kane, with soaped hands, has rubbed his face and now cannot 
          open his eyes, for fear of getting soap in them.

                                    KANE
                        Where's the towel?

                                    SUSAN
                        On the chiffonier.  Here.

                                    KANE
                               (rubs his face dry)
                        Thanks.

                                    SUSAN
                               (on her way to closet)
                        I've got a brush in the closet.  
                        As soon as the mud on your trousers 
                        is all dry - you just brush it 
                        off.

                                    KANE
                        I'll get these streets fixed, if 
                        it's the last thing I do.

          Susan comes out of the closet.  She holds out the brush with 
          her left hand, her right hand to her jaw in real distress.

                                    KANE
                               (takes the brush)
                        You are in pain, aren't you, you 
                        poor kid?

          Susan can't stand it anymore and sits down in a chair, bent 
          over, whimpering a bit.

                                    KANE
                               (brushing himself)
                        Wish there was something I could -

          He stops and thinks.  Susan, her face averted, is still trying 
          hard not to cry.

                                    KANE
                        I've got an idea, young lady.
                               (there is no response)
                        Turn around and look at me.
                               (there is still no 
                               response)
                        I said, turn around and look at 
                        me, young lady.

          Slowly, Susan turns.

                                    KANE
                        Did you ever see anybody wiggle 
                        both his ears at the same time?

          It takes a second for Susan to adapt herself to this.

                                    KANE
                        Watch closely!
                               (he wiggles his 
                               ears)
                        It took me two solid years at the 
                        finest boys' school in the world 
                        to learn that trick.  The fellow 
                        who taught me is President of 
                        Venezuela now.

          He's still wiggling his ears as Susan starts to smile.

                                    KANE
                        That's it!  Smile!

          Susan smiles, very broadly.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. SUSAN'S ROOM - NIGHT -

          Closeup of a duck, camera pulls back showing it to be a 
          shadowgraph on the wall, made by Kane, who is now in his shirt 
          sleeves.  It is about an hour later than preceding sequence.

                                    SUSAN
                               (hesitatingly)
                        A chicken?

                                    KANE
                        No.  But you're close.

                                    SUSAN
                        A rooster?

                                    KANE
                        You're getting farther away all 
                        the time.  It's a duck.

                                    SUSAN
                        Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this 
                        takes a lot of nerve, but - who 
                        are you?  I mean - I'm pretty 
                        ignorant, guess you caught on to 
                        that -

                                    KANE
                               (looks squarely at 
                               her)
                        You really don't know who I am?

                                    SUSAN
                        No.  That is, I bet it turns out 
                        I've heard your name a million 
                        times, only you know how it is -

                                    KANE
                        But you like me, don't you?  Even 
                        though you don't know who I am?

                                    SUSAN
                        You've been wonderful!  I can't 
                        tell you how glad I am you're here, 
                        I don't know many people and -
                               (she stops)

                                    KANE
                        And I know too many people.  
                        Obviously, we're both lonely.
                               (he smiles)
                        Would you like to know where I was 
                        going tonight - when you ran into 
                        me and ruined my Sunday clothes?

                                    SUSAN
                        I didn't run into you and I bet 
                        they're not your Sunday clothes.
                        You've probably got a lot of 
                        clothes.

                                    KANE
                               (as if defending 
                               himself from a 
                               terrible onslaught)
                        I was only joking!
                               (pauses)
                        This evening I was on my way to
                        the Western Manhattan Warehouses -
                        in search of my youth.

          Susan is bewildered.

                                    KANE
                        You see, my mother died, too - a 
                        long time ago.  Her things were 
                        put into storage out west because 
                        I had no place to put them then.
                        I still haven't.  But now I've 
                        sent for them just the same.  And 
                        tonight I'd planned to make a sort 
                        of sentimental journey -
                               (slowly)
                        - to the scenes of my youth - my 
                        childhood, I suppose - to look 
                        again at -
                               (he changes mood 
                               slightly)
                        and now -

          Kane doesn't finish.  He looks at Susan.  Silence.

                                    KANE
                        Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles 
                        Foster Kane was born in New Salem,
                        Colorado in eighteen six -
                               (he stops on the 
                               word "sixty" - 
                               obviously a little 
                               embarrassed)
                        I run a couple of newspapers.  How 
                        about you?

                                    SUSAN
                        Oh, me -

                                    KANE
                        How old did you say you were?

                                    SUSAN
                               (very bright)
                        I didn't say.

                                    KANE
                        I didn't think you did.  If you 
                        had, I wouldn't have asked you 
                        again, because I'd have remembered.
                        How old?

                                    SUSAN
                        Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in 
                        August.

                                    KANE
                               (looks at her 
                               silently for a 
                               moment)
                        That's a ripe old age -  What do 
                        you do?

                                    SUSAN
                        I work at Seligman's.

                                    KANE
                        Is that what you want to do?

                                    SUSAN
                        I want to be a singer.
                               (she thinks for a 
                               moment)
                        I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for 
                        me.

                                    KANE
                               (sympathetically)
                        What happened to the singing?
                        You're not in a show, are you?

                                    SUSAN
                        Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother 
                        always thought - she used to talk 
                        about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine!
                        An American girl, for one thing -
                        and then my voice isn't really 
                        that kind anyway, it's just that 
                        Mother - you know what mothers are 
                        like.

          A sudden look comes over Kane's face.

                                    KANE
                        Yes -

                                    SUSAN
                        As a matter of fact, I do sing a 
                        little.

                                    KANE
                               (points to the piano)
                        Would you sing for me?

                                    SUSAN
                               (bashful)
                        Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me 
                        sing.

                                    KANE
                        Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.

                                    SUSAN
                        Well, I -

                                    KANE
                        Don't tell me your toothache is 
                        bothering you again?

                                    SUSAN
                        Oh, no, that's all gone.

                                    KANE
                        Then you have no alibi at all.
                        Please sing.

          Susan, with a tiny ladylike hesitancy, goes to the piano and 
          sings a polite song.  Sweetly, nicely, she sings with a small, 
          untrained voice.  Kane listens.  He is relaxed, at ease with 
          the world.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. "EL RANCHO" CABARET - EARLY DAWN -

          Susan tosses down a drink, then goes on with her story.

                                    SUSAN
                        I did a lot of singing after that.
                        I sang for Charlie -  I sang for 
                        teachers at a hundred bucks an 
                        hour - the teachers got that, I
                        didn't -

                                    THOMPSON
                        What did you get?

                                    SUSAN
                               (glares at him 
                               balefully)
                        What do you mean?

          Thompson doesn't answer.

                                    SUSAN
                        I didn't get a thing.  Just the 
                        music lessons.  That's all there 
                        was to it.

                                    THOMPSON
                        He married you, didn't he?

                                    SUSAN
                        He was in love with me.  But he 
                        never told me so until after it 
                        all came out in the papers about 
                        us - and he lost the election and
                        that Norton woman divorced him.

                                    THOMPSON
                        What about that apartment?

                                    SUSAN
                        He wanted me to be comfortable -
                        Oh, why should I bother?  You don't 
                        believe me, but it's true.  It 
                        just happens to be true.  He was 
                        really interested in my voice.
                               (sharply)
                        What are you smiling for?  What do 
                        you think he built that opera house 
                        for?  I didn't want it.  I didn't
                        want to sing.  It was his idea -
                        everything was his idea - except 
                        my leaving him.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. LIVING ROOM OF KANE'S HOUSE IN NEW YORK - DAY -

          Susan is singing.  Matisti, her voice teacher, is playing the 
          piano.  Kane is seated nearby.  Matisti stops.

                                    MATISTI
                        Impossible!  Impossible!

                                    KANE
                        Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane 
                        your opinion of her talents.
                        You're supposed to train her voice.
                        Nothing more.

                                    MATISTI
                               (sweating)
                        But, it is impossible.  I will be 
                        the laughingstock of the musical
                        world!  People will say -

                                    KANE
                        If you're interested in what people 
                        say, Signor Matisti, I may be able 
                        to enlighten you a bit.  The 
                        newspapers, for instance.  I'm an 
                        authority on what the papers will 
                        say, Signor Matisti, because I own 
                        eight of them between here and San 
                        Francisco...  It's all right, dear.
                        Signor Matisti is going to listen 
                        to reason.  Aren't you, maestro?
                               (he looks him square 
                               in the eyes)

                                    MATISTI
                        Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -

                                    KANE
                        You can't.

          There is a silence.  Matisti rises.

                                    KANE
                        I knew you'd see it my way.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CHICAGO OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT -

          It is the same opening night - it is the same moment as before - 
          except taht the camera is now upstage angling toward the 
          audience.  The curtain is down.  We see the same tableau as 
          before - the terrified and trembling Susan, the apprehensive 
          principals, the maids and singing teachers, the stage hands.  
          As the dissolve commences, there is the sound of applause 
          (exactly as before) and now as the dissolve completes itself, 
          the orchestra breaks frighteningly into opening chords of the 
          music - the stage is cleared - Susan is left alone, terribly 
          alone.  The curtain rises.  The glare of the footlights jump 
          into the image.  The curtain is now out of the picture and 
          Susan starts to sing.  Beyond her, we see the prompter's box, 
          containing the anxious face of the prompter.  Beyond that, out 
          in the darkness - an apprehensive conductor struggles with his 
          task of coordinating an orchestra and an incompetent singer.  
          Beyond that - dimly white shirt fronts and glistening bosoms 
          for a couple of rows, and then deep and terrible darkness.

          Closeup of Kane's face - seated in the audience - listening.

          Sudden but perfectly correct lull in the music reveals a voice 
          from the audience - a few words from a sentence - the kind of 
          thing that often happens in a theatre -

                                    THE VOICE
                        - really pathetic.

          Music crashes in and drowns out the rest of the sentence, but 
          hundreds of people around the voice have heard it (as well as 
          Kane) and there are titters which grow in volume.

          Closeup of Susan's face - singing.

          Closeup of Kane's face - listening.

          There is the ghastly sound of three thousand people applauding 
          as little as possible.  Kane still looks.  Then, near the 
          camera, there is the sound of about a dozen people applauding 
          very, very loudly.  Camera moves back, revealing Bernstein and 
          Reilly and other Kane stooges, seated around him, beating their 
          palms together.  The curtain is falling - as we can see by the 
          light which shutters down off their faces.

          The stage from Kane's angle.

          The curtain is down - the lights glowing on it.  Still, the 
          polite applause dying fast.  Nobody comes out for a bow.

          Closeup of Kane - breathing heavily.  Suddenly he starts to 
          applaud furiously.

          The stage from the audience again.

          Susan appears for her bow.  She can hardly walk.  There is a 
          little polite crescendo of applause, but it is sickly.

          Closeup of Kane - still applauding very, very hard, his eyes 
          on Susan.

          The stage again.

          Susan, finishing her bow, goes out through the curtains.  The 
          light on the curtain goes out and the houselights go on.

          Closeup of Kane - still applauding very, very hard.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. STUDY - KANE'S NEW YORK HOME - DAY -

          Some weeks later.  Susan, in a negligee, is at the window.  
          There are the remains of her breakfast tray on a little table.

                                    SUSAN
                        You don't propose to have yourself 
                        made ridiculous?  What about me?
                        I'm the one that has to do the 
                        singing.  I'm the one that gets 
                        the razzberries.
                               (pauses)
                        Last week, when I was shopping, 
                        one of the salesgirls did an 
                        imitation of me for another girl.  
                        She thought I didn't see her, but -  
                        Charlie, you might as well make up 
                        your mind to it.  This is one thing 
                        you're not going to have your own 
                        way about.  I can't sing and you 
                        know it -  Why can't you just -

          Kane rises and walks toward her.  There is cold menace in his 
          walk.  Susan shrinks a little as he draws closer to her.

                                    KANE
                        My reasons satisfy me, Susan.  You 
                        seem unable to understand them.  I 
                        will not tell them to you again.
                               (he is very close 
                               to her)
                        You will continue with your singing.

          His eyes are relentlessly upon her.  She sees something in 
          them that frightens her.  She nods her head slowly, indicating 
          surrender.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          Front page of the "San Francisco Enquirer" containing a large 
          portrait of Susan as Thais (as before).  It is announced that 
          Susan will open an independent season in San Francisco in 
          "Thais."  The picture remains constant but the names of the 
          papers change from New York to St. Louis, to Los Angeles to 
          Cleveland, to Denver to Philadelphia - all "Enquirers."

          During all this, on the soundtrack, Susan's voice is heard 
          singing her aria very faintly and far away, her voice cracking 
          a little.

          At the conclusion of this above, Susan has finished her song, 
          and there is the same mild applause as before - over the sound 
          of this, one man loudly applauding.  This fades out as we -

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. SUSAN'S BEDROOM - KANE'S NEW YORK HOME - LATE NIGHT -

          The camera angles across the bed and Susan's form towards the 
          door, from the other side of which voices can be heard.

                                    KANE'S VOICE
                        Let's have your keys, Raymond.

                                    RAYMOND'S VOICE
                        Yes, sir.

                                    KANE'S VOICE
                        The key must be in the other side.

                        We'll knock the door down, Raymond.

                                    RAYMOND'S VOICE
                               (calling)
                        Mrs. Kane -

                                    KANE'S VOICE
                        Do what I say.

          The door crashes open, light floods in the room, revealing 
          Susan, fully dressed, stretched out on the bed, one arm dangling 
          over the side.  Kane rushes to her.

                                    KANE
                        Get Dr. Corey.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes, sir.

          He rushes out.  Susan is breathing, but heavily.  Kane loosens 
          the lace collar at her throat.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. SUSAN'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT -

          A little later.  All the lights are lit.  Susan, in a nightgown, 
          is in bed, asleep.  Raymond and a nurse are just leaving the 
          room, Raymond closing the door quietly behind him.  Dr. Corey 
          rises.

                                    DR. COREY
                        She'll be perfectly all right in a 
                        day or two, Mr. Kane.

          Kane nods.  He has a small bottle in his hand.

                                    DR. COREY
                        The nurse has complete instructions, 
                        but if you care to talk to me at 
                        any time, I should be only too 
                        glad -  I shall be here in the 
                        morning.

                                    KANE
                        Thank you.  I can't imagine how 
                        Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly 
                        mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner 
                        gave her is in a somewhat larger 
                        bottle -  I suppose the strain of 
                        preparing for her trip has excited 
                        and confused her.

                                    DR. COREY
                        I'm sure that's it.
                               (he starts out)

                                    KANE
                        There are no objections to my 
                        staying here with her, are there?

                                    DR. COREY
                        Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to 
                        be here, too.

                                    KANE
                        Of course.

          Dr. Corey leaves.  Kane settles himself in a chair next to the 
          bed, looking at Susan.  In a moment, the nurse enters, goes to 
          a chair in the corner of the room, and sits down.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. SUSAN'S ROOM - DAY -

          Susan, utterly spent, is lying flat on her back in her bed.  
          Kane is in the chair beside her.  The nurse is out of the room.

                                    SUSAN
                               (in a voice that 
                               comes from far 
                               away)
                        I couldn't make you see how I felt, 
                        Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I 
                        couldn't go threw with singing 
                        again.  You don't know what it 
                        means to feel - to know that people - 
                        that an audience don't want you.  
                        That if you haven't got what they 
                        want - a real voice -
                        they just don't care about you.  
                        Even when they're polite - and 
                        they don't laugh or get restless 
                        or - you know...  They don't want 
                        you.  They just -

                                    KANE
                               (angrily)
                        That's when you've got to fight 
                        them.  That's when you've got to 
                        make them.  That's -

          Susan's head turns and she looks at him silently with pathetic 
          eyes.

                                    KANE
                        I'm sorry.
                               (he leans over to 
                               pat her hand)
                        You won't have to fight them 
                        anymore.
                               (he smiles a little)
                        It's their loss.

          Gratefully, Susan, with difficulty, brings her other hand over 
          to cover his.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOT OF XANADU - HALF BUILT

          INT. THE GRAND HALL IN XANADU -

          Closeup of an enormous jigsaw puzzle.  A hand is putting in 
          the last piece.  Camera moves back to reveal jigsaw puzzle 
          spread out on the floor.

          Susan is on the floor before her jigsaw puzzle.  Kane is in an 
          easy chair.  Behind them towers the massive Renaissance 
          fireplace.  It is night and Baroque candelabra illuminates the 
          scene.

                                    SUSAN
                               (with a sigh)
                        What time is it?

          There is no answer.

                                    SUSAN
                        Charlie!  I said, what time is it?

                                    KANE
                               (looks up - consults 
                               his watch)
                        Half past eleven.

                                    SUSAN
                        I mean in New York.

                                    KANE
                        Half past eleven.

                                    SUSAN
                        At night?

                                    KANE
                        Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to 
                        press.

                                    SUSAN
                               (sarcastically)
                        Hurray for the bulldog!
                               (sighs)
                        Half past eleven!  The shows have 
                        just let out.  People are going to 
                        night clubs and restaurants.  Of 
                        course, we're different.  We live 
                        in a palace - at the end of the 
                        world.

                                    KANE
                        You always said you wanted to live 
                        in a palace.

                                    SUSAN
                        Can't we go back, Charlie?

          Kane looks at her smilingly and turns back to his work.

                                    SUSAN
                        Charlie -

          Another picture puzzle.

          Camera pulls back to show Kane and Susan in much the same 
          positions as before, except that they are older.

                                    KANE
                        One thing I've never been able to 
                        understand, Susan.  How do you 
                        know you haven't done them before?

          Susan shoots him an angry glance.  She isn't amused.

                                    SUSAN
                        It makes a whole lot more sense 
                        than collecting Venuses.

                                    KANE
                        You may be right -  I sometimes 
                        wonder - but you get into the
                        habit -

                                    SUSAN
                               (snapping)
                        It's not a habit.  I do it because 
                        I like it.

                                    KANE
                        I was referring to myself.
                               (pauses)
                        I thought we might have a picnic 
                        tomorrow - it might be a nice change 
                        after the Wild West party tonight.  
                        Invite everybody to go to the

                               (throws down a piece 
                               of the jigsaw puzzle 
                               and rises)
                        Invite everybody!  Order everybody, 
                        you mean, and make them sleep in 
                        tents!  Who wants to sleep in tents 
                        when they have a nice room of their
                        own - with their own bath, where 
                        they know where everything is?

          Kane has looked at her steadily, not hostilely.

                                    KANE
                        I thought we might invite everybody 
                        to go on a picnic tomorrow.  Stay 
                        at Everglades overnight.
                               (he pats her lightly 
                               on the shoulder)
                        Please see that the arrangements 
                        are made, Susan.

          Kane turns away - to Bernstein.

                                    KANE
                        You remember my son, Mr. Bernstein.

          On the soundtrack we hear the following lines of dialogue:

          During this, camera holds on closeup of Susan's face.  She is 
          very angry.

          Two real beds have been set up on each side of the tent.  A 
          rather classy dressing table is in the rear, at which Susan is 
          preparing for bed.  Kane, in his shirt-sleeves, is in an easy 
          chair, reading.  Susan is very sullen.

                                    SUSAN
                        I'm not going to put up with it.

          Kane turns to look at her.

                                    SUSAN
                        I mean it.

                               flicker on Kane's 
                               face)
                        Oh, I know I always say I mean it, 
                        and then I don't - or you get me 
                        so don't do what I say I'm going 
                        to - but -

                                    KANE
                               (interrupting)
                        You're in a tent, darling.  You're 
                        not at home.  And I can hear you 
                        very well if you just talk in a 
                        normal tone of voice.

                                    SUSAN
                        I'm not going to have my guests
                        insulted, just because you think -

                        - if people want to bring a drink 
                        or two along on a picnic, that's
                        their business.  You've got no 
                        right -

                                    KANE
                               (quickly)
                        I've got more than a right as far 
                        as you're concerned, Susan.

                                    SUSAN
                        Oh, I'm sick and tired of you 
                        telling me what I must and what I 
                        musn't do!

                                    KANE
                               (gently)
                        You're my wife, Susan, and -

                                    SUSAN
                        I'm not just your wife, I'm a person 
                        all by myself - or I ought to be.  
                        I was once.  Sometimes you get me 
                        to believing I never was.

                                    KANE
                        We can discuss all this some other
                        time, Susan.  Right now -

                                    SUSAN
                        I'll discuss what's on my mind 
                        when I want to.  You're not going 
                        to keep on running my life the way 
                        you want it.

                                    KANE
                        As far as you're concerned, Susan, 
                        I've never wanted anything -  I 
                        don't want anything now - except 
                        what you want.

                                    SUSAN
                        What you want me to want, you mean.
                        What you've decided I ought to 
                        have - what you'd want if you were 
                        me.  But you've never given me 
                        anything that -

                                    KANE
                        Susan, I really think -

                                    SUSAN
                        Oh, I don't mean the things you've 
                        given me - that don't mean anything 
                        to you.  What's the difference 
                        between giving me a bracelet or 
                        giving somebody else a hundred 
                        thousand dollars for a statue you're 
                        going to keep crated up and never 
                        look at?  It's only money.  It 
                        doesn't mean anything.  You're not 
                        really giving anything that belongs 
                        to you, that you care about.

                                    KANE
                               (he has risen)
                        Susan, I want you to stop this.
                        And right now!

                                    SUSAN
                        Well, I'm not going to stop it.  
                        I'm going to say exactly what I 
                        think.
                               (she screams)
                        You've never given me anything.  
                        You've tried to buy me into giving 
                        you something.  You're -
                               (a sudden notion)
                        - it's like you were bribing me!  
                        That's what it's been from the 
                        first moment I met you.  No matter 
                        how much it cost you - your time, 
                        your money - that's what you've 
                        done with everybody you've ever 
                        known.  Tried to bribe them!

                                    KANE
                        Susan!

          She looks at him, with no lessening of her passion.

                                    KANE
                        You're talking an incredible amount 
                        of nonsense, Susan.
                               (quietly)
                        Whatever I do -  I do - because I 
                        love you.

                                    SUSAN
                        Love!  You don't love anybody!  Me 
                        or anybody else!  You want to be 
                        loved - that's all you want!  I'm 
                        Charles Foster Kane.  Whatever you 
                        want - just name it and it's yours!
                        Only love me!  Don't expect me to
                        love you -

          Without a word, Kane slaps her across the face.  They look at 
          each other.

                                    SUSAN
                        You - you hit me.

          Kane continues to look at her.

                                    SUSAN
                        You'll never have another chance 
                        to hit me again.
                               (pauses)
                        Never knew till this minute -

                                    KANE
                        Susan, it seems to me -

                                    SUSAN
                        Don't tell me you're sorry.

                                    KANE
                        I'm not sorry.

                                    SUSAN
                        I'm going to leave you.

                                    KANE
                        No, you're not.

                                    SUSAN
                               (nods)
                        Yes.

          They look at each other, fixedly, but she doesn't give way.  
          In fact, the camera on Kane's face shows the beginning of a 
          startled look, as of one who sees something unfamiliar and 
          unbelievable.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. KANE'S STUDY - XANADU - DAY -

          Kane is a the window looking out.  He turns as he hears Raymond 
          enter.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Mrs. Kane would like to see you, 
                        Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        All right.

          Raymond waits as Kane hesitates.

                                    KANE
                        Is Mrs. Kane -
                               (he can't finish)

                                    RAYMOND
                        Marie has been packing since 
                        morning, Mr. Kane.

          Kane impetuously walks past him out of the room.

          INT. SUSAN'S ROOM - XANADU - DAY -

          Packed suitcases are on the floor, Susan is completely dressed 
          for travelling.  Kane bursts into the room.

                                    SUSAN
                        Tell Arnold I'm ready, Marie.  He 
                        can get the bags.

                                    MARIE
                        Yes, Mrs. Kane.

          She leaves.  Kane closes the door behind her.

                                    KANE
                        Have you gone completely crazy?

          Susan looks at him.

                                    KANE
                        Don't you realize that everybody 
                        here is going to know about this?
                        That you've packed your bags and
                        ordered the car and -

                                    SUSAN
                        - And left?  Of course they'll
                        hear.  I'm not saying goodbye -
                        except to you - but I never imagined 
                        that people wouldn't know.

          Kane is standing against the door as if physically barring her 
          way.

                                    KANE
                        I won't let you go.

                                    SUSAN
                        You can't stop me.

          Kane keeps looking at her.  Susan reaches out her hand.

                                    SUSAN
                        Goodbye, Charlie.

                                    KANE
                               (suddenly)
                        Don't go, Susan.

                                    SUSAN
                        Let's not start all over again, 
                        Charlie.  We've said everything 
                        that can be said.

                                    KANE
                        Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!

          He has lost all pride.  Susan stops.  She is affected by this.

                                    KANE
                        You mustn't go, Susan.  
                        Everything'll be exactly the way 
                        you want it.  Not the way I think 
                        you want it - by your way.  Please, 
                        Susan - Susan!

          She is staring at him.  She might weaken.

                                    KANE
                        Don't go, Susan!  You mustn't go!
                               (almost blubbering)
                        You - you can't do this to me,
                        Susan -

          It's as if he had thrown ice water into her face.  She freezes.

                                    SUSAN
                        I see - it's you that this is being 
                        done to!  It's not me at all.  Not 
                        how I feel.  Not what it means to 
                        me.
                               (she laughs)
                        I can't do this to you!
                               (she looks at him)
                        Oh, yes I can.

          She walks out, past Kane, who turns to watch her go, like a 
          very tired old man.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          INT. "EL RANCHO" CABARET - NIGHT -

          Susan and Thompson at a table.  There is silence between them 
          for a moment.

                                    SUSAN
                        In case you've never heard of how 
                        I lost all my money - and it was
                        plenty, believe me -

                                    THOMPSON
                        The last ten years have been tough 
                        on a lot of people.

                                    SUSAN
                        They haven't been tough on me.  I 
                        just lost my money.  But when I 
                        compare these last ten years with
                        the twenty I spent with him -

                                    THOMPSON
                        I feel kind of sorry for him, all
                        the same -

                                    SUSAN
                               (harshly)
                        Don't you think I do?
                               (pause)
                        You say you're going down to Xanadu?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Monday, with some of the boys from 
                        the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants 
                        the whole place photographed 
                        carefully - all that art stuff.  
                        We run a picture magazine, you 
                        know -

                                    SUSAN
                        I know.  If you're smart, you'll 
                        talk to Raymond.  That's the butler.
                        You can learn a lot from him.  He 
                        knows where the bodies are buried.

          She shivers.  The dawn light from the skylight above has grown 
          brighter, making the artificial light in the night club look 
          particularly ghastly, revealing mercilessly every year of 
          Susan's age.

                                    SUSAN
                        Well, what do you know?  It's 
                        morning already.
                               (looks at him)
                        You must come around and tell me 
                        the story of your life sometime.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:

          INT. GREAT HALL - XANADU - NIGHT -

          An open door shows the pantry, which is dark.  Thompson and 
          Raymond are at a table.  There is a pitcher of beer and a plate 
          of sandwiches before them.  Raymond drinks a glass of beer and 
          settles back.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to 
                        handle the old man.  He was kind 
                        of queer, but I knew how to handle 
                        him.

                                    THOMPSON
                        Queer?

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yeah.  I guess he wasn't very happy 
                        those last years - he didn't have
                        much reason to be -

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CORRIDOR AND TELEGRAPH OFFICE - XANADU - NIGHT -

          Raymond walking rapidly along corridor.  He pushes open a door.  
          At a desk in a fairly elaborate telegraph office sits a wireless 
          operator named Fred.  Near him at a telephone switchboard sits 
          a female operator named Katherine (not that it matters).

                                    RAYMOND
                               (reading)
                        Mr. Charles Foster Kane announced 
                        today that Mrs. Charles Foster 
                        Kane has left Xanadu, his Florida 
                        home, under the terms of a peaceful 
                        and friendly agreement with the 
                        intention of filing suit for divorce 
                        at an early date.  Mrs. Kane said 
                        that she does not intend to return 
                        to the operatic career which she 
                        gave up a few years after her 
                        marriage, at Mr.  Kane's request.  
                        Signed, Charles Foster Kane.

          Fred finishes typing and then looks up.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Exclusive for immediate 
                        transmission.  Urgent priority all 
                        Kane papers.

                                    FRED
                        Okay.

          There is the sound of the buzzer on the switchboard.  Katherine 
          puts in a plug and answers the call.

                                    KATHERINE
                        Yes ... yes...  Mrs. Tinsdall -
                        Very well.
                               (turns to Raymond)
                        It's the housekeeper.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes?

                                    KATHERINE
                        She says there's some sort of 
                        disturbance up in Mrs. Alexander's 
                        room.  She's afraid to go in.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUSAN'S BEDROOM - XANADU - NIGHT -

          The housekeeper, Mrs. Tinsdall, and a couple of maids are near 
          the door but are too afraid to be in front of it.  From inside 
          can be heard a terrible banging and crashing.  Raymond hurries 
          into scene, opens the door and goes in.

          INT. SUSAN'S BEDROOM - XANADU -

          Kane, in a truly terrible and absolutely silent rage, is 
          literally breaking up the room - yanking pictures, hooks and 
          all off the wall, smashing them to bits - ugly, gaudy pictures - 
          Susie's pictures in Susie's bad taste.  Off of occasional 
          tables, bureaus, he sweeps Susie's whorish accumulation of 
          bric-a-brac.

          Raymond stands in the doorway watching him.  Kane says nothing.  
          He continues with tremendous speed and surprising strength, 
          still wordlessly, tearing the room to bits.  The curtains (too 
          frilly - overly pretty) are pulled off the windows in a single 
          gesture, and from the bookshelves he pulls down double armloads 
          of cheap novels - discovers a half-empty bottle of liquor and 
          dashes it across the room.  Finally he stops.  Susie's cozy 
          little chamber is an incredible shambles all around him.

          He stands for a minute breathing heavily, and his eye lights 
          on a hanging what-not in a corner which had escaped his notice.  
          Prominent on its center shelf is the little glass ball with 
          the snowstorm in it.  He yanks it down.  Something made of 
          china breaks, but not the glass ball.  It bounces on the carpet 
          and rolls to his feet, the snow in a flurry.  His eye follows 
          it.  He stoops to pick it up - can't make it.  Raymond picks 
          it up for him; hands it to him.  Kane takes it sheepishly - 
          looks at it - moves painfully out of the room into the corridor.

          INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUSAN'S BEDROOM - XANADU -

          Kane comes out of the door.  Mrs. Tinsdall has been joined now 
          by a fairly sizable turnout of servants.  They move back away 
          from Kane, staring at him.  Raymond is in the doorway behind 
          Kane.  Kane looks at the glass ball.

                                    KANE
                               (without turning)
                        Close the door, Raymond.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes, sir.
                               (he closes it)

                                    KANE
                        Lock it - and keep it locked.

          Raymond locks the door and comes to his side.  There is a long 
          pause - servants staring in silence.  Kane gives the glass 
          ball a gentle shake and starts another snowstorm.

                                    KANE
                        Raymond -
                               (he is almost in a 
                               trance)

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes, sir -

          One of the younger servants giggles and is hushed up.  Kane 
          shakes the ball again.  Another flurry of snow.  He watches 
          the flakes settle - then looks up.  Finally, taking in the 
          pack of servants and something of the situations, he puts the 
          glass ball in his coat pocket.  He speaks very quietly to 
          Raymond, so quietly it only seems he's talking to himself.

                                    KANE
                        Keep it locked.

          He slowly walks off down the corridor, the servants giving way 
          to let him pass, and watching him as he goes.  He is an old, 
          old man!

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. KANE'S CHAPEL - XANADU - LATE AFTERNOON -

          As the dissolve completes itself, camera is travellling across 
          the floor of the chapel past the crypts of Kane's father and 
          mother - (marked: James Kane - 18- TO 19-; Mary Kane - 18- TO 
          19-;) - past a blank crypt, and then holding on the burial of 
          Kane's son.  A group of ordinary workmen in ordinary clothes 
          are lowering a very expensive-looking coffin into its crypt.  
          Kane stands nearby with Raymond, looking on.  The men strain 
          and grunt as the coffin bangs on the stone floor.  The men now 
          place over it a long marble slab on which is cut the words:

          CHARLES FOSTER KANE II.

          1907 - 1938

                                    ONE OF THE WORKMEN
                        Sorry, Mr. Kane, we won't be able
                        to cement it till tommorrow.  We -

          Kane looks right through him.  Raymond cuts him short.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Okay.

          The men tip their hats and shuffle out of the chapel.  Kane 
          raises his head, looks at the inscription on the wall.  It is 
          a little to one side of Junior's grave, directly over the blank 
          place which will be occupied by Kane himself.

                                    KANE
                        Do you like poetry, Raymond?

                                    RAYMOND
                        Can't say, sir.

                                    KANE
                        Mrs. Kane liked poetry -

          Raymond is now convinced that the old master is very far gone 
          indeed - not to say off his trolley.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        Not my wife - not either of them.

          He looks at the grave next to his son's - the grave marked 
          "MARY KANE."

                                    RAYMOND
                               (catching on)
                        Oh, yes, sir.

                                    KANE
                               (looking back up at 
                               the wall)
                        Do you know what that is?

                                    RAYMOND
                               (more his keeper 
                               than his butler 
                               now)
                        It's a wall you bought in China, 
                        Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        Persia.  It belonged to a king.

                                    RAYMOND
                        How did you get him to part with 
                        it, Mr. Kane?

                                    KANE
                        He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do 
                        you know what it means?

                                    RAYMOND
                        No, I don't, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        I didn't used to be afraid of it.

          A short pause.  His eyes still on the wall, but looking through 
          it, Kane quotes the translation.

                                    KANE
                        The drunkeness of youth has passed 
                        like a fever, And yet I saw many 
                        things, Seeing my glory in the 
                        days of my glory, I thought my 
                        power eternal And the days of my 
                        life Fixed surely in the years But 
                        a whisper came to me From Him who 
                        dies not.  I called my tributary 
                        kings together And those who were 
                        proud rulers under me, I opened 
                        the boxes of my treasure to them, 
                        saying: "Take hills of gold, 
                        moutains of silver, And give me 
                        only one more day upon the earth."
                        But they stood silent, Looking 
                        upon the ground; So that I died 
                        And Death came to sit upon my 
                        throne.  O sons of men You see a 
                        stranger upon the road, You call 
                        to him and he does not step.  He 
                        is your life Walking towards time, 
                        Hurrying to meet the kings of India 
                        and China.
                               (quoting)
                        O sons of men You are caught in 
                        the web of the world And the spider 
                        Nothing waits behind it.  Where 
                        are the men with towering hopes?
                        They have changed places with owls, 
                        Owls who have lived in tombs And 
                        now inhabit a palace.

          Kane still stares at the wall, through it, and way beyond it.  
          Raymond looks at him.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          INT. GREAT HALL - XANADU - NIGHT -

          Thompson and Raymond.  Raymond has finished his beer.

                                    RAYMOND
                               (callously)
                        That's the whole works, right up 
                        to date.

                                    THOMPSON
                        Sentimental fellow, aren't you?

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes and no.

                                    THOMPSON
                               (getting to his 
                               feet)
                        Well, thanks a lot.

                                    RAYMOND
                        See what I mean?  He was a little 
                        gone in the head - the last couple 
                        of years, anyway - but I knew how 
                        to handle him.
                               (rises)
                        That "Rosebud" - that don't mean 
                        anything.  I heard him say it.
                        He just said "Rosebud" and then he 
                        dropped that glass ball and it 
                        broke on the floor.  He didn't say 
                        anything about that, so I knew he 
                        was dead - He said all kind of 
                        things I couldn't make out.  But I 
                        knew how to take care of him.

          Thompson doesn't answer.

                        You can go on asking questions if 
                        you want to.

                               (coldly)
                        We're leaving tonight.  As soon as 
                        they're through photographing
                        the stuff -

          Thompson has risen.  Raymond gets to his feet and goes to the 
          door, opening it for him.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Allow yourself plenty of time.  
                        The train stops at the Junction On 
                        signal - but they don't like to 
                        wait.  Not now.  I can remember 
                        when they'd wait all day ... if 
                        Mr. Kane said so.

          Raymond ushes Thompson into

          INT. THE GREAT HALL - XANADU - NIGHT -

          The magnificent tapestries, candelabra, etc., are still there, 
          but now several large packing cases are piled against the walls, 
          some broken open, some shut and a number of objects, great and 
          small, are piled pell mell all over the place.  Furniture, 
          statues, paintings, bric-a-brac - things of obviously enormous 
          value are standing beside a kitchen stove, an old rocking chair 
          and other junk, among which is also an old sled, the self-same 
          story.  Somewhere in the back, one of the vast Gothic windows 
          of the hall is open and a light wind blows through the scene, 
          rustling the papers.

          In the center of the hall, a Photographer and his Assistant 
          are busy photographing the sundry objects.  The floor is 
          littered with burnt-out flash bulbs.  They continue their work 
          throughout the early part of the scene so that now and then a 
          flash bulb goes off.  In addition to the Photographer and his 
          Assistant, there are a Girl and Two Newspaperment - the Second 
          and Third Men of the projection room scene - also Thompson and 
          Raymond.

          The Girl and the Second Man, who wears a hat, are dancing 
          somewhere in the back of the hall to the music of a phonograph.  
          A flash bulb goes off.  The Photographer has just photographed 
          a picture, obviously of great value, an Italian primitive.  
          The Assistant consults a label on the back of it.

                                    ASSISTANT
                        NO. 9182

          The Third Newspaperman starts to jot this information down.

                        cost 45,000 lira.  Got that?

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                        Yeah.

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        All right!  Next!  Better get that 
                        statue over there.

                                    ASSISTANT
                        Okay.

          The Photographer and his Assitant start to move off with their 
          equipment towards a large sculpture in another part of the 
          hall.

                                    RAYMOND
                        What do you think all that is worth, 
                        Mr. Thompson?

                                    THOMPSON

                        The banks are out of luck, eh?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear 
                        all right.

                        That's a lot of money to pay for a 
                        dame without a head.

                        Okay.

          A flashlight bulb goes off.

                                    SECOND ASSISTANT
                        We're all set to get everything.  
                        The junk as well as the art.

          Thompson has opened a box and is idly playing with a handful 
          of little pieces of cardboard.

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                        What's that?

                                    RAYMOND
                        It's a jigsaw puzzle.

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                        We got a lot of those.  There's a 
                        Burmese Temple and three Spanish 
                        ceilings down the hall.

          Raymond laughs.

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Yeah, all in crates.

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                        There's a part of a Scotch castle 
                        over there, but we haven't bothered 
                        to unwrap it.

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        I wonder how they put all those 
                        pieces together?

                                    ASSISTANT

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Put it over by that statue.  It'll 
                        make a good setup.

                                    GIRL
                               (calling out)
                        Who is she anyway?

                                    SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN
                        Venus.  She always is.

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                        He sure liked to collect things, 
                        didn't he?

                                    RAYMOND
                        He went right on buying - right up 
                        to the end.

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Anything and everything - he was a 
                        regular crow.

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                        wonder -  You put all this together -
                        the palaces and the paintings and 
                        the toys and everything - what 
                        would it spell?

          Thompson has turned around.  He is facing the camera for the 
          first time.

                                    THOMPSON
                        Charles Foster Kane.

          Another flash bulb goes off.  The Photographer turns to Thompson 
          with a grin.

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Or Rosebud?  How about it, Jerry?

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                               (to the dancers)
                        Turn that thing off, will you?  
                        It's driving me nuts!  What's 
                        Rosebud?

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Kane's last words, aren't they, 
                        Jerry?
                               (to the Third 
                               Newspaperman)
                        That was Jerry's angle, wasn't it, 
                        Jerry?  Did you ever find out what 
                        it means, Jerry?

                                    THOMPSON
                        No, I didn't.

          The music has stopped.  The dancers have come over to Thompson.

                                    SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN
                        Say, what did you find out about 
                        him, anyway, Jerry?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Not much.

                                    SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN
                        Well, what have you been doing?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Playing with a jigsaw puzzle -   I 
                        talked to a lot of people who knew 
                        him.

                                    GIRL
                        What do they say?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Well - it's become a very clear 
                        picture.  He was the most honest 
                        man who ever lived, with a streak 
                        of crookedness a yard wide.  He 
                        was a liberal and a reactionary; 
                        he was tolerant - "Live and Let 
                        Live" - that was his motto.  But 
                        he had no use for anybody who 
                        disagreed with him on any point, 
                        no matter how small it was.  He 
                        was a loving husband and a good 
                        father - and both his wives left 
                        him and his son got himself killed 
                        about as shabbily as you can do 
                        it.  He had a gift for friendship 
                        such as few men have - he broke 
                        his oldest friend's heart like 
                        you'd throw away a cigarette
                        you were through with.  Outside of 
                        that -

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                        Okay, okay.

                                    GIRL
                        What about Rosebud?  Don't you 
                        think that explains anything?

                                    THOMPSON
                        No, I don't.  Not much anway.  
                        Charles Foster Kane was a man who 
                        got everything he wanted, and then 
                        lost it.  Maybe Rosebud was 
                        something he couldn't get or lost.  
                        No, I don't think it explains
                        anything.  I don't think any word 
                        explains a man's life.  No -  I 
                        guess Rosebud is just a piece in a 
                        jigsaw puzzle - a missing piece.

          He drops the jigsaw pieces back into the box, looking at his 
          watch.

                                    THOMPSON
                        We'd better get along.  We'll miss 
                        the train.

          He picks up his overcoat - it has been resting on a little 
          sled - the little sled young Charles Foster Kane hit Thatcher 
          with at the opening of the picture.  Camera doesn't close in 
          on this.  It just registers the sled as the newspaper people, 
          picking up their clothes and equipment, move out of the great 
          hall.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CELLAR - XANADU - NIGHT -

          A large furnace, with an open door, dominates the scene.  Two 
          laborers, with shovels, are shovelling things into the furnace.  
          Raymond is about ten feet away.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Throw that junk in, too.

          Camera travels to the pile that he has indicated.  It is mostly 
          bits of broken packing cases, excelsior, etc.  The sled is on 
          top of the pile.  As camera comes close, it shows the faded 
          rosebud and, though the letters are faded, unmistakably the 
          word "ROSEBUD" across it.  The laborer drops his shovel, takes 
          the sled in his hand and throws it into the furnace.  The flames 
          start to devour it.

          EXT. XANADU - NIGHT -

          No lights are to be seen.  Smoke is coming from a chimney.

          Camera reverses the path it took at the beginning of the 
          picture, perhaps omitting some of the stages.  It moves finally 
          through the gates, which close behind it.  As camera pauses 
          for a moment, the letter "K" is prominent in the moonlight.

          Just before we fade out, there comes again into the picture 
          the pattern of barbed wire and cyclone fencing.  On the fence 
          is a sign which reads:

          "PRIVATE - NO TRESPASSING"

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          All around this is an almost totally black screen.  Now, as 
          the camera moves slowly towards the window which is almost a 
          postage stamp in the frame, other forms appear; barbed wire, 
          cyclone fencing, and now, looming up against an early morning 
          sky, enormous iron grille work.  Camera travels up what is now 
          shown to be a gateway of gigantic proportions and holds on the 
          top of it - a huge initial "K" showing darker and darker against 
          the dawn sky.  Through this and beyond we see the fairy-tale 
          mountaintop of Xanadu, the great castle a sillhouette as its 
          summit, the little window a distant accent in the darkness.

                                     

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          A SERIES OF SET -UPS, EACH CLOSER TO THE GREAT WINDOW, ALL 
          TELLING SOMETHING OF: 

          The literally incredible domain of CHARLES FOSTER KANE.

          Its right flank resting for nearly forty miles on the Gulf 
          Coast, it truly extends in all directions farther than the eye 
          can see.  Designed by nature to be almost completely bare and 
          flat - it was, as will develop, practically all marshland when 
          Kane acquired and changed its face - it is now pleasantly 
          uneven, with its fair share of rolling hills and one very good-
          sized mountain, all man-made.  Almost all the land is improved, 
          either through cultivation for farming purposes of through 
          careful landscaping, in the shape of parks and lakes.  The 
          castle dominates itself, an enormous pile, compounded of several 
          genuine castles, of European origin, of varying architecture - 
          dominates the scene, from the very peak of the mountain.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          GOLF LINKS (MINIATURE)

          Past which we move.  The greens are straggly and overgrown, 
          the fairways wild with tropical weeds, the links unused and 
          not seriously tended for a long time.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

                                                               DISSOLVE IN:

          WHAT WAS ONCE A GOOD-SIZED ZOO (MINIATURE)

          Of the Hagenbeck type.  All that now remains, with one 
          exception, are the individual plots, surrounded by moats, on 
          which the animals are kept, free and yet safe from each other 
          and the landscape at large.  (Signs on several of the plots 
          indicate that here there were once tigers, lions, girrafes.)

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          THE MONKEY TERRACE (MINIATURE)

          In the foreground, a great obscene ape is outlined against the 
          dawn murk.  He is scratching himself slowly, thoughtfully, 
          looking out across the estates of Charles Foster Kane, to the 
          distant light glowing in the castle on the hill.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          THE ALLIGATOR PIT (MINIATURE)

          The idiot pile of sleepy dragons.  Reflected in the muddy water - 
          the lighted window.

          THE LAGOON (MINIATURE)

          The boat landing sags.  An old newspaper floats on the surface 
          of the water - a copy of the New York Enquirer."  As it moves 
          across the frame, it discloses again the reflection of the 
          window in the castle, closer than before.

          THE GREAT SWIMMING POOL (MINIATURE)

          It is empty.  A newspaper blows across the cracked floor of 
          the tank.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          THE COTTAGES (MINIATURE)

          In the shadows, literally the shadows, of the castle.  As we 
          move by, we see that their doors and windows are boarded up 
          and locked, with heavy bars as further protection and sealing.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

                                                               DISSOLVE IN:

          A DRAWBRIDGE (MINIATURE)

          Over a wide moat, now stagnant and choked with weeds.  We move 
          across it and through a huge solid gateway into a formal garden, 
          perhaps thirty yards wide and one hundred yards deep, which 
          extends right up to the very wall of the castle.  The 
          landscaping surrounding it has been sloppy and causal for a 
          long time, but this particular garden has been kept up in 
          perfect shape.  As the camera makes its way through it, towards 
          the lighted window of the castle, there are revealed rare and 
          exotic blooms of all kinds.  The dominating note is one of 
          almost exaggerated tropical lushness, hanging limp and 
          despairing.  Moss, moss, moss.  Ankor Wat, the night the last 
          King died.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          THE WINDOW (MINIATURE)

          Camera moves in until the frame of the window fills the frame 
          of the screen.  Suddenly, the light within goes out.  This 
          stops the action of the camera and cuts the music which has 
          been accompanying the sequence.  In the glass panes of the 
          window, we see reflected the ripe, dreary landscape of Mr. 
          Kane's estate behind and the dawn sky.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. KANE'S BEDROOM - FAINT DAWN -

          A very long shot of Kane's enormous bed, silhouetted against 
          the enormous window.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. KANE'S BEDROOM - FAINT DAWN - SNOW SCENE.  

          An incredible one.  Big, impossible flakes of snow, a too 
          picturesque farmhouse and a snow man.  The jingling of sleigh 
          bells in the musical score now makes an ironic reference to 
          Indian Temple bells - the music freezes -

           

                                    KANE'S OLD OLD VOICE
                        Rosebud...

          The camera pulls back, showing the whole scene to be contained 
          in one of those glass balls which are sold in novelty stores 
          all over the world.  A hand - Kane's hand, which has been 
          holding the ball, relaxes.  The ball falls out of his hand and 
          bounds down two carpeted steps leading to the bed, the camera 
          following.  The ball falls off the last step onto the marble 
          floor where it breaks, the fragments glittering in the first 
          rays of the morning sun.  This ray cuts an angular pattern 
          across the floor, suddenly crossed with a thousand bars of 
          light as the blinds are pulled across the window.

          The foot of Kane's bed.  The camera very close.  Outlined 
          against the shuttered window, we can see a form - the form of 
          a nurse, as she pulls the sheet up over his head.  The camera 
          follows this action up the length of the bed and arrives at 
          the face after the sheet has covered it.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:

          INT. OF A MOTION PICTURE PROJECTION ROOM

          On the screen as the camera moves in are the words:

                                   "MAIN TITLE"

          Stirring, brassy music is heard on the soundtrack (which, of 
          course, sounds more like a soundtrack than ours.)

          The screen in the projection room fills our screen as the second 
          title appears:

                                    "CREDITS"

          NOTE:  Here follows a typical news digest short, one of the 
          regular monthly or bi-monthly features, based on public events 
          or personalities.  These are distinguished from ordinary 
          newsreels and short subjects in that they have a fully developed 
          editorial or storyline.  Some of the more obvious 
          characteristics of the "March of Time," for example, as well 
          as other documentary shorts, will be combined to give an 
          authentic impression of this now familiar type of short subject.  
          As is the accepted procedure in these short subjects, a narrator 
          is used as well as explanatory titles.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          A great number of headlines, set in different types and 
          different styles, obviously from different papers, all 
          announcing Kane's death, all appearing over photographs of 
          Kane himself (perhaps a fifth of the headlines are in foreign 
          languages).  An important item in connection with the headlines 
          is that many of them - positively not all - reveal passionately 
          conflicting opinions about Kane.  Thus, they contain variously 
          the words "patriot," "democrat," "pacifist," "war-monger," 
          "traitor," "idealist," "American," etc.

                        The magnificent Enquirer Building 
                        of today.

          1891-1911 - a map of the USA, covering the entire screen, which 
          in animated diagram shows the Kane publications spreading from 
          city to city.  Starting from New York, minature newboys speed 
          madly to Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis, Los Angeles, San 
          Francisco, Washington, Atlanta, El Paso, etc., screaming 
          "Wuxtry, Kane Papers, Wuxtry."

          Shot of a large mine going full blast, chimneys belching smoke, 
          trains moving in and out, etc.  A large sign reads "Colorado 
          Lode Mining Co." (1940)  Sign reading; "Little Salem, CO - 25 
          MILES."

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          An old still shot of Little Salem as it was 70 years ago 
          (identified by copper-plate caption beneath the still). (1870)

          Shot of early tintype stills of Thomas Foster Kane and his 
          wife, Mary, on their wedding day.  A similar picture of Mary 
          Kane some four or five years later with her little boy, Charles 
          Foster Kane.

                        Fifty-seven years later, before a 
                        Congressional Investigation, Walter 
                        P.  Thatcher, grand old man of 
                        Wall Street, for years chief target 
                        of Kane papers' attack on "trusts," 
                        recalls a journey he made as a 
                        youth...

          Shot of Capitol, in Washington D.C.

          Shot of Congressional Investigating Committee (reproduction of 
          existing J.P. Morgan newsreel).  This runs silent under 
          narration.  Walter P. Thatcher is on the stand.  He is flanked 
          by his son, Walter P. Thatcher Jr., and other partners.  He is 
          being questioned by some Merry Andrew congressmen.  At this 
          moment, a baby alligator has just been placed in his lap, 
          causing considerable confusion and embarrassment.

          Newsreel close-up of Thatcher, the soundtrack of which now 
          fades in.

                                    THATCHER
                        ...  because of that trivial 
                        incident...

                                    INVESTIGATOR
                        It is a fact, however, is it not, 
                        that in 1870, you did go to 
                        Colorado?

                                    THATCHER
                        I did.

                                    INVESTIGATOR
                        In connection with the Kane affairs?

                                    THATCHER
                        Yes.  My firm had been appointed 
                        trustees by Mrs. Kane for the 
                        fortune, which she had recently 
                        acquired.  It was her wish that I 
                        should take charge of this boy, 
                        Charles Foster Kane.

                                    NARRATOR
                        That same month in Union Square -

                                    INVESTIGATOR
                        Is it not a fact that on that 
                        occasion, the boy personally 
                        attacked you after striking you in 
                        the stomach with a sled?

          Loud laughter and confusion.

                                    THATCHER
                        Mr. Chairman, I will read to this 
                        committee a prepared statement I 
                        have brought with me - and I will 
                        then refuse to answer any further 
                        questions.  Mr.  Johnson, please!

          A young assistant hands him a sheet of paper from a briefcase.

                                    THATCHER
                               (reading it)
                        "With full awareness of the meaning 
                        of my words and the responsibility 
                        of what I am about to say, it is 
                        my considered belief that Mr.  
                        Charles Foster Kane, in every 
                        essence of his social beliefs and
                        by the dangerous manner in which 
                        he has persistently attacked the 
                        American traditions of private 
                        property, initiative and opportunity 
                        for advancement, is - in fact - 
                        nothing more or less than a 
                        Communist."

          Newsreel of Union Square meeting, section of crowd carrying 
          banners urging the boycott of Kane papers.  A speaker is on 
          the platform above the crowd.

                                    SPEAKER
                               (fading in on 
                               soundtrack)
                        - till the words "Charles Foster 
                        Kane" are a menace to every working 
                        man in this land.  He is today 
                        what he has always been and always 
                        will be - A FASCIST!

                                    NARRATOR
                        And yet another opinion - Kane's 
                        own.

          Silent newsreel on a windy platform, flag-draped, in front of 
          the magnificent Enquirer building.  On platform, in full 
          ceremonial dress, is Charles Foster Kane.  He orates silently.

          TITLE: 

          "I AM, HAVE BEEN, AND WILL BE ONLY ONE THING - AN AMERICAN."  
          CHARLES FOSTER KANE.

          Same locale, Kane shaking hands out of frame.

          Another newsreel shot, much later, very brief, showing Kane, 
          older and much fatter, very tired-looking, seated with his 
          second wife in a nightclub.  He looks lonely and unhappy in 
          the midst of the gaiety.

                                    NARRATOR
                        Twice married, twice divorced - 
                        first to a president's niece, Emily 
                        Norton - today, by her second 
                        marriage, chatelaine of the oldest 
                        of England's stately homes.  Sixteen 
                        years after that - two weeks after
                        his divorce from Emily Norton - 
                        Kane married Susan Alexander, 
                        singer, at the Town Hall in Trenton, 
                        New Jersey.

          TITLE: 

          FEW PRIVATE LIVES WERE MORE PUBLIC.

          Period still of Emily Norton (1900).

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Reconstructed silent newsreel.  Kane, Susan, and Bernstein 
          emerging from side doorway of City Hall into a ring of press 
          photographers, reporters, etc.  Kane looks startled, recoils 
          for an instance, then charges down upon the photographers, 
          laying about him with his stick, smashing whatever he can hit.

                                    NARRATOR
                        For wife two, one-time opera singing 
                        Susan Alexander, Kane built 
                        Chicago's Municipal Opera House.  
                        Cost: three million dollars.  
                        Conceived for Susan Alexander Kane, 
                        half-finished before she divorced 
                        him, the still unfinished Xanadu.  
                        Cost: no man can say.

          Still of architect's sketch with typically glorified "rendering" 
          of the Chicago Municipal Opera House.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          A glamorous shot of the almost-finished Xanadu, a magnificent 
          fairy-tale estate built on a mountain. (1920)

          Then shots of its preparation. (1917)

          Shots of truck after truck, train after train, flashing by 
          with tremendous noise.

          Shots of vast dredges, steamshovels.

          Shot of ship standing offshore unloading its lighters.

          In quick succession, shots follow each other, some 
          reconstructed, some in miniature, some real shots (maybe from 
          the dam projects) of building, digging, pouring concrete, etc.

                                    NARRATOR
                        One hundred thousand trees, twenty 
                        thousand tons of marble, are the 
                        ingredients of Xanadu's mountain.
                        Xanadu's livestock: the fowl of 
                        the air, the fish of the sea, the 
                        beast of the field and jungle - 
                        two of each; the biggest private 
                        zoo since Noah.  Contents of Kane's 
                        palace: paintings, pictures, 
                        statues, the very stones of many 
                        another palace, shipped to Florida 
                        from every corner of the earth, 
                        from other Kane houses, warehouses, 
                        where they mouldered for years.  
                        Enough for ten museums - the loot 
                        of the world.

          More shots as before, only this time we see (in miniature) a 
          large mountain - at different periods in its development - 
          rising out of the sands.

          Shots of elephants, apes, zebras, etc. being herded, unloaded, 
          shipped, etc. in various ways.

          Shots of packing cases being unloaded from ships, from trains, 
          from trucks, with various kinds of lettering on them (Italian, 
          Arabian, Chinese, etc.) but all consigned to Charles Foster 
          Kane, Xanadu, Florida.

          A reconstructed still of Xanadu - the main terrace.  A group 
          of persons in clothes of the period of 1917.  In their midst, 
          clearly recognizable, are Kane and Susan.

                                    NARRATOR
                        Kane urged his country's entry 
                        into one war, opposed participation 
                        in another.  Swung the election to 
                        one American President at least, 
                        was called another's assassin.  
                        Thus, Kane's papers might never 
                        have survived - had not the 
                        President.

          TITLE:

          FROM XANADU, FOR THE PAST TWENTY-FIVE YEARS, ALL KANE 
          ENTERPRISES HAVE BEEN DIRECTED, MANY OF THE NATIONS DESTINIES 
          SHAPED.

          Shots of various authentically worded headlines of American 
          papers since 1895.

          Spanish-American War shots. (1898)

          A graveyard in France of the World War and hundreds of crosses.

          HEADLINE: "PRESIDENT SHOT"

                                    NARRATOR
                        Kane, molder of mass opinion though 
                        he was, in all his life was never 
                        granted elective office by the 
                        voters of his country.  Few U.S. 
                        news publishers have been.
                        Few, like one-time Congressman 
                        Hearst, have ever run for any office - 
                        most know better - conclude with 
                        other political observers that one 
                        man's press has power enough for 
                        himself.  But Kane papers were 
                        once strong indeed, and once the 
                        prize seemed almost his.  In 1910, 
                        as Independent Candidate for 
                        governor, the best elements of the 
                        state behind him - the White House 
                        seemingly the next easy step in a 
                        lightning political career -

          THE DUMMY BEARS A GROTESQUE, COMIC RESEMBLANCE TO KANE.  IT IS 
          TOSSED INTO THE FLAMES, WHICH BURN UP -

          AND THEN DOWN...  (1910)

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          TITLE:

          IN POLITICS - ALWAYS A BRIDESMAID, NEVER A BRIDE

          Newsreel shots of great crowds streaming into a building - 
          Madison Square Garden - then shots inside the vast auditorium, 
          at one end of which is a huge picture of Kane.  (1910)

          Shot of box containing the first Mrs. Kane and young Howard 
          Kane, age five.  They are acknowledging the cheers of the crowd.

                                    NARRATOR
                        Then, suddenly - less than one 
                        week before election - defeat!  
                        Shameful, ignominious - defeat 
                        that set back for twenty years the 
                        cause of reform in the U.S., forever 
                        cancelled political chances for 
                        Charles Foster Kane.  Then, in the 
                        third year of the Great 
                        Depression...  As to all publishers, 
                        it sometimes must - to Bennett, to 
                        Munsey and Hearst it did - a paper 
                        closes!  For Kane, in four short 
                        years: collapse!
                        Eleven Kane papers, four Kane 
                        magazines merged, more sold, 
                        scrapped -

          Printed title about Depression.

          Once more repeat the map of the USA 1932-1939.  Suddenly, the 
          cartoon goes into reverse, the empire begins to shrink,

          The door of a newspaper office with the signs: "Closed."

                                    NARRATOR
                        Then four long years more - alone 
                        in his never-finished, already 
                        decaying, pleasure palace, aloof, 
                        seldom visited, never photographed, 
                        Charles Foster Kane continued to 
                        direct his falling empire ... vainly 
                        attempting to sway, as he once 
                        did, the destinies of a nation 
                        that has ceased to listen to him 
                        ... ceased to trust him...

          SHOTS OF XANADU.  (1940)

          Series of shots, entirely modern, but rather jumpy and obviously 
          bootlegged, showing Kane in a bath chair, swathed in summer 
          rugs, being perambulated through his rose garden, a desolate 
          figure in the sunshine.  (1935)

                                    NARRATOR
                        Last week, death came to sit upon 
                        the throne of America's Kubla Khan - 
                        last week, as it must to all men, 
                        death came to Charles Foster Kane.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Cabinent Photograph (Full Screen) of Kane as an old, old man.  
          This image remains constant on the screen (as camera pulls 
          back, taking in the interior of a dark projection room.

          INT. PROJECTION ROOM - DAY -

          A fairly large one, with a long throw to the screen.  It is 
          dark.

          The image of Kane as an old man remains constant on the screen 
          as camera pulls back, slowly taking in and registering 
          Projection Room.  This action occurs, however, only after the 
          first few lines of encuring dialogue have been spoken.  The 
          shadows of the men speaking appear as they rise from their 
          chairs - black against the image of Kane's face on the screen.

          NOTE:  These are the editors of a "News Digest" short, and of 
          the Rawlston magazines.  All his enterprises are represented 
          in the projection room, and Rawlston himself, that great man, 
          is present also and will shortly speak up.

          During the entire course of this scene, nobody's face is really 
          seen.  Sections of their bodies are picked out by a table light, 
          a silhouette is thrown on the screen, and their faces and bodies 
          are themselves thrown into silhouette against the brilliant 
          slanting rays of light from the projection room.

          A Third Man is on the telephone.  We see a corner of his head 
          and the phone.

                                    THIRD MAN
                               (at phone)
                        Stand by.  I'll tell you if we 
                        want to run it again.
                               (hangs up)

                                    THOMPSON'S VOICE
                        Well?

          A short pause.

                                    A MAN'S VOICE
                        It's a tough thing to do in a 
                        newsreel.  Seventy years of a man's 
                        life -

          Murmur of highly salaried assent at this.  Rawlston walks toward 
          camera and out of the picture.  Others are rising.  Camera 
          during all of this, apparently does its best to follow action 
          and pick up faces, but fails.  Actually, all set-ups are to be 
          planned very carefully to exclude the element of personality 
          from this scene; which is expressed entirely by voices, shadows, 
          sillhouettes and the big, bright image of Kane himself on the 
          screen.

                                    A VOICE
                        See what Arthur Ellis wrote about 
                        him in the American review?

                                    THIRD MAN
                        I read it.

                                    THE VOICE
                               (its owner is already 
                               leaning across the 
                               table, holding a 
                               piece of paper 
                               under the desk 
                               light and reading 
                               from it)
                        Listen:  Kane is dead.  He 
                        contributed to the journalism of 
                        his day - the talent of a 
                        mountebank, the morals of a 
                        bootlegger, and the manners of a 
                        pasha.  He and his kind have almost 
                        succeeded in transforming a once 
                        noble profession into a seven 
                        percent security - no longer secure.

                                    ANOTHER VOICE
                        That's what Arthur Ellis is writing 
                        now.  Thirty years ago, when Kane 
                        gave him his chance to clean up 
                        Detroit and Chicago and St. Louis, 
                        Kane was the greatest guy in the
                        world.  If you ask me -

                                    ANOTHER VOICE
                        Charles Foster Kane was a...

          Then observations are made almost simultaneous.

                                    RAWLSTON'S VOICE
                        Just a minute!

          Camera moves to take in his bulk outlined against the glow 
          from the projection room.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        What were Kane's last words?

          A silence greets this.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        What were the last words he said 
                        on earth?  Thompson, you've made 
                        us a good short, but it needs 
                        character -

                                    SOMEBODY'S VOICE
                        Motivation -

                                    RAWLSTON
                        That's it - motivation.  What made 
                        Kane what he was?  And, for that 
                        matter, what was he?  What we've 
                        just seen are the outlines of a 
                        career - what's behind the career?  
                        What's the man?  Was he good or 
                        bad?  Strong or foolish?  Tragic 
                        or silly?  Why did he do all those 
                        things?  What was he after?
                               (then, appreciating 
                               his point)
                        Maybe he told us on his death bed.

                                    THOMPSON
                        Yes, and maybe he didn't.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        Ask the question anyway, Thompson!
                        Build the picture around the 
                        question, even if you can't answer 
                        it.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I know, but -

                                    RAWLSTON
                               (riding over him 
                               like any other 
                               producer)
                        All we saw on that screen was a 
                        big American -

                                    A VOICE
                        One of the biggest.

                                    RAWLSTON
                               (without pausing 
                               for this)
                        But how is he different from Ford?
                        Or Hearst for that matter?  Or 
                        Rockefeller - or John Doe?

                                    A VOICE
                        I know people worked for Kane will 
                        tell you - not only in the newspaper 
                        business - look how he raised 
                        salaries.  You don't want to forget -

                                    ANOTHER VOICE
                        You take his labor record alone, 
                        they ought to hang him up like a 
                        dog.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        I tell you, Thompson - a man's 
                        dying words -

                                    SOMEBODY'S VOICE
                        What were they?

          Silence.

                                    SOMEBODY'S VOICE
                               (hesitant)
                        Yes, Mr. Rawlston, what were Kane's 
                        dying words?

                                    RAWLSTON
                               (with disgust)
                        Rosebud!

          A little ripple of laughter at this, which is promptly silenced 
          by Rawlston.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        That's right.

                                    A VOICE
                        Tough guy, huh?
                               (derisively)
                        Dies calling for Rosebud!

                                    RAWLSTON
                        Here's a man who might have been 
                        President.  He's been loved and 
                        hated and talked about as much as 
                        any man in our time - but when he 
                        comes to die, he's got something 
                        on his mind called "Rosebud."  
                        What does that mean?

                                    ANOTHER VOICE
                        A racehorse he bet on once, 
                        probably, that didn't come in - 
                        Rosebud!

                                    RAWLSTON
                        All right.  But what was the race?

          There is a short silence.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        Thompson!

                                    THOMPSON
                        Yes, sir.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        Hold this thing up for a week.  
                        Two weeks if you have to...

                                    THOMPSON
                               (feebly)
                        But don't you think if we release 
                        it now - he's only been dead four 
                        days it might be better than if -

                                    RAWLSTON
                               (decisively)
                        Nothing is ever better than finding 
                        out what makes people tick.  Go 
                        after the people that knew Kane 
                        well.  That manager of his - the 
                        little guy, Bernstein, those two 
                        wives, all the people who knew 
                        him, had worked for him, who loved 
                        him, who hated his guts -
                               (pauses)
                        I don't mean go through the City
                        Directory, of course -

          The Third Man gives a hearty "yes-man" laugh.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'll get to it right away, Mr.
                        Rawlston.

                                    RAWLSTON
                               (rising)
                        Good!

          The camera from behind him, outlines his back against Kane's 
          picture on the screen.

                                    RAWLSTON'S VOICE
                        It'll probably turn out to be a 
                        very simple thing...

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          NOTE:  Now begins the story proper - the seach by Thompson for 
          the facts about Kane - his researches ... his interviews with 
          the people who knew Kane.

          It is important to remember always that only at the very end 
          of the story is Thompson himself a personality.  Until then, 
          throughout the picture, we photograph only Thompson's back, 
          shoulders, or his shadow - sometimes we only record his voice.  
          He is not until the final scene a "character".  He is the 
          personification of the search for the truth about Charles Foster 
          Kane.  He is the investigator.

          FADE IN:

          EXT. CHEAP CABARET - "EL RANCHO" - ATLANTIC CITY - NIGHT - 
          1940 (MINIATURE) - RAIN

          The first image to register is a sign:

          "EL RANCHO"

          FLOOR SHOW

          SUSAN ALEXANDER KANE

          TWICE NIGHTLY

          These words, spelled out in neon, glow out of the darkness at 
          the end of the fade out.  Then there is lightning which reveals 
          a squalid roof-top on which the sign stands.  Thunder again, 
          and faintly the sound of music from within.  A light glows 
          from a skylight.  The camera moves to this and closes in.  
          Through the splashes of rain, we see through the skylight down 
          into the interior of the cabaret.  Directly below us at a table 
          sits the lone figure of a woman, drinking by herself.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. "EL RANCO" CABARET - NIGHT -

          Medium shot of the same woman as before, finishing the drink 
          she started to take above.  It is Susie.  The music, of course, 
          is now very loud.  Thompson, his back to the camera, moves 
          into the picture in the close foreground.  A Captain appears 
          behind Susie, speaking across her to Thompson.

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                               (a Greek)
                        This is Mr. Thompson, Miss 
                        Alexander.

          Susan looks up into Thompson's face.  She is fifty, trying to 
          look much younger, cheaply blonded, in a cheap, enormously 
          generous evening dress.  Blinking up into Thompson's face, she 
          throws a crink into ther mouth.  Her eyes, which she thinks is 
          keeping commandingly on his, are bleared and watery.

                                    SUSAN
                               (to the Captain)
                        I want another drink, John.

          Low thunder from outside.

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                               (seeing his chance)
                        Right away.  Will you have 
                        something, Mr. Thompson?

                                    THOMPSON
                               (staring to sit 
                               down)
                        I'll have a highball.

                                    SUSAN
                               (so insistently as 
                               to make Thompson 
                               change his mind 
                               and stand up again)
                        Who told you you could sit down 
                        here?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Oh!  I thought maybe we could have 
                        a drink together?

                                    SUSAN
                        Think again!

          There is an awkward pause as Thompson looks from her to the 
          Captain.

                                    SUSAN
                        Why don't you people let me alone?
                        I'm minding my own business.  You 
                        mind yours.

                                    THOMPSON
                        If you'd just let me talk to you 
                        for a little while, Miss Alexander.
                        All I want to ask you...

                                    SUSAN
                        Get out of here!
                               (almost hysterical)
                        Get out!  Get out!

          Thompson looks at the Captain, who shrugs his shoulders.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'm sorry.  Maybe some other time -

          If he thought he would get a response from Susan, who thinks 
          she is looking at him steelily, he realizes his error.  He 
          nods and walks off, following the Captain out the door.

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                        She's just not talking to anybody 
                        from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'm not from a newspaper exactly, 
                        I -

          They have come upon a waiter standing in front of a booth.

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                               (to the waiter)
                        Get her another highball.

                                    THE WAITER
                        Another double?

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                               (after a moment, 
                               pityingly)
                        Yes.

          They walk to the door.

                                    THOMPSON
                        She's plastered, isn't she?

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                        She'll snap out of it.  Why, until 
                        he died, she'd just as soon talk 
                        about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  
                        Sooner.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'll come down in a week or so and 
                        see her again.  Say, you might be 
                        able to help me.  When she used to 
                        talk about Kane - did she ever 
                        happen to say anything - about 
                        Rosebud?

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                        Rosebud?

          Thompson has just handed him a bill.  The Captain pockets it.

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                        Thank you, sir.  As a matter of 
                        fact, yesterday afternoon, when it 
                        was in all the papers - I asked 
                        her.  She never heard of Rosebud.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:

          INT. THATCHER MEMORIAL LIBRARY - DAY -

          An excruciatingly noble interpretation of Mr. Thatcher himself 
          executed in expensive marble.  He is shown seated on one of 
          those improbable Edwin Booth chairs and is looking down, his 
          stone eyes fixed on the camera.

          We move down off of this, showing the impressive pedestal on 
          which the monument is founded.  The words, "Walter Parks 
          Thatcher" are prominently and elegantly engraved thereon.  
          Immediately below the inscription we encounter, in a medium 
          shot, the person of Bertha Anderson, an elderly, manish 
          spinnster, seated behind her desk.  Thompson, his hat in his 
          hand, is standing before her.  Bertha is on the phone.

                                    BERTHA
                               (into phone)
                        Yes.  I'll take him in now.
                               (hangs up and looks 
                               at Thompson)
                        The directors of the Thatcher 
                        Library have asked me to remind 
                        you again of the condition under 
                        which you may inspect certain 
                        portions of Mr. Thatcher's 
                        unpublished memoirs.  Under no 
                        circumstances are direct quotations 
                        from his manuscript to be used by 
                        you.

                                    THOMPSON
                        That's all right.

                                    BERTHA
                        You may come with me.

          Without watching whether he is following her or not, she rises 
          and starts towards a distant and imposingly framed door.  
          Thompson, with a bit of a sigh, follows.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          INT. THE VAULT ROOM - THATCHER MEMORIAL LIBRARY - DAY -

          A room with all the warmth and charm of Napolean's tomb.

          As we dissolve in, the door opens in and we see past Thompson's 
          shoulders the length of the room.  Everything very plain, very 
          much made out of marble and very gloomy.  Illumination from a 
          skylight above adds to the general air of expensive and 
          classical despair.  The floor is marble, and there is a 
          gigantic, mahogany table in the center of everything.  Beyond 
          this is to be seen, sunk in the marble wall at the far end of 
          the room, the safe from which a guard, in a khaki uniform, 
          with a revolver holster at his hip, is extracting the journal 
          of Walter P. Thatcher.  He brings it to Bertha as if he were 
          the guardian of a bullion shipment.  During this, Bertha has 
          been speaking.

                                    BERTHA
                               (to the guard)
                        Pages eighty-three to one hundred 
                        and forty-two, Jennings.

                                    GUARD
                        Yes, Miss Anderson.

                                    BERTHA
                               (to Thompson)
                        You will confine yourself, it is 
                        our understanding, to the chapter 
                        dealing with Mr. Kane.

                                    THOMPSON
                        That's all I'm interested in.

          The guard has, by this time, delivered the precious journal.  
          Bertha places it reverently on the table before Thompson.

                                    BERTHA
                        You will be required to leave this 
                        room at four-thirty promptly.

          She leaves.  Thompson starts to light a cigarette.  The guard 
          shakes his head.  With a sigh, Thompson bends over to read the 
          manuscript.  Camera moves down over his shoulder onto page of 
          manuscript.

          Manuscript, neatly and precisely written:

          "CHARLES FOSTER KANE

          WHEN THESE LINES APPEAR IN PRINT, FIFTY YEARS AFTER MY DEATH, 
          I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD WILL AGREE WITH MY OPINION 
          OF CHARLES FOSTER KANE, ASSUMING THAT HE IS NOT THEN COMPLETELY 
          FORGOTTEN, WHICH I REGARD AS EXTREMELY LIKELY.  A GOOD DEAL OF 
          NONSENSE HAS APPEARED ABOUT MY FIRST MEETING WITH KANE, WHEN 
          HE WAS SIX YEARS OLD...  THE FACTS ARE SIMPLE.  IN THE WINTER 
          OF 1870..."

          The camera has not held on the entire page.  It has been 
          following the words with the same action that the eye does the 
          reading.  On the last words, the white page of the paper

                                                            DISSOLVES INTO:

          EXT. MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          The white of a great field of snow, seen from the angle of a 
          parlor window.

          In the same position of the last word in above Insert, appears 
          the tiny figure of Charles Foster Kane, aged five (almost like 
          an animated cartoon).  He is in the act of throwing a snowball 
          at the camera.  It sails toward us and over our heads, out of 
          scene.

          Reverse angle - on the house featuring a large sign reading:

          MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE

          HIGH CLASS MEALS AND LODGING

          INQUIRE WITHIN

          Charles Kane's snowball hits the sign.

          INT. PARLOR - MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          Camera is angling through the window, but the window-frame is 
          not cut into scene.  We see only the field of snow again, same 
          angle as in previous scene.  Charles is manufacturing another 
          snowball.  Now -

          Camera pulls back, the frame of the window appearing, and we 
          are inside the parlor of the boardinghouse.  Mrs. Kane, aged 
          about 28, is looking out towards her son.  Just as we take her 
          in she speaks:

                                    MRS. KANE
                               (calling out)
                        Be careful, Charles!

                                    THATCHER'S VOICE
                        Mrs. Kane -

                                    MRS. KANE
                               (Calling out the 
                               window almost on 
                               top of this)
                        Pull your muffler around your neck, 
                        Charles -

          But Charles, deliriously happy in the snow, is oblivious to 
          this and is running away.  Mrs. Kane turns into camera and we 
          see her face - a strong face, worn and kind.

                                    THATCHER'S VOICE
                        think we'll have to tell him now -

          Camera now pulls back further, showing Thatcher standing before 
          a table on which is his stove-pipe hat and an imposing 
          multiplicity of official-looking documents.  He is 26 and, as 
          might be expected, a very stuffy young man, already very 
          expensive and conservative looking, even in Colorado.

                                    MRS. KANE
                        I'll sign those papers -

                                    KANE SR.
                        You people seem to forget that I'm 
                        the boy's father.

          At the sound of Kane Sr.'s voice, both have turned to him and 
          the camera pulls back still further, taking him in.

          Kane Sr., who is the assistant curator in a livery stable, has 
          been groomed as elegantly as is likely for this meeting ever 
          since daybreak.

          From outside the window can be heard faintly the wild and 
          cheerful cries of the boy, blissfully cavorting in the snow.

                                    MRS. KANE
                        It's going to be done exactly the
                        way I've told Mr. Thatcher -

                                    KANE SR.
                        If I want to, I can go to court.
                        father has a right to -

                                    THATCHER
                               (annoyed)
                        Mr. Kane, the certificates that 
                        Mr.  Graves left here are made out 
                        to Mrs.  Kane, in her name.  Hers 
                        to do with as she pleases -

                                    KANE SR.
                        Well, I don't hold with signing my 
                        boy away to any bank as guardian
                        just because -

                                    MRS. KANE
                               (quietly)
                        I want you to stop all this 
                        nonsense, Jim.

                                    THATCHER
                        The Bank's decision in all matters 
                        concerning his education, his place 
                        of residence and similar subjects 
                        will be final.
                               (clears his throat)

                                    KANE SR.
                        The idea of a bank being the 
                        guardian -

          Mrs. Kane has met his eye.  Her triumph over him finds 
          expression in his failure to finish his sentence.

                                    MRS. KANE
                               (even more quietly)
                        I want you to stop all this 
                        nonsense, Jim.

                                    THATCHER
                        We will assume full management of 
                        the Colorado Lode - of which you, 
                        Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.

          Kane Sr. opens his mouth once or twice, as if to say something, 
          but chokes down his opinion.

                                    MRS. KANE
                               (has been reading 
                               past Thatcher's 
                               shoulder as he 
                               talked)
                        Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?

                                    THATCHER
                        Right here, Mrs. Kane.

                                    KANE SR.
                               (sulkily)
                        Don't say I didn't warn you.

          Mrs. Kane lifts the quill pen.

                                    KANE SR.
                        Mary, I'm asking you for the last 
                        time - anyon'd think I hadn't been
                        a good husband and a -

          Mrs. Kane looks at him slowly.  He stops his speech.

                                    THATCHER
                        The sum of fifty thousand dollars 
                        a year is to be paid to yourself 
                        and Mr. Kane as long as you both 
                        live, and thereafter the survivor -

          Mrs. Kane puts pen to the paper and signs.

                                    KANE SR.
                        Well, let's hope it's all for the 
                        best.

                                    MRS. KANE
                        It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher -

          Mrs. Kane, listening to Thatcher, of course has had her other 
          ear bent in the direction of the boy's voice.  Thatcher is 
          aware both of the boy's voice, which is counter to his own, 
          and of Mrs. Kane's divided attention.  As he pauses, Kane Sr. 
          genteelly walks over to close the window.

          EXT. MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          Kane Jr., seen from Kane Sr.'s position at the window.  He is 
          advancing on the snowman, snowballs in his hands, dropping to 
          one knee the better to confound his adversary.

                                    KANE
                        If the rebels want a fight boys, 
                        let's give it to 'em!

          He throws two snowballs, missing widely, and gets up and 
          advances another five feet before getting on his knees again.

                                    KANE
                        The terms are underconditional 
                        surrender.  Up and at 'em!  The 
                        Union forever!

          INT. PARLOR - MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          Kane Sr. closes the window.

                                    THATCHER
                               (over the boy's 
                               voice)
                        Everything else - the principal as 
                        well as all monies earned - is to 
                        be administered by the bank in 
                        trust for your son, Charles Foster 
                        Kane, until his twenty-fifth 
                        birthday, at which time he is to 
                        come into complete possession.

          Mrs. Kane rises and goes to the window.

                                    MRS. KANE
                        Go on, Mr. Thatcher.

          Thatcher continues as she opens the window.  His voice, as 
          before, is heard with overtones of the boy's.

          EXT. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          Kane Jr., seen from Mrs. Kane's position at the window.  He is 
          now within ten feet of the snowman, with one snowball left 
          which he is holding back in his right hand.

                                    KANE
                        You can't lick Andy Jackson!  Old 
                        Hickory, that's me!

          He fires his snowball, well wide of the mark and falls flat on 
          his stomach, starting to crawl carefully toward the snowman.

                                    THATCHER'S VOICE
                        It's nearly five, Mrs. Kane, don't
                        you think I'd better meet the boy -

          INT. PARLOR - MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          Mrs. Kane at the window.  Thatcher is now standing at her side.

                                    MRS. KANE
                        I've got his trunk all packed -
                               (she chokes a little)
                        I've it packed for a couple of 
                        weeks -

          She can't say anymore.  She starts for the hall day.  Kane 
          Sr., ill at ease, has no idea of how to comfort her.

                                    THATCHER
                        I've arranged for a tutor to meet 
                        us in Chicago.  I'd have brought 
                        him along with me, but you were so
                        anxious to keep everything secret -

          He stops as he realizes that Mrs. Kane has paid no attention 
          to him and, having opened the door, is already well into the 
          hall that leads to the side door of the house.  He takes a 
          look at Kane Sr., tightens his lips and follows Mrs. Kane.  
          Kane, shoulders thrown back like one who bears defeat bravely, 
          follows him.

          EXT. MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          Kane, in the snow-covered field.  With the snowman between him 
          and the house, he is holding the sled in his hand, just about 
          to make the little run that prefaces a belly-flop.  The Kane 
          house, in the background, is a dilapidated, shabby, two-story 
          frame building, with a wooden outhouse.  Kane looks up as he 
          sees the single file procession, Mrs. Kane at its head, coming 
          toward him.

                                    KANE
                        H'ya, Mom.

          Mrs. Kane smiles.

                                    KANE
                               (gesturing at the 
                               snowman)
                        See, Mom?  I took the pipe out of 
                        his mouth.  If it keeps on snowin',
                        maybe I'll make some teeth and -

                                    MRS. KANE
                        You better come inside, son.  You 
                        and I have got to get you all ready
                        for - for -

                                    THATCHER
                        Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -

                                    MRS. KANE
                        This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.

                                    THATCHER
                        How do you do, Charles?

                                    KANE SR.
                        He comes from the east.

                                    KANE
                        Hello.  Hello, Pop.

                                    KANE SR.
                        Hello, Charlie!

                                    MRS. KANE
                        Mr. Thatcher is going to take you 
                        on a trip with him tonight, Charles.
                        You'll be leaving on Number Ten.

                                    KANE SR.
                        That's the train with all the 
                        lights.

                                    KANE
                        You goin', Mom?

                                    THATCHER
                        Your mother won't be going right 
                        away, Charles -

                                    KANE
                        Where'm I going?

                                    KANE SR.
                        You're going to see Chicago and 
                        New York - and Washington, maybe...
                        Isn't he, Mr. Thatcher?

                                    THATCHER
                               (heartily)
                        He certainly is.  I wish I were a 
                        little boy and going to make a 
                        trip like that for the first time.

                                    KANE
                        Why aren't you comin' with us, 
                        Mom?

                                    MRS. KANE
                        We have to stay here, Charles.

                                    KANE SR.
                        You're going to live with Mr. 
                        Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  
                        You're going to be rich.  Your Ma 
                        figures - that is, re - she and I 
                        have decided that this isn't the 
                        place for you to grow up in.
                        You'll probably be the richest man 
                        in America someday and you ought 
                        to -

                                    MRS. KANE
                        You won't be lonely, Charles...

                                    THATCHER
                        We're going to have a lot of good 
                        times together, Charles...  Really 
                        we are.

          Kane stares at him.

                                    THATCHER
                        Come on, Charles.  Let's shake 
                        hands.
                               (extends his hand.  
                               Charles continues 
                               to look at him)
                        Now, now!  I'm not as frightening 
                        as all that!  Let's shake, what do 
                        you say?

          He reaches out for Charles's hand.  Without a word, Charles 
          hits him in the stomach with the sled.  Thatcher stumbles back 
          a few feet, gasping.

                                    THATCHER
                               (with a sickly grin)
                        You almost hurt me, Charles.
                               (moves towards him)
                        Sleds aren't to hit people with.
                        Sleds are to - to sleigh on.  When 
                        we get to New York, Charles, we'll
                        get you a sled that will -

          He's near enough to try to put a hand on Kane's shoulder.  As 
          he does, Kane kicks him in the ankle.

                                    MRS. KANE
                        Charles!

          He throws himself on her, his arms around her.  Slowly Mrs. 
          Kane puts her arms around him.

                                    KANE
                               (frightened)
                        Mom!  Mom!

                                    MRS. KANE
                        It's all right, Charles, it's all 
                        right.

          Thatcher is looking on indignantly, occasionally bending over 
          to rub his ankle.

                                    KANE SR.
                        Sorry, Mr. Thatcher!  What the kid 
                        needs is a good thrashing!

                                    MRS. KANE
                        That's what you think, is it, Jim?

                                    KANE SR.
                        Yes.

          Mrs. Kane looks slowly at Mr. Kane.

                                    MRS. KANE
                               (slowly)
                        That's why he's going to be brought 
                        up where you can't get at him.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. TRAIN - OLD-FASHIONED DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT -

          Thatcher, with a look of mingled exasperation, annoyance, 
          sympathy and inability to handle the situation, is standing 
          alongside a berth, looking at Kane.  Kane, his face in the 
          pillow, is crying with heartbreaking sobs.

                                    KANE
                        Mom!  Mom!

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          The white page of the Thatcher manuscript.  We pick up the 
          words:

          "HE WAS, I REPEAT, A COMMON ADVENTURER, SPOILED, UNSCRUPULOUS, 
          IRRESPONSIBLE."

          The words are followed by printed headline on "Enquirer" copy 
          (as in following scene).

          INT. ENQUIRER CITY ROOM - DAY -

          Close-up on printed headline which reads:

          "ENEMY ARMADA OFF JERSEY COAST"

          Camera pulls back to reveal Thatcher holding the "Enquirer" 
          copy, on which we read the headline.  He is standing near the 
          editorial round table around which a section of the staff,

                               (coldly)
                        Is that really your idea of how to 
                        run a newspaper?

                                    KANE
                        I don't know how to run a newspaper, 
                        Mr. Thatcher.  I just try everything 
                        I can think of.

                                    THATCHER

                               of paper he is 
                               still holding)
                        "Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  
                        You know you haven't the slightest 
                        proof that this - this armada - is 
                        off the Jersey Coast.

                                    KANE
                        Can you prove it isn't?

          Bernstein has come into the picture.  He has a cable in his 
          hand.  He stops when he sees Thatcher.

                        How are you, Mr. Thatcher?

                                    THATCHER
                        How do you do? -

                        We just had a wire from Cuba, Mr.

                        That's all right.  We have no 
                        secrets from our readers.  Mr. 
                        Thatcher is one of our most devoted 
                        readers, Mr.  Bernstein.  He knows 
                        what's wrong with every issue since 
                        I've taken charge.  What's the 
                        cable?

                        You see!  There hasn't been a true 
                        word -

                                    KANE
                        I think we'll have to send our 
                        friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. 
                        Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have 
                        to make it shorter than his, because 
                        he's working on an expense account 
                        and we're not.  Let me see -
                               (snaps his fingers)
                        Mike!

                               (a fairly tough 
                               customer prepares

                        Dear Wheeler -
                               (pauses a moment)
                        You provide the prose poems - I'll 
                        provide the war.

          Laughter from the boys and girls at the table.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        That's fine, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        I rather like it myself.  Send it 
                        right away.

                                    MIKE
                        Right away.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Right away.

          Mike and Bernstein leave.  Kane looks up, grinning at Thatcher, 
          who is bursting with indignation but controls himself.  After 
          a moment of indecision, he decides to make one last try.

                                    THATCHER
                        I came to see you, Charles, about 
                        your - about the Enquirer's campaign 
                        against the Metropolitan Transfer 
                        Company.

                                    KANE
                        Won't you step into my office, Mr.
                        Thatcher?

          They cross the City Room together.

                                    THATCHER
                        I think I should remind you, 
                        Charles, of a fact you seem to 
                        have forgotten.  You are yourself 
                        one of the largest individual 
                        stockholders.

          INT. KANE'S OFFICE - DAY -

          Kane holds the door open for Thatcher.  They come in together.

                                    KANE
                        Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything 
                        I've been saying in the Enquirer 
                        about the traction trust absolutely 
                        true?

                                    THATCHER
                               (angrily)
                        They're all part of your general
                        attack - your senseless attack -
                        on everything and everybody who's 
                        got more than ten cents in his 
                        pocket.  They're -

                                    KANE
                        The trouble is, Mr. Thatcher, you 
                        don't realize you're talking to
                        two people.

          Kane moves around behind his desk.  Thatcher doesn't understand, 
          looks at him.

                                    KANE
                        As Charles Foster Kane, who has                         
                        eighty-two thousand, six hundred 
                        and thirty-one shares of 
                        Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I 
                        do have a rough idea of my holdings -
                        I sympathize with you.  Charles 
                        Foster Kane is a dangerous 
                        scoundrel, his paper should be run 
                        out of town and a committee should 
                        be formed to boycott him.  You 
                        may, if you can form such a 
                        committee, put me down for a 
                        contribution of one thousand 
                        dollars.

                                    THATCHER
                               (angrily)
                        Charles, my time is too valuable 
                        for me -

                                    KANE
                        On the other hand -
                               (his manner becomes 
                               serious)
                        I am the publisher of the Enquirer.
                        As such, it is my duty - I'll let 
                        you in on a little secret, it is 
                        also my pleasure - to see to it 
                        that decent, hard-working people 
                        of this city are not robbed blind 
                        by a group of money - mad pirates 
                        because, God help them, they have 
                        no one to look after their 
                        interests!  I'll let you in on 
                        another little secret, Mr. Thatcher.  
                        I think I'm the man to do it.  You 
                        see, I have money and property -

          Thatcher doesn't understand him.

                                    KANE
                        If I don't defend the interests of 
                        the underprivileged, somebody else 
                        will - maybe somebody without any 
                        money or any property and that 
                        would be too bad.

          Thatcher glares at him, unable to answer.  Kane starts to dance.

                                    KANE
                        Do you know how to tap, Mr. 
                        Thatcher?  You ought to learn -
                               (humming quietly, 
                               he continues to 
                               dance)

          Thatcher puts on his hat.

                                    THATCHER
                        I happened to see your consolidated 
                        statement yesterday, Charles.  
                        Could I not suggest to you that it 
                        is unwise for you to continue this 
                        philanthropic enterprise -
                               (sneeringly)
                        this Enquirer - that is costing 
                        you one million dollars a year?

                                    KANE
                        You're right.  We did lose a million 
                        dollars last year.

          Thatcher thinks maybe the point has registered.

                                    KANE
                        We expect to lost a million next
                        year, too.  You know, Mr. Thatcher -
                               (starts tapping 
                               quietly)
                        at the rate of a million a year -
                        we'll have to close this place in 
                        sixty years.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. THE VAULT ROOM - THATCHER MEMORIAL LIBRARY - DAY

          Thompson - at the desk.  With a gesture of annoyance, he is 
          closing the manuscript.

          Camera arcs quickly around from over his shoulder to hold on 
          door behind him, missing his face as he rises and turns to 
          confront Miss Anderson, who has come into the room to shoo him 
          out.  Very prominent on this wall is an over-sized oil painting 
          of Thatcher in the best Union League Club renaissance style.

                                    MISS ANDERSON
                        You have enjoyed a very rare 
                        privilege, young man.  Did you 
                        find what you were looking for?

                                    THOMPSON
                        No.  Tell me something, Miss 
                        Anderson.  You're not Rosebud, are 
                        you?

                                    MISS ANDERSON
                        What?

                                    THOMPSON
                        I didn't think you were.  Well, 
                        thanks for the use of the hall.

          He puts his hat on his head and starts out, lighting a cigarette 
          as he goes.  Miss Anderson, scandalized, watches him.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:

          INT. BERNSTEIN'S OFFICE - ENQUIRER SKYSCRAPER - DAY -

          Closeup of a still of Kane, aged about sixty-five.  Camera 
          pulls back, showing it is a framed photograph on the wall.  
          Over the picture are crossed American flags.  Under it sits 
          Bernstein, back of his desk.  Bernstein, always an undersized 
          Jew, now seems even smaller than in his youth.  He is bald as 
          an egg, spry, with remarkably intense eyes.  As camera continues 
          to travel back, the back of Thompson's head and his shoulders 
          come into the picture.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (wryly)
                        Who's a busy man?  Me?  I'm Chairman 
                        of the Board.  I got nothing but 
                        time ...  What do you want to know?

                                    THOMPSON
                               (still explaining)
                        Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with 
                        Mr.  Kane from the very beginning -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        From before the beginning, young 
                        fellow.  And now it's after the 
                        end.
                               (turns to Thompson)
                        Anything you want to know about 
                        him - about the paper -

                        -  We thought maybe, if we can 
                        find out what he meant by that 
                        last word - as he was dying -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?  
                        There were a lot of them back in 
                        the early days, and -

                                    THOMPSON
                        Not some girl he knew casually and 
                        then remembered after fifty years,
                        on his death bed -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        You're pretty young, Mr. -
                               (remembers the name)
                        Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will 
                        remember things you wouldn't think 
                        he'd remember.  You take me.  One 
                        day, back in 1896, I was crossing 
                        over to Jersey on a ferry and as 
                        we pulled out, there was another
                        ferry pulling in -
                               (slowly)
                        - and on it, there was a girl 
                        waiting to get off.  A white dress 
                        she had on - and she was carrying 
                        a white pastrol - and I only saw 
                        her for one second and she didn't 
                        see me at all - but I'll bet a 
                        month hasn't gone by since that I 
                        haven't thought of that girl.
                               (triumphantly)
                        See what I mean?
                               (smiles)
                        Well, so what are you doing about 
                        this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'm calling on people who knew Mr. 
                        Kane.  I'm calling on you.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Who else you been to see?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Well, I went down to Atlantic City -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Susie?  I called her myself the 
                        day after he died.  I thought maybe 
                        somebody ought to...
                               (sadly)
                        She couldn't even come to the 
                        'phone.

                                    THOMPSON
                        You know why?  She was so -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Sure, sure.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'm going back there.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Who else did you see?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Nobody else, but I've been through 
                        that stuff of Walter Thatcher's.
                        That journal of his -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Thatcher!  That man was the biggest
                        darn fool I ever met -

                                    THOMPSON
                        He made an awful lot of money.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        It's not trick to make an awful 
                        lot of money if all you want is to 
                        make a lot of money.
                               (his eyes get 
                               reflective)
                        Thatcher!

          Bernstein looks out of the window and keeps on looking, seeming 
          to see something as he talks.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        He never knew there was anything 
                        in the world but money.  That kind 
                        of fellow you can fool every day 
                        in the week - and twice on Sundays!
                               (reflectively)
                        The time he came to Rome for Mr. 
                        Kane's twenty-fifth birthday...  
                        You know, when Mr. Kane got control 
                        of his own
                        money...  Such a fool like Thatcher -
                        I tell you, nobody's business!

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          INT. BERNSTEIN'S OFFICE - DAY -

          Bernstein speaking to Thompson.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        He knew what he wanted, Mr. Kane 
                        did, and he got it!  Thatcher never 
                        did figure him out.  He was hard 
                        to figure sometimes, even for me.  
                        Mr. Kane was a genius like he said.  
                        He had that funny sense of humor.  
                        Sometimes even I didn't get the 
                        joke.  Like that night the opera 
                        house of his opened in Chicago...  
                        You know, the opera house he built 
                        for Susie, she should be an opera 
                        singer...
                               (indicates with a 
                               little wave of his 
                               hand what he thinks 
                               of that; sighing)
                        That was years later, of course - 
                        1914 it was.  Mrs. Kane took the 
                        leading part in the opera, and she 
                        was terrible.  But nobody had the 
                        nerve to say so - not even the 
                        critics.  Mr. Kane was a big man 
                        in those days.  But this one fellow, 
                        this friend of his, Branford Leland -

          He leaves the sentence up in the air, as we

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CITY ROOM - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          It is late.  The room is almost empty.  Nobody is at work at 
          the desks.  Bernstein, fifty, is waiting anxiously with a little 
          group of Kane's hirelings, most of them in evening dress with 
          overcoats and hats.  Eveybody is tense and expectant.

                                    CITY EDITOR
                               (turns to a young 
                               hireling; quietly)
                        What about Branford Leland?  Has 
                        he got in his copy?

                                    HIRELING
                        Not yet.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Go in and ask him to hurry.

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein?
                        You know Mr. Leland.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (looks at him for a 
                               moment; then slowly)
                        I might make him nervous.

                                    CITY EDITOR
                               (after a pause)
                        You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you 
                        were great friends back in the old 
                        days, I understand.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (with a smile)
                        That's right.  They called us the 
                        "Three Musketeers."

          Somebody behind Bernstein has trouble concealing his laughter.  
          The City Editor speaks quickly to cover the situation.

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        He's a great guy - Leland.
                               (another little 
                               pause)
                        Why'd he ever leave New York?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (he isn't saying)
                        That's a long story.

                                    ANOTHER HIRELING
                               (a tactless one)
                        Wasn't there some sort of quarrel 
                        between -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (quickly)
                        I had nothing to do with it.
                               (then, somberly)
                        It was Leland and Mr. Kane, and 
                        you couldn't call it a quarrel 
                        exactly.  Better we should forget 
                        such things -
                               (turning to City 
                               Editor)
                        Leland is writing it up from the 
                        dramatic angle?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Yes.  I thought it was a good idea.
                        We've covered it from the news 
                        end, of course.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        And the social.  How about the 
                        music notice?  You got that in?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Oh, yes, it's already made up.  
                        Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Enthusiastic?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Yes, very!
                               (quietly)
                        Naturally.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Well, well - isn't that nice?

                                    KANE'S VOICE
                        Mr. Bernstein -

          Bernstein turns.

          Medium long shot of Kane, now forty-nine, already quite stout.  
          He is in white tie, wearing his overcoat and carrying a folded 
          opera hat.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Hello, Mr. Kane.

          The Hirelings rush, with Bernstein, to Kane's side.  Widespread, 
          half-suppressed sensation.

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!

                                    KANE
                        We've got a nice plant here.

          Everybody falls silent.  There isn't anything to say.

                                    KANE
                        Was the show covered by every 
                        department?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Exactly according to your 
                        instructions, Mr. Kane.  We've got 
                        two spreads of pictures.

                                    KANE
                               (very, very casually)
                        And the notice?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Yes - Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                               (quietly)
                        Is it good?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Yes, Mr. kane.

          Kane looks at him for a minute.

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        But there's another one still to 
                        come - the dramatic notice.

                                    KANE
                               (sharply)
                        It isn't finished?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        No, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        That's Leland, isn't it?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Yes, Mr. Kane.

                        Has he said when he'll finish?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        We haven't heard from him.

                                    KANE
                        He used to work fast - didn't he, 
                        Mr. Bernstein?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        He sure did, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        Where is he?

                                    ANOTHER HIRELING
                        Right in there, Mr. Kane.

          The Hireling indicates the closed glass door of a little office 
          at the other end of the City Room.  Kane takes it in.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (helpless, but very 
                               concerned)
                        MR. KANE -

                                    KANE
                        That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.

          Kane crosses the length of the long City Room to the glass 
          door indicated before by the Hireling.  The City Editor looks 
          at Bernstein.  Kane opens the door and goes into the office, 
          closing the door behind him.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Leland and Mr. Kane - they haven't 
                        spoke together for ten years.
                               (long pause; finally)
                        Excuse me.
                               (starts toward the 
                               door)

          INT. LELAND'S OFFICE - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          Bernstein comes in.  An empty bottle is standing on Leland's 
          desk.  He has fallen over his typewriter, his face on the keys.  
          A sheet of paper is in the machine.  A paragraph has been typed.  
          Kane is standing at the other side of the desk looking down on 
          him.  This is the first time we see murder in Kane's face.  
          Bernstein looks at Kane, then crosses to Leland.  He shakes 
          him.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Hey, Brad!  Brad!
                               (he straightens, 
                               looks at Kane; 
                               pause)
                        He ain't been drinking before, Mr. 
                        Kane.  Never.  We would have heard.

                                    KANE
                               (finally; after a 
                               pause)
                        What does it say there?

          Bernstein stares at him.

                                    KANE
                        What's he written?

          Bernstein looks over nearsightedly, painfully reading the 
          paragraph written on the page.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (reading)
                        "Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty 
                        but hopelessly incompetent amateur -
                               (he waits for a 
                               minute to catch 
                               his breath; he 
                               doesn't like it)
                        - last night opened the new Chicago

                               (looks up miserably)
                        I can't pronounce that name, Mr. 
                        Kane.

                        Thais.

          Bernstein looks at Kane for a moment, then looks back, tortured.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (reading again)
                        "Her singing, happily, is no concern 
                        of this department.  Of her acting,

                               (he continues to 
                               stare at the page)

                                    KANE
                               (after a short 
                               silence)
                        Go on!

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (without looking up)
                        That's all there is.

          Kane snatches the paper from the roller and reads it for 
          himself.  Slowly, a queer look comes over his face.  Then he 
          speaks, very quietly.

                                    KANE
                        Of her acting, it is absolutely 
                        impossible to say anything except 
                        that it represents a new low...
                               (then sharply)
                        Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein?
                        In the opinion of this reviewer -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (miserably)
                        I didn't see that.

                                    KANE
                        It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm 
                        dictating it.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (looks at him)
                        I can't take shorthand.

                                    KANE
                        Get me a typewriter.  I'll finish 
                        the notice.

          Bernstein retreats from the room.

          Long shot of Kane in his shirt sleeves, illuminated by a desk

          Bernstein speaking to Thompson.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        He finished it.  He wrote the worst 
                        notice I ever read about the girl 
                        he loved.  We ran it in every paper.

                                    THOMPSON
                               (after a pause)
                        I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so 
                        well of Susie's art anyway.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (looks at him very 
                               soberly)
                        He thought she was great, Mr. 
                        Thompson.  He really believed that.  
                        He put all his ambition on that 
                        girl.  After she came along, he 
                        never really cared for himself 
                        like he used to.  Oh, I don't
                        blame Susie -

                                    THOMPSON
                        Well, then, how could he write 
                        that roast?  The notices in the 
                        Kane papers were always very kind 
                        to her.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Oh, yes.  He saw to that.  I tell 
                        you, Mr. Thompson, he was a hard 
                        man to figure out.  He had that 
                        funny sense of humor.  And then, 
                        too, maybe he thought by finishing 
                        that piece he could show Leland he 
                        was an honest man.  You see, Leland 
                        didn't think so.  I guess he showed 
                        him all right.  He's a nice fellow, 
                        but he's a dreamer.  They were 
                        always together in those early 
                        days when we just started the 
                        Enquirer.

          On these last words, we

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CITY ROOM - ENQUIRER BUILDING - DAY -

          The front half of the second floor constitutes one large City 
          Room.  Despite the brilliant sunshine outside, very little of 
          it is actually getting into the room because the windows are 
          small and narrow.  There are about a dozen tables and desks, 
          of the old-fashioned type, not flat, available for reporters.  
          Two tables, on a raised platform at the end of the room, 
          obviously serve the city room executives.  To the left of the 
          platform is an open door which leads into the Sanctrum.

          As Kane and Leland enter the room, an elderly, stout gent on 
          the raised platform, strikes a bell and the other eight 
          occupants of the room - all men - rise and face the new 
          arrivals.  Carter, the elderly gent, in formal clothes, rises 
          and starts toward them.

                                    CARTER
                        Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the 
                        "Enquirer."  I am Herbert Carter.

                                    KANE
                        Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr.
                        Leland.

                                    CARTER
                               (bowing)
                        How do you do, Mr. Leland?

                                    KANE
                               (pointing to the 
                               standing reporters)
                        Are they standing for me?

                                    CARTER
                        I thought it would be a nice gesture
                        the new publisher -

                                    KANE
                               (grinning)
                        Ask them to sit down.

                                    CARTER
                        You may resume your work, gentlemen.
                               (to Kane)
                        I didn't know your plans and so I 
                        was unable to make any preparations.

                                    KANE
                        I don't my plans myself.

          They are following Carter to his raised platform.

                                    KANE
                        As a matter of fact, I haven't got 
                        any.  Except to get out a newspaper.

          There is a terrific crash at the doorway.  They all turn to 
          see Bernstein sprawled at the entrance.  A roll of bedding, a 
          suitcase, and two framed pictures were too much for him.

                                    KANE
                        Oh, Mr. Bernstein!

          Bernstein looks up.

                                    KANE
                        If you would come here a moment,
                        please, Mr. Bernstein?

          Bernstein rises and comes over, tidying himself as he comes.

                                    KANE
                        Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein.
                        Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.

                                    CARTER
                               (frigidly)
                        How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?

                                    KANE
                        You've got a private office here, 
                        haven't you?

          The delivery wagon driver has now appeared in the entrance 
          with parts of the bedstead and other furniture.  He is looking 
          about, a bit bewildered.

          is working feverishly on copy and eating a very sizeable meal 
          at the same time.  Carter, still formally coated, is seated 
          alongside him.  Leland, seated in a corner, is looking on, 
          detached, amused.  The furniture has been pushed around and 
          Kane's effects are somewhat in place.  On a corner of the desk, 
          Bernstein is writing down figures.  No one pays any attention 
          to him.

                                    KANE
                        I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, 
                        but here's what I mean.  There's a 
                        front page story in the "Chronicle,"
                               (points to it)
                        and a picture - of a woman in 
                        Brooklyn who is missing.  Probably 
                        murdered.
                               (looks to make sure 
                               of the name)
                        A Mrs. Harry Silverstone.  Why 
                        didn't the "Enquirer" have that 
                        this morning?

                                    CARTER
                               (stiffly)
                        Because we're running a newspaper, 
                        Mr.  Kane, not a scandal sheet.

          Kane has finished eating.  He pushes away his plates.

                                    KANE
                        I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go 
                        to Rector's and get something 
                        decent.
                               (pointing to the 
                               "Chronicle" before 
                               him)
                        The "Chronicle" has a two-column 
                        headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't 
                        we?

                                    CARTER
                        There is no news big enough.

                                    KANE
                        If the headline is big enough, it 
                        makes the new big enough.  The 
                        murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -

                                    CARTER
                               (hotly)
                        As a matter of fact, we sent a man 
                        to the Silverstone home yesterday 
                        afternoon.
                               (triumphantly)
                        Our man even arrived before the 
                        "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's 
                        no proof that the woman was murdered -
                        or even that she's dead.

                                    KANE
                               (smiling a bit)
                        The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's 
                        murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the 
                        neighbors are getting suspicious.

                                    CARTER
                               (stiffly)
                        It's not our function to report 
                        the gossip of housewives.  If we 
                        were interested in that kind of 
                        thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the 
                        paper twice over daily -

                                    KANE
                               (gently)
                        That's the kind of thing we are 
                        going to be interested in from now 
                        on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish 
                        you'd send your best man up to see 
                        Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell 
                        Mr.  Silverstone if he doesn't 
                        produce his wife at once, the 
                        "Enquirer" will have him arrested.
                               (he gets an idea)
                        Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's 
                        a detective from the Central Office.
                        If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his 
                        badge, your man is to get indignant 
                        and call Mr. Silverstone an 
                        anarchist.

          Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.

                                    CARTER
                        Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the
                        function of a respectable newspaper -

          Kane isn't listening to him.

                                    KANE
                        Oh, Mr. Bernstein!

          Bernstein looks up from his figures.

                                    KANE
                        I've just made a shocking discovery.
                        The "Enquirer" is without a 
                        telephone.  Have two installed at 
                        once!

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        I ordered six already this morning!
                        Got a discount!

          Kane looks at Leland with a fond nod of his head at Bernstein.  
          Leland grins back.  Mr. Carter, meantime, has risen stiffly.

                                    CARTER
                        But, Mr. Kane -

                                    KANE
                        That'll be all today, Mr. Carter.
                        You've been most understanding.
                        Good day, Mr. Carter!

          Carter, with a look that runs just short of apoplexy, leaves 
          the room, closing the door behind him.

                                    LELAND
                        Poor Mr. Carter!

                                    KANE
                               (shakes his head)
                        What makes those fellows think 
                        that a newspaper is something rigid, 
                        something inflexible, that people
                        are supposed to pay two cents for -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (without looking up)
                        Three cents.

                                    KANE
                               (calmly)
                        Two cents.

          Bernstein lifts his head and looks at Kane.  Kane gazes back 
          at him.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (tapping on the 
                               paper)
                        This is all figured at three cents 
                        a copy.

                                    KANE
                        Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at 
                        two cents.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (sighs and puts 
                               papers in his pocket)
                        All right, but I'll keep these 
                        figures, too, just in case.

                                    KANE
                        Ready for dinner, Brad?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Mr. Leland, if Mr. Kane, he should 
                        decide to drop the price to one 
                        cent, or maybe even he should make 
                        up his mind to give the paper away 
                        with a half-pound of tea - you'll 
                        just hold him until I get back, 
                        won't you?

                                    LELAND
                        I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr.
                        Bernstein.  You people work too 
                        fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Who said anything about brooms?

                                    KANE
                        It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein.  A 
                        new broom sweeps clean.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Oh!

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT.PRIMITIVE COMPOSING AND PRESSROOM - NEW YORK ENQUIRER - 
          NIGHT -

          The ground floor witht he windows on the street - of the 
          "Enquirer."  It is almost midnight by an old-fashioned clock 
          on the wall.  Grouped around a large table, on which are several 
          locked forms of type, very old-fashioned of course, but true 
          to the period - are Kane and Leland in elegant evening clothes, 
          Bernstein, unchanged from the afternoon, and Smathers, the 
          composing room foreman, nervous and harassed.

                                    SMATHERS
                        But it's impossible, Mr. Kane.  We 
                        can't remake these pages.

                                    KANE
                        These pages aren't made up as I 
                        want them, Mr. Smathers.  We go to 
                        press in five minutes.

                                    CARTER
                               (about to crack up)
                        The "Enquirer" has an old and 
                        honored tradition, Mr. Kane...  
                        The "Enquirer" is not in competition 
                        with those other rags.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        We should be publishing such rags,
                        that's all I wish.  Why, the 
                        "Enquirer" - I wouldn't wrap up 
                        the liver for the cat in the 
                        "Enquirer" -

                                    CARTER
                               (enraged)
                        Mr. Kane, I must ask you to see to 
                        it that this - this person learns 
                        to control his tongue.

          Kane looks up.

                                    CARTER
                        I've been a newspaperman my whole 
                        life and I don't intend -
                               (he starts to sputter)
                        - if it's your intention that I 
                        should continue to be harassed by 
                        this - this -
                               (he's really sore)
                        I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go 
                        against my grain to desert you 
                        when you need me so badly - but I 
                        would feel obliged to ask that my 
                        resignation be accepted.

                                    KANE
                        It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with 
                        assurances of my deepest regard.

                                    CARTER
                        But Mr. Kane, I meant -

          Kane turns his back on him, speaks again to the composing room 
          foreman.

                                    KANE
                               (quietly)
                        Let's remake these pages, Mr. 
                        Smathers.  We'll have to publish a 
                        half hour late, that's all.

                                    SMATHERS
                               (as though Kane 
                               were talking Greek)
                        We can't remake them, Mr. Kane.  
                        We go to press in five minutes.

          Kane sighs, unperturbed, as he reaches out his hand and shoves 
          the forms off the table onto the floor, where they scatter 
          into hundreds of bits.

                                    KANE
                        You can remake them now, can't 
                        you, Mr. Smathers?

          Smather's mouth opens wider and wider.  Bradford and Bernstein 
          are grinning.

                                    KANE
                        After the types 've been reset and 
                        the pages have been remade according 
                        to the way I told you before, Mr.
                        Smathers, kindly have proofs pulled 
                        and bring them to me.  Then, if I 
                        can't find any way to improve them
                        again -
                               (almost as if 
                               reluctantly)
                        - I suppose we'll have to go to 
                        press.

          He starts out of the room, followed by Leland.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (to Smathers)
                        In case you don't understand, Mr.
                        Smathers - he's a new broom.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - VERY EARLY DAWN -

          The picture is mainly occupied by a large building, on the 
          roof of which the lights spell out the word "Enquirer" against 
          the sunrise.  We do not see the street or the first few stories 
          of this building, the windows of which would be certainly 
          illuminated.  What we do see is the floor on which is located 
          the City Room.  Over this scene, newboys are heard selling the 
          Chronicle, their voices growing in volume.

          As the dissolve complete itself, camera moves toward the one 
          lighted window - the window of the Sanctrum.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. KANE'S OFFICE - VERY EARLY DAWN -

          The newsboys are still heard from the street below - fainter 
          but very insistent.

          Kane's office is gas-lit, of course, as is the rest of the 
          Enquirer building.

          Kane, in his shirt sleeves, stands at the open window looking 
          out.  The bed is already made up.  On it is seated Bernstein, 
          smoking the end of a cigar.  Leland is in a chair.

                                    NEWSBOYS' VOICES
                        CHRONICLE!  CHRONICLE!  H'YA - THE 
                        CHRONICLE - GET YA!  CHRONICLE!

          Kane, taking a deep breath of the morning air, closes the window 
          and turns to the others.  The voices of the newsboys, naturally, 
          are very much fainter after this.

                                    LELAND
                        We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - 
                        another ten minutes.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (looking at his 
                               watch)
                        It's three hours and fifty minutes
                        late - but we did it -

          Leland rises from the chair, stretching painfully.

                                    KANE
                        Tired?

                                    LELAND
                        It's been a tough day.

                                    KANE
                        A wasted day.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (looking up)
                        Wasted?

                                    LELAND
                               (incredulously)
                        Charlie?!

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        You just made the paper over four
                        times today, Mr. Kane.  That's all -

                                    KANE
                        I've changed the front page a 
                        little, Mr. Bernstein.  That's not 
                        enough - There's something I've 
                        got to get into this paper besides 
                        pictures and print -  I've got to 
                        make the "New York Enquirer" as 
                        important to New York as the gas 
                        in that light.

                                    LELAND
                               (quietly)
                        What're you going to do, Charlie?

          Kane looks at him for a minute with a queer smile of happy 
          concentration.

                                    KANE
                        My Declaration of Principles -
                               (he says it with 
                               quotes around it)
                        Don't smile, Brad -
                               (getting the idea)
                        Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -

                                    KANE
                        I'll write it myself.

          Kane grabs a piece of rough paper and a grease crayon.  Sitting 
          down on the bed next to Bernstein, he starts to write.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (looking over his 
                               shoulder)
                        You don't wanta make any promises, 
                        Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.

                                    KANE
                               (as he writes)
                        These'll be kept.
                               (stops for a minute 
                               and reads what he 
                               has written; reading)
                        I'll provide the people of this 
                        city with a daily paper that will 
                        tell all the news honestly.
                               (starts to write 
                               again; reading as 
                               he writes)
                        will also provide them -

                                    LELAND
                        That's the second sentence you've
                        started with "I" -

                                    KANE
                               (looking up)
                        People are going to know who's 
                        responsible.  And they're going to
                        get the news - the true news -
                        quickly and simply and 
                        entertainingly.
                               (he speaks with 
                               real conviction)
                        And no special interests will be 
                        allowed to interfere with the truth 
                        of that news.

          He looks at Leland for a minute and goes back to his writing, 
          reading as he writes.

          Bernstein has risen and crossed to one side of Kane.  They 
          both stand looking out.  Leland joins him on the other side.  
          Their three heads are silhouetted against the sky.  Leland's 
          head is seen to turn slightly as he looks into Kane's face - 
          camera very close on this - Kane turns to him and we know their 
          eyes have met, although their faces are almost in sillhouette.  
          Bernstein is still smoking a cigar.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Front page of the "Enquirer" shows big boxed editorial with 
          heading:

          MY PRINCIPLES - A DECLARATION BY CHARLES FOSTER KANE

          Camera continues pulling back and shows newspaper to be on the 
          top of a pile of newspapers.  As we draw further back, we see 
          four piles, and as camera contines to pull back, we see six 
          piles and go on back until we see a big field of "Enquirers" - 
          piles of "Enquirers" - all 26,000 copies ready for distribution.

          A wagon with a huge sign on its side reading

          "ENQUIRER - CIRCULATION 26,000"

          passes through foreground, and we wipe to:

          A pile of "Enquirers" for sale on a broken down wooden box on 
          a street corner, obviously a poor district.  A couple of coins 
          fall on the pile.

          The stoop of a period door with old-fashioned enamel milk can 
          and a bag of rolls.  Across the sidewalk before this, moves 
          the shadow of an old-fashioned bicycle with an enormous front 
          wheel.  A copy of the "Enquirer" is tossed on the stoop.

          A breakfast table - beautiful linen and beautiful silver - 
          everything very expensive, gleaming in the sunshine.  Into a 
          silver newspaper rack there is slipped a copy of the "Enquirer".  
          Here, as before, the boxed editorial reading MY PRINCIPLES - A 
          DECLARATION BY CHARLES FOSTER KANE, is very prominent on the 
          front page.

          The wooden floor of a railroad station, flashing light and 
          dark as a train behind the camera rushes by.  On the floor, 
          there is tossed a bound bundle of the "New York Enquirer" - 
          the Declaration of Principles still prominent.

          Rural Delivery - a copy of the "Enquirer"s being put into bins, 
          showing state distribution.

          The railroad platform again.  We stay here for four images.  
          On each image, the speed of the train is faster and the piles 
          of the "Enquirer" are larger.  On the first image, we move in 
          to hold on the words "CIRCULATION - 31,000."  We are this close 
          for the next pile which reads 40,000; the next one which reads 
          55,000, and the last which is 62,000.  In each instance, the 
          bundles of newspapers are thicker and the speed of the moving 
          train behind the camera is increased.

          The entire montage above indicated is accompanied by a 
          descriptive complement of sound - the traffic noises of New 
          York in the 1890's; wheels on cobblestones and horses' hooves; 
          bicycle bells; the mooning of cattle and the crowing of roosters 
          (in the RFD shot), and in all cases where the railroad platform 
          is used - the mounting sound of the railroad train.

          The last figure "62,000" opposite the word "CIRCULATION" on 
          the "Enquirer" masthead changes to:

          EXT. STREET AND CHRONICLE BUIDING - DAY -

          Angle up to wall of building - a painter on a cradle is putting 
          the last zero to the figure "62,000" on an enormous sign 
          advertising the "Enquirer."  It reads:

          THE ENQUIRER  THE PEOPLE'S NEWSPAPER  CIRCULATION 62,000

          Camera travels down side of building - takes in another building 
          on which there is a sign which reads:

          READ THE ENQUIRER  AMERICA'S FINEST  CIRCULATION 62,000

          Camera continues to travel down to sidewalk in front of the 
          Chronicle office.  The Chronicle office has a plateglass window 
          in which is reflected traffic moving up and down the street, 
          also the figures of Kane, Leland and Bernstein, who are munching 
          peanuts.

          Inside the window, almost filling it, is a large photograph of 
          the "Chronicle" staff, with Reilly prominently seated in the 
          center.  A sign over the photo reads: EDITORIAL AND EXECUTIVE 
          STAFF OF THE NEW YORK CHRONICLE.  A sign beneath it reads: 
          GREATEST NEWSPAPER STAFF IN THE WORLD.  The sign also includes 
          the "Chronicle" circulation figure.  There are nine men in the 
          photo.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (looking up at the 
                               sign - happily)
                        Sixty-two thousand -

                                    LELAND
                        That looks pretty nice.

                                    KANE
                               (indicating the 
                               Chronicle Building)
                        Let's hope they like it there.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        From the Chronicle Building that 
                        sign is the biggest thing you can 
                        see - every floor guaranteed - 
                        let's hope it bothers them - it 
                        cost us enough.

                                    KANE
                               (pointing to the 
                               sign over the 
                               photograph in the 
                               window)
                        Look at that.

                                    LELAND
                        The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.

                                    KANE
                        It's a good idea for a newspaper.
                               (reading the figures)
                        Four hundred sixy thousand.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Say, with them fellows -
                               (referring to the 
                               photo)
                        - it's no trick to get circulation.

                                    KANE
                        You're right, Mr. Bernstein.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (sighs)
                        You know how long it took the 
                        "Chronicle" to get that staff 
                        together?  Twenty years.

                                    KANE
                        I know.

          Kane, smiling, lights a cigarette, at the same time looking 
          into the window.  Camera moves in to hold on the photograph of 
          nine men, still holding the reflection of Kane's smiling face.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CITY ROOM - THE ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          Nine men, arrayed as in the photograph, but with Kane beaming 
          in the center of the first row.  The men, variously with 
          mustaches, beards, bald heads, etc. are easily identified as 
          being the same men, Reilly prominent amongst them.

          As camera pulls back, it is revealed that they are being 
          photographed - by an old-type professional photographer, big 
          box, black hood and all - in a corner of the room.  It is 1:30 
          at night.  Desks, etc. have been pushed against the wall.  
          Running down the center of the room is a long banquet table, 
          at which twenty diners have finished their meals.  The eleven 
          remaining at their seats - these include Bernstein and Leland - 
          are amusedly watching the photographic ceremonies.

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        That's all.  Thank you.

          The photographic subjects rise.

                                    KANE
                               (a sudden thought)
                        Make up an extra copy and mail it 
                        to the "Chronicle."

          Chuckling and beaming, he makes his way to his place at the 
          head of the table.  The others have already sat down.  Kane 
          gets his guests' attention by rapping on the table with a knife.

                                    KANE
                        Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This 
                        has, I think, been a fitting welcome
                        to those distinguished journalists -
                               (indicates the eight 
                               men)
                        Mr. Reilly in particular - who are 
                        the latest additions to our ranks.
                        It will make them happy to learn 
                        that the "Enquirer's" circulation 
                        this morning passed the two hundred 
                        thousand mark.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Two hundred and one thousand, six 
                        hundred and forty-seven.

          General applause.

                                    KANE
                        All of you - new and old -  You're 
                        all getting the best salaries in 
                        town.  Not one of you has been 
                        hired because of his loyalty.  
                        It's your talent I'm interested 
                        in.  That talent that's going to 
                        make the "Enquirer" the kind of 
                        paper I want - the best newspaper 
                        in the world!

          Applause.

                                    KANE
                        However, I think you'll agree we've 
                        heard enough about newspapers and 
                        the newspaper business for one 
                        night.  There are other subjects 
                        in the world.

          He puts his two fingers in his mouth and lets out a shrill 
          whistle.  This is a signal.  A band strikes up a lively ditty 
          of the period and enters in advance a regiment of very 
          magnificent maidens, as daringly arrayed as possible in the 
          chorus costumes of the day.  The rest of this episode will be 
          planned and staged later.  Its essence is that Kane is just a 
          healthy and happy young man having a wonderful time.

          As some of the girls are detached from the line and made into 
          partners for individual dancing -

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          THE "ENQUIRER" SIGN:  THE ENQUIRER  AMERICA'S FINEST  
          CIRCULATION 274,321

          Dissolve just completes itself - the image of Kane dancing 
          with a girl on each arm just disappears as camera pans down 
          off the Temple Bldg. in the same action as the previous street 
          scene.  There is a new sign on the side of the building below.  
          It reads:

          READ THE ENQUIRER GREATEST STAFF IN THE WORLD

          Camera continues panning as we

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          A montage of various scenes, between the years 1891-1900.

          The scenes indicate the growth of the "Enquirer" under the 
          impulse of Kane's personal drive.  Kane is shown, thus, at 
          various activities:

          Move down from the sign: READ THE ENQUIRER  GREATEST STAFF IN 
          THE WORLD to street in front of saloon with parade passing 
          (boys going off to the Spanish-American War)-  A torchlight 
          parade with the torches reflected in the glass window of the 
          saloon - the sound of brass band playing "It's a Hot Time."  
          In the window of the saloon is a large sign or poster "REMEMBER 
          THE MAINE"

          INSERT:  Remington drawing of American boys, similar to the 
          parade above, in which "Our Boys" in the expeditionary hats 
          are seen marching off to war.

          Back of observation car.  Shot of Kane congratulating Teddy 
          Roosevelt (the same shot as in the News Digest - without 
          flickering).

          The wooden floor of the railroad platform again - a bundle of 
          "Enquirers" - this time an enormous bundle - is thrown down, 
          and the moving shadows of the train behind the camera indicate 
          that it is going like a bat out of hell.  A reproduction of 
          Kane and Teddy shaking hands as above is very prominent in the 
          frame and almost hogs the entire front page.  The headline 
          indicates the surrender of Cuba.

          INT. ENQUIRER OFFICE

          Cartoon, highly dramatic and very involved as to content - 
          lousy with captions, labels, and symbolic figures, the most 
          gruesome and recognizable - "Capitalistic Greed."  This cartoon 
          is almost finished and is on a drawing board before which stand 
          Kane and the artist himself.  Kane is grinning over some 
          suggestion he has made.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          The cartoon finished and reproduced on the editorial page of 
          the "Enquirer" - in quite close, with an editorial and several 
          faces of caps shown underneath.  The entire newspaper is crushed 
          with an angry gesture and thrown down into an expensive-looking 
          wastebasket (which is primarily for ticker tape) tape is 
          pouring.

          INT. ENQUIRER OFFICE

          Cartoonist and Kane working on comic strip of "Johnny the Monk."

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Floor of room -  Two kids on floor, with newspaper spread out, 
          looking at the same comic strip.

          Kane's photographic gallery with photographers, stooges, and 
          Kane himself in attendance on a very hot-looking item of the 
          period.  A sob sister is interviewing this hot number and Kane 
          is arranging her dress to look more seductive.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          The hot number reproduced and prominently displayed and covering 
          almost half a page of the "Enquirer."  It is being read in a 
          barber shop and is seen in an over-shoulder shot of the man 
          who is reading it.  He is getting a shine, a manicure, and a 
          haircut.  The sob-sister caption over the photograph reveals: 
          "I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING, SAYS DANCER.  EVERYTHING WENT 
          RED."  An oval photograph of the gun is included in the lay-
          out of the pretty lady with a headline which says: "DEATH GUN."

          STREET - SHOT OF BUCKET BRIGADE

          Shot of Kane, in evening clothes, in obvious position of danger, 
          grabbing camera from photographer.  Before him rages a terrific 
          tenement fire.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INSERT:  Headline about inadequacy of present fire equipment.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Final shot of a new horse-drawn steam engine roaring around a 
          street corner (Stock).

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          A black pattern of iron bars.  We are in a prison cell.  The 
          door is opened and a condemned man, with priest, warden and 
          the usual attendants, moves into foreground and starts up the 
          hall past a group which includes phtographers, Kane's sob-
          sister, and Kane.  The photographers take pictures with a mighty 
          flash of old-fashioned flash powder.  The condemned man in the 
          foreground (in silhouette) is startled by this.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          A copy of the "Enquirer" spread out on a table.  A big lay-out 
          of the execution story includes the killer as photographed by 
          Kane's photographers, and nearby on the other page there is a 
          large picture of the new steam fire engine (made from the stock 
          shot) with a headline indicating that the "Enquirer" has won 
          its campaign for better equipment.  A cup of coffee and a 
          doughnut are on the newspaper, and a servant girl - over whose 
          shoulder we see the paper - is stirring the coffee.

          The Beaux Art Ball.  A number of elderly swells are jammed 
          into a hallway.  Servants suddenly divest them of their furs, 
          overcoats and wraps, revealing them to be in fancy dress 
          costume, pink fleshings, etc., the effect to be very surprising, 
          very lavish and very very ridiculous.  We see, among others, 
          Mr. Thatcher himself (as Ben Hur) ribbon around, his bald head 
          and all.  At the conclusion of this tableau, the image freezes 
          and we pull back to show it reproduced on the society page of 
          the "New York Enquirer."

          Over the "Enquirer"'s pictorial version of the Beaux Art Ball 
          is thrown a huge fish - then coffee grounds - altogether a 
          pretty repulsive sight.

          The whole thing is bundled up and thrown into a garbage can.

          Extreme close-up of the words: "OCCUPATION - JOUNALIST."

          Camera pulls back to show passport open to the photograph page 
          which shows Kane, registering birth, race, and nationality.  
          Passport cover is closed, showing it to be an American passport.

          EXT. CUNARD DOCKS - GANGPLANK AND DECK OF BOAT - NIGHT -

          As camera pulls back over shoulder of official, taking in Kane, 
          Leland, and Bernstein, we see the bustle and noise of departing 
          ocean liner.  Behind the principles can be seen an enormous 
          plain sign which reads: "FIRST CLASS."  From offstage can be 
          heard the steward's cry, indispensable in any Mercury 
          production, the old familiar cry, "All Ashore That's Going 
          Ashore!" - gongs, also blasts of the great whistle and all the 
          rest of it.

                                    THE OFFICIAL
                        There you are, Mr. Kane.  Everything 
                        in order.

                                    KANE
                        Thank you.

          Kane and Leland and Bernstein start up the gangplank.

                                    THE OFFICIAL
                               (calling)
                        Have a good rest, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        Thanks.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        But please, Mr. Kane, don't buy 
                        any more paintings.  Nine Venuses 
                        already we got, twenty-six Virgins - 
                        two whole warehouses full of stuff -

                                    KANE
                        I promise not to bring any more 
                        Venuses and not to worry - and not 
                        to try to get in touch with any of
                        the papers -

                                    STEWARD'S VOICE
                        All ashore!

                                    KANE
                        - and to forget about the new 
                        feature sections - and not to try 
                        to think up and ideas for comic 
                        sections.

                                    STEWARD'S VOICE
                        All ashore that's going ashore!

          Kane leaves Leland and Bernstein midway up gangplank, as he 
          rushes up to it, calling back with a wave:

                                    KANE
                        Goodbye, gents!
                               (at the top of the 
                               gangplank, he turns 
                               and calls down)
                        Hey!

                                    KANE
                               (calling down to 
                               them)
                        You don't expect me to keep any of 
                        those promises, do you?

          A band on deck strikes up "Auld Lang Syne."  Bernstein and 
          Leland turn to each other.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Do you, Mr. Leland?

                                    LELAND
                               (smiling)
                        Certainly not.

          They start down the gangplank together.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          LONG SHOT OF THE ENQUIRER BUILDING - NIGHT

          The pattern of telegraph wires, dripping with rain, through 
          which we see the same old building but now rendered fairly 
          remarkable by tremendous outline sign in gold which reads "THE 
          NEW YORK DAILY ENQUIRER."  A couple of lights show in the 
          building.  We start toward the window where the lights show, 
          as we -

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          EXT. OUTSIDE THE WINDOW AT BERNSTEIN'S DESK - NIGHT

          The light in the window in the former shot was showing behind 
          the letter "E" of the Enquirer sign.  Now the letter "E" is 
          even larger than the frame of the camera.  Rain drips 
          disconsolately off the middle part of the figure.  We see 
          through this and through the drizzle of the window to 
          Bernstein's desk where he sits working under a blue shaded 
          light.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          Same setup as before except that it is now late afternoon and 
          late in the winter of the year.  The outline "E" is hung with 
          icicles which are melting, dripping despairingly between us 
          and Mr. Bernstein, still seated at his desk - still working.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Same setup as before except that it is spring.  Instead of the 
          sad sounds of dripping rain or dripping icicles, we hear the 
          melancholy cry of a hurdy-gurdy in the street below.  It is 
          spring and through the letter "E" we can see Bernstein working 
          at his desk.  Pigeons are gathering on the "E" and on the sill.  
          Bernstein looks up and sees them.  He takes some crumbs from 
          his little homemade lunch which is spread out on the desk before 
          him, carries them to the windows and feeds the pigeons, looking 
          moodily out on the prospect of spring on Park Row.  The birds 
          eat the crumbs - the hurdy-gurdy continues to play.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          The same setup again, it is now summer.  The window was half-
          open before .. now it's open all the way and Bernstein has 
          gone so far as to take off his coat.  His shirt and his 
          celluloid collar are wringing wet.  Camera moves toward the 
          window to tighten on Bernstein and to take in the City Room 
          behind him, which is absolutely deserted.  It is clear that 
          there is almost nothing more for Bernstein to do.  The hurdy-
          gurdy in the street is playing as before, but a new tune.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          A beach on Coney Island.

          Bernstein in a rented period bathing suit sits alone in the 
          sand, reading a copy of the "Enquirer."

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          INT. CITY ROOM - ENQUIRER BUILDING - DAY -

          The whole floor is now a City Room.  It is twice its former 
          size, yet not too large for all the desks and the people using 
          them.  The windows have been enlarged, providing a good deal 
          more light and air.  A wall calendar says September 9th.

          Kane and Bernstein enter and stand in the entrance a moment.  
          Kane, who really did look a bit peaked before, is now clear-
          eyed and tanned.  He is wearing new English clothes.  As they 
          come into the room, Bernstein practically walking sideways, is 
          doing nothing but beaming and admiring Kane, quelling like a 
          mother at the Carnegie Hall debut of her son.  Seeing and 
          recognizing Kane, the entire staff rises to its feet.

                                    KANE
                               (referring to the 
                               staff; with a smile)
                        Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Sit down, everybody - for heaven's 
                        sake!

          The order is immediately obeyed, everybody going into business 
          of feverish activity.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        So then, tonight, we go over 
                        everything thoroughly, eh?  
                        Especially the new papers -

                                    KANE
                        We certainly do.  Vacation's over -
                        starting right after dinner.  But
                        right now - that lady over there -
                               (he indicates a 
                               woman at the desk)
                        - that's the new society editor, I 
                        take it?  You think I could 
                        interrupt her a moment, Mr. 
                        Bernstein?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Huh?  Oh, I forgot - you've been 
                        away so long I forgot about your
                        joking -

          He trails after Kane as he approaches the Society Editor's 
          desk.  The Society Editor, a middle-aged spinster, sees him 
          approaching and starts to quake all over, but tries to pretend 
          she isn't aware of him.  An envelope in her hand shakes 
          violently.  Kane and Bernstein stop at her desk.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Miss Townsend -

          Miss Townsend looks up and is so surprised to see Bernstein 
          with a stranger.

                                    MISS TOWNSEND
                        Good afternoon, Mr. Bernstein.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        This is Mr. Kane, Miss Townsend.

          Miss Townsend can't stick to her plan.  She starts to rise, 
          but her legs are none too good under her.  She knocks over a 
          tray of copy paper as she rises, and bends to pick it up.

                                    KANE
                               (very hesitatingly 
                               and very softly)
                        Miss Townsend -

          At the sound of his voice, she straightens up.  She is very 
          close to death from excitement.

                                    KANE
                        I've been away for several months, 
                        and I don't know exactly how these 
                        things are handled now.  But one 
                        thing I wanted to be sure of is 
                        that you won't treat this little 
                        announcement any differently than 
                        you would any other similar 
                        announcement.

          He hands her an envelope.  She has difficulty in holding on to 
          it.

                                    KANE
                               (gently)
                        Read it, Miss Townsend.  And 
                        remember - just the regular 
                        treatment!  See you at nine o'clock, 
                        Mr. Bernstein!

          Kane leaves.  Bernstein looks after him, then at the paper.  
          Miss Townsend finally manages to open the envelope.  A piece 
          of flimsy paper, with a few written lines, is her reward.

                                    MISS TOWNSEND
                               (reading)
                        Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Moore Norton 
                        announce the engagement of their 
                        daughter, Emily Monroe Norton, to 
                        Mr.  Charles Foster Kane.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (starts to read it)
                        Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Moore Norton
                        announce -

                                    MISS TOWNSEND
                               (fluttering - on 
                               top of him)
                        She's - she's the niece of - of 
                        the President of the United States -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (nodding proudly)
                        know.  Come on, Miss Townsend -
                        From the window, maybe we can get 
                        a look.

          He takes her by the hand and leads her off.

          Angle toward open window.  Bernstein and Miss Townsend, backs 
          to camera, rushing to the window.

          EXT. STREET OUTSIDE ENQUIRER BUILDING - DAY -

          High angle downward - what Bernstein and Miss Townsend see 
          from the window.

          Kane is just stepping into an elegant barouch, drawn up at the 
          curb, in which sits Miss Emily Norton.  He kisses her full on 
          the lips before he sits down.  She acts a bit taken aback, 
          because of the public nature of the scene, but she isn't really 
          annoyed.  As the barouche starts off, she is looking at him 
          adoringly.  He, however, has turned his head and is looking 
          adoringly at the "Enquirer."  He apparently sees Bernstein and 
          Miss Townsed and waves his hand.

          INT. CITY ROOM - ENQUIRER - DAY -

          Bernstein and Miss Townsend at window.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        A girl like that, believe me, she's 
                        lucky!  Presiden't niece, huh!  
                        Say, before he's through, she'll 
                        be a Presiden't wife.

          Miss Townsend is now dewey-eyed.  She looks at Bernstein, who 
          has turned away, gazing down at the departing couple.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Front page of the "Enquirer."  Large picture of the young couple - 
          Kane and Emily - occupying four columns - very happy.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. BERNSTEIN'S OFFICE - ENQUIRER - DAY -

          Bernstein and Thompson.  As the dissolve comes, Bernstein's 
          voice is heard.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        The way things turned out, I don't 
                        need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton 
                        was no rosebud!

                                    THOMPSON
                        It didn't end very well, did it?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (shaking his head)
                        It ended -
                               (a slight pause)
                        Then there was Susie - that ended, 
                        too.
                               (shrugs, a pause; 
                               then looking up 
                               into Thompson's 
                               eyes)
                        guess he didn't make her very happy -

                                    (A PAUSE)
                        You know, I was thinking - that 
                        Rosebud you're trying to find out 
                        about -

                                    THOMPSON
                        Yes -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Maybe that was something he lost.  
                        Mr. Kane was a man that lost - 
                        almost everything he had -
                               (a pause)
                        You ought to talk to Bradford 
                        Leland.  He could tell you a lot.  
                        I wish I could tell you where Leland 
                        is, but I don't know myself.  He 
                        may be out of town somewhere - he 
                        may be dead.

                                    THOMPSON
                        In case you'd like to know, Mr.
                        Bernstein, he's at the Huntington 
                        Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        You don't say!  Why I had no idea -

                                    THOMPSON
                        Nothing particular the matter with
                        him, they tell me.  Just -
                               (controls himself)

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Just old age.
                               (smiles sadly)
                        It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson, 
                        you don't look forward to being 
                        cured of.
                               (pauses)
                        You ought to see Mr. Leland.  
                        There's a whole lot of things he 
                        could tell you - if he wanted to.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:

          EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF - DAY -

          Close shot - Thompson.  He is tilted back in a chair which 
          seems to be, and is, leaning against a chimney.  Leland's voice 
          is heard for a few moments before Leland is seen.

                                    LELAND'S VOICE
                        When you get to my age, young man, 
                        you don't miss anything.  Unless 
                        maybe it's a good drink of bourbon.
                        Even that doesn't make much 
                        difference, if you remember there 
                        hasn't been any good bourbon in 
                        this country for twenty years.

          Camera has pulled back, during above speech, revealing that 
          Leland, wrapped in a blanket, is in a wheel chair, talking to 
          Thompson.  They are on the flat roof of a hospital.  Other 
          people in wheel chairs can be seen in the background, along 
          with a nurse or two.  They are all sunning themselves.

                                    THOMPSON
                        Mr. Leland, you were -

                                    LELAND
                        You don't happen to have a cigar, 
                        do you?  I've got a young physician - 
                        must remember to ask to see his 
                        license - the odds are a hundred 
                        to one he hasn't got one - who 
                        thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  
                        I changed the subject, didn't I?  
                        Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable 
                        old man I've become.  You want to 
                        know what I think of Charlie Kane?  
                        Well - I suppose he has some private 
                        sort of greatness.  But he kept it 
                        to himself.
                               (grinning)
                        He never - gave himself away -  He
                        never gave anything away.  He just -
                        left you a tip.  He had a generous 
                        mind.  I don't suppose anybody 
                        ever had so many opinions.  That 
                        was because he had the power to 
                        express them, and Charlie lived on 
                        power and the excitement of using 
                        it -  But he didn't believe in
                        anything except Charlie Kane.  He 
                        never had a conviction in his life.  
                        I guess he died without one -  
                        That must have been pretty 
                        unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of 
                        us check out with no special 
                        conviction about death.  But we do 
                        know what we're leaving ... we 
                        believe in something.
                               (looks sharply at 
                               Thompson)
                        You're absolutely sure you haven't 
                        got a cigar?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Sorry, Mr. Leland.

                                    LELAND
                        Never mind -  Bernstein told you 
                        about the first days at the office, 
                        didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a 
                        bad newspaper man even then.  He 
                        entertained his readers, but he 
                        never told them the truth.

                                    THOMPSON
                        Maybe you could remember something
                        that -

                                    LELAND
                        I can remember everything.  That's 
                        my curse, young man.  It's the 
                        greatest curse that's ever been 
                        inflicted on the human race.  Memory -  
                        I was his oldest friend.
                               (slowly)
                        As far as I was concerned, he 
                        behaved like swine.  Maybe I wasnt' 
                        his friend.  If I wasn't, he never 
                        had one.  Maybe I was what nowadays
                        you call a stooge -

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          The party (previously shown in the Bernstein sequence).

          We start this sequence toward the end of the former one, but 
          from a fresh angle, holding on Leland, who is at the end of 
          the table.  Kane is heard off, making a speech.

                                    KANE'S VOICE
                        Not one of you has been hired 
                        because of his loyalty.  It's your 
                        talent I'm interested in.  That 
                        talent that's going to make the 
                        "Enquirer" the kind of paper I 
                        want - the best newspaper in the 
                        world!

          Applause.  During above, Bernstein has come to Leland's side.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party!

                                    LELAND
                        Yes.

          His tone causes Bernstein to look at him.

                                    KANE'S VOICE
                        However, I think you'll agree we've 
                        heard enough about newspapers and 
                        the newspaper business for one 
                        night.

          The above speeches are heard under the following dialogue.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (to Leland)
                        What's the matter?

                                    LELAND
                        Mr. Bernstein, these men who are 
                        now with the "Enquirer" - who were 
                        with the "Chronicle" until yesterday -
                        weren't they just as devoted to 
                        the "Chronicle" kind of paper as 
                        they are now to - our kind of paper?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Sure.  They're like anybody else.
                        They got work to do.  They do it.
                               (proudly)
                        Only they happen to be the best 
                        men in the business.

                                    KANE
                               (finishing his speech)
                        There are other subjects in the 
                        world -

          Kane whistles.  The band and the chorus girls enter and hell 
          breaks loose all around Leland and Bernstein.

                                    LELAND
                               (after a minute)
                        Do we stand for the same things 
                        that the "Chronicle" stands for, 
                        Mr. Bernstein?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (indignantly)
                        Certainly not.  So what's that got 
                        to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll 
                        have them changed to his kind of 
                        newspapermen in a week.

                                    LELAND
                        Probably.  There's always a chance, 
                        of course, that they'll change Mr.
                        Kane - without his knowing it.

          Kane has come up to Leland and Bernstein.  He sits down next 
          to them, lighting a cigarette.

                                    KANE
                        Well, gentlemen, are we going to 
                        war?

                                    LELAND
                        Our readers are, anyway, I don't 
                        know about the rest of the country.

                                    KANE
                               (enthusiastically)
                        It'll be our first foreign war in 
                        fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it 
                        the way the "Hickville Gazette" 
                        covers the church social!  The 
                        names of everybody there; what 
                        they wore; what they ate; who won 
                        the prizes; who gave the prizes -
                               (gets excited)
                        I tell you, Brad, I envy you.
                               (quoting)
                        By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's"
                        Special Correspondent at the Front.
                        I'm almost tempted -

                                    LELAND
                        But there is no Front, Charlie.
                        There's a very doubtful civil war.
                        Besides, I don't want the job.

                                    KANE
                        All right, Brad, all right - you 
                        don't have to be a war correspondent 
                        unless you want to - I'd want to.
                               (looking up)
                        Hello, Georgie.

          Georgie, a very handsome madam has walked into the picture, 
          stands behind him.  She leans over and speaks quietly in his 
          ear.

                                    GEORGIE
                        Is everything the way you want it, 
                        dear?

                                    KANE
                               (looking around)
                        If everybody's having fun, that's 
                        the way I want it.

                                    GEORGIE
                        I've got some other little girls
                        coming over -

                                    LELAND
                               (interrupting)
                        Charles, I tell you there is no 
                        war!  There's a condition that 
                        should be remedied - but between 
                        that and a -

                                    KANE
                               (seriously)
                        How would the "Enquirer" look with 
                        no news about this non-existent 
                        war - with Benton, Pulitzer and 
                        Heart devoting twenty columns a 
                        day to it?

                                    LELAND
                        They do it only because you do!

                                    KANE
                               (grins)
                        And I do it because they do it, 
                        and they do it - it's a vicious 
                        circle, isn't it?
                               (rises)
                        I'm going over to Georgie's, Brad -
                        you know, Georgie, don't you?

          Leland nods.

                                    GEORGIE
                               (over Kane's next 
                               lines)
                        Glad to meet you, Brad.

          Leland shudders.

                                    KANE
                        I told you about Brad, Georgie.
                        He needs to relax.

          Brad doesn't answer.

                        Some ships with wonderful wines

                        Georgie knows a young lady whom 
                        I'm sure you'd adore - wouldn't 
                        he, Georgie?  Why only the other 
                        evening I said to myself, if Brad 
                        were only here to adore this young 
                        lady - this -

                        What's her name again?

          INT. GEORGIE'S PLACE - NIGHT -

          Georgie is introducing a young lady to Branford Leland.  On 
          sound track we hear piano music.

                                    GEORGIE
                               (right on cue from 
                               preceding scene)
                        Ethel - this gentlemen has been 
                        very anxious to meet you -  This 
                        is Ethel.

                                    ETHEL
                        Hello, Mr. Leland.

          Camera pans to include Kane, seated at piano, with girls 
          gathered around him.

                                    ONE OF THE GIRLS
                        Charlie!  Play the song about you.

                                    ANOTHER GIRL
                        Is there a song about Charlie?

          Kane has broken into "Oh, Mr. Kane!" and Charlie and the girls 
          start to sing.  Ethel leads the unhappy Leland over to the 
          group.  Kane, seeing Leland and taking his eye, motions to the 
          professor who has been standing next to him to take over.  The 
          professor does so.  The singing continues.  Kane rises and 
          crosses to Leland.

                                    KANE
                        Say, Brad.
                               (draws him slightly 
                               aside)
                        I've got an idea.

                                    LELAND
                        Yes?

                                    KANE
                        I mean I've got a job for you.

                                    LELAND
                        Good.

                                    KANE
                        You don't want to be a war 
                        correspondent - how about being a 
                        dramatic critic?

                                    LELAND
                               (sincerely, but not 
                               gushing; seriously)
                        I'd like that.

          Kane starts quietly to dance in time to the music.  Leland 
          smiles at him.

                                    KANE
                        You start tomorrow night.  Richard 
                        Carl in "The Spring Chicken."
                               (or supply show)
                        I'll get us some girls.  You get 
                        tickets.  A drama critic gets them 
                        free, you know.

                        Rector's at seven?

                        Charlie -

                                    KANE
                        Yes?

                                    LELAND
                               (still smiling)
                        It doesn't make any difference 
                        about me, but one of these days 
                        you're going to find out that all 
                        this charm of yours won't be enough -

                                    KANE
                               (has stopped dancing)
                        You're wrong.  It does make a 
                        difference to you -  Rector's, 
                        Brad?
                               (starts to dance 
                               again)
                        Come to think of it, I don't blame 
                        you for not wanting to be a war 
                        correspondent.  You won't miss 
                        anything.  It isn't much of a war.
                        Besides, they tell me there isn't 
                        a decent restaurant on the whole 
                        island.

          INT. RECTOR'S - NIGHT -

          Leland, Kane, two young ladies at Rector's.  Popular music is 
          heard over the soundtrack.  Everybody is laughing very, very 
          hard at something Kane has said.  The girls are hysterical.  
          Kane can hardly breathe.  As Leland's laughter becomes more 
          and more hearty, it only increases the laughter of the others.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          EXT. CUNARD LOCKS - GANGPLANK AND DECK OF BOAT - NIGHT -

          As told by Bernstein.  Kane is calling down to Leland and 
          Bernstein (as before).

                        You don't expect me to keep any of 
                        those promises, do you?

          A band on deck strikes up "Auld Lang Syne" and further ship-to-
          shore conversation is rendered unfeasible.

          Bernstein and Leland on deck.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (turns to Leland)
                        Do you, Mr. Leland?

                                    LELAND
                               (smiling)
                        Certainly not.

          Slight pause.  They continue on their way.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to 
                        Europe with him?  He wanted you
                        to.  He said to me just yesterday -

                                    LELAND
                        I wanted him to have fun - and 
                        with me along -

          This stops Bernstein.  Bernstein looks at him.

                                    LELAND
                        Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me
                        ask you a few questions, and answer 
                        me truthfully.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Don't I always?  Most of the time?

                                    LELAND
                        Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt?  
                        Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am 
                        I a New England school-marm?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Yes.

          Leland is surprised.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        If you thought I'd answer different 
                        from what Mr. Kane tells you - 
                        well, I wouldn't.

                                    LELAND
                               (good naturedly)
                        You're in a conspiracy against me, 
                        you two.  You always have been.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Against me there should be such a 
                        conspiracy some time!

          He pauses.  "Auld Lang Syne" can still be heard from the deck 
          of the department steamer.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (with a hopeful 
                               look in his eyes)
                        Well, he'll be coming back in 
                        September.  The Majestic.  I got 
                        the reservations.  It gets in on 
                        the ninth.

                                    LELAND
                        September the ninth?

          Leland puts his hand in his pocket, pulls out a pencil and 
          small engagement book, opens the book and starts to write.

          Leland's pencil writing on a page in the engagement book open 
          to September 9: "Rector's - 8:30 p.m."

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF - DAY -

          Leland and Thompson.  Leland is speaking as we dissolve.

                                    LELAND
                        I used to go to dancing school 
                        with her.

          Thompson had handed Leland a paper.

                                    LELAND
                        What's this?

                                    THOMPSON
                        It's a letter from her lawyers.

                                    LELAND
                               (reading aloud from 
                               the letter)
                        David, Grobleski & Davis -  My
                        dear Rawlston -
                               (looks up)

                                    THOMPSON
                        Rawlston is my boss.

                                    LELAND
                        Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.

                                    THOMPSON
                        He knows the first Mrs. Kane 
                        socially -  That's the answer we 
                        got.

                                    LELAND
                               (reading)
                        I am in receipt of your favor of 
                        yesterday.  I beg you to do me the 
                        courtesy of accepting my assurance 
                        that Mrs. Whitehall cannot be 
                        induced to contribute any more 
                        information on the career of Charles 
                        Foster Kane.

          She has authorized me to state on previous occasions that she 
          regards their brief marriage as a distateful episode in her 
          life that she prefers to forget.  With assurances of the highest 
          esteem - Leland hands the paper back to Thompson.

                                    LELAND
                        Brief marriage!  Ten years!
                               (sighs)

                                    THOMPSON
                        Was he in love?

                                    LELAND
                        He married for love -
                               (a little laugh)
                        That's why he did everything.  
                        That's why he went into politics.  
                        It seems we weren't enough.  He 
                        wanted all the voters to love him, 
                        too.  All he really wanted out of 
                        life was love.  That's Charlie's 
                        story - it's the story of how he 
                        lost it.  You see, he just didn't 
                        have any to give.  He loved Charlie 
                        Kane, of course, very dearly - and 
                        his mother, I guess he always loved 
                        her.  As for Emily - well, all I 
                        can tell you is Emily's story as 
                        she told it to me, which probably 
                        isn't fair - there's supposed to 
                        be two sides to every story - and 
                        I guess there are.  I guess there's
                        more than two sides -

          DISSOLVE IN:

          INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DAY -

          This scene is shot so as never to show the President - or at 
          least never his face.  There is present the President's 
          Secretary, sitting on one side of the desk, intently taking 
          notes.  Kane is on his feet, in front of the desk, tense and 
          glaring.

                                    THE PRESIDENT
                        It is the unanimous opinion of my 
                        Cabinent - in which I concur - 
                        that the proposed leases are in 
                        the best interests of the 
                        Governement and the people.
                               (pauses)
                        You are not, I hope, suggesting 
                        that these interests are not 
                        indentical?

                                    KANE
                        I'm not suggesting anything, Mr.
                        President!  I've come here to tell 
                        you that, unless some action is 
                        taken promptly - and you are the 
                        only one who can take it - the oil 
                        that is the property of the people 
                        of this country will be turned 
                        over for a song to a gang of high-
                        pressure crooks!

                                    THE PRESIDENT
                               (calmly)
                        I must refuse to allow you to 
                        continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                               (screaming)
                        It's the only vein I know.  I tell 
                        the facts the way I see them.  And
                        any man that knows that facts -

                                    THE PRESIDENT
                        I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I 
                        happen to have the incredible 
                        insolence to differ with you as to 
                        what they mean.
                               (pause)
                        You're a man of great talents, Mr. 
                        Kane.

                                    KANE
                        Thanks.

                                    THE PRESIDENT
                        I understand that you have political 
                        ambitions.  Unfortunately, you 
                        seem incapable of allowing any 
                        other opinion but your own -

                                    KANE
                               (building to a frenzy)
                        I'm much obliged, Mr. President, 
                        for your concern about me.  However, 
                        I happen to be concerned at this 
                        moment with the matter of extensive 
                        oil lands belonging to the people 
                        of the United States, and I say 
                        that if this lease goes through, 
                        the property of the people of the 
                        United States goes into the hands 
                        of -

                                    THE PRESIDENT
                               (interrupting)
                        You've made your point perfectly 
                        clear, Mr. Kane.  Good day.

          The Secretary rises.  Kane, with every bit of will power 
          remotely at his disposal to control what might become an 
          hysterical outburst, manages to bow.

                                    KANE
                        Mr. President.

          He starts out of the office.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. COMPOSING ROOM - ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          Kane, Reilly, Leland and a composing room Foreman, in working 
          clothes, bending over a table with several forms of type.  
          They are looking, at this moment, at a made-up headline - but 
          Kane's back is in the way ... so we can't read it.

                                    FOREMAN
                        How about it, Mr. Kane?

          Reilly glances at his wrist watch and makes a face.  Kane smiles 
          as he notices this.

                                    KANE
                        All right.  Let her slide!

          He turns away, and we can now read the headline.

          Insert of the headline, which reads: "OIL THEFT BECOMES LAW AS 
          PRESIDENT WITHOLDS VETO"

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Here follows a quick montage (presently to be worked out) of 
          no more than four or five images in which the President, by 
          means of cartoons, editorials, headlines (all faithfully 
          reproduced from period yellow journalism) is violently attacked.  
          The montage ends on the word TREASON.  The music cuts.

          A hand reaches in a side pocket which contains a newspaper - 
          recognizably the "Enquirer."  The hand removes a gun.  The gun 
          is shot.  Many arms seize the hand which is pulled up - gun 
          still firing.  As the arm is raised in the air, we see that 
          the other arms holding the arm and struggling with it are 
          uniformed, and we see the White House beyond.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          shows a crowd forming, looking angrily up toward the camera.  
          Crowd noises on the soundtrack under music.

          A hand snatches the ticker tape away and as the image of the

          The ticker tape is in Reilly's hand.  Reilly has a phone to 
          his ear.

                                    REILLY
                        Looks bad for us, Mr. Kane.  How 
                        shall we handle it?

          Headline under "Enquirer" masthead which reads: 

          "PRESIDENT ASSASSINATED"

          Newsboy is crying the headline at the same time.  We pull back

          INT. THEATRE - NIGHT

          The camera is in tight on a box which contains Emily and 
          distinguished elderly ladies and gentlemen, obviously family 
          and friends.  On the soundtrack, very limpid opera music.  
          Another elderly gent, in white tie but still wearing an 
          overcoat, comes into the box and whispers to Emily.  He has a 
          copy of the "Enquirer" in his hand.  Emily rises.  He shows 
          the paper to her.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          EXT. STREET OUTSIDE ENQUIRER BUILDING - NIGHT -

          An angry crowd seen from the window of Kane's office.  They 
          make a deep threatening sound which is audible during the 
          following scene.  Across the heads of the crowd are two great 
          squares of light from the windows above them.  One of these 
          disappears as the blind is pulled.  As the dissolve completes 
          itself, the second square of light commences to reduce in size, 
          and then the entire street is cut off by a blind which Leland 
          pulls down, covering the entire frame.

          INT. KANE'S OFFICE - ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          The staff standing around, worried to death, in their 
          shirtsleeves.

                        great man was assassinated.  He 
                        was the President of the United

                                    KANE
                        Yes?

                                    LELAND
                        Do you think you're the one who 
                        should call him a great man?

                                    KANE
                        Why not?

                                    LELAND
                        Why not?  Well - nobody's a great 
                        man in your estimation until he's 
                        dead.

                               (quickly)
                        Maybe we'd better wait for more 
                        word on the President's condition.

                               Leland)
                        What do you mean by that?

                                    LELAND
                               (quietly)
                        Competition.

                                    REILLY
                        He may recover -

                               (still holding on 
                               Leland)
                        What do you mean by that?

                                    LELAND
                               (steadily)
                        Yesterday morning you called the 
                        President a traitor.  What do you 
                        think that crowd is doing down 
                        there?  They think you murdered 
                        him.

                                    KANE
                        Because the crackpot who did it 
                        had a copy of the "Enquirer" in 
                        his pocket?

                                    LELAND
                        - and that copy of the "Enquirer" 
                        said the President should be killed.

                                    KANE
                        I said treason was a capital offense
                        punishable by death -

                                    LELAND
                        You've said a lot of things about 
                        the President in the last few 
                        months.

                                    KANE
                        They're true!  Everything I said!
                        Witholding that veto was treason!

                                    LELAND
                               (interrupting)
                        Charlie!

                                    KANE
                               (riding over him)
                        Oil belonging to the people of the 
                        United States was leased out for a 
                        song to a gang of high-pressure
                        crooks -  Nobody can blame me 
                        because -

                                    LELAND
                        Look out that window.

          Kane stops - looks at him.

                                    LELAND
                        There are the people of the United
                        States, and they are blaming you -
                        Oh, I know it doesn't make any 
                        sense, but at least you can learn 
                        a lesson from it.

                                    KANE
                               (snarling)
                        What lesson?  Not to expose fraud 
                        when I see it?  Not to fight for 
                        the right of the people to own 
                        their own property?
                               (he turns to Reilly)
                        Run it the way I said, Reilly - 
                        "This afternoon a great man was 
                        assassinated -"

                                    LELAND
                        Charlie!  Now you're not making 
                        sense.

                                    KANE
                               (sharply)
                        I don't have to.  I run a newspaper 
                        with half a million readers and 
                        they're getting a martyred president 
                        this morning with their breakfast.
                        I can't help that.  Besides, they 
                        all know I'm married to his niece.  
                        I've got to think of her.

                                    LELAND
                        What?

                                    KANE
                        I've got to think of Emily -

                                    LELAND
                               (after a silence)
                        I'd like to talk to you about that.

                                    KANE
                        Go ahead.

          Leland looks back at Kane, is conscious of the boys standing 
          around.

                                    LELAND
                        Finish your editorial.

          Leland walks out in to the City Room.  More staff members in 
          shirt sleeves in a state of panic.  Leland goes to his desk, 
          takes out a bottle, pours himself a very stiff drink.  A door 
          opens.  A Policeman enters with Bernstein.  Bernstein is badly 
          battered.  The boys crowd around.

                                    LELAND
                               (worried)
                        What's happened?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (smiling)
                        I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only 
                        there was some fellows out front 
                        that thought they ought to take 
                        things up with me.  I learned 'em!
                        Didn't I, officer?

                                    THE COP
                               (grinning)
                        You sure did -  Say, the 
                        Commissioner said I was to stand 
                        by and protect Mr. Kane until 
                        further orders, no matter how he 
                        felt about it.  Where is he?

                                    LELAND
                               (finishing his drink)
                        In there.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        If you hadn't come along and 
                        protected me when you did, I'd 
                        have killed them fellows.

                                    LELAND
                               (pouring himself 
                               another drink)
                        Go and get yourself washed up, Mr.
                        Bernstein.
                               (he looks his face 
                               over thoroughly)
                        There doesn't seem to be an serious 
                        injury.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Not to me.  But you will let that 
                        cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't 
                        you?

                                    LELAND
                        Yes, Mr. Bernstein.

          Bernstein leaves the picture with sympathetic attendance.  
          Leland finishes his second drink.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. KANE'S OFFICE - NIGHT -

          The bottle is finished.  The door in the Sanctrum opens.  Reilly 
          and the others leave.

                                    REILLY
                               (as they go)
                        Goodnight, Mr. Kane.

          Kane stands in the door, waiting for Leland.  Leland gets up 
          and moves toward the office - goes in, sits down across from 
          Kane at the desk.  An uncomfortable pause.  Then Kane smiles 
          ingratiatingly.  Leland tries to cope with this.

                                    LELAND
                        First of all -
                               (he can't go on)

                                    KANE
                               (not cruelly - 
                               genuinely kind)
                        What's wrong, Brad?

                                    LELAND
                        I'm drunk.

                                    KANE
                        I'll get you some coffee.

          He rises and goes to the door.

                                    LELAND
                        First of all, I will not write a 
                        good review of a play because 
                        somebody paid a thousand dollars 
                        for an advertisement in the 
                        "Enquirer."

                                    KANE
                               (gently - opening 
                               the door)
                        That's just a little promotion 
                        scheme.  Nobody expects you -
                               (calling)
                        Mike, will you try and get Mr. 
                        Leland some coffee?

                                    MIKE'S VOICE
                        Sure thing, Mr. Kane.

          Kane turns back to Leland.  Leland doesn't look up at him.

                                    LELAND
                        Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't 
                        agree anymore.  I wish you'd let 
                        me go to Chicago.

                                    KANE
                        Why, Brad?

                                    LELAND
                        I want to be transferred to the 
                        new paper.  You've been saying 
                        yourself you wish you had somebody 
                        to -
                               (he is heartsick, 
                               inarticulate)
                        That's not what I wanted to talk 
                        about.

          Kane goes around behind the desk and sits down.

                                    KANE
                        I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad -
                        I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll 
                        help.

                                    LELAND
                        No, that won't help.  Besides, you 
                        never get drunk.  I wanted to talk 
                        about you and Emily.

          Kane looks at Leland sharply before he speaks.

                                    KANE
                               (quietly)
                        All right.

                                    LELAND
                               (without looking at 
                               him)
                        She's going to leave you -

                                    KANE
                        I don't think so, Brad.  We've 
                        just had word that the President 
                        is out of danger.
                               (ruefully)
                        It seems I didn't kill him after 
                        all.

                                    LELAND
                               (takes his eye)
                        She was going to leave you anyway -

          Kane takes this in.

                                    LELAND
                        Emily's going south next week with 
                        the child.  As far as anybody's to 
                        know, it's a holiday.  When they 
                        get back -

                                    KANE
                               (sharply)
                        Brad, you are drunk.

                                    LELAND
                        Sure I am.  She wants full custody 
                        of the child no matter what happens.
                        If you won't agree to that, she'll 
                        apply for a divorce regardless of 
                        the President's wishes.  I can't 
                        tell her she's wrong, because she 
                        isn't wrong -

                                    KANE
                        Why is she leaving me?

                                    LELAND
                               (it's very hard for 
                               him to say all 
                               this)
                        She hasn't any friends left sine 
                        you started this oil business, and 
                        she never sees you.

                                    KANE
                        Do you think the "Enquirer" 
                        shouldn't have campaigned against 
                        the oil leases?

                                    LELAND
                               (hesitating)
                        You might have made the whole thing 
                        less personal!

          No answer from Kane.

                                    LELAND
                        It isn't just that the President 
                        was her uncle - everyone she knows, 
                        all the people she's been brought 
                        up with, everything she's ever 
                        been taught to believe is important -

          Still no answer from Kane.

                                    LELAND
                        There's no reason why this - this
                        savage personal note -

                                    KANE
                        The personal note is all there is 
                        to it.  It's all there ever is to 
                        it.  It's all there every is to 
                        anything!  Stupidity in our 
                        government, complacency and self-
                        satisfaction and unwillingness to 
                        believe that anything done by a 
                        certain class of people can be 
                        wrong - you can't fight those things 
                        impersonally.  They're not 
                        impersonal crimes against people.  
                        They're being done by actual persons - 
                        with actual names and positions 
                        and - the right of the American 
                        people to own their own country is 
                        not an academic issue, Brad, that 
                        you debate - and then the judges 
                        retire to return a verdict and the 
                        winners give a dinner for the 
                        losers.

                                    LELAND
                        You almost convince me.
                               (rising)
                        I'm just drunk enough to tell you 
                        the truth.  I have to be a little 
                        drunk for that because I'm a coward.  
                        You know that.  That's why you 
                        keep me around.
                               (smiles)
                        You only associate with your 
                        inferiors, Charlie.  I guess that's 
                        why you ran away from Emily.  
                        Because you can't stand the company 
                        of your equals.  You don't like to 
                        admit they exist - the other big 
                        people in your world are dead.
                        I told you that.

          Kane looks at Leland, but Leland can't be stopped now.  He 
          speaks very quietly - no poison in his voice - no personal 
          indignation - as though he were explaining the nature of a 
          disease.

                                    LELAND
                        You talk about the people of the 
                        United States as though they 
                        belonged to you.  When you find 
                        out they don't think they are, 
                        you'll lose interest.  You talk 
                        about giving them their rights as 
                        though you could make a present of 
                        liberty.  Remember the working 
                        man?  You used to defend him quite 
                        a good deal.  Well, he's turning 
                        into something called organized 
                        labor and you don't like that at 
                        all.  And listen, when your precious 
                        underprivileged really get together - 
                        that's going to add up to something 
                        bigger than - than your privilege 
                        and then I don't know what you'll 
                        do - sail away to a desert island, 
                        probably, and lord it over the 
                        monkeys.

                        You're not going to like it in 
                        Chicago.  They wind comes howling 
                        in from the lake.  And there's
                        practically no opera season at all -
                        and the Lord only knows whether
                        they've ever heard of Lobster

                        That's all right.

                               out of his duty)
                        What are you going to do about

                               a little)
                        Nothing - if she dosen't love me -

          Leland has risen.  He speaks as he turns away, starting towards 
          the door.

                                    LELAND
                        You want love on your own terms,

                               (he stops - his 
                               back turned to 
                               Kane)
                        Love according to your own rules.
                        And if anything goes wrong and 
                        you're hurt - then the game stops, 
                        and you've got to be soothed and 
                        nursed, no matter what else is 
                        happening - and no matter who else 
                        is hurt!

                        It's simpler than that, Brad.  A 
                        society girl can't stand the gaff, 
                        that's all.  Other things are 
                        important to her - social position, 
                        what they're saying on the front 
                        porches at Southampton, is it going 
                        to be embarrassing to meet somebody
                        or the other at dinner -

          Leland has turned, taking his eye again.  Now Kane stops and 
          smiles.

                        She can leave me.  As a matter of

                        worry, Brad - I'll live.

                        awful lot tonight - let's have 
                        another brandy.

          Leland shakes his head.  Kane lifts his glass.

                                    KANE
                        To love on my terms.  Those are

          EXT. ENQUIRER BUILDING - NIGHT -

          Kane, Leland, and a couple of policemen make their way out of 
          the front toward a hansom cab.

                                    A VOICE FROM THE CROWD
                        You moiderer!

          A rock is thrown.  It hits Leland on the face.  A little blood 
          flows.  Kane doesn't see it at first.  Then when he's in the 
          hansom cab, he turns and notices it.

                                    KANE
                        Are you hurt?

          Leland has a handkerchief to his face.

                                    LELAND
                        No.  I wish you'd go home to Emily.
                        She'll be pretty upset by all this -
                        She still loves you -

          The crowd, pushed by the cops, retreats in the background, but 
          still hard by.

                        get what he's worth.

          INT. KANE'S NEW YORK HOME - KANE'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING -

          Emily is in bed, a damp cloth over her temples.  Kane is 
          standing at the foot of the bed.  The baby's bed is in a corner 
          of the room.  The baby's nurse is standing near the crib, a 
          nurse for Emily is near her.  Kane is looking fixedly on Emily, 
          who is staring tiredly at the ceiling.

                                    KANE
                               (to the nurse)
                        Excuse us a moment, please.

          The nurse looks at Emily.

                                    KANE
                               (peremptorily)
                        I said, excuse us a moment.

          The nurse, unwilling, leaves.

                                    KANE
                        I've been talking to Leland.  Emily -
                        You can't leave me now - not now -

          Silence.

                                    KANE
                        It isn't what it would do to my 
                        changes in politics, Emily -  That 
                        isn't it -  They were talking of 
                        running me for governor, but now,
                        of course, we'll have to wait -
                        It isn't that, Emily -  It's just -
                        the president is your uncle and 
                        they're saying I killed him.

          Still silence.

                                    KANE
                        That story about the murderer having 
                        a copy of the "Enquirer" in his 
                        pocket - the "Chronicle" made that 
                        up out of whole cloth -  Emily, 
                        please - He's going to be all right, 
                        you know, he's going to recover -
                               (bitterly)
                        If it will make you any happier, 
                        we had nine pages of advertising 
                        cancelled in the first mail this 
                        morning.  Bernstein is afraid to 
                        open any more letters.  He -

          He stops.  He sees that he's getting no place with Emily.

                                    KANE
                               (exasperated)
                        What do you expect me to do?  What
                        in the world -

                                    EMILY
                               (weakly)
                        Charles.

          He waits for her to continue.

                                    EMILY
                        Do you really think -
                               (she can't continue)
                        Those threatening letters, can
                        they really -

          She sits up and looks at the crib.  She almost continues to 
          look at the crib, with almost unseeing eyes.

                               (uncomfortably)
                        They won't do anything to Junior, 
                        darling.

                        Anonymous letter writers -   I've 
                        got guards in front of the house,
                        and I'm going to arrange -

                               (turning her face 
                               toward him)
                        Please don't talk any more, Charles.

          Kane is about to say something, but bites his lips instead.  
          Emily keeps staring at him.

                                    EMILY
                        Have they heard from father yet?
                        Has he seen -

                                    KANE
                        I've tried to tell you, Emily.
                        The President's going to be all 
                        right.  He had a comfortable night.
                        There's no danger of any kind.

          Emily nods several times.  There is an uncomforable silence.  
          Suddenly there is a cry from the crib.  Emily leaps from the 
          bed and rushes to him.  She bends over the crib.

                                    EMILY
                               (murmuring)
                        Here I am, darling...  Darling!...  
                        Darling, it's all right...  Mother's 
                        here.

                                    KANE
                        Emily - you musn't leave me now -
                        you can't do that to me.

                                    EMILY
                        They won't hurt you, darling.
                        Mother's with you!  Mother's looking 
                        after you!

          Kane, unwanted, ignored, looks on.  Tightening his lips, he 
          walks out.

          INT. KANE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

          By the desk light, Kane is seen working with his usual 
          intensity,  Reilly standing beside him at the desk.

                                    KANE
                        We'll withdraw support completely.
                        Anything else?

                                    REILLY
                        Mr. Leland sent back that check.

                                    KANE
                        What check?

                                    REILLY
                        You made it out to him last week 
                        after he left for Chicago.

                                    KANE
                        Oh, yes, the bonus.

                                    REILLY
                        It was for twenty-five thousand 
                        dollars.

          Kane is perplexed and worried, but we can see in a moment his 
          mind will be on something else.

                                    REILLY
                        He sent it back torn up - all torn 
                        up into little bits, and he enclosed 
                        something else -  I can't make it 
                        out.

          Kane doesn't answer.  Reilly goes on.  He has brought out a 
          piece of paper and is reading it.

                                    REILLY
                        It says here, "A Declaration of
                        Principles" -
                               (he still reads)
                        "I will provide the people of this 
                        city with a daily paper that will
                        tell all the news honestly" -

          Kane has looked up sharply.  Reilly, sensing his look, stops 
          reading and meets his eye.  Slowly, Kane reaches out his hand.  
          Reilly hands him the piece of paper.  Without reading it, Kane 
          tears it up, throws it into the wastebasket at his side.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT -

          The evening of the final great rally.  These shots remind us 
          of and are identical with and supplementary to the "News Digest" 
          scenes earlier.  The vast auditorium with a huge picture of 
          Kane, cheering crowds, etc.  Emily and Junior are to be seen 
          in the front of a box.  Emily is tired and wears a forced smile 
          on her face.  Junior, now aged nine and a half, is eager, bright-
          eyed and excited.  Kane is just finishing his speech.

                        It is no secret that I entered 
                        upon this campaign with no thought 
                        that I could be elected Governor 
                        of this state!  It is now no secret 
                        that every straw vote, every 
                        independent pole, shows that I 
                        will be elected.  And I repeat to 
                        you - my first official act as 
                        Governor will be to appoint a 
                        special District Attorney to arrange 
                        for the indictment, prosecution 
                        and conviction of Boss Edward G. 
                        Rogers!

          Terrific screaming and cheering from the audience.

          The Speaker's Platform.  Numerous officials and civic leaders 
          are crowding around Kane.  Cameramen take flash photographs 
          with old-fashioined flash powder.

                        Great speech, Mr. Kane.

                                    SECOND LEADER
                               (pompous)
                        One of the most notable public 
                        utterances ever made by a candidate
                        in this state -

                                    KANE
                        Thank you, gentlemen.  Thank you.

          He looks up and notices that the box in which Emily and the 
          boy were sitting is now empty.  He starts toward the rear of 
          the platform, through the press of people, Reilly approaches 
          him.

                                    REILLY
                        A wonderful speech, Mr. Kane.

          Kane pats him on the shoulder as he walks along.

                                    REILLY
                        I just got word from Buffalo, Mr.
                        Kane.  They're going to throw you 
                        the organization vote - and take a 
                        chance maybe you'll give them a
                        break -

          This is said almost inquiringly, as if he were hoping that 
          Kane would give him some assurance that McDonald is not making 
          a mistake.  There is no answer from Kane.

                                    REILLY
                        On an independent ticket there's 
                        never been anything like it!  If 
                        the election were held today, you'd 
                        be elected by a hundred thousand 
                        votes - and every day between now 
                        and November 7th is just going to 
                        add to your majority.

          Kane is very pleased.  He continues with Reilly slowly through 
          the crowd - a band playing off.  Bernstein joins him.

                                    KANE
                        It does seem too good to be true, 
                        doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?

                                    REILLY
                        Rogers isn't even pretending.  He 
                        isn't just scared anymore.  He's 
                        sick.  Frank Norris told me last 
                        night he hasn't known Rogers to be 
                        that worried in twenty-five years.

                        I think it's beginning to dawn on 
                        Mr. Rogers that I mean what I say.
                        With Mr. Rogers out of the way, 
                        Reilly, I think we may really begin 
                        to hope for a good government in 
                        this state.
                               (stopping)
                        Well, Mr. Bernstein?

                               it)
                        It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  
                        Wonderful.  Wonderful.

                                    KANE
                        You don't really think so?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're 
                        running for Governor - and you 
                        want to be elected -  I think it's 
                        wonderful you're going to be 
                        elected.  Only -
                               (interrupts himself)
                        -  Can I say something?

                                    KANE
                        Please, Mr. Bernstein.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Well, the way I look at it -
                               (comes out with it)
                        -  You want to know what I really 
                        think would be wonderful?

          Kane indicates he is to proceed.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Well, you're running for Governor 
                        and going to be elected - my idea 
                        is how wonderful it would be if 
                        you don't run at all and don't get 
                        elected.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          EXT. ONE OF THE EXITS - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT -

          Emily and Junior are standing, waiting for Kane.

                                    JUNIOR
                        Is Pop Governor yet, Mom?

          Just then, Kane appears, with Reilly and several other men.  
          Kane rushes toward Emily and Junior, as the men politely greet 
          Emily.

                                    KANE
                        Hello, Butch!  Did you like your 
                        old man's speech?

                                    JUNIOR
                        Hello, Pop!  I was in a box.  I 
                        could hear every word.

                                    KANE
                        I saw you!
                               (he has his arm 
                               around Junior's 
                               shoulder)
                        Good night, gentlemen.

          There are good nights.  Kane's car is at the curb and he starts 
          to walk toward it with Junior and Emily.

                                    EMILY
                        I'm sending Junior home in the
                        car, Charles - with Oliver -

                                    KANE
                        But I'd arranged to go home with 
                        you myself.

                                    EMILY
                        There's a call I want you to make 
                        with me, Charles.

                                    KANE
                        It can wait.

                                    EMILY
                        No, it can't.
                               (she bends down and 
                               kisses Junior)
                        Good night, darling.

                                    JUNIOR
                        Good night, Mom.

          The driver is holding the rear door open as Emily guides Junior 
          in.

                                    KANE
                               (as car starts to 
                               drive off)
                        What's this all about, Emily?  
                        I've had a very tiring day and -

                                    EMILY
                        It may not be about anything at 
                        all.

          A cab has pulled up.

                                    THE DRIVER
                        Cab?

          Emily nods to him.

                                    EMILY
                        I intend to find out.

                                    KANE
                        I insist on being told exactly 
                        what you have in mind.

                                    EMILY
                        I'm going to -
                               (she looks at a 
                               slip of paper in 
                               her hand)
                        - 185 West 74th Street.

          Kane's reaction indicates that the address definitely means 
          something to him.

                                    EMILY
                        If you wish, you can come with 
                        me...

          Kane nods.

                                    KANE
                        I'll go with you.

          He opens the door and she enters the cab.  He follows her.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CAB - NIGHT -

          Kane and Emily.  He looks at her, in search of some kind of 
          enlightenment.  Her face is set and impassive.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          EXT. AND INT. APARTMENT HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT -

          Kane and Emily, in front of an apartment door.  Emily is 
          pressing the bell.

                                    KANE
                        I had no idea you had this flair 
                        for melodrama, Emiliy.

          Emily does not answer.  The door is opened by a maid, who 
          recognizes Kane.

                                    THE MAID
                        Come in, Mr. Kane, come in.

          They enter, Emily first.

          INT. SUSAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT -

          There is first a tiny reception room, through which an open 
          door shows the living room.  Kane and Emily enter from the 
          hallway and cross to the living room.  As they enter, Susan 
          rises from a chair.  The other person  in the room - a big, 
          heavyset man, a little past middle age - stays where he is, 
          leaning back in his chair, regarding Kane intently.

                                    SUSAN
                        It wasn't my fault, Charlie.  He 
                        made me send your wife a note.
                        He said I'd - oh, he's been saying 
                        the most terrible things, I didn't
                        know what to do...  I -
                               (she catches sight 
                               of Emily)

                                    ROGERS
                        Good evening, Mr. Kane.
                               (he rises)
                        I don't suppose anybody would 
                        introduce us.  Mrs. Kane, I am 
                        Edward Rogers.

                                    EMILY
                        How do you do?
                               (pauses)
                        I came here - and I made Mr. Kane 
                        come with me...
                               (she consults the 
                               note in her hand 
                               without reading it 
                               again)
                        because I recieved this note -

                                    ROGERS
                        I made Miss - Miss Alexander send 
                        you the note.  She was a little
                        unwilling at first -
                               (he smiles grimly)
                        but she did it.

                                    SUSAN
                        I can't tell you the things he 
                        said, Charlie.  You haven't got
                        any idea -

                                    KANE
                               (turning on Rogers)
                        Rogers, I don't think I will 
                        postpone doing something about you 
                        until I'm elected.
                               (he starts toward 
                               him)
                        To start with, I'll break your 
                        neck.

                                    ROGERS
                               (not giving way an 
                               inch)
                        Maybe you can do it and maybe you 
                        can't, Mr. Kane.

                                    EMILY
                        Charles!
                               (he stops to look 
                               at her)
                        Your - your breaking this man's
                        neck -
                               (she is clearly 
                               disgusted)
                        would scarcely explain this note -
                               (glancing at the 
                               note)
                        Serious consequences for Mr. Kane -
                               (slowly)
                        for myself, and for my son.  What
                        does this note mean, Miss -

                                    SUSAN
                               (stiffly)
                        I'm Susan Alexander.
                               (pauses)
                        I know what you think, Mrs. Kane,
                        but -

                                    EMILY
                               (ignoring this)
                        What does this note mean, Miss 
                        Alexander?

                                    ROGERS
                        She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane.  She 
                        just sent it - because I made her 
                        see it wouldn't be smart for her 
                        not to send it.

                                    KANE
                        In case you don't know, Emily,
                        this - this gentleman -
                               (he puts a world of 
                               scorn into the 
                               word)
                        is -

                                    ROGERS
                        I'm not a gentleman, Mrs. Kane, 
                        and your husband is just trying to 
                        be funny calling me one.  I don't 
                        even know what a gentleman is.
                               (tensely, with all 
                               the hatred and 
                               venom in the world)
                        You see, my idea of a gentleman, 
                        Mrs.  Kane - well, if I owned a 
                        newspaper and if I didn't like the 
                        way somebody else was doing things - 
                        some politican, say - I'd fight 
                        them with everything I had.  Only 
                        I wouldn't show him in a convict 
                        suit, with stripes - so his children 
                        could see the picture in the paper.  
                        Or his mother.
                               (he has to control 
                               himself from hurling 
                               himself at Kane)
                        It's pretty clear - I'm not a 
                        gentleman.

                                    EMILY
                        Oh!!

                                    KANE
                        You're a cheap, crooked grafter -
                        and your concern for your children
                        and your mother -

                                    ROGERS
                        Anything you say, Mr. Kane.  Only 
                        we're talking now about what you 
                        are.  That's what the note is about, 
                        Mrs. Kane.  Now I'm going to lay 
                        all my cards on the table.  I'm 
                        fighting for my life.  Not just my 
                        political life.  My life.  If your
                        husband is elected governor -

                                    KANE
                        I'm going to be elected governor.
                        And the first thing I'm going to
                        do -

                                    EMILY
                        Let him finish, Charles.

                                    ROGERS
                        I'm protecting myself every way I 
                        know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last 
                        week, I finally found out how I 
                        can stop your husband from being 
                        elected.  If the people of this 
                        state learn what I found out this 
                        week, he wouldn't have a chance to - 
                        he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  
                        Well, what I'm interested in is 
                        seeing that he's not elected.  I 
                        don't care whether they know what 
                        I know about him.  Let him keep 
                        right on being the Great, Noble, 
                        Moral -
                               (he stresses the 
                               world)
                        Champeen of the people.  Just as 
                        long as -

                                    EMILY
                        I think I understand, Mr. Rogers, 
                        but wonder if -
                               (she leaves her 
                               sentence unfinished)

                                    KANE
                        You can't blackmail me, Rogers, 
                        you can't -

                                    SUSAN
                               (excitedly)
                        Charlie, he said, unless you 
                        withdrew your name -

                                    ROGERS
                        That's the chance I'm willing to 
                        give you, Mr. Kane.  More of a 
                        chance than you'd give me.  Unless 
                        you make up your mind by tomorrow 
                        that you're so sick that you've 
                        got to go away for a year or two -
                        Monday morning every paper in this 
                        State will carry the story I'm 
                        going to give them.

          Kane starts to stare at him intently.

                                    EMILY
                        What story, Mr. Rogers?

                                    ROGERS
                        The story about him and Miss 
                        Alexander, Mrs. Kane.

          Emily looks at Kane.

                                    SUSAN
                        There is no story.  It's all lies.
                        Mr. Kane is just -

                                    ROGERS
                               (to Susan)
                        Shut up!
                               (to Kane)
                        I've had a dozen men doing nothing 
                        but run this thing down - we've 
                        got evidence enough to - well, the 
                        evidence would stand up in any 
                        court of law.  You want me to give 
                        you the evidence, Mr. Kane?

                                    KANE
                        You do anything you want to do.
                        The people of this state can decide 
                        which one of us to trust.  If you 
                        want to know, they've already 
                        decided.  The election Tuesday'll 
                        be only -

                                    ROGERS
                        Mrs. Kane, I'm not asking you to
                        believe me.  I'd like to show you -

                                    EMILY
                        You don't have to show me anything, 
                        Mr. Rogers.  I believe you.

                                    ROGERS
                        I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without 
                        having to get the story published.
                        Not that I care about him.  But 
                        I'd be better off that way -
                               (he pauses)
                        - and so would you, Mrs. Kane.

                                    SUSAN
                        What about me?
                               (to Kane)
                        He said my name'd be dragged through 
                        the mud.  He said everywhere I'd 
                        go from now on -

                                    EMILY
                        There seems to be only one decision 
                        you can make, Charles.  I'd say 
                        that it has been made for you.
                               (pauses)
                        I suppose the details can be 
                        arranged tomorrow, Mr. Rogers.  
                        About the statements by the doctors -

                                    KANE
                        Have you gone completely mad, Emily?

          Emily looks at him.

                                    KANE
                        You don't think I'm going to let 
                        this blackmailer intimidate me, do 
                        you?

                                    EMILY
                        I don't see what else you can do, 
                        Charles.  If he's right - and the
                        papers publish this story he has -

                                    KANE
                        Oh, they'll publish it all right.
                        But that's not going to stop me -

                                    EMILY
                        Charles, this - this story - doesn't 
                        concern only you.  I'll be in it, 
                        too, won't I?
                               (quickly)
                        And Junior?

                                    KANE
                               (squirming a bit)
                        I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid 
                        of the story.  You can't tell me
                        that the voters of this state -

                                    EMILY
                        I'm not interested in the voters 
                        of this state right now.  I am 
                        interested in - well, Junior, for 
                        one thing.

                                    SUSAN
                        Charlie!  If they publish this
                        story -

                                    EMILY
                        They won't.  Goodnight, Mr. Rogers.
                               (she starts out)
                        There's nothing more to be said, 
                        Charles.

                                    KANE
                        Oh yes, there is.

                                    EMILY
                        I don't think so.  Are you coming, 
                        Charles?

                                    KANE
                        No.

          She looks at him.  He starts to work himself into a rage.

                                    KANE
                        There's only one person in the 
                        world to decide what I'm going to 
                        do - and that's me.  And if
                        you think - if any of you think -

                                    EMILY
                        You decided what you were going to 
                        do, Charles - some time ago.
                               (she looks at Susan)
                        You can't always have it your own 
                        way, regardless of anything else 
                        that may have happened.
                               (she sighs)
                        Come on, Charles.

                                    KANE
                        Go on!  Get out!  I can fight this 
                        thing all alone!

                                    ROGERS
                        You're making a bigger fool of 
                        yourself than I thought you would, 
                        Mr. Kane.  You're licked.  Why 
                        don't you -

                                    KANE
                               (turning on him)
                        Get out!  I've got nothing to talk 
                        to you about.  If you want to see 
                        me, have the Warden write me a 
                        letter.

                                    ROGERS
                        I see!
                               (he starts toward 
                               the door)

                                    SUSAN
                               (starting to cry)
                        Charlie, you're just excited.  You
                        don't realize -

                                    KANE
                        I know exactly what I'm doing.
                               (he is screaming)
                        Get out!

                                    EMILY
                               (quietly)
                        Charles, if you don't listen to
                        reason, it may be too late -

                                    KANE
                        Too late for what?  Too late for
                        you and this -
                               (he can't find the 
                               adjective)
                        this public thief to take the love 
                        of the people of this state away 
                        from me?  Well, you won't do it, I 
                        tell you.  You won't do it!

                                    SUSAN
                        Charlie, there are other things to 
                        think of.
                               (a sly look comes 
                               into her eyes)
                        Your son - you don't want him to
                        read in the papers -

                                    EMILY
                        It is too late now, Charles.

                                    KANE
                               (rushes to the door 
                               and opens it)
                        Get out, both of you!

                                    SUSAN
                               (rushes to him)
                        Charlie, please don't -

                                    KANE
                        What are you waiting here for?
                        Why don't you go?

                                    EMILY
                        Goodnight, Charles.

          She walks out.  Rogers stops as he gets directly in front of 
          Kane.

                                    ROGERS
                        You're the greatest fool I've ever 
                        known, Kane.  If it was anybody 
                        else, I'd say what's going to happen 
                        to you would be a lesson to you.  
                        Only you're going to need more 
                        than one lesson.  And you're going 
                        to get more than one lesson.
                               (he walks past Kane)

                                    KANE
                        Don't you worry about me.  I'm 
                        Charles Foster Kane.  I'm no cheap, 
                        crooked politician, trying to save 
                        himself from the consequences of
                        his crimes -

          INT. APARTMENT HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT -

          Camera angling toward Kane from other end of the hall.  Rogers 
          and Emily are already down the hall, moving toward foreground.  
          Kane in apartment doorway background.

                                    KANE
                               (screams louder)
                        I'm going to send you to Sing Sing, 
                        Rogers.  Sing Sing!

          Kane is trembling with rage as he shakes his fist at Rogers's 
          back.  Susan, quieter now, has snuggled into the hollow of his 
          shoulder as they stand in the doorway.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT -

          Emily is opening the door for Leland.

                                    EMILY
                        Hello, Brad -

                                    LELAND
                        Emily -

          He pauses.  Leland comes in.  Emily closes the door.

                                    EMILY
                        I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad -
                        didn't -

                                    LELAND
                        Chicago is pretty close to New
                        York nowadays - only twenty hours -

          She doesn't have anything to say.

                                    LELAND
                        I'm glad to see you.

          She smiles at him and we know that there isn't anybody else in 
          the world for her to smile at.  She's too grateful to talk.

                                    EMILY
                        Are all the returns in?

          Leland puts his hat unconsciously on his coat by the newspaper.

                                    EMILY
                        Let me see it.

          Leland takes the newspaper out of his pocket and hands it to 
          her.  She takes it.  We see the headline, not an insert, but 
          it registers.  It reads: "Fraud at Polls."  Emily is looking 
          at the paper with unseeing eyes, and a little smile.

                                    LELAND
                               (after a pause)
                        Almost two to one -

                                    EMILY
                        I'm surprised he got the votes he 
                        did.

                                    LELAND
                        Emily!

                                    EMILY
                        Why should anyone vote for him?  
                        He's made it quite clear to the 
                        people what he thinks of them.
                        Children - to be told one thing 
                        one day, something else the next, 
                        as the whim seizes him.  And they're 
                        supposed to be grateful and love 
                        and adore him - because he sees to 
                        it that they get cheap ice and 
                        only pay a nickel in the street 
                        cars.

                                    LELAND
                        Emily, you're being - a little 
                        unfair -  You know what I think of 
                        Charles' behavior - about your
                        personal lives -

                                    EMILY
                        There aren't any personal lives 
                        for people like us.  He made that
                        very clear to me nine years ago -
                        If I'd thought of my life with
                        Charles as a personal life, I'd
                        have left him then -

                                    LELAND
                        know that, Emily -

                                    EMILY
                               (on top of Leland)
                        Maybe I should have - the first 
                        time he showed me what a mad dog 
                        he really was.

                                    LELAND
                               (on the cue "dog")
                        Emily, you -

                                    EMILY
                        Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman
                        yet -

                                    LELAND
                        It's - all over -

          He stops himself.

                                    EMILY
                               (after a pause)
                        Know it is, Brad -

                                    LELAND
                        He's paying for it, Emily.  Those 
                        returns tonight - he's finished.
                        Politically -
                               (he thinks)
                        - socially, everywhere, I guess.
                        don't know about the papers, but -

                                    EMILY
                        If you're asking me to sympathize 
                        with him, Brad, you're wasting 
                        your time.
                               (pauses)
                        There's only one person I'm sorry
                        for, as a matter of fact.  That -
                        that shabby little girl.  I'm really 
                        sorry for her, Brad.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Front page Chicago "Enquirer," with photograph proclaiming 
          that Susan Alexander opens at new Chicago Opera House in 
          "Thais," as in "News Digest."

          On soundtrack during above we hear the big, expectant murmur 
          of an opening night audience and the noodling of the orchestra.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CHICAGO OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT - SET FOR "THAIS" -

          The camera is just inside the curtain, angling upstage.  We 
          see the set for "Thais" - the principals in place - stage 
          managers, stage hands, etc., and in the center of all this, in 
          an elaborate costume, looking very small and very lost, is 
          Susan.  She is almost hysterical with fright.  Maids, singing 
          teacher, and the rest are in attendance.  Her throat is sprayed.  
          Applause is heard at the opening of the shot, and now the 
          orchestra starts thunderously.  The curtain starts to rise -
          the camera with it - the blinding glare of the foots moves up 
          Susan's body and hits her face.  She squints and starts to 
          sing.  Camera continues on up with the curtain, up past Susan, 
          up the full height of the proscenium arch and then on up into 
          the gridiron into a world of ropes, brick walls and hanging 
          canvas - Susan's voice still heard - but faintly.  The camera 
          stops at the top of the gridiron as the curtain stops.  Two 
          typical stage hands fill the frame.  They are looking down on 
          the stage below.  Some of the reflected light gleams on their 
          faces.  They look at each other.  One of them puts his hand to 
          his nose.

          INT. LELAND'S OFFICE - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          Leland, as in the same scene in the Bernstein sequence, is 
          sprawled across his typewriter, his head on the keys.  The 
          paper is gone from the roller.  Leland stirs and looks up 
          drunkenly, his eyes encountering Bernstein, who stands beside 
          him (also as in the previous scene).

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Hello, Mr. Leland.

                                    LELAND
                        Hello, Bernstein.

          Leland makes a terrific effort to pull himself together.  He 
          straightens and reaches for the keys - then sees the paper is 
          gone from the machine.

                                    LELAND
                        Where is it - where's my notice?
                        I've got to finish it!

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (quietly)
                        Mr. Kane is finishing it.

                                    LELAND
                        Kane?  Charlie?
                               (painfully, he rises 
                               to his feet)
                        Where is he?

          During all this, the sound of a typewriter has been heard off - 
          a busy typewriter.  Leland's eyes follow the sound.  Slowly he 
          registers Kane in the City Room beyond.  This is almost the 
          same shot as in the previous Bernstein story.

          INT. CITY ROOM - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          Kane, in white tie and shirt sleeves, is typing away at a 
          machine, his fingers working briskly and efficiently, his face, 
          seen by the desk light before him, set in a strange half-smile.

          Leland stands in the door of his office, staring across at 
          him.

                                    LELAND
                        I suppose he's fixing it up - I 
                        know I'd never get that through.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (moving to his side)
                        Mr. Kane is finishing your piece 
                        the way you started it.

          Leland turns incredulously to Bernstein.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        He's writing a roast like you wanted
                        it to be -
                               (then suddnely - 
                               with a kind of 
                               quiet passion rather 
                               than a triumph)
                        - I guess that'll show you.

          Leland picks his way across the City Room to Kane's side.  
          Kane goes on typing, without looking up.  After a pause, Kane 
          speaks.

                                    KANE
                        Hello, Brad.

                                    LELAND
                        Hello, Charlie -

                                    (ANOTHER PAUSE)
                        I didn't know we were speaking.

          Kane stops typing, but doesn't turn.

                                    KANE
                        Sure, we're speaking, Brad -
                        you're fired.

          He starts typing again, the expression on his face doesn't 
          change.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF - DAY -

          Thompson and Leland on the roof, which is now deserted.  It is 
          getting late.  The sun has just about gone down.

                                    LELAND
                        Well, that's about all there is -
                        and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!
                               (pause)
                        Five years ago, he wrote from that
                        place of his down South -
                               (as if trying to 
                               think)
                        - you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?
                               (pauses)
                        Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of 
                        that place?  You know...  All right.  
                        Xanadu.  I knew what it was all 
                        the time.  You caught on, didn't 
                        you?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Yes.

                                    LELAND
                        I guess maybe I'm not as hard to 
                        see through as I think.  Anyway, I 
                        never even answered his letter.
                        Maybe I should have.  I guess he 
                        was pretty lonely down there those 
                        last years.  He hadn't finished it 
                        when she left him - he never 
                        finished it - he never finished 
                        anything.  Of course, he built it 
                        for her -

                                    THOMPSON
                        That must have been love.

                                    LELAND
                        I don't know.  He was disappointed 
                        in the world.  So he built one of 
                        his own -  An absolute monarchy -
                        It was something bigger than an 
                        opera house anyway -

                        Say, I'll tell you one thing you 
                        can do for me, young fellow.

                                    THOMPSON
                        Sure.

                                    LELAND
                        On your way out, stop at a cigar 
                        store, will you, and send me up a 
                        couple of cigars?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad 
                        to.

                                    LELAND
                        Hey, Nurse!

          A Nurse appears.

                                    NURSE
                        Hello, Mr. Leland.

                                    LELAND
                        I'm ready to go in now.  You know 
                        when I was a young man, there was 
                        an impression around that nurses 
                        were pretty.  It was no truer then
                        than it is now.

                                    NURSE
                        Here, let me take your arm, Mr. 
                        Leland.

                                    LELAND
                               (testily)
                        All right, all right.
                               (he has begun to 
                               move forward on 
                               the Nurse's arm; 
                               turning to Thompson)
                        You won't forget, will you, about 
                        the cigars?  And tell them to wrap 
                        them up to look like toothpaste, 
                        or something, or they'll stop them 
                        at the desk.  That young doctor I 
                        was telling you about, he's got an 
                        idea he wants to keep me alive.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          NEON SIGN ON THE ROOF:

          "EL RANCHO"

          FLOOR SHOW

          SUSAN ALEXANDER KANE

          TWICE NIGHTLY

          glows on the dark screen as in the previous sequence earlier 
          in the script.  Behind the lights and through them, we see a 
          nasty early morning.  Camera as before, moves through the lights 
          of the sign and down on the skylight, through which is seen 
          Susan at her regular table,  Thompson seated across from her.

          Very faintly during this, idle piano music playing.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. "EL RANCHO" CABARET - EARLY DAWN -

          Susan and Thompson are facing each other.  The place is almost 
          deserted.  Susan is sober.  On the other side of the room, 
          somebody is playing a piano.

                                    SUSAN
                        How do you want to handle the whole 
                        thing - ask questions?

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'd rather you just talked.  
                        Anything that comes into your mind - 
                        about yourself and Mr. Kane.

                                    SUSAN
                        You wouldn't want to hear a lot of 
                        what comes into my mind about myself 
                        and Mr. Charlie Kane.

          Susan is thinking.

                                    THOMPSON
                        How did you meet him?

                                    SUSAN
                        I had a toothache.

          Thompson looks at her.

                                    SUSAN
                        That was thiry years ago - and I 
                        still remember that toothache.
                        Boy!  That toothache was just 
                        driving me crazy...

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          EXT. CORNER DRUG STORE AND STREET ON THE WEST SIDE OF NEW YORK - 
          NIGHT -

          Susan, aged twenty, neatly but cheaply dressed in the style of 
          the period, is leaving the drug store.  It's about 8 o'clock 
          at night.  With a large, man-sized handkerchief pressed to her 
          cheek, she is in considerable pain.  The street is wet - after 
          a recent rain.

          She walks a few steps towards the middle of the block, and can 
          stand it no longer.  She stops, opens a bottle of Oil of Cloves 
          that she has in her hand, applies some to her finger, and rubs 
          her gums.

          She walks on, the pain only a bit better.  Four or five houses 
          farther along, she comes to what is clearly her own doorway - 
          a shabby, old four-story apartment house.  She turns toward 
          the doorway, which is up a tiny stoop, about three steps.

          As she does so, Kane, coming from the opposite direction, almost 
          bumps into her and turns to his left to avoid her.  His shoulder 
          bumps hers and she turns.  As she does so, Kane, forced to 
          change his course, steps on the loose end of a plank which 
          covers a puddle in the bad sidewalk.  The plank rises up and 
          cracks him on the knee, also covering him with mud.

                                    KANE
                               (hopping up and 
                               down and rubbing 
                               his knee)
                        Ow!

          Susan, taking her handkerchief from her jaw, roars with 
          laughter.

                                    KANE
                        It's not funny.

          He bites his lip and rubs his knee again.  Susan tries to 
          control her laughter, but not very successfully.  Kane glares 
          at her.

                                    SUSAN
                        I'm sorry, mister - but you do 
                        look awful funny.

          Suddenly, the pain returns and she claps her hand to her jaw.

                                    SUSAN
                        Ow!

                                    KANE
                        What's the matter with you?

                                    SUSAN
                        Toothache.

                                    KANE
                        Hmm!

          He has been rubbing his clothes with his handkerchief.

                                    SUSAN
                        You've got some on your face.

                                    KANE
                        If these sidewalks were kept in 
                        condition - instead of the money
                        going to some cheap grafter -

          Susan starts to laugh again.

                                    KANE
                        What's funny now?

                                    SUSAN
                        You are.  You look like you've 
                        been making mud pies.

          In the middle of her smile, the pain returns.

                                    SUSAN
                        Oh!

                                    KANE
                        You're no Venus de Milo.

                                    SUSAN
                               (points to the 
                               downstair window)
                        If you want to come in and wash 
                        your face -  I can get you some 
                        hot water to get that dirt off
                        your trousers -

                                    KANE
                        Thanks.

          Susan starts, with Kane following her.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. SUSAN'S ROOM - NIGHT -

          It's in moderate disorder.  The Mansbach gas lights are on.  
          It's not really a classy room, but it's exactly what you're 
          entitled to in 1910, for $5.00 a week including breakfast.

          There is a bed, a couple of chairs, a chiffonier, and a few 
          personal belongings on the chiffonier.  These include a 
          photograph of a gent and lady, obviously Susan's parents, and 
          a few objets d'art.  One, "At the Japanese Rolling Ball Game 
          at Coney Island," and - perhaps this is part of the Japanese 
          loot - the glass globe with the snow scene Kane was holding in 
          his hand in the first sequence.

          Susan comes into the room, carrying a basin, with towels over 
          her arm.  Kane is waiting for her.  She doesn't close the door.

                                    SUSAN
                               (by way of 
                               explanation)
                        My landlady prefers me to keep 
                        this door open when I have a 
                        gentleman caller.
                               (starts to put the 
                               basin down)
                        She's a very decent woman.
                               (making a face)
                        Ow!

          Kane rushes to take the basin from her, putting it on the 
          chiffonier.  To do this, he has to shove the photograph to one 
          side of the basin.  Susan grabs the photograph as it is about 
          to fall over.

                                    SUSAN
                        Hey, you should be more careful.
                        That's my ma and pa.

                                    KANE
                        I'm sorry.  They live here, too?

                                    SUSAN
                        No.  They've passed on.

          Again she puts her hand to her jaw.

                                    KANE
                        Where's the soap?

                                    SUSAN
                        In the water.

          Kane fishes the soap out of the water.  It is slippery, however, 
          and slips out of his hand, hitting him in the chest before it 
          falls to the floor.  Susan laughs as he bends over.

                                    KANE
                               (starting to wash 
                               his hands)
                        You're very easily amused.

                                    SUSAN
                        I always like to see the funny 
                        side of things.  No sense crying 
                        when you don't have to.  And you're 
                        so funny.  Looking at you, I forget 
                        all about my toothache.

          Her face distorts in pain again.

                                    SUSAN
                        Oh!

                                    KANE
                        I can't stay here all night chasing 
                        your pain away.

                                    SUSAN
                               (laughs)
                        I know...  But you do look so silly.

          Kane, with soaped hands, has rubbed his face and now cannot 
          open his eyes, for fear of getting soap in them.

                                    KANE
                        Where's the towel?

                                    SUSAN
                        On the chiffonier.  Here.

                                    KANE
                               (rubs his face dry)
                        Thanks.

                                    SUSAN
                               (on her way to closet)
                        I've got a brush in the closet.  
                        As soon as the mud on your trousers 
                        is all dry - you just brush it 
                        off.

                                    KANE
                        I'll get these streets fixed, if 
                        it's the last thing I do.

          Susan comes out of the closet.  She holds out the brush with 
          her left hand, her right hand to her jaw in real distress.

                                    KANE
                               (takes the brush)
                        You are in pain, aren't you, you 
                        poor kid?

          Susan can't stand it anymore and sits down in a chair, bent 
          over, whimpering a bit.

                                    KANE
                               (brushing himself)
                        Wish there was something I could -

          He stops and thinks.  Susan, her face averted, is still trying 
          hard not to cry.

                                    KANE
                        I've got an idea, young lady.
                               (there is no response)
                        Turn around and look at me.
                               (there is still no 
                               response)
                        I said, turn around and look at 
                        me, young lady.

          Slowly, Susan turns.

                                    KANE
                        Did you ever see anybody wiggle 
                        both his ears at the same time?

          It takes a second for Susan to adapt herself to this.

                                    KANE
                        Watch closely!
                               (he wiggles his 
                               ears)
                        It took me two solid years at the 
                        finest boys' school in the world 
                        to learn that trick.  The fellow 
                        who taught me is President of 
                        Venezuela now.

          He's still wiggling his ears as Susan starts to smile.

                                    KANE
                        That's it!  Smile!

          Susan smiles, very broadly.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. SUSAN'S ROOM - NIGHT -

          Closeup of a duck, camera pulls back showing it to be a 
          shadowgraph on the wall, made by Kane, who is now in his shirt 
          sleeves.  It is about an hour later than preceding sequence.

                                    SUSAN
                               (hesitatingly)
                        A chicken?

                                    KANE
                        No.  But you're close.

                                    SUSAN
                        A rooster?

                                    KANE
                        You're getting farther away all 
                        the time.  It's a duck.

                                    SUSAN
                        Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this 
                        takes a lot of nerve, but - who 
                        are you?  I mean - I'm pretty 
                        ignorant, guess you caught on to 
                        that -

                                    KANE
                               (looks squarely at 
                               her)
                        You really don't know who I am?

                                    SUSAN
                        No.  That is, I bet it turns out 
                        I've heard your name a million 
                        times, only you know how it is -

                                    KANE
                        But you like me, don't you?  Even 
                        though you don't know who I am?

                                    SUSAN
                        You've been wonderful!  I can't 
                        tell you how glad I am you're here, 
                        I don't know many people and -
                               (she stops)

                                    KANE
                        And I know too many people.  
                        Obviously, we're both lonely.
                               (he smiles)
                        Would you like to know where I was 
                        going tonight - when you ran into 
                        me and ruined my Sunday clothes?

                                    SUSAN
                        I didn't run into you and I bet 
                        they're not your Sunday clothes.
                        You've probably got a lot of 
                        clothes.

                                    KANE
                               (as if defending 
                               himself from a 
                               terrible onslaught)
                        I was only joking!
                               (pauses)
                        This evening I was on my way to
                        the Western Manhattan Warehouses -
                        in search of my youth.

          Susan is bewildered.

                                    KANE
                        You see, my mother died, too - a 
                        long time ago.  Her things were 
                        put into storage out west because 
                        I had no place to put them then.
                        I still haven't.  But now I've 
                        sent for them just the same.  And 
                        tonight I'd planned to make a sort 
                        of sentimental journey -
                               (slowly)
                        - to the scenes of my youth - my 
                        childhood, I suppose - to look 
                        again at -
                               (he changes mood 
                               slightly)
                        and now -

          Kane doesn't finish.  He looks at Susan.  Silence.

                                    KANE
                        Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles 
                        Foster Kane was born in New Salem,
                        Colorado in eighteen six -
                               (he stops on the 
                               word "sixty" - 
                               obviously a little 
                               embarrassed)
                        I run a couple of newspapers.  How 
                        about you?

                                    SUSAN
                        Oh, me -

                                    KANE
                        How old did you say you were?

                                    SUSAN
                               (very bright)
                        I didn't say.

                                    KANE
                        I didn't think you did.  If you 
                        had, I wouldn't have asked you 
                        again, because I'd have remembered.
                        How old?

                                    SUSAN
                        Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in 
                        August.

                                    KANE
                               (looks at her 
                               silently for a 
                               moment)
                        That's a ripe old age -  What do 
                        you do?

                                    SUSAN
                        I work at Seligman's.

                                    KANE
                        Is that what you want to do?

                                    SUSAN
                        I want to be a singer.
                               (she thinks for a 
                               moment)
                        I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for 
                        me.

                                    KANE
                               (sympathetically)
                        What happened to the singing?
                        You're not in a show, are you?

                                    SUSAN
                        Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother 
                        always thought - she used to talk 
                        about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine!
                        An American girl, for one thing -
                        and then my voice isn't really 
                        that kind anyway, it's just that 
                        Mother - you know what mothers are 
                        like.

          A sudden look comes over Kane's face.

                                    KANE
                        Yes -

                                    SUSAN
                        As a matter of fact, I do sing a 
                        little.

                                    KANE
                               (points to the piano)
                        Would you sing for me?

                                    SUSAN
                               (bashful)
                        Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me 
                        sing.

                                    KANE
                        Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.

                                    SUSAN
                        Well, I -

                                    KANE
                        Don't tell me your toothache is 
                        bothering you again?

                                    SUSAN
                        Oh, no, that's all gone.

                                    KANE
                        Then you have no alibi at all.
                        Please sing.

          Susan, with a tiny ladylike hesitancy, goes to the piano and 
          sings a polite song.  Sweetly, nicely, she sings with a small, 
          untrained voice.  Kane listens.  He is relaxed, at ease with 
          the world.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. "EL RANCHO" CABARET - EARLY DAWN -

          Susan tosses down a drink, then goes on with her story.

                                    SUSAN
                        I did a lot of singing after that.
                        I sang for Charlie -  I sang for 
                        teachers at a hundred bucks an 
                        hour - the teachers got that, I
                        didn't -

                                    THOMPSON
                        What did you get?

                                    SUSAN
                               (glares at him 
                               balefully)
                        What do you mean?

          Thompson doesn't answer.

                                    SUSAN
                        I didn't get a thing.  Just the 
                        music lessons.  That's all there 
                        was to it.

                                    THOMPSON
                        He married you, didn't he?

                                    SUSAN
                        He was in love with me.  But he 
                        never told me so until after it 
                        all came out in the papers about 
                        us - and he lost the election and
                        that Norton woman divorced him.

                                    THOMPSON
                        What about that apartment?

                                    SUSAN
                        He wanted me to be comfortable -
                        Oh, why should I bother?  You don't 
                        believe me, but it's true.  It 
                        just happens to be true.  He was 
                        really interested in my voice.
                               (sharply)
                        What are you smiling for?  What do 
                        you think he built that opera house 
                        for?  I didn't want it.  I didn't
                        want to sing.  It was his idea -
                        everything was his idea - except 
                        my leaving him.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. LIVING ROOM OF KANE'S HOUSE IN NEW YORK - DAY -

          Susan is singing.  Matisti, her voice teacher, is playing the 
          piano.  Kane is seated nearby.  Matisti stops.

                                    MATISTI
                        Impossible!  Impossible!

                                    KANE
                        Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane 
                        your opinion of her talents.
                        You're supposed to train her voice.
                        Nothing more.

                                    MATISTI
                               (sweating)
                        But, it is impossible.  I will be 
                        the laughingstock of the musical
                        world!  People will say -

                                    KANE
                        If you're interested in what people 
                        say, Signor Matisti, I may be able 
                        to enlighten you a bit.  The 
                        newspapers, for instance.  I'm an 
                        authority on what the papers will 
                        say, Signor Matisti, because I own 
                        eight of them between here and San 
                        Francisco...  It's all right, dear.
                        Signor Matisti is going to listen 
                        to reason.  Aren't you, maestro?
                               (he looks him square 
                               in the eyes)

                                    MATISTI
                        Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -

                                    KANE
                        You can't.

          There is a silence.  Matisti rises.

                                    KANE
                        I knew you'd see it my way.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CHICAGO OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT -

          It is the same opening night - it is the same moment as before - 
          except taht the camera is now upstage angling toward the 
          audience.  The curtain is down.  We see the same tableau as 
          before - the terrified and trembling Susan, the apprehensive 
          principals, the maids and singing teachers, the stage hands.  
          As the dissolve commences, there is the sound of applause 
          (exactly as before) and now as the dissolve completes itself, 
          the orchestra breaks frighteningly into opening chords of the 
          music - the stage is cleared - Susan is left alone, terribly 
          alone.  The curtain rises.  The glare of the footlights jump 
          into the image.  The curtain is now out of the picture and 
          Susan starts to sing.  Beyond her, we see the prompter's box, 
          containing the anxious face of the prompter.  Beyond that, out 
          in the darkness - an apprehensive conductor struggles with his 
          task of coordinating an orchestra and an incompetent singer.  
          Beyond that - dimly white shirt fronts and glistening bosoms 
          for a couple of rows, and then deep and terrible darkness.

          Closeup of Kane's face - seated in the audience - listening.

          Sudden but perfectly correct lull in the music reveals a voice 
          from the audience - a few words from a sentence - the kind of 
          thing that often happens in a theatre -

                                    THE VOICE
                        - really pathetic.

          Music crashes in and drowns out the rest of the sentence, but 
          hundreds of people around the voice have heard it (as well as 
          Kane) and there are titters which grow in volume.

          Closeup of Susan's face - singing.

          Closeup of Kane's face - listening.

          There is the ghastly sound of three thousand people applauding 
          as little as possible.  Kane still looks.  Then, near the 
          camera, there is the sound of about a dozen people applauding 
          very, very loudly.  Camera moves back, revealing Bernstein and 
          Reilly and other Kane stooges, seated around him, beating their 
          palms together.  The curtain is falling - as we can see by the 
          light which shutters down off their faces.

          The stage from Kane's angle.

          The curtain is down - the lights glowing on it.  Still, the 
          polite applause dying fast.  Nobody comes out for a bow.

          Closeup of Kane - breathing heavily.  Suddenly he starts to 
          applaud furiously.

          The stage from the audience again.

          Susan appears for her bow.  She can hardly walk.  There is a 
          little polite crescendo of applause, but it is sickly.

          Closeup of Kane - still applauding very, very hard, his eyes 
          on Susan.

          The stage again.

          Susan, finishing her bow, goes out through the curtains.  The 
          light on the curtain goes out and the houselights go on.

          Closeup of Kane - still applauding very, very hard.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. STUDY - KANE'S NEW YORK HOME - DAY -

          Some weeks later.  Susan, in a negligee, is at the window.  
          There are the remains of her breakfast tray on a little table.

                                    SUSAN
                        You don't propose to have yourself 
                        made ridiculous?  What about me?
                        I'm the one that has to do the 
                        singing.  I'm the one that gets 
                        the razzberries.
                               (pauses)
                        Last week, when I was shopping, 
                        one of the salesgirls did an 
                        imitation of me for another girl.  
                        She thought I didn't see her, but -  
                        Charlie, you might as well make up 
                        your mind to it.  This is one thing 
                        you're not going to have your own 
                        way about.  I can't sing and you 
                        know it -  Why can't you just -

          Kane rises and walks toward her.  There is cold menace in his 
          walk.  Susan shrinks a little as he draws closer to her.

                                    KANE
                        My reasons satisfy me, Susan.  You 
                        seem unable to understand them.  I 
                        will not tell them to you again.
                               (he is very close 
                               to her)
                        You will continue with your singing.

          His eyes are relentlessly upon her.  She sees something in 
          them that frightens her.  She nods her head slowly, indicating 
          surrender.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          Front page of the "San Francisco Enquirer" containing a large 
          portrait of Susan as Thais (as before).  It is announced that 
          Susan will open an independent season in San Francisco in 
          "Thais."  The picture remains constant but the names of the 
          papers change from New York to St. Louis, to Los Angeles to 
          Cleveland, to Denver to Philadelphia - all "Enquirers."

          During all this, on the soundtrack, Susan's voice is heard 
          singing her aria very faintly and far away, her voice cracking 
          a little.

          At the conclusion of this above, Susan has finished her song, 
          and there is the same mild applause as before - over the sound 
          of this, one man loudly applauding.  This fades out as we -

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. SUSAN'S BEDROOM - KANE'S NEW YORK HOME - LATE NIGHT -

          The camera angles across the bed and Susan's form towards the 
          door, from the other side of which voices can be heard.

                                    KANE'S VOICE
                        Let's have your keys, Raymond.

                                    RAYMOND'S VOICE
                        Yes, sir.

                                    KANE'S VOICE
                        The key must be in the other side.
                               (pause)
                        We'll knock the door down, Raymond.

                                    RAYMOND'S VOICE
                               (calling)
                        Mrs. Kane -

                                    KANE'S VOICE
                        Do what I say.

          The door crashes open, light floods in the room, revealing 
          Susan, fully dressed, stretched out on the bed, one arm dangling 
          over the side.  Kane rushes to her.

                                    KANE
                        Get Dr. Corey.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes, sir.

          He rushes out.  Susan is breathing, but heavily.  Kane loosens 
          the lace collar at her throat.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. SUSAN'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT -

          A little later.  All the lights are lit.  Susan, in a nightgown, 
          is in bed, asleep.  Raymond and a nurse are just leaving the 
          room, Raymond closing the door quietly behind him.  Dr. Corey 
          rises.

                                    DR. COREY
                        She'll be perfectly all right in a 
                        day or two, Mr. Kane.

          Kane nods.  He has a small bottle in his hand.

                                    DR. COREY
                        The nurse has complete instructions, 
                        but if you care to talk to me at 
                        any time, I should be only too 
                        glad -  I shall be here in the 
                        morning.

                                    KANE
                        Thank you.  I can't imagine how 
                        Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly 
                        mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner 
                        gave her is in a somewhat larger 
                        bottle -  I suppose the strain of 
                        preparing for her trip has excited 
                        and confused her.

                                    DR. COREY
                        I'm sure that's it.
                               (he starts out)

                                    KANE
                        There are no objections to my 
                        staying here with her, are there?

                                    DR. COREY
                        Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to 
                        be here, too.

                                    KANE
                        Of course.

          Dr. Corey leaves.  Kane settles himself in a chair next to the 
          bed, looking at Susan.  In a moment, the nurse enters, goes to 
          a chair in the corner of the room, and sits down.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. SUSAN'S ROOM - DAY -

          Susan, utterly spent, is lying flat on her back in her bed.  
          Kane is in the chair beside her.  The nurse is out of the room.

                                    SUSAN
                               (in a voice that 
                               comes from far 
                               away)
                        I couldn't make you see how I felt, 
                        Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I 
                        couldn't go threw with singing 
                        again.  You don't know what it 
                        means to feel - to know that people - 
                        that an audience don't want you.  
                        That if you haven't got what they 
                        want - a real voice -
                        they just don't care about you.  
                        Even when they're polite - and 
                        they don't laugh or get restless 
                        or - you know...  They don't want 
                        you.  They just -

                                    KANE
                               (angrily)
                        That's when you've got to fight 
                        them.  That's when you've got to 
                        make them.  That's -

          Susan's head turns and she looks at him silently with pathetic 
          eyes.

                                    KANE
                        I'm sorry.
                               (he leans over to 
                               pat her hand)
                        You won't have to fight them 
                        anymore.
                               (he smiles a little)
                        It's their loss.

          Gratefully, Susan, with difficulty, brings her other hand over 
          to cover his.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOT OF XANADU - HALF BUILT

          INT. THE GRAND HALL IN XANADU -

          Closeup of an enormous jigsaw puzzle.  A hand is putting in 
          the last piece.  Camera moves back to reveal jigsaw puzzle 
          spread out on the floor.

          Susan is on the floor before her jigsaw puzzle.  Kane is in an 
          easy chair.  Behind them towers the massive Renaissance 
          fireplace.  It is night and Baroque candelabra illuminates the 
          scene.

                                    SUSAN
                               (with a sigh)
                        What time is it?

          There is no answer.

                                    SUSAN
                        Charlie!  I said, what time is it?

                                    KANE
                               (looks up - consults 
                               his watch)
                        Half past eleven.

                                    SUSAN
                        I mean in New York.

                                    KANE
                        Half past eleven.

                                    SUSAN
                        At night?

                                    KANE
                        Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to 
                        press.

                                    SUSAN
                               (sarcastically)
                        Hurray for the bulldog!
                               (sighs)
                        Half past eleven!  The shows have 
                        just let out.  People are going to 
                        night clubs and restaurants.  Of 
                        course, we're different.  We live 
                        in a palace - at the end of the 
                        world.

                                    KANE
                        You always said you wanted to live 
                        in a palace.

                                    SUSAN
                        Can't we go back, Charlie?

          Kane looks at her smilingly and turns back to his work.

                                    SUSAN
                        Charlie -

          There is no answer.

                                    SUSAN
                        If I promise to be a good girl!
                        Not to drink - and to entertain 
                        all the governors and the senators
                        with dignity -
                               (she puts a slur 
                               into the word)

          INT. XANADU - LIVING ROOM - DAY -

          Another picture puzzle.

          Camera pulls back to show Kane and Susan in much the same 
          positions as before, except that they are older.

                                    KANE
                        One thing I've never been able to 
                        understand, Susan.  How do you 
                        know you haven't done them before?

          Susan shoots him an angry glance.  She isn't amused.

                                    SUSAN
                        It makes a whole lot more sense 
                        than collecting Venuses.

                                    KANE
                        You may be right -  I sometimes 
                        wonder - but you get into the
                        habit -

                                    SUSAN
                               (snapping)
                        It's not a habit.  I do it because 
                        I like it.

                                    KANE
                        I was referring to myself.
                               (pauses)
                        I thought we might have a picnic 
                        tomorrow - it might be a nice change 
                        after the Wild West party tonight.  
                        Invite everybody to go to the 
                        Everglades -

                                    SUSAN
                               (throws down a piece 
                               of the jigsaw puzzle 
                               and rises)
                        Invite everybody!  Order everybody, 
                        you mean, and make them sleep in 
                        tents!  Who wants to sleep in tents 
                        when they have a nice room of their
                        own - with their own bath, where 
                        they know where everything is?

          Kane has looked at her steadily, not hostilely.

                                    KANE
                        I thought we might invite everybody 
                        to go on a picnic tomorrow.  Stay 
                        at Everglades overnight.
                               (he pats her lightly 
                               on the shoulder)
                        Please see that the arrangements 
                        are made, Susan.

          Kane turns away - to Bernstein.

                                    KANE
                        You remember my son, Mr. Bernstein.

          On the soundtrack we hear the following lines of dialogue:

                                    BERNSTEIN'S VOICE
                               (embarrased)
                        Oh, yes.  How do you do, Mr. Kane?

                                    CHARLIE JR.'S VOICE
                        Hello.

          During this, camera holds on closeup of Susan's face.  She is 
          very angry.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Long shot - of a number of classy tents.

          DISSOLVE IN:

          INT. LARGE TENT - EVERGLADES CAMP - NIGHT -

          Two real beds have been set up on each side of the tent.  A 
          rather classy dressing table is in the rear, at which Susan is 
          preparing for bed.  Kane, in his shirt-sleeves, is in an easy 
          chair, reading.  Susan is very sullen.

                                    SUSAN
                        I'm not going to put up with it.

          Kane turns to look at her.

                                    SUSAN
                        I mean it.
                               (she catches a slight 
                               flicker on Kane's 
                               face)
                        Oh, I know I always say I mean it, 
                        and then I don't - or you get me 
                        so don't do what I say I'm going 
                        to - but -

                                    KANE
                               (interrupting)
                        You're in a tent, darling.  You're 
                        not at home.  And I can hear you 
                        very well if you just talk in a 
                        normal tone of voice.

                                    SUSAN
                        I'm not going to have my guests
                        insulted, just because you think -
                               (in a rage)
                        - if people want to bring a drink 
                        or two along on a picnic, that's
                        their business.  You've got no 
                        right -

                                    KANE
                               (quickly)
                        I've got more than a right as far 
                        as you're concerned, Susan.

                                    SUSAN
                        Oh, I'm sick and tired of you 
                        telling me what I must and what I 
                        musn't do!

                                    KANE
                               (gently)
                        You're my wife, Susan, and -

                                    SUSAN
                        I'm not just your wife, I'm a person 
                        all by myself - or I ought to be.  
                        I was once.  Sometimes you get me 
                        to believing I never was.

                                    KANE
                        We can discuss all this some other
                        time, Susan.  Right now -

                                    SUSAN
                        I'll discuss what's on my mind 
                        when I want to.  You're not going 
                        to keep on running my life the way 
                        you want it.

                                    KANE
                        As far as you're concerned, Susan, 
                        I've never wanted anything -  I 
                        don't want anything now - except 
                        what you want.

                                    SUSAN
                        What you want me to want, you mean.
                        What you've decided I ought to 
                        have - what you'd want if you were 
                        me.  But you've never given me 
                        anything that -

                                    KANE
                        Susan, I really think -

                                    SUSAN
                        Oh, I don't mean the things you've 
                        given me - that don't mean anything 
                        to you.  What's the difference 
                        between giving me a bracelet or 
                        giving somebody else a hundred 
                        thousand dollars for a statue you're 
                        going to keep crated up and never 
                        look at?  It's only money.  It 
                        doesn't mean anything.  You're not 
                        really giving anything that belongs 
                        to you, that you care about.

                                    KANE
                               (he has risen)
                        Susan, I want you to stop this.
                        And right now!

                                    SUSAN
                        Well, I'm not going to stop it.  
                        I'm going to say exactly what I 
                        think.
                               (she screams)
                        You've never given me anything.  
                        You've tried to buy me into giving 
                        you something.  You're -
                               (a sudden notion)
                        - it's like you were bribing me!  
                        That's what it's been from the 
                        first moment I met you.  No matter 
                        how much it cost you - your time, 
                        your money - that's what you've 
                        done with everybody you've ever 
                        known.  Tried to bribe them!

                                    KANE
                        Susan!

          She looks at him, with no lessening of her passion.

                                    KANE
                        You're talking an incredible amount 
                        of nonsense, Susan.
                               (quietly)
                        Whatever I do -  I do - because I 
                        love you.

                                    SUSAN
                        Love!  You don't love anybody!  Me 
                        or anybody else!  You want to be 
                        loved - that's all you want!  I'm 
                        Charles Foster Kane.  Whatever you 
                        want - just name it and it's yours!
                        Only love me!  Don't expect me to
                        love you -

          Without a word, Kane slaps her across the face.  They look at 
          each other.

                                    SUSAN
                        You - you hit me.

          Kane continues to look at her.

                                    SUSAN
                        You'll never have another chance 
                        to hit me again.
                               (pauses)
                        Never knew till this minute -

                                    KANE
                        Susan, it seems to me -

                                    SUSAN
                        Don't tell me you're sorry.

                                    KANE
                        I'm not sorry.

                                    SUSAN
                        I'm going to leave you.

                                    KANE
                        No, you're not.

                                    SUSAN
                               (nods)
                        Yes.

          They look at each other, fixedly, but she doesn't give way.  
          In fact, the camera on Kane's face shows the beginning of a 
          startled look, as of one who sees something unfamiliar and 
          unbelievable.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. KANE'S STUDY - XANADU - DAY -

          Kane is a the window looking out.  He turns as he hears Raymond 
          enter.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Mrs. Kane would like to see you, 
                        Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        All right.

          Raymond waits as Kane hesitates.

                                    KANE
                        Is Mrs. Kane -
                               (he can't finish)

                                    RAYMOND
                        Marie has been packing since 
                        morning, Mr. Kane.

          Kane impetuously walks past him out of the room.

          INT. SUSAN'S ROOM - XANADU - DAY -

          Packed suitcases are on the floor, Susan is completely dressed 
          for travelling.  Kane bursts into the room.

                                    SUSAN
                        Tell Arnold I'm ready, Marie.  He 
                        can get the bags.

                                    MARIE
                        Yes, Mrs. Kane.

          She leaves.  Kane closes the door behind her.

                                    KANE
                        Have you gone completely crazy?

          Susan looks at him.

                                    KANE
                        Don't you realize that everybody 
                        here is going to know about this?
                        That you've packed your bags and
                        ordered the car and -

                                    SUSAN
                        - And left?  Of course they'll
                        hear.  I'm not saying goodbye -
                        except to you - but I never imagined 
                        that people wouldn't know.

          Kane is standing against the door as if physically barring her 
          way.

                                    KANE
                        I won't let you go.

                                    SUSAN
                        You can't stop me.

          Kane keeps looking at her.  Susan reaches out her hand.

                                    SUSAN
                        Goodbye, Charlie.

                                    KANE
                               (suddenly)
                        Don't go, Susan.

                                    SUSAN
                        Let's not start all over again, 
                        Charlie.  We've said everything 
                        that can be said.

                                    KANE
                        Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!

          He has lost all pride.  Susan stops.  She is affected by this.

                                    KANE
                        You mustn't go, Susan.  
                        Everything'll be exactly the way 
                        you want it.  Not the way I think 
                        you want it - by your way.  Please, 
                        Susan - Susan!

          She is staring at him.  She might weaken.

                                    KANE
                        Don't go, Susan!  You mustn't go!
                               (almost blubbering)
                        You - you can't do this to me,
                        Susan -

          It's as if he had thrown ice water into her face.  She freezes.

                                    SUSAN
                        I see - it's you that this is being 
                        done to!  It's not me at all.  Not 
                        how I feel.  Not what it means to 
                        me.
                               (she laughs)
                        I can't do this to you!
                               (she looks at him)
                        Oh, yes I can.

          She walks out, past Kane, who turns to watch her go, like a 
          very tired old man.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          INT. "EL RANCHO" CABARET - NIGHT -

          Susan and Thompson at a table.  There is silence between them 
          for a moment.

                                    SUSAN
                        In case you've never heard of how 
                        I lost all my money - and it was
                        plenty, believe me -

                                    THOMPSON
                        The last ten years have been tough 
                        on a lot of people.

                                    SUSAN
                        They haven't been tough on me.  I 
                        just lost my money.  But when I 
                        compare these last ten years with
                        the twenty I spent with him -

                                    THOMPSON
                        I feel kind of sorry for him, all
                        the same -

                                    SUSAN
                               (harshly)
                        Don't you think I do?
                               (pause)
                        You say you're going down to Xanadu?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Monday, with some of the boys from 
                        the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants 
                        the whole place photographed 
                        carefully - all that art stuff.  
                        We run a picture magazine, you 
                        know -

                                    SUSAN
                        I know.  If you're smart, you'll 
                        talk to Raymond.  That's the butler.
                        You can learn a lot from him.  He 
                        knows where the bodies are buried.

          She shivers.  The dawn light from the skylight above has grown 
          brighter, making the artificial light in the night club look 
          particularly ghastly, revealing mercilessly every year of 
          Susan's age.

                                    SUSAN
                        Well, what do you know?  It's 
                        morning already.
                               (looks at him)
                        You must come around and tell me 
                        the story of your life sometime.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:

          INT. GREAT HALL - XANADU - NIGHT -

          An open door shows the pantry, which is dark.  Thompson and 
          Raymond are at a table.  There is a pitcher of beer and a plate 
          of sandwiches before them.  Raymond drinks a glass of beer and 
          settles back.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to 
                        handle the old man.  He was kind 
                        of queer, but I knew how to handle 
                        him.

                                    THOMPSON
                        Queer?

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yeah.  I guess he wasn't very happy 
                        those last years - he didn't have
                        much reason to be -

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CORRIDOR AND TELEGRAPH OFFICE - XANADU - NIGHT -

          Raymond walking rapidly along corridor.  He pushes open a door.  
          At a desk in a fairly elaborate telegraph office sits a wireless 
          operator named Fred.  Near him at a telephone switchboard sits 
          a female operator named Katherine (not that it matters).

                                    RAYMOND
                               (reading)
                        Mr. Charles Foster Kane announced 
                        today that Mrs. Charles Foster 
                        Kane has left Xanadu, his Florida 
                        home, under the terms of a peaceful 
                        and friendly agreement with the 
                        intention of filing suit for divorce 
                        at an early date.  Mrs. Kane said 
                        that she does not intend to return 
                        to the operatic career which she 
                        gave up a few years after her 
                        marriage, at Mr.  Kane's request.  
                        Signed, Charles Foster Kane.

          Fred finishes typing and then looks up.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Exclusive for immediate 
                        transmission.  Urgent priority all 
                        Kane papers.

                                    FRED
                        Okay.

          There is the sound of the buzzer on the switchboard.  Katherine 
          puts in a plug and answers the call.

                                    KATHERINE
                        Yes ... yes...  Mrs. Tinsdall -
                        Very well.
                               (turns to Raymond)
                        It's the housekeeper.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes?

                                    KATHERINE
                        She says there's some sort of 
                        disturbance up in Mrs. Alexander's 
                        room.  She's afraid to go in.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUSAN'S BEDROOM - XANADU - NIGHT -

          The housekeeper, Mrs. Tinsdall, and a couple of maids are near 
          the door but are too afraid to be in front of it.  From inside 
          can be heard a terrible banging and crashing.  Raymond hurries 
          into scene, opens the door and goes in.

          INT. SUSAN'S BEDROOM - XANADU -

          Kane, in a truly terrible and absolutely silent rage, is 
          literally breaking up the room - yanking pictures, hooks and 
          all off the wall, smashing them to bits - ugly, gaudy pictures - 
          Susie's pictures in Susie's bad taste.  Off of occasional 
          tables, bureaus, he sweeps Susie's whorish accumulation of 
          bric-a-brac.

          Raymond stands in the doorway watching him.  Kane says nothing.  
          He continues with tremendous speed and surprising strength, 
          still wordlessly, tearing the room to bits.  The curtains (too 
          frilly - overly pretty) are pulled off the windows in a single 
          gesture, and from the bookshelves he pulls down double armloads 
          of cheap novels - discovers a half-empty bottle of liquor and 
          dashes it across the room.  Finally he stops.  Susie's cozy 
          little chamber is an incredible shambles all around him.

          He stands for a minute breathing heavily, and his eye lights 
          on a hanging what-not in a corner which had escaped his notice.  
          Prominent on its center shelf is the little glass ball with 
          the snowstorm in it.  He yanks it down.  Something made of 
          china breaks, but not the glass ball.  It bounces on the carpet 
          and rolls to his feet, the snow in a flurry.  His eye follows 
          it.  He stoops to pick it up - can't make it.  Raymond picks 
          it up for him; hands it to him.  Kane takes it sheepishly - 
          looks at it - moves painfully out of the room into the corridor.

          INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUSAN'S BEDROOM - XANADU -

          Kane comes out of the door.  Mrs. Tinsdall has been joined now 
          by a fairly sizable turnout of servants.  They move back away 
          from Kane, staring at him.  Raymond is in the doorway behind 
          Kane.  Kane looks at the glass ball.

                                    KANE
                               (without turning)
                        Close the door, Raymond.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes, sir.
                               (he closes it)

                                    KANE
                        Lock it - and keep it locked.

          Raymond locks the door and comes to his side.  There is a long 
          pause - servants staring in silence.  Kane gives the glass 
          ball a gentle shake and starts another snowstorm.

                                    KANE
                        Raymond -
                               (he is almost in a 
                               trance)

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes, sir -

          One of the younger servants giggles and is hushed up.  Kane 
          shakes the ball again.  Another flurry of snow.  He watches 
          the flakes settle - then looks up.  Finally, taking in the 
          pack of servants and something of the situations, he puts the 
          glass ball in his coat pocket.  He speaks very quietly to 
          Raymond, so quietly it only seems he's talking to himself.

                                    KANE
                        Keep it locked.

          He slowly walks off down the corridor, the servants giving way 
          to let him pass, and watching him as he goes.  He is an old, 
          old man!

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. KANE'S CHAPEL - XANADU - LATE AFTERNOON -

          As the dissolve completes itself, camera is travellling across 
          the floor of the chapel past the crypts of Kane's father and 
          mother - (marked: James Kane - 18- TO 19-; Mary Kane - 18- TO 
          19-;) - past a blank crypt, and then holding on the burial of 
          Kane's son.  A group of ordinary workmen in ordinary clothes 
          are lowering a very expensive-looking coffin into its crypt.  
          Kane stands nearby with Raymond, looking on.  The men strain 
          and grunt as the coffin bangs on the stone floor.  The men now 
          place over it a long marble slab on which is cut the words:

          CHARLES FOSTER KANE II.

          1907 - 1938

                                    ONE OF THE WORKMEN
                        Sorry, Mr. Kane, we won't be able
                        to cement it till tommorrow.  We -

          Kane looks right through him.  Raymond cuts him short.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Okay.

          The men tip their hats and shuffle out of the chapel.  Kane 
          raises his head, looks at the inscription on the wall.  It is 
          a little to one side of Junior's grave, directly over the blank 
          place which will be occupied by Kane himself.

                                    KANE
                        Do you like poetry, Raymond?

                                    RAYMOND
                        Can't say, sir.

                                    KANE
                        Mrs. Kane liked poetry -

          Raymond is now convinced that the old master is very far gone 
          indeed - not to say off his trolley.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        Not my wife - not either of them.

          He looks at the grave next to his son's - the grave marked 
          "MARY KANE."

                                    RAYMOND
                               (catching on)
                        Oh, yes, sir.

                                    KANE
                               (looking back up at 
                               the wall)
                        Do you know what that is?

                                    RAYMOND
                               (more his keeper 
                               than his butler 
                               now)
                        It's a wall you bought in China, 
                        Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        Persia.  It belonged to a king.

                                    RAYMOND
                        How did you get him to part with 
                        it, Mr. Kane?

                                    KANE
                        He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do 
                        you know what it means?

                                    RAYMOND
                        No, I don't, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        I didn't used to be afraid of it.

          A short pause.  His eyes still on the wall, but looking through 
          it, Kane quotes the translation.

                                    KANE
                        The drunkeness of youth has passed 
                        like a fever, And yet I saw many 
                        things, Seeing my glory in the 
                        days of my glory, I thought my 
                        power eternal And the days of my 
                        life Fixed surely in the years But 
                        a whisper came to me From Him who 
                        dies not.  I called my tributary 
                        kings together And those who were 
                        proud rulers under me, I opened 
                        the boxes of my treasure to them, 
                        saying: "Take hills of gold, 
                        moutains of silver, And give me 
                        only one more day upon the earth."
                        But they stood silent, Looking 
                        upon the ground; So that I died 
                        And Death came to sit upon my 
                        throne.  O sons of men You see a 
                        stranger upon the road, You call 
                        to him and he does not step.  He 
                        is your life Walking towards time, 
                        Hurrying to meet the kings of India 
                        and China.
                               (quoting)
                        O sons of men You are caught in 
                        the web of the world And the spider 
                        Nothing waits behind it.  Where 
                        are the men with towering hopes?
                        They have changed places with owls, 
                        Owls who have lived in tombs And 
                        now inhabit a palace.

          Kane still stares at the wall, through it, and way beyond it.  
          Raymond looks at him.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          INT. GREAT HALL - XANADU - NIGHT -

          Thompson and Raymond.  Raymond has finished his beer.

                                    RAYMOND
                               (callously)
                        That's the whole works, right up 
                        to date.

                                    THOMPSON
                        Sentimental fellow, aren't you?

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes and no.

                                    THOMPSON
                               (getting to his 
                               feet)
                        Well, thanks a lot.

                                    RAYMOND
                        See what I mean?  He was a little 
                        gone in the head - the last couple 
                        of years, anyway - but I knew how 
                        to handle him.
                               (rises)
                        That "Rosebud" - that don't mean 
                        anything.  I heard him say it.
                        He just said "Rosebud" and then he 
                        dropped that glass ball and it 
                        broke on the floor.  He didn't say 
                        anything about that, so I knew he 
                        was dead - He said all kind of 
                        things I couldn't make out.  But I 
                        knew how to take care of him.

          Thompson doesn't answer.

                                    RAYMOND
                        You can go on asking questions if 
                        you want to.

                                    THOMPSON
                               (coldly)
                        We're leaving tonight.  As soon as 
                        they're through photographing
                        the stuff -

          Thompson has risen.  Raymond gets to his feet and goes to the 
          door, opening it for him.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Allow yourself plenty of time.  
                        The train stops at the Junction On 
                        signal - but they don't like to 
                        wait.  Not now.  I can remember 
                        when they'd wait all day ... if 
                        Mr. Kane said so.

          Raymond ushes Thompson into

          INT. THE GREAT HALL - XANADU - NIGHT -

          The magnificent tapestries, candelabra, etc., are still there, 
          but now several large packing cases are piled against the walls, 
          some broken open, some shut and a number of objects, great and 
          small, are piled pell mell all over the place.  Furniture, 
          statues, paintings, bric-a-brac - things of obviously enormous 
          value are standing beside a kitchen stove, an old rocking chair 
          and other junk, among which is also an old sled, the self-same 
          story.  Somewhere in the back, one of the vast Gothic windows 
          of the hall is open and a light wind blows through the scene, 
          rustling the papers.

          In the center of the hall, a Photographer and his Assistant 
          are busy photographing the sundry objects.  The floor is 
          littered with burnt-out flash bulbs.  They continue their work 
          throughout the early part of the scene so that now and then a 
          flash bulb goes off.  In addition to the Photographer and his 
          Assistant, there are a Girl and Two Newspaperment - the Second 
          and Third Men of the projection room scene - also Thompson and 
          Raymond.

          The Girl and the Second Man, who wears a hat, are dancing 
          somewhere in the back of the hall to the music of a phonograph.  
          A flash bulb goes off.  The Photographer has just photographed 
          a picture, obviously of great value, an Italian primitive.  
          The Assistant consults a label on the back of it.

                                    ASSISTANT
                        NO. 9182

          The Third Newspaperman starts to jot this information down.

                                    ASSISTANT
                        "Nativity" - attributed to 
                        Donatello, acquired Florence 1921, 
                        cost 45,000 lira.  Got that?

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                        Yeah.

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        All right!  Next!  Better get that 
                        statue over there.

                                    ASSISTANT
                        Okay.

          The Photographer and his Assitant start to move off with their 
          equipment towards a large sculpture in another part of the 
          hall.

                                    RAYMOND
                        What do you think all that is worth, 
                        Mr. Thompson?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Millions - if anybody wants it.

                                    RAYMOND
                        The banks are out of luck, eh?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear 
                        all right.

                                    ASSISTANT
                        "Venus," Fourth Century.  Acquired 
                        1911.  Cost twenty-three thousand.
                        Got it?

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                        Okay.

                                    ASSISTANT
                               (patting the statue 
                               on the fanny)
                        That's a lot of money to pay for a 
                        dame without a head.

                                    SECOND ASSISTANT
                               (reading a label)

                        of Mary Kane, Little Salem,

                        Okay.

          A flashlight bulb goes off.

                                    SECOND ASSISTANT
                        We're all set to get everything.  
                        The junk as well as the art.

          Thompson has opened a box and is idly playing with a handful 
          of little pieces of cardboard.

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                        What's that?

                                    RAYMOND
                        It's a jigsaw puzzle.

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                        We got a lot of those.  There's a 
                        Burmese Temple and three Spanish 
                        ceilings down the hall.

          Raymond laughs.

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Yeah, all in crates.

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                        There's a part of a Scotch castle 
                        over there, but we haven't bothered 
                        to unwrap it.

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        I wonder how they put all those 
                        pieces together?

                                    ASSISTANT

                        Value $2.00.

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Put it over by that statue.  It'll 
                        make a good setup.

                                    GIRL
                               (calling out)
                        Who is she anyway?

                                    SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN
                        Venus.  She always is.

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                        He sure liked to collect things, 
                        didn't he?

                                    RAYMOND
                        He went right on buying - right up 
                        to the end.

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Anything and everything - he was a 
                        regular crow.

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                        wonder -  You put all this together -
                        the palaces and the paintings and 
                        the toys and everything - what 
                        would it spell?

          Thompson has turned around.  He is facing the camera for the 
          first time.

                                    THOMPSON
                        Charles Foster Kane.

          Another flash bulb goes off.  The Photographer turns to Thompson 
          with a grin.

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Or Rosebud?  How about it, Jerry?

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                               (to the dancers)
                        Turn that thing off, will you?  
                        It's driving me nuts!  What's 
                        Rosebud?

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Kane's last words, aren't they, 
                        Jerry?
                               (to the Third

                        That was Jerry's angle, wasn't it, 
                        Jerry?  Did you ever find out what 
                        it means, Jerry?

                                    THOMPSON
                        No, I didn't.

          The music has stopped.  The dancers have come over to Thompson.

                        Say, what did you find out about 
                        him, anyway, Jerry?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Not much.

                        Well, what have you been doing?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Playing with a jigsaw puzzle -   I 
                        talked to a lot of people who knew 
                        him.

                                    GIRL
                        What do they say?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Well - it's become a very clear 
                        picture.  He was the most honest 
                        man who ever lived, with a streak 
                        of crookedness a yard wide.  He 
                        was a liberal and a reactionary; 
                        he was tolerant - "Live and Let 
                        Live" - that was his motto.  But 
                        he had no use for anybody who 
                        disagreed with him on any point, 
                        no matter how small it was.  He 
                        was a loving husband and a good 
                        father - and both his wives left 
                        him and his son got himself killed 
                        about as shabbily as you can do 
                        it.  He had a gift for friendship 
                        such as few men have - he broke 
                        his oldest friend's heart like 
                        you'd throw away a cigarette
                        you were through with.  Outside of 
                        that -

                        Okay, okay.

                                    GIRL
                        What about Rosebud?  Don't you 
                        think that explains anything?

                                    THOMPSON
                        No, I don't.  Not much anway.  
                        Charles Foster Kane was a man who 
                        got everything he wanted, and then 
                        lost it.  Maybe Rosebud was 
                        something he couldn't get or lost.  
                        No, I don't think it explains
                        anything.  I don't think any word 
                        explains a man's life.  No -  I 
                        guess Rosebud is just a piece in a 
                        jigsaw puzzle - a missing piece.

          He drops the jigsaw pieces back into the box, looking at his 
          watch.

                                    THOMPSON
                        We'd better get along.  We'll miss 
                        the train.

          He picks up his overcoat - it has been resting on a little 
          sled - the little sled young Charles Foster Kane hit Thatcher 
          with at the opening of the picture.  Camera doesn't close in 
          on this.  It just registers the sled as the newspaper people, 
          picking up their clothes and equipment, move out of the great 
          hall.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CELLAR - XANADU - NIGHT -

          A large furnace, with an open door, dominates the scene.  Two 
          laborers, with shovels, are shovelling things into the furnace.  
          Raymond is about ten feet away.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Throw that junk in, too.

          Camera travels to the pile that he has indicated.  It is mostly 
          bits of broken packing cases, excelsior, etc.  The sled is on 
          top of the pile.  As camera comes close, it shows the faded 
          rosebud and, though the letters are faded, unmistakably the 
          word "ROSEBUD" across it.  The laborer drops his shovel, takes 
          the sled in his hand and throws it into the furnace.  The flames 
          start to devour it.

          EXT. XANADU - NIGHT -

          No lights are to be seen.  Smoke is coming from a chimney.

          Camera reverses the path it took at the beginning of the 
          picture, perhaps omitting some of the stages.  It moves finally 
          through the gates, which close behind it.  As camera pauses 
          for a moment, the letter "K" is prominent in the moonlight.

          Just before we fade out, there comes again into the picture 
          the pattern of barbed wire and cyclone fencing.  On the fence 
          is a sign which reads:

          "PRIVATE - NO TRESPASSING"

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                         FADE IN:

          EXT. ALLEYWAY (VILLAGE) - DUSK

          Gloomy, last light. From out of the shadows comes            --
          A DOG. A dog of war. Big, mangy, muscular, scary. As
          he moves down the alley, the way becomes increasingly
          choked with fallen structures. and signs of tumult.

          EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DUSK

          TRACKING WITH THE DOG as he comes onto a battlefield.
          The hellish scene is REVEALED TO US SLOWLY --                

          SERIES OF SHOTS
          as the Dog traverses a landscape of --
          BODIES, frozen in contorted death poses. This was
          furious, hand-to-hand fighting between human SOLDIERS and
          nightmare CREATURES, their corpses now in piles to the
          horizon.
          The Dog climbs a mound of casualties. At the top, the
          Dog looks back across the battlefield. The Dog's eyes
          are sad, his expression weary and disgusted.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - NIGHT

          The entrance is patrolled by a dozen PALACE GUARDS. They     
          don't see the Dog pad silently to a fissure in the palace    
          wall and disappear inside.                                   

          INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - GREAT HALL - NIGHT             

          Bloodied and battered, the King's GENERALS are               
          disagreeing loudly about strategy. A loud BANGING sound
          pierces the hubbub, and the officers quiet, turning to --    
          KING ACRISIUS, a striking man in his prime, his handsome     
          face marked by one crooked scar on his jaw. He commands      
          the room --                                                  

                         KING ACRISIUS
          Now we end the debate about
          tactics... and begin to plan for
          victory.

          AT THE BACK OF THE HALL
          The Dog stares at the King. Then slips away.

          INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - GREAT STAIRS - NIGHT

          Unseen by exhausted Guards, the Dog bounds up the stairs.     

          INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - ROYAL APARTMENT - CORRIDOR -


                         NIGHT
          The Dog approaches a doorway; stops to watch from the         
          shadows.

          INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - BEDCHAMBER - DOG'S POV -


                         NIGHT
          In the dim bedchamber, the SILHOUETTE of QUEEN DANAE as a     
          LADY-IN-WAITING removes her gown, revealing the Queen's       
          perfect body as she slips into bed. The Lady-in-Waiting
          leaves.
          The Dog's eyes. He moves forward.

                         FLOOR-LEVEL
          TRACKING WITH the Dog's legs as they MORPH INTO HUMAN
          LEGS. The CAMERA RISES BEHIND a towering male figure,
          who roughly pulls a curtain aside.                            
          In the bed, the Queen is startled, then pleased.

                         QUEEN DANAE
          My King! Has the strategy been
          set so quickly?

                         REVERSE ANGLE
          The looming figure looks exactly like King Acrisius,          
          including the distinctive scar. He regards her hungrily.      

                         QUEEN DANAE
          Come to your Queen, my King.

          INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - GREAT STAIRS - SUNRISE          

          The real King Acrisius wearily climbs the stairs with         
          AIDES and Guards. Suddenly, the King stops.

                         CONTINUED:
          On the wall above is the huge shadow of a four-legged
          creature -- and now it appears:
          The Dog stops at the top of the stairs and regards the
          men without fear -- its eyes blaze with a God's power.
          Even Acrisius, who fears nothing, steps back. The others
          raise their weapons.
          The Dog comes down the steps, eyes upon them, and passes     
          close by. No one dare move. The Dog disappears into the      
          shadows below.

          HARDENED COUNTENANCE - DAY
          staring at --

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Queen Danae, PREGNANT NOW, and weeping. Her arms are
          bound.
          A ROYAL ENTOURAGE is gathered. The women weep, the men       
          agonize.                                                     
          Palace Guards lift the Queen into a chest and chain it       
          closed. On the King's signal, the Guards carry the chest     
          to the edge and drop it into the rough sea. We HEAR a
          SCREAM from within.
          Some members of the Royal Entourage look with scorn at
          their King, outraged by this double murder. Acrisius
          registers their disapproving looks and angrily turns to
          leave the promontory.
          WE SEE in his face what the others do not -- shame and
          doubt.                                                       
          IN THE WATER BELOW, the chest rights itself and rides out    
          on the tide.

          Two HORSEMEN gallop in the moonlight. The first Rider
          sways in the saddle and falls from his mount. He
          staggers to his feet, a skin of ale in his hands. It is
          King Acrisius, very drunk.
          The second Rider, the King's STEWARD, dismounts to give      
          aid, though he's also drunk.

          This talk sobers the Steward instantly; he looks about                    
          fearlessly.

          He cuckolds me in my castle, rapes

          Yes, Tiamat! And today I have
          honored her.
          The King whirls and staggers up the crest of the dune.        

                         KING ACRISIUS
          I've taken Zeus' whore and the
          bastard she grows in her belly and
          thrown them to Tiamat in her rough
          sea!
          (toward the moonlit

                         OCEAN)
          I honor Zeus' rival with all that
          was dear to me --
          (falters, ashamed)
          -- and commit double murder in her
          honor...
          About to go to pieces, rage seizes him again --               

                         KING ACRISIUS
          so that Zeus will know I
          despise and disdain him and spit
          on his foul name!
          The Steward shrinks from this blasphemy, eyes darting in      
          fear.                                                         
          ON THE CREST the King is silhouetted in the moonlight,        
          arms raised defiantly toward the heavens, when suddenly --    
          -- his figure is seized by some violent force, shaking
          his being. A HORRIBLE SOUND                                  (MUSCLE TEARS, BONES CRACK)
          and THE KING'S BODY GROWS LARGER AS IT DISTORTS IN

          MISSHAPEN DISFIGUREMENT.
          And thus, KING ACRISIUS BECOMES... KALIBOS!
          The Steward SEES what we now cannot. An INHUMAN ROAR and
          the shadow of this new being falls upon the Steward. He
          SCREAMS, but it's too late -- the huge CREATURE grabs him
          by the neck and LIFTS HIM OUT OF FRAME. From the empty,
          moonlit dunes, we...

          A LITTLE BOY leads a blind OLD MAN along a road.             
          Abruptly, the Old Man halts. Puzzled, the Boy scans
          ahead, SEES --

                         FORM --

          WE ARE IN THAT RUSHING POV: the landscape is just a          
          blur. But up ahead is a mountain: OLYMPOS. WE ZOOM UP        
          TO the summit --                                             
          -- INTO the clouds above the peak. THROUGH the mist --
          villas, classical facades: THE ABODE OF THE GODS. The
          polished stone of the grandest villa reflects THOTH'S
          dark form touching down.

          THOTH THE QUICK enters the wide courtyard, his cape
          billowing. He strides past the reflecting pool in the
          center of the courtyard, gravely acknowledging --
          -- each of the TEN FIGURES seated around the perimeter...
          THE OLYMPIANS. APOLLO is here, and bronze-helmeted
          ATHENA; APHRODITE and muscular VULCAN -- we are dazzled
          and lose count.
          Thoth bows deeply before the throne of ZEUS, majestic,       
          bearded, awe-inspiring. An EAGLE is perched on his arm.

          We have debated, we have voted,

          Humans peace. Thoth, you will
          take them the terms of a treaty --

                         (SCORNFULLY)
          A treaty!
          Zeus and his eagle turn their heads. The God's eyes are
          familiar -- the blazing orbs we saw in The Dog.
          In the shadowed corner of the atrium stand TWO MORE
          Olympians: SET THE VOID, whose countenance is death made    
          visible, and --

                         TIAMAT
          We don't negotiate with them! We
          dictate to them. Their place is
          to beg. They have forgotten their
          role and have denied us the
          sustenance of their prayers.

                         APHRODITE
          Our mercy will give them reason to
          be grateful. They will bow down
          and whisper our names with more
          passion than before.

                         TIAMAT
          They will bow down when we snap
          their backs! Mercy? We are Gods!
          Some of us remember that and are
          not afraid --
          Zeus has had enough: furious ARCS OF LIGHTNING jump to
          the walls, the eagle beats its wings in rage.               

                         ZEUS
          Silence! Or learn what it is to
          be afraid! The debate is over,
          the votes cast...
          Zeus points to a golden tray; it bears TEN chips of
          alabaster versus TWO shards of obsidian.

          weaker than I knew.
          Set gestures at the white chips on the tray as he picks
          up the two black shards representing their votes. He

          We will manage these thick-witted

          Yes, we will be bound by great

          I only recommend you take care
          with the tone of the conversation.
          A truce would benefit all...

                         KEPHEUS
          In my palace, I decide how the                             
          discourse proceeds, not some
          messenger sent on errands by Zeus.

          THOTH (O.S.)
          You are correct, Your Highness, I
          do the bidding of Zeus...
          To their astonishment, the emissary is already in the
          Throne Room, behind them. Startled, they turn to see      --    
          Thoth the Quick, Messenger of the Gods, float forward.          

                         THOTH
          ... as do all Gods... and all men.
          Thoth removes his hood, revealing his crystal skull.       

                         THOTH
          (with an edge)
          King Kepheus, as humble messenger
          of Zeus, I've come to talk of
          peace.

                         AMOUN

                         (DEFERENTIAL)
          Thoth the Quick, I am Amoun, the
          King's Magi Strategos. We welcome                          
          you with humility, honored by your                         
          visit from the realm of the Gods.                          
          The King shoots Amoun a look, but he is still shaken by
          Thoth's sudden appearance. Cassiopeia tries to recover
          her composure.

                         KEPHEUS
          I am a reasonable man. Everyone
          wishes for the conflict to cease.                          

                         THOTH
          Zeus above all. He has so long
          desired the tragedy end, he made a                         
          plan that began twenty-five years
          ago.

          Twenty-five years! How is that
          possible?
          Amoun winces at her tone. Thoth sends a scary glance her
          way. Icy --

                         THOTH
          Beauteous Queen, let Thoth limn
          for you the forethought and wisdom
          of Zeus, God of Gods.

          EXT. THE AGORA OF JOPPA - DAY

          The market, now quiet, tries to return to normalcy. But     
          the crowd watches the Basilica, worried by the God's        
          presence.

          INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

          Kepheus and Cassiopeia sit stunned. Amoun watches
          without surprise.

                         KEPHEUS
          A treaty marriage?

                         THOTH
          You have a daughter of age.

                         CASSIOPEIA

                         (GASPS)
          Andromeda!

                         KEPHEUS
          Surely Zeus does not ask a mortal
          father to give his daughter to a
          God.

                         THOTH
          No. Such a union would be
          unclean. Years ago Zeus created a                           
          scion of mixed blood. Half-man,
          half-God. Bred for just this
          union. That is how important Zeus
          considers this truce.

                         CASSIOPEIA                                                  
          Is my only daughter to marry a
          demigod, not of this earth?

                         THOTH
          A prince, of both Olympian and
          Human royalty. A chosen one.

          Zeus has given his son to the
          cause of peace.

                         KEPHEUS
          I have heard of no such demigod.

                         AMOUN
          Majesty, if I may -- the young man
          does exist. He lives in a small
          fishing village on the isle of                         
          Seriphos.
          Kepheus turns, surprised at Amoun's foreknowledge.

                         KEPHEUS
          You knew about this and said
          nothing?

                         (ACCUSATORY)
          Just which king do you serve?

                         AMOUN
          My Queen, I serve only the great
          order of things. I was the boy's
          tutor years ago.

                         KEPHEUS
          How haughty this boy must be, who                      
          knows he is half-God.

                         AMOUN
          He knows nothing and believes
          himself an ordinary man. He has
          never left his village. He can be                      
          overconfident, but it is from                          
          inexperience, not arrogance.                           
          Repheus and Cassiopeia exchange wary looks. Sharply    

                         CASSIOPEIA
          What assurance do we have that our                     
          daughter will be safe?

          You have my word, as Ambassador of
          the Gods.

                         KEPHEUS
          With our daughter's future at
          stake, we do not bestow trust
          easily.

          Amoun reacts, but it is too late -- Thoth has been

                         IRRITATED:
          Suddenly, the WALLS GROAN, compressing with an AWFUL
          SHUDDER. The room TILTS. Kepheus and the Queen grab for
          a solid handhold, frightened.
          The golden marbles on a tabletop roll from their pits and
          pile up in defiance of gravity. Wine goblets tilt toward
          Thoth.

                         THOTH

          Of course... of course your word

          Thoth's demeanor changes. The marbles spill off the          
          table, rolling across the floor to Kepheus' feet. TILT       
          UP TO his intimidated face:

          Where is the lucky young suitor?

          Perfectly blue, sunlight shafting from the surface.                                                            
          A GREAT WHITE SHARK appears, ensnared in a fisherman's       
          net. Panicked, the shark is diving as fast as it can.        
          As the net passes we see --
          ANTEROS, a hapless young fisherman, his legs entangled in    
          the net, desperately trying to hold his breath. When
          they have disappeared, we see a FIGURE appear through the
          blue in pursuit. As he passes, we get our first look

                         AT --
          PERSEUS,                                                    25, wiry, bronzed from the sun, a stubbled jaw,
          a knife in his teeth. He swims with the power and grace
          of a porpoise -- beyond the ability of any normal man.

          EXT. SEA FLOOR - DAY

          The shark thrashes about, jaws snapping close to Anteros.

          Perseus swims INTO VIEW and uses his knife to cut the net
          near the shark's snout. The shark tries to swim through
          the hole, but instead drags the net upwards. Perseus
          hangs on.
          One more slice and the shark zooms out of the net,
          bumping the young hero as it swims away. Perseus pulls
          Anteros toward the surface.

          EXT. FISHING TRAWLER - DAY

          A CREW of FISHERMEN wait desperately at the rail.
          SPYROS, the oldest and toughest, watches in agony.
          Perseus breaks the surface, gasping, his lifeless friend
          in his arms. Five crewmen dive in to help, but Perseus
          is mad with despair. They have to pull him away.
          Spyros watches sadly. But also, relieved to see the one
          survivor.

          EXT. FISHING TRAWLER - DAY

          Spyros makes his way to the bow, where Perseus sits
          alone, downcast, in pain. Spyros watches in silence.
          Then, gruffly --

                         SPYROS
          Your grieving does Anteros no
          good. It comforts only you.

                         PERSEUS
          It's my fault he's gone.

                         SPYROS
          He was careless with the net.
          Perseus gives him a hard look.

                         PERSEUS
          So it's his fault. Not mine, not
          fate, not the Gods?

                         SPYROS

                         (DISDAINFULLY)
          The Gods delude themselves about
          their power and watch in envy
          while we act. We make our own

          die in my arms. I made it back,

          What you do, no other man can do.
          Have you not noticed?

                         PERSEUS
          To what purpose? I failed him.

                         (SCOFFS)
          Purpose! Looking for purpose is
          what ensnares men in the
          superstition of the Gods, as
          surely as your friend was caught
          in that net. And all the
          searching leads down to the same
          place.
          The trawler is approaching its home island, Seriphos.
          Perseus looks off at the rocky coast. Collects himself,

                         QUIETLY --

                         PERSEUS
          You always say that my abilities
          are greater than other men's. But
          they were not enough to save him.

                         SPYROS
          You are still a man, confined by
          man's limits. You are just as
          likely to fail as succeed.

                         PERSEUS
          How is that greater than other
          men?

                         SPYROS
          Ordinary men fail most of the
          time.
          The trawler rounds a point on the island.
          Perseus spies a beautiful girl on the cliff. A closer

                         LOOK --
          A huntress; a pagan leather bandeau hugs her lithe         
          figure. Flowers in her golden hair -- wilted dahlias.      
          Young yet ancient. THE WILTING GIRL.

          She watches Perseus intently as the boat passes. He
          turns to see if Spyros or his friends have seen her, but
          no one has. When he looks back, she's gone.

          Perseus, why are you so sad?
          This breaks his spell. He looks at Tekla warmly, gets up

          Perseus eats with his adoptive family: Spyros, his wife
          MARMARA, and Tekla. Spyros is patient and twinkly with      
          his wife though he disagrees with her beliefs.

                         TEKLA
          I still don't understand.

                         SPYROS
          Your mother can explain. She
          believes everything has an

          make it up.

          Tell me! Why is there war between
          Man and the Gods?
          Marmara and Tekla continue to bring out the food.

                         MARMARA
          At the beginning of time, when Man
          was young, he prayed to the Gods.
          His belief in the Gods gave his
          life meaning. It was a good
          thing.

          Perseus opens the door to the Wilting Girl. Her beauty      
          electrifies him. She glows from within, but her color is    
          oddly faded, washed-out.

          Right now?
          (as she nods)
          It wouldn't take much persuading
          to get me to leave this village,
          but tonight is impossible. My
          family can't wake and find me
          gone. Where do you want me to go?

          Perseus doesn't notice the black widow spider scurry
          between her feet. Then a centipede, a scorpion. Then a
          swarm, racing toward him.
          He feels the first spider and looks down. The creatures
          climb his legs, biting. Weakening from the venom, he
          stumbles back into the table, loses his balance and
          falls.

          A white sail, swollen with wind, draws the small boat
          swiftly across the sea. The Wilting Girl, alone, sits
          quietly at the stern, effortlessly steering.

          We SEE that she is also watching Perseus, who is sleeping
          in a makeshift bed in the bottom of the boat. Her eyes
          slowly travel over his bronzed, muscled frame. There are
          bite marks on his legs and arms, but they seem to be

          Do you think you can manhandle a
          Princess this way?
          (as he kisses her)
          As though she was hungry and needy
          as you, a mere servant?
          Another steamy kiss. In between liplocks, she whispers

                         HOTLY --

                         ANDROMEDA
          very mistaken... a woman of my
          station... never be attracted...
          They go at it again.

          A NIMBLE GIRL hurries past SERVANTS hanging laundry in      
          the atrium.                                                 
          She's PESHET, handmaid to Princessa Andromeda. She has a    
          feline quality -- eyes, grace, agility. She raps on the     
          scullery door.

          Find another... Princess.

          Andromeda! You'll care enough if
          you're caught! Remember last
          time...
          From inside we HEAR complaining, more kissing and
          moaning.

          Andromeda freezes at her mother's voice, stops Agenor,
          finger to her lips.
          He ignores her, starts again. Andromeda does something       
          below the frame that jolts him off. The girl can take        
          care of herself.

          She throws a perturbed glance at the door. Peshet looks

          Perseus can't take his eyes off the Wilting Girl, who            
          steers. She tries not to be self-conscious; she would            
          blush were she not so pale.

          You're looking in the wrong
          direction.

          A breathtaking view of Joppa -- a city in two parts.
          At sea level, tangled hovels, boats, and docks crowd the
          working-class area -- the LOWER WHARF.

          I take no comfort in that, young

          Not even a little, my lord. It's

          snatched also, as you say, from my
          happy springtime...

          at all convinced.

                         KEPHEUS

          Men and Gods not strike you as a
          higher purpose?

                         (TO CASSIOPEIA)
          This is supposed to be the son of
          a God, yet he doubts their
          existence!

                         (TO PERSEUS)
          They exist, young man. But if you
          doubt their power, I join you --

                         KEPHEUS

                         (ANGRY)
          Cassiopeia! We have agreed such
          talk has no place in this palace.

                         CASSIOPEIA

                         PERSEUS
          I can only proceed based on what I                        
          have experienced, not on a faith I
          do not possess.

                         KEPHEUS
          Where does a young person get such
          ideas?

                         PERSEUS
          Perhaps from my adopted father,
          sir. I admire him greatly, and he
          believes in little he cannot hold
          in his hand.

          No, Your Highness, a fisherman.                           

          AMOUN (O.S.)
          I know this mentor who so
          influences young Perseus.
          Amoun has silently entered the chamber. Perseus reacts    
          in amazement.

                         PERSEUS
          Master Amoun!
          He hurries over to the older man, who embraces him
          warmly.

          strong since my departure.                                
          Perseus laughs at his old nickname and holds Amoun at
          arm's length.

                         PERSEUS
          What are you doing here?

          I am honored to serve the King as                         
          an advisor. His Magi Strategos.

                         PERSEUS
          From my village tutor to Magi
          Strategos... What a path!
          The King's patience is exhausted. To Cassiopeia

                         KEPHEUS
          Where is Andromeda? At the least,
          the two should meet before
          tomorrow's ceremony...

                         PERSEUS

                         (FREAKED)
          Tomorrow? Is the wedding so soon?

                         CASSIOPEIA
          The wedding comes later. Tomorrow
          we will have the public
          announcement.

                         AMOUN
          And a celebration of the treaty.
          A Page enters and whispers in Kepheus' ear. Kepheus is    
          irritated.                                                

                         KEPHEUS
          It seems our Andromeda has
          wandered away.
          Cassiopeia reacts, upset.

                         AMOUN
          Perhaps the thought of her new
          life has made her frantic to enjoy
          the vestiges of her old one.

          Perseus, if you're to take the
          wild girl for a wife, this is a
          good time to start your training.
          Go into the city and retrieve her.

                         PERSEUS
          How will I know her?

                         CASSIOPEIA
          She is unmistakable.

                         PERSEUS
          I'm a stranger here. Any hints?

          Follow the lights and the sound of
          profane music.

          EXT. BASILICA - SIDE ENTRANCE - MAGIC HOUR

          The Wilting Girl slips into the dusk like a thief.          

          EXT. ALLEYWAY - MAGIC HOUR

          The Wilting Girl steals down the dark, narrow alley,        
          headed toward the outskirts of town.
          Suddenly, a heavy wall shoots up from the cobblestones,     
          blocking her way. She startles, but does not stop. She
          goes up to the wall, turns at an angle and slides right
          through the stone, like a ghost.
          On the other side, she emerges from the stone, breathing    
          hard. She looks around and hurries down an intersecting
          passageway.
          She's gone only a few steps, when just ahead of her,        
          thick vines shoot out and form a dense barrier. She
          takes a breath and dives into the surging growth.
          She almost makes it through, but at the last moment,        
          vines wrap her arms and legs, holding her prisoner. She
          gives up, with a sigh. We HEAR the LAUGHTER of a God.

                         WILTING GIRL
          Zeus?
          Zeus' rumbling voice is held low, talking to her in an
          intimate way -- a beautiful sound.

          Why do we have to play these
          games, my lovely girl? You know
          you cannot leave.
          The vines retract, freeing her. She rubs where they
          gripped her.

                         WILTING GIRL
          My part is finished.

          ZEUS                                                        (V.0.)
          It has just begun. Have you
          forgotten your place in this?

                         WILTING GIRL
          As I've lost my believers, the

          I still believe in you. Close
          your eyes and see your tomorrow.
          She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. A single
          tear runs along her cheek. She opens her eyes.

                         WILTING GIRL
          It's too painful. I can't involve
          myself.

          You you already involved. Such is                                     
          fate. We cannot hide from the
          .trials of our future... no matter
          how dark the alleyway.
          She looks back at the Basilica with profound sadness.

          EXT. STREETS OF JOPPA - MAGIC HOUR

          Perseus roams, taking in the city with interest. Rich        
          and poor mix in the crowded streets. As always, the poor     
          have suffered the most from the conflict.                    

          EXT. OCEAN TERRACE - MAGIC HOUR

          Perseus follows the MUSIC and the sound of LAUGHTER to a
          crowded terrace overlooking the sea. Upper class YOUNG
          PEOPLE are partying en masse.
          Perseus moves through the revelry, looking at every girl,    
          testing his instincts. Suddenly, he stops in his tracks,     
          looking off --

          Andromeda is dancing at the center of attention, her
          sheer gown enhancing her sensuality. The MUSIC ends.
          Andromeda laughs and tosses her curly mane.
          A HANDSOME YOUNG NOBLEMAN embraces her. She gives him a
          deep kiss, causing a sensation, then breaks away into the
          crush.

          EXT. BALUSTRADE - MAGIC HOUR

          Andromeda glides to the balustrade to watch the sunset.
          The Young Nobleman approaches, but her imperious gesture
          stops him cold.

          Very beautiful.
          Andromeda spins, petulant.

          Will you please give me some

                         PEACE --
          The sight of the handsome stranger gives her pause.

                         ANDROMEDA
          What did you say?

                         PERSEUS
          I said, 'Very beautiful.'

          intimate judgements on the royal
          family?

          I meant the sunset.
          She regards Perseus over her glistening bare shoulder.       

                         ANDROMEDA
          Do you always start a seduction
          with an insult?
          Perseus moves to the rail, very close to her, and looks
          at the sea.

                         PERSEUS
          I know nothing of seduction. I'm
          a simple fisherman. My home is
          across that water.

          I've come to see my future wife.
          Startled, Andromeda suddenly realizes who he is. A mad
          mix of emotions crosses her face.

          EXT. GARDENS OF THE BASILICA - NIGHT

          Perseus and Andromeda walk in moonlit gardens. She stays
          close, attracted to him.

                         ANDROMEDA
          It's not personal. You're not a
          bad-looking boy.
          (as Perseus laughs)
          I'm too young. I don't want to be
          married.

                         PERSEUS
          Me either.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Then why are you doing it?

                         PERSEUS
          No one asked me. And now that
          I've met you, I don't know if I
          can go through with it.
          (off her look)                                              
          It's not personal. Seeing you
          makes it real. I think a man
          should make his own decisions. I
          won't be the pawn of a King or a                            
          God.
          She looks at him with new interest.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Since we agree, it's settled. No                            
          marriage.

          Ignoring that, she takes his arm, moving even closer.

          That doesn't mean we can't be
          friends. Get to know each other.
          I want to show you something.
          She leads him into a tall, hedged garden maze.

          EXT. THE BASILICA - GARDEN MAZE - NIGHT

          Beautiful in the moonlight. She hurries him quickly         
          around one turn, then another, and another. He laughs at
          her excitement.

                         PERSEUS
          I'm already lost.

          I'll take care of you.
          They take two more jogs and find themselves in an odd
          sylvan chamber. Soft plants have been stacked in what
          could be mistaken for a bed.

                         ANDROMEDA
          This is my special place. No one
          can see or hear or even find us
          now.

          without your aid.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Do you want to?
          When he turns back to her, she melts into his arms and
          gives him a long deep kiss. He's surprised, but handles
          it well. When she tries to continue, he slows things
          down, holding her at bay.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Do you not find me attractive?

                         PERSEUS
          One of the most beautiful women
          I've ever seen.

          like you.

          find we're not compatible.

                         PERSEUS
          What if we find we're very compat--
          She stops him with another kiss. He starts to surrender
          to his desire, but again, he stops. Her voice is a low

          It seems what everyone wants to

          Her face is inches from his. She looks into his eyes.

          (as Perseus laughs)
          But let's find out for sure...
          She kisses him yet again, pulling him toward the bed of    
          foliage. He can no longer resist. Together they fall
          into the softness. He kisses her passionately as their
          bodies begin to move together. She breaks the kiss for
          only a moment, her voice husky --

          Perseus, in a white tunic and polished ceremonial armor,
          moves through the crowd of REVELERS. The grandiose room
          is hemmed by columns and statues. The royal family sits
          on the dais. Andromeda motions Perseus up beside her.

          You're late.

          the dais with a cup of wine, not her first.

          I won't be long-winded. You all
          know I am a modest person, no
          matter my rank.
          Some of the crowd react silently. Andromeda watches her
          mother with trepidation, but not as much as Kepheus,
          watching from his throne.

          Mild confusion in the hall, concern from the Royal

          Her subjects agree loudly. Andromeda wishes this would

          This is my will, Joppa.
          Desolation or sacrifice. Choose
          your penance. You can thank
          your...

          . sickly, aged Queen.
          Clouds of black sea ink swirl and swallow Tiamat, then
          implode. Tiamat is gone. Cassiopeia, palsied and
          withered, collapses. Kepheus and Royal Aides rush to
          her.

          EXT. OCEAN FLOOR - NIGHT

          An immense school of fish is SUDDENLY SPOOKED. An EERIE
          GLOW swells in the gloom -- Tiamat glides TOWARD us,        
          stops and raises her palm. The silt SWIRLS and RIPPLES.
          A VAST PRIMORDIAL SHAPE SLOWLY RISES in clouds of ocean     
          mud. It's impossible to see what this creature looks        
          like, but it is big. We hear a deafening ROAR, which        
          drives a SHOCKWAVE across the silt.                         

          EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - NIGHT

          The sea bulges and a TSUNAMI rolls toward the shores of     
          Joppa.

          EXT. JOPPA'S LOWER WHARF - NIGHT                            

          Dark docks and shanties under the cliffs, populace
          asleep.
          A lone FISHERMAN unloads nets from his boat. Suddenly,      
          the water under his boat is sucked out to sea. A deep       
          RUMBLE shakes the ground.                                   
          The fisherman is mesmerized as the horizon CLIMBS higher    
          and higher, a WALL OF WATER. In seconds, the colossal       
          wave breaks and falls, obliterating the boat, the docks     
          and the low-lying shanties.                                 

          INT. ROYAL CHAMBERS - NIGHT

          Cassiopeia lies blank and wan. A LOW DRONE grows.           
          Kepheus rushes to the window. And then, a deep, EARTH-      
          SHATTERING BELLOW from the creature. The room SHUDDERS.

          INT. BASILICA - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

          A figure passes by a window in silhouette -- Andromeda
          steals through the shadows toward the Throne Room.

          INT. BALCONY ABOVE THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

          Andromeda edges into position to see the room below.

          AMOUN (O.S.)
          . Leviathan -- First dweller of
          the deep. Hewn by Tiamat from the
          dark blood of the earth...

                         HER POV
          A council of VICEROYS and MINISTERS gathered before
          Kepheus, who seems lost in thought, head down. Perseus    
          stands off to the side.

          INT. THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

          Amoun reads from a scroll.                                

                         AMOUN

          but shadows of Leviathan the
          Kraken -- colossal, rapacious, and                        
          nigh indestructible.
          The men turn to Kepheus; when he raises his face, he      
          looks exhausted.                                          

                         KEPHEUS
          My Queen lies near death. Am I                            
          now to choose between the survival
          of our state... and the life of                           
          Andromeda, my only child?                                 
          Amoun watches Perseus, at the fringe of the group,
          expectantly. But Perseus looks only perplexed, an
          observer.

          Again, Amoun looks to Perseus.                  

           MINISTER OF DEFENSE

          Amoun alone takes notice: he spins toward Perseus, with

          The ministers are puzzled by Amoun's persistence.         
          Perseus, uncertainly --

          I know that I am young and have
          not seen much of the world, but it
          seems to me that nothing is
          indestructible.
          The Ministers react to the young man's arrogance.

          I am far from young and have seen
          much of the world... and I agree
          with my son.
          Everyone turns to the new arrival: Perseus' adoptive               
          father, Spyros. Perseus goes to embrace him.

          Father, how did you find me?

                         KEPHEUS
          I thought this boy's father was a
          God. How does a stranger walk
          unmolested into the Throne Room of
          the King?

                         AMOUN
          I sent for him, Lord. This good                           
          man raised Perseus from infancy.                          
          He will help him now.

          He will help me destroy Leviathan.
          Spyros does a double-take, then swallows: "Yeah, okay,

                         IDENTIFIES THEM:                                             
          First, two fearsome Mongols, MONGKE and TAMBURLANE.

          AMOUN (V.0.)
          Our guides will be Mongke and
          Tamburlane, father and son monster
          hunters from the Kingdom of the
          Iron Horde.
          Next, THE PRAETORIAN GUARD, commanded by a square-jawed    
          old soldier, DRACO. His men, in heavy armor: KOSMO,        
          Draco's lieutenant, and the soldiers ABAS, ICOS, THAD,     
          BOREAS, KRIKOR, and POLLUC.

          AMOUN (V.0.)
          Our escort will be a detachment of                         
          the Praetorian Guard, led by                               
          Commander Draco -- the staunchest                          
          security force in Joppa.                                   
          Next, on a stunning pale horse, a pale rider -- the        
          Wilting Girl.

          PERSEUS                                                   (V.0.)
          Why do we bring the Earth Goddess                          
          into this danger?                                          

          AMOUN (V.0.)
          I thank the stars we have her.                             
          Besides, she takes her orders from
          an authority much greater than I.
          Next, Spyros; horseback riding is not one of his many      
          skills. Behind him, Perseus and Amoun ride talking --      

                         PERSEUS
          Amoun, it seems an odd coincidence
          you came into my life as tutor, so
          long ago, and now, once again you
          instruct me.

                         AMOUN

                         (LAUGHS)
          No matter what you believe,
          Porpoise, some things are fated.
          I've been looking forward to this
          journey for a long, long time.
          He spurs his horse, riding ahead. Spyros drops back
          beside Perseus.

                         SPYROS
          Who would have thought we'd be on
          a journey like this? Two simple
          fishermen.

          I'm afraid I've dragged you into
          real danger, Father, when I have
          little idea of what I'm doing.

                         SPYROS
          Living at the mercy of the sea so
          long has convinced me some
          adventures are unexpected and some
          dangers unavoidable. It's all in
          your attitude.

                         PERSEUS
          What's our attitude about                                   
          destroying Leviathan?

                       SPYROS
          The Kraken is just another big                              
          fish.

          Tiamat's Palace-Galleon is bigger than anything man can
          construct. Tiamat is at the prow of the vessel, using
          all her godly power to STIR THE ELEMENTS. With great
          effort, she sends a hurricane down on Joppa.
          Set the Void approaches the prow.

          The demigod and his retinue are
          joined. They march for the
          counsel of the Norn Sisters, to
          seek the frailty of my Leviathan.

          INT. THE BASILICA - ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

          Tiamat's storm is pounding Joppa. LIGHTNING stabs          
          through the dark clouds. RAIN POUNDS the tiles outside
          Andromeda's lavish bedroom.
          Peshet glides to Andromeda, who's wide awake, red-eyed,    
          distressed.

          Princessat You must take care of
          yourself.
          A CRACK OF THUNDER. Andromeda looks over at her,           
          thinking.

          My father was ready to sacrifice
          me to the monster.

                         PESHET
          I'm sure that is not so.

                         ANDROMEDA
          I saw it. I heard the words. My                            
          loving father, his beloved child.                          
          Only Perseus stayed his decision.

                         (TEARS COME)
          And do you know the worst part,
          Peshet? He was right.
          Peshet's feline eyes widen. More LIGHTNING.

          The city is besieged, the people

          The palace shakes with the ROLLING THUNDER.                 

          EXT. THE VIA DAHLIA - NIGHT

          The sound of that same DISTANT THUNDER as the Expedition
          follows the road. To the south behind them, LIGHTNING                   
          FLASHES over faraway Joppa.

          Perseus and the Wilting Girl ride side by side. Perseus                 
          looks back at the distant storm.

                         PERSEUS

          Since we're naming you on this
          road, what about 'Via Dahlia'?
          She gives him a sharp look. Is he mocking her? He's
          defensive.

          That's a pretty name. Wait,
          better yet -- 'Vidalia'? How's
          that... 'Vidalia'? That's more
          than pretty, beautiful really,
          just as you are.
          She is pleased, self-conscious, concentrating on the road

          They've camped for the night in a clearing. A fire

                         (DOESN'T MOVE)
          . but they say I am not really a
          man.
          Vidalia surfaces and drifts on her back, looking sadly       
          into the sky.
          Perseus fixates on the sadness in her eyes. His
          expression changes, and the tenor of this stolen vigil is
          altered.
          RAINDROPS fall as the SKY OPENS and a CLOUDBURST pelts
          the pool. Vidalia opens her lips to taste the rain and
          smiles. LIGHTNING.

                         CONTINUED:
          Perseus' HEART POUNDS in his ears as he watches. KRA-
          KOOM! The ROLLING THUNDER hits exactly on his
          heartbeat -- BOOM, BOOM, BOOM!
          Vidalia instantly knows he is nearby. She looks around
          quickly and huddles in the water.
          Perseus retreats. After a few yards, he stops, face         
          flushed with the awareness of a whole new dilemma.

          EXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE VIA DAHLIA WOODS - NIGHT

           Abas uses his sword to HACK at dried wood. He bends to      
           pick up a branch when he HEARS the CRACK of wood. He        
           whirls, sword at ready. But there is nothing there.         
           Embarrassed, he picks up the firewood. Now he HEARS
           something unidentifiable -- is that BREATHING? Spooked,
           he turns to head back to camp --
           A DARK FIGURE is standing behind him, larger than a man,    
           grotesquely misshapen. Abas raises his sword, but a         
           twisted PAW swats it away with a ROAR. Abas tries to        
           raise the sword again and realizes his arm is gone. He      
           looks up in horror as the Creature envelops him --          

          -- KALIBOS!

           Only a few streaks of sunlight penetrate the canopy of      
          tall cedars.                                               

           SUPERIMPOSE: THE CEDAR FOREST OF THE ILLYRIAN BORDER...
           24 DAYS REMAINING

           Here slumbers an enormous hybrid creature with human        
           features and a leathery, scaled hide -- HUMBABA.            
          Suddenly, Set the Void appears. The evil God strokes the    
          sleeping monster's head, then reaches inside Humbaba's      
          skull. The animal goes stiff; its leg twitches.

                         SET
          Hear me, my pet. Let my
          instructions be seared to your
          primal mind as natural law.

                        L
          The monster's eyes shoot open; its pupils shrink to
          pinpoints.

          You are starving. Your gut says
          you'll soon perish. No earthly

          EXT. CEDAR FOREST ROAD - DAY

          Nearby, the Expedition (minus Abas) rests. Not here:
          Perseus, Draco, Icos, and Boreas.

          EXT. CEDAR FOREST CLEARING - DAY

          A herd of winged horses, PEGASSI, graze.
          Draco, Boreas, Icos and Perseus  -- thrilled -- hide in a
          thicket.

                         DRACO
          Pegassi, stallions of the Gods.

                         ICOS
          Perseus. How long do you think
          you could stay on one of those?
          Icos and Boreas exchange a sly look.        

                         BOREAS
          Don't goad the boy, Icos. No Man
          can ride a Pegasus.

                         ICOS
          Did not Bellerophon tame the Great
          White Pegasus?

                         BOREAS
          You're right. But he was a                  
          demigod...

          Then this will be a good way to
          find out just what I am.

                         DRACO
          Stop it, rogues. One of our own
          has disappeared without a trace
          and all you can think is to cause
          mischief. What if Perseus is
          bucked to his death from a
          thousand feet up?

          Don't worry, Commander, the boy
          won't even get on its back.
          With a "watch this" grin, Perseus rises. Draco pulls him     
          back down.                                                   

                         DRACO
          Don't do this. If we go back to
          camp right now, we can avoid
          trouble and keep our goal in
          sight. A true leader will not be
          distracted.

                         PERSEUS
          I'm not the leader, Draco, Amoun
          is. I'm too young to start
          avoiding trouble.
          Perseus jumps up and approaches a roan Pegasus, speaking     
          soothingly. It WHINNIES and threshes its wings,              
          buffeting Perseus with gusts.
          The Pegasus rears up, and leaps over Perseus' head. It       
          lands behind him, bucks its hind legs, and kicks Perseus     
          face-first into the dirt.
          Icos and Boreas are laughing, but when Draco gives them a
          dark look, Boreas jumps up, sobered, and heads into the
          clearing.

                         BOREAS
          I'll collect him right now,
          Commander.
          Suddenly, Humbaba erupts from the thicket with a HOWL.       
          The Pegassi take flight, but the Humbaba grabs one and       
          swallows it whole. Humbaba turns and SNIFFS the air,         
          homing in on Perseus.                                        

                         DRACO
          Perseus, get out of there! Icos,                             
          fetch the others.                                            
          Icos bolts. Draco and Boreas leap into the clearing with     
          swords drawn to draw the monster's attention. Perseus        
          does the same.                                               

                         DRACO

          Hearing the ROARS, the Expedition is already up. Icos       
          arrives.

          Mongke and Tamburlane fly into the woods; the others        
          follow.

          EXT. CEDAR FOREST CLEARING - DAY

          The reinforcements arrive to see Humbaba pin Boreas with    
          its talons.

          Boreas!
          Draco hacks at the monster's leg, to no avail. it rips      
          off Boreas' head and swallows his body.                     
          Perseus CRIES OUT and leaps at the creature, sword          
          swinging.                                                   

                         AMOUN                                                       
          No, Perseus!

          Get back!                                                   
          Vidalia spins her shepherd's sling to pitch lead sling-
          bullets. Spyros leaps between Perseus and the monster
          and thrusts his weapon -- a VICIOUS-LOOKING HARPOON/BOAT

          HOOK.
          Tamburlane hoists an ancient BAZOOKA. Mongke lights the     
          fuse and backs away. KA-BOOM! The weapon belches fire       
          and metal.                                                  
          The Humbaba staggers from the shot, but lunges and          
          swallows Mongke whole. Spyros sinks his harpoon in one      
          leg, but has it ripped from his hands.                      

                         VIDALIA
          A delusion is planted in its mind.
          It thinks it's starving and it
          wants to feed on --

                         CONTINUED:
          The Humbaba's eyes bulge with surprise as a saber pierces    
          its nose. From inside, Mongke pries open the beast's
          mouth with his saber.

                         VIDALIA
          I can't reverse the powerful
          curse. But if the monster's
          hungry, I can feed it.
          Vidalia raises her arms and shuts her eyes. A cyclone of
          CAWING RAVENS descends from the sky and dives straight       
          into the monster's mouth. As the Humbaba tries to shake      
          them away, Mongke is thrown clear.                           

                         VIDALIA

                         (TO DRACO)
          Now! The belly! Slash the belly!
          Draco moves to do that when Perseus leaps forward, lunges
          and sweeps his blade up Humbaba's belly at the same
          moment Draco sweeps down. The two blades barely miss
          each other, opening a huge X in the belly. The others
          are shocked and impressed by Perseus. Steaming purple
          entrails spill over Perseus and Draco. HUMBABA CRASHES

          TO THE GROUND.
          The flock of ravens, liberated from Humbaba's gut, shake
          the viscera from their feathers and take flight.

          EXT. THE CEDAR FOREST - STREAM - DAY

          Perseus, somber, washes the creature's guts from his arms
          and legs. He turns to find Vidalia standing above him,
          furious.

          Vidalia's eyes narrow, enraged.

          Yes, a tyrannical Goddess, who

          A CADRE of REVOLUTIONARIES led by Fantasos is gathered.
          Agenor, the handsome scullion who made love to Andromeda,
          leads Peshet in from the rain. She is frightened; Agenor
          has misled her.

          Just listen to this good man. He

          Revolutionary leader, exhorts the mob, surrounded by         
          BODYGUARDS, including Agenor. As before, Fantasos seems

          cloistered above the flood... on
          the high ground, with the high-
          born -- the privileged gentry!...
          The angry crowd responds, fists shaking. Peshet moves
          through the throng, desperately looking for Andromeda.
          She passes close to the rostrum and Fantasos registers
          her presence.

          still, the Kraken comes! Does the
          King build his defenses at the
          water's edge?
          "NO!" cries the crowd. Peshet is shocked to find herself
          replying with them -- "NO1" Fantasos motions for Agenor
          to continue the harangue, while Fantasos hurries off the
          stage.

                         AGENOR
          No! He makes his stand at his
          daughter's chamber door!... We
          will show Kepheus we're not
          sacrificial fodder. We will
          tremble the walls of his Basilica!
          RABID SUPPORT from the mob. Peshet stops suddenly,

          from the anonymity of a hooded cloak, terrified.

          Andromeda is the one Tiamat wants!
          We die so she may live...

          Peshet rounds a corner, frustrated. Andromeda is gone.     
          A hand grabs Peshet's shoulder, startling her. It is       
          Fantasos.

          One night soon, a gong will sound
          three times. When you hear it,
          unlock the back gate of the

          . and bring the Princess out.
          My men will take her to Leviathan.

          Everyone is standing perfectly still.                       
          DARK FIGURES surround them. The transformed Cleon Legion    
          lurches INTO VIEW. The only resemblance to the soldiers     
          they were is their armor.. Now they're monstrous

          Perseus stands by Vidalia, watching the monsters.

          Thad, Krikor and Perseus are the first there. Amoun
          tosses an arc of the black sand around them all. The
          ring of sand transforms into a dense, swirling swarm of     
          insects. Amoun shouts to the others, still fighting.

                         AMOUN
          Come on! You can pass through!
          Draco bolts for the barrier. A Lotophagi spears Kosmo,      
          killing him. Draco slides inside the swarm. He looks        
          back at Kosmo in horror.
          Polluc slashes zombies and runs toward the swarm. He's      
          almost there when one of the Lotophagi lands on him,        
          sinking fangs into his skull. Polluc sticks his sword
          into the creature; they both fall over dead. Icos and
          Spyros fight their way to the swarm and jump inside.
          Mongke and Tamburlane kill a Lotus-eater and leap over
          the corpse into the protected circle.                       
          The tide of HOWLING and SHRIEKING Lotophagi claw at the

          Only humans...
          He looks over the Lotophagi and sees Vidalia out there,
          alone, flinging sling-bullets as she fights her way
          toward the barrier.

          At that moment, Kalibos grabs Vidalia and drags her to
          the top of an outcrop. At the top, he turns, LOOKS
          DIRECTLY AT PERSEUS and HOWLS, his message clear: "If
          you want to save her, come and get her." He hungrily
          rips her leather bandeau. Perseus turns to Amoun.

          On the boulder, Kalibos grabs Vidalia's white flesh.         
          Perseus is anguished; he knows he's in love.

                         PERSEUS
          Get ready to defend yourselves!
          Perseus runs, plants a foot on Thad's back and leaps out
          through the swarm, which immediately dissipates around
          the humans. They have only a moment to react as the
          stunned Lotophagi come to their senses.

                         DRACO
          Let's kill these freks!
          Perseus runs over the backs of the Lotophagi. Hurtling
          off them, he scrambles up and knocks Kalibos off Vidalia.
          Ralibos rolls, flips onto his feet and gives Perseus a
          look: "You're the one that I want."
          They face off, looking for an opening. Perseus lunges,
          thrusting his sword. Kalibos dodges, springing up the
          rocks and then down toward Perseus, acrobatic as an ape.
          Perseus rolls out of the way.
          Perseus sweeps his sword at Kalibos' head. The monster       
          catches the blade in his jaws and SNAPS IT IN TWO!           
          Bloody spittle flies from his tongue.                        
          Kalibos pounces, pins Perseus. He opens his jaw and
          sinks his teeth into Perseus' shoulder. Vidalia cracks a
          rock into Kalibos' head. The creature whirls on Vidalia
          and careens toward her, head bloody.
          Perseus leaps in the air and catches Kalibos in the back     
          with both feet, knocking him over the edge.

          Kalibos slams down on the jagged boulders and ricochets
          off, pinwheeling through the air. The grotesque figure
          hits the lower rocks head-first and his neck CRUNCHES.
          He slams into the dust, dead.
          Perseus lands on his back, weak from the bite. When he       
          tries to rise, his legs are rubbery. Vidalia catches him
          as he falls forward and lowers him gently, looking at the
          bloody puncture wounds.

          Draco, Spyros, Amoun and the others hack away, fending
          off the Lotophagi. Outnumbered, they won't last long.
          The earth VIBRATES. The Lotophagi are distracted,
          looking around nervously.
          Over a rise stampede SCORPIOCHS, rhino-sized scorpions.      
          Riding them, DJINN RAIDERS, flowing black silk masking       
          all but their blue eyes.                                     
          They lay into the Lotophagi. The Scorpiochs skewer the
          beasts with HUGE PINCERS. The Djinn use flashing             
          SCIMITARS to cut them down.

          the cliff where Kalibos fell. She is mystified by what       

                         SHE SEES:                                                    
          The deformed monster Kalibos is gone. In his place, neck     
          broken, lies a handsome, aging noble, finally at peace --    
          King Acrisius.

          EXT. SIROQUE MOUNTAINS - DJINN CARAVAN - NIGHT

          A STRING OF LIGHTS, each a lantern hanging from a
          Scorpioch's tail. The Expedition members ride on the
          Scorpioch with the Djinn. Some of the huge scorpions
          carry small box/rooms (palanquins) on their backs.

          INT. PALANQUIN - NIGHT

          Perseus lies sprawled on cushions, unconscious. Vidalia                                    
          replaces the dressing on his bite wound. Knowing he                                        
          cannot hear her --

                         VIDALIA
          To save me, you risked everything
          -- your mission, your friends...
          the fate of multitudes. Men need
          better judgment in the one who is
          meant to lead them...                                       
          No longer able to lecture, she regards him with love.       

                         TENDERLY --                                                 

                         VIDALIA
          You shouldn't have risked your
          life for me. It is a waste to                               
          save me when I'll be gone so soon.
          She strokes his hair and kisses his forehead.               

                         VIDALIA
          Thank you for your reckless
          disregard. Thank you, Perseus...
          Vidalia holds her palm above the floor and mutters a
          quick incantation. A small shoot APPEARS and SPROUTS FAT    
          PODS. Vidalia squeezes the salve from a pod and covers      
          Perseus' wound.                                             
          The wound bulges, then squirms deeper into Perseus.         
          Perseus shoots up, clutching his chest. Vidalia gently      
          lays him down.                                              
          Perseus gags. A VIPER WRIGGLES from his throat and          
          slithers away with the fat lump of infection in its         
          stomach.                                                    

                         VIDALIA
          The poison is gone now.

          interest in you.

          EXT. CLEON LEGION BIVOUAC - DAY                             

          Surviving Lotophagi chew on the bones of the fallen. One
          reaches hungrily for an Alkali Lotus in the sand, but
          suddenly the petals blacken and curl. The creature,
          spooked, sniffs the air.
          All at once, the Lotophagi age years in seconds and keel
          over, dead. The cause: Set the Void glides over,
          surveying the battlefield.

          EXT. VILLAGES IN SKOLOTHIA - DAY                                 

          The Expedition rides through a war-ravaged village of            
          stucco and thatch. DOORS and SHUTTERS CREAK shut as they         
          pass, UNSEEN INHABITANTS skitter about.

          The Skolothians have suffered more
          than their share in this war. The
          Legions of the Gods have battered
          them.

                         SPYROS
          It's no wonder they shy away from
          all strangers.
          Perseus looks ahead, where the Expedition is parting        
          company with the Djinn Raiders. only one of the Djinn is    
          staying -- SHAIKH SULEIMAN, a veiled priest.

          they saved us.

          The Expedition climbs through rugged country. At a turn,
          Amoun looks up. Dead ahead, wreathed in fog -- sheer
          granite pinnacles, one towering above the others.

          Tell me of them.

                         AMOUN
          They're witches in the form of
          Strix. Not a pleasant sight, a                              
          Strix. They have powerful magic                             
          and dreadful habits. Baby-eaters,
          among other things.
          (off Perseus' shock)
          But they owe me a favor. When the
          war broke out, they lent their
          power to men against the Gods in                            
          exchange for infant sacrifice.
          Tiamat struck them blind for their
          treachery. When they came for                               
          help, I fashioned them an
          artificial eye, for their Second                            
          Sight.

                         PERSEUS

          Yes. They have to take turns. If

          The Expedition sleeps in a drizzle.              
          WHISPERS. Shaikh Suleiman moves toward Perseus. The
          WHISPERING comes from behind his veil. He pulls a
          GLEAMING BRONZE SICKLE from his cloak. The priest, blade
          poised, stands over the sleeping Perseus.
          OUT OF THE DARKNESS runs Spyros, his harpoon raised for a
          strike.

                         SPYROS
          Stay away from my boy!
          Without touching him, the Shaikh throws the fisherman        
          over his head, where he lands hard with an "UMPH!"           
          Perseus jolts awake. He reaches for his sword, but has       
          none. Spyros struggles to his feet to start another          
          charge.
          Suleiman raises his hand and freezes Spyros in his           
          position. The Shaikh's veil has fallen, revealing his        
          frightening countenance: scaled skin of charred wood;        
          eyes like slots in a furnace. Perseus listens to the         

          WHISPERING.

                         PERSEUS
          Spyros, he means me no harm.                                 
          The Shaikh lowers his hand: Spyros falls into the dirt.
          The Shaikh pulls his veil over his face. He kneels
          before Perseus, head bowed.

                         PERSEUS
          I hear you and I understand you.
          But I don't know how.

          The Shaikh proffers the gleaming bronze sickle which has
          a zig-zag, LIGHTNING BOLT PATTERN engraved on the blade,
          honoring Zeus.

                         PERSEUS
          An offering'? I thank you and
          take it humbly, as agift from a
          friend, not an offering.
          He takes the weapon and bows his head, surprising the
          Shaikh.

          mysterious stranger.

          In a morning fog, the Expedition enters a circle of FREE-
          STANDING MONOLITHS white with bird crap. All around:
          regurgitated food, shredded garments and tiny human baby
          bones.
          A FLAP of WINGS and suddenly perched atop the stones are                
          the NORN SISTERS: URD, VERDANDI, and SKULD -- human-                    
          sized owls with the gray faces of old crones                (Strix).    
          Each has one central EYE SOCKET; they share one              
          ARTIFICIAL ORB. The Strix toss the Eye between them and      
          pop it in to study the arrivals.

          You've wasted a journey. I trust
          it was not a taxing one.
          The Sisters CACKLE HORRIBLY. Skuld SWOOSHES down. Icos
          and Krikor, terrified, hit the deck. Skuld tosses the
          Eye back to Urd. Perseus watches with growing
          irritation.

          There's something wrong with that

          here.

          Let me take a look.
          Verdandi tosses the Eye to Skuld. Perseus leaps and          
          snags the Eye out of mid-air. The Strix SCREECH.             
          Perseus goes to the precipice.

          A round edge catches his eye. He pulls it free -- A

          Leviathan. IT GOES RIGHT PAST THEM, miraculously leaving
          the fleet untouched.
          But then -- they HEAR a sound BIGGER than the typhoon.
          The dark sky gets darker as an ENORMOUS BLACK SHAPE
          appears behind the Fleet, bearing down on them at
          impossible speed --
          TIAMAT'S PALACE-GALLEON so dwarfs the Fleet that it PLOWS

          rare beauty as to tempt even the

          twist and snap and become a slithering tail. Snake heads

          EXT. THE TETHYS SEA - DAY

          The prow of the galley cuts through ice. Rows of oars
          slice the frigid water, pulling the boat through at a
          steady clip.

          INT. GALLEY - BELOW DECK - DAY

          Dark, hot and loud: PIPES, STEAM, GEARS and PISTONS.
          CHARON, a grizzled old sea captain, shovels coal and
          slams the furnace closed. He walks past his "crew"          --
          MECHANICAL OARSMEN of tarnished brass, rowing tirelessly.
          Charon dons furs, then climbs up to --

          EXT. GALLEY - UPPER DECK - DAY

          -- an icy, slick deck, snow. The Expedition huddle
          around stoves, miserable. We HEAR the OARS BEAT, the
          HULL GROAN, the ICE CRACKING. Charon CHORTLES, his VOICE
          deeper than the sea --

                         CHARON
          Better stoke those fires, boys,
          it's going to get cold soon.

          INT. HOLD - DAY

          In a small space among the stores, Vidalia circles
          Perseus, whose eyes are shut. Suddenly, she sweeps his
          legs out. He lands hard.

                         VIDALIA
          She's got a tail and she'll use it
          just like that.
          Perseus opens his eyes.

                         VIDALIA
          Keep your eyes shut! Open them
          with Medusa and it will be your
          last look.

                         PERSEUS

                         (CLOSES EYES)
          You're enjoying this too much.

          He can't see her smile. Or that she regards him with
          something hotter than amusement. She tries to punch him,
          but he blocks it.

                         VIDALIA
          Good!
          Pleased, he doesn't sense her right cross, which knocks     
          him down.

          Do you think the Gorgon will hit
          once and then surrender her head?
          He gets up, eyes closed, and resumes the defensive
          position, turning as she moves around him.                  

                         VIDALIA
          Listen... you will hear her
          muscles coil. Feel her hunger in                            
          your gut. Ask, how will she feed                            
          it?

          I wish it, but I can't perceive
          the world that way.

                         VIDALIA
          You can. You're the son of a God.

          me of that.

          You do not see yourself clearly                             
          yet. In time, your actions in                               
          crisis will sharpen your view.                              
          Her faith touches him deeply. She resumes the lesson:

          You can do those things, Perseus,                           
          and much more.

          Surprisingly, he lands on his feet, and immediately

          SLOW MOTION as Perseus dives forward and cradles her
          gently as they both fall to the floor. A move beyond
          human. She looks up at his closed eyes, worried. Their
          lips are inches apart. REGULAR SPEED --

          She kisses him, deeply. He returns it. Suddenly, she        
          rolls free and stands up, turning away from him.            

                         PERSEUS
          Wait...
          She is already climbing the ladder. She stops for only a

          Spyros is at the rail, looking over the ocean of ice.       
          Perseus, troubled, arrives. Spyros looks at him closely.    

                         PERSEUS
          What?

                         SPYROS
          Nothing.

          Perseus, Spyros, and Draco split off toward the temple.     
          Suddenly, the two "statues," Nessus and Ixion, shake off
          their dusty skins and COME TO LIFE. They GALLOP down the
          ridge, hooves shaking the ground. They raise fearsome
          spiky maces of jagged iron.
          Vidalia readies her sling. The Shaikh draws his

          CRIES OUT for his friend and charges in. Ixion smashes

          Thad, enraged, races at Nessus, but the Centaur dodges

          Tamburlane rolls under the beast and fires his weapon.

          Nessus' mace shatters Shaikh Suleiman's head of charred     
          wood. BLUE FIRE shoots out his neck, ENVELOPING THE         
          CENTAUR. The burning Centaur crumples, dead.

          In the subterranean temple, we HEAR Ixion landing above;    
          dust rains into the cavern. SUNLIGHT angles through

          The men can't see it, but one wall suddenly frames a
          silhouette of MEDUSA: HAIR OF HISSING SNAKES atop a
          woman's torso, the body of a mammoth reptile.
          WE SEE only GLIMPSES of Medusa as she slides through the
          shadows. Her forked tongue tastes the air.
          CUTTING BETWEEN Spyros, Perseus and Draco, moving
          silently on opposite sides of the sanctuary.
          OUR VIEW of Draco is suddenly BLOCKED by Medusa -- she      
          coils around Draco without touching him. He HEARS the       
          RASP of SCALES ON STONE.

          the tail before him. Unthinking, he instinctively spins               
          and looks.
          Medusa's face is inches from Draco's. His muscles lock                
          and his flesh hardens to scabrous stone, emanating SMOKY              
          GAS. Medusa breathes in the vapors ecstatically.                      
          AT THAT MOMENT a hole blasts through the roof of the                  
          cavern as Ixion crashes down in a cloud of dirt -- dead,              
          a gaping wound in his head.                                           
          Medusa regards her fallen minion in horror, loosing a        

          MOURNFUL SIGH.                                               
          Spyros HEARS HER and blindly hurls his harpoon toward the
          sound.
          WITH THE HARPOON as its sails cleanly through slanted        
          pillars and debris, WHOOSH, WHOOSH, until it comes
          through a tiny opening and --
          THUDS into Medusa's body! The Monster SCREAMS, whipping      
          about. She tries to pull the harpoon out, but can't.         

          SPYROS                                                      (O.S.)
          Perseus, I think she's hit!

          PERSEUS                                                     (O.S.)
          Where?

          SPYROS                                                      (O.S.)
          Near to the left!
          Medusa's enraged attention shifts back and forth between
          the VOICES of the two men, deciding which to attack.
          Perseus tries to control his shakes, jumping at every                 
          sound, head swiveling blindly. From a distance --                     

          SPYROS                                                      (O.S.)
          Perseus... I don't hear her near
          me!
          Perseus steps back and BUMPS into a column.

          Medusa is coiled around the column, harpoon stuck in her     
          bloody side. She CRAWLS DOWN toward Perseus.                 
          Perseus against the column. FROM THE TOP OF FRAME,           
          Medusa's fingers reach for his blindfold. She pulls the      
          knot and the blindfold falls.                                
          Eyes closed, Perseus slashes the air, sweeping the sickle    
          about until it SMASHES into the column -- BRINNNGI The       
          SOUND ECHOES, then FADES.                                    
          Perseus waits and listens. Then, PING!, one drop of
          Medusa's blood lands on his shield.                          
          Perseus opens his eyes and peers into his shield. In the     
          reflection on the bronze, he SEES: Movement. Snakes.         
          Searing eyes... Medusa!
          Eyes shut, he windmills his weapon above him. Medusa's       
          talons DEFLECT the blade and the sickle flies from his
          grip.                                                        
          Perseus scrambles for it on his hands and knees. Behind
          him, Medusa SLITHERS down the column and heads for           
          Perseus.
          Perseus reaches the sickle. He lifts his shield up in
          front of him and sees Medusa's reflection growing closer
          behind him.
          He shuts his eyes and wheels around, blade sweeping. A       
          soft F-THMMP as the blade slices through something...
          SILENCE. Perseus turns away and opens his eyes, looking
          into the shield. Still, Medusa looms behind him!             
          But suddenly, Medusa's head THUDS and rolls on the
          ground. The headless reflection topples over, dead.         r-

          THE AFTERMATH: the survivors -- Vidalia, Amoun, Mongke,
          and Tamburlane -- take mournful stock of their losses.
          Mongke sees something, smiles and SWEARS in his language.
          They all turn to see:
          Perseus and Spyros, spent and saddened, stand at the top
          of the Temple steps. Perseus grasps the canvas sack.
          Now it holds Medusa's head, which bloodies the whole bag
          and sends a crimson drip to the stones. There is still       
          movement in there -- squirming serpents.

          Rain and waves pound the Lower Wharf, the water choked

          and GENERALS at his side. A massive tent town has been
          pitched in the piazza. VOICES -- frequent and angry --

          The relief fleet is lost.
          Monsters gather outside our walls.
          Soon I won't be able to keep my
          own people at bay. And still, no
          word from the Expedition.
          Kepheus raises a spyglass to survey the view beyond the

          EXT. FOREST TRAIL (ILLYRIA)   - MAGIC HOUR

          The Expedition passes through deep woods. Spyros and
          Perseus ride side by side.

                         PERSEUS
          Father, we've seen much on this
          journey we cannot hold in our
          hands. Yet these things are real
          enough. At each turn, we find
          monsters and Gods.

                         SPYROS
          Yes, the evidence is everywhere
          once we leave our island. That's
          why I so rarely leave. These
          Gods, what do you make of them?

                         PERSEUS                                                    
          As you always said, they're petty,                         
          vengeful... and dangerous.                                 

                         SPYROS
          Yes, as bad as men.
          (as Perseus smiles)
          And would you have that sort guide
          your life?

                         PERSEUS
          No. Men must be accountable to
          themselves. Otherwise we serve
          poor masters.

                         SPYROS

          We should stop for the night.

                         PERSEUS
          We must keep moving. Time is                               
          running out.

                         SPYROS
          If we don't rest the horses, they
          won't make it to Joppa.

          We all need rest. If you don't
          save yourself, you'll have nothing
          left when you face the Kraken.
          Riding behind them, Vidalia (paler and more ephemeral
          than ever) is suddenly alert. She peers into the woods,
          agitated. Then she EXCLAIMS SOFTLY, dismounts and runs
          into the woods.

                         PERSEUS
          Vidalia!
          Perseus slides from his horse and follows her. Mongke

          Vidalia darts through the trees. She stops, closes her

          stops, searching her senses. Perseus arrives and watches    
          her.

                    VIDALIA
          I know this place...
          Suddenly, she hurries to the trunk of an ancient tree.

          motionless before a bare altar.

                         (UNCERTAIN)
          I know they were humans. They
          seemed so fragile. I sheltered
          them because I thought the harsh
          world would break them. Now I
          know I underestimated them.

          Medusa's head, I saw that a Man
          had done an impossible thing.
          Beautiful, yes, but not fragile.
          Resilient. Fearless.

                         PERSEUS
          I was mad with fear. I was no

          Perseus turns toward the altar.

          What is this?
          A marble tablet sits on the altar, its surface defaced.
          Vidalia runs her fingers along the scoring.

          When the war began, Men ranged
          through the hills, stamping out
          any trace of God-worship they
          found.
          (touching the tablet)
          My true name was carved here.
          When it was obliterated, my
          worshippers lost faith and my last
          season began.

          Only days.

          You have liberated me, my Queen.
          Watch as your desires are quickly
          satisfied.

          INT. UNDERGROUND SHRINE - SUNRISE                          

          Perseus jolts awake. He reaches for Vidalia, but she is
          gone. Amoun stands over him, his manner severe.

                         PERSEUS
          Where is she?                                              

                         AMOUN                                                      
          This is my fault. I've permitted                           
          .this infatuation to progress too
          far.

                         PERSEUS
          It is not yours to permit,                                 
          Master... with respect.                                    
          Vidalia comes down into the shrine, her apron full of      
          berries.                                                   

                         VIDALIA
          Look what I've found for us --                             
          She startles when she sees Amoun, dropping the berries.    

                         AMOUN

                         (TO VIDALIA)
          Have you forgotten Perseus is                              
          engaged to the Princessa?

          Both Amoun and Vidalia are surprised.

                         AMOUN
          If by some miracle you survive
          this encounter with Leviathan, the                          
          hand of the Princessa is your
          reward.

          I want no reward.                                           

                         AMOUN
          Are you so selfish? Would you                               
          risk everything for the foolish
          love of --
          A BLAST of HOT DESERT WIND blows into the Shrine. The       
          berries turn brown and shrivel.                             
          Amoun grabs his chest. Perseus and Vidalia crumple in       
          agony.
          SET THE VOID COMES INTO THE SHRINE. Amoun tries to          
          invoke a spell, but Set touches his chest and Amoun         
          splits open.                                                
          Set points at Vidalia, slamming her into the earthen        
          wall. The God is there in an instant, strangling her.       
          Perseus staggers up and swings his sickle, but Set          
          points, ripping the weapon from Perseus' hand. It flies     
          across the shrine and sinks with a CLANG into the tablet    
          that once held Vidalia's true name.                         
          Still choking Vidalia, Set grabs Perseus' arm. Perseus      
          doubles over, paralyzed by the God's touch. Suffocating,    
          Vidalia FADES MORE.                                         
          Immobilized, Perseus watches her struggle and searches      

                         HIS BEING:

          Perseus rises. He cocks his arm and clobbers Set with an
          ear-splitting CRACK OF THUNDER and a sparking BURST OF
          WHITE ENERGY. Set drops Vidalia and lurches back,
          aghast. BLACK BLOOD shoots from his mouth.
          Perseus, his face contorted in rage, chokes Set. The        
          God's body SPASMS and deforms in DEATH THROES.

                         CONTINUED:
          Perseus slams the God down in a ghastly heap, which
          liquefies into thick black blood. It seeps into the
          sandy floor, leaving an ugly stain.                          
          Perseus rushes to embrace Vidalia, who is more evanescent
          than ever. They look with pain at the remains of Amoun.      

                         VIDALIA
          I'm so sorry, Perseus.
          A look of brutal, determined resolve grows in Perseus'       
          face.                                                        

                         VIDALIA

                         (IN AWE)
          You faced a God in lethal
          combat... and vanquished him.
          Never have I heard of such a
          thing.
          He looks at her, mind racing, then lifts her as he           
          stands.

                         PERSEUS
          We must go quickly now.
          He pulls the sickle from the marble with a BRINNG! The
          light flashes off Zeus' LIGHTNING BOLT PATTERN on the
          blade.

                         PERSEUS

          Fantasos and the LEADERS of the Revolution are gathered

          CHANTING.

          fearsome IDOL OF TIAMAT, unlike any representation we've

          Loyal servants...
          it may be an illusion, but the Idol seems to have taken      
          on the most subtle of life. It does not move, but it

          Fantasos, closest to the Idol, flinches, buffeted by an
          unseen draft.

          A GONG sounds ONCE in the night. Repheus sleeps fitfully
          on a divan by the bed of the desiccated Cassiopeia.

          INT. ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

          The GONG sounds again. CLOSE ON Andromeda's tortured
          face staring down at the city -- too CLOSE to see exactly
          where she is.

          EXT. THE BASILICA - BACK GATE - NIGHT

          The GONG sounds a THIRD TIME. Peshet opens a lock and
          sets the heavy gate ajar. She looks at the dagger in her
          palm and hurries inside.
          After a moment, four CLOAKED REBELS slip through the open    
          gate.

          My lady? Princess Andromeda?
          She goes deeper into the rooms, then GASPS, looking off,

                         ALARMED --
          Andromeda stands on the balustrade of her balcony,
          preparing to jump to her death. She turns at the sound,

          Peshet rushes to her but stops when Andromeda raises a       
          knife of her own. Peshet is shocked, not afraid.             

                         ANDROMEDA
          Peshet, stop! I know what I am                               
          meant to do.

          understand that the fate of so

          what I must. I will die so that

          She turns, but Peshet leaps and grabs her, pulling her to    
          safety. They fall to the floor, both daggers CLATTERING      
          on the marble.

          you are only a Princess. One day
          your people may need a Queen ready                           
          to die for them.

          A VOICE from the darkness:

          AGENOR (O.S.)
          Your father is dead and your
          mother has been relieved of her                              
          suffering.                                                   
          The four Cloaked Rebels step into the light. Agenor          
          wipes his bloody dagger on his cloak as all four advance.

                         AGENOR
          The Princessa is coming with us.
          She has a rendezvous to keep.
          Peshet WHIPS HER DAGGER through the air; it THUDS into
          the neck of the First Rebel, killing him on his feet.
          Before he can fall, Peshet leaps to him and pulls out her    
          knife. She plants herself in front of Andromeda.

          Come and get her.                                            
          Agenor and the other two circle Peshet. She moves with       
          feline agility, but is separated from the Princess. To       
          the Second Rebel --

          You're not going anywhere, Your

          He grabs her in a bear hug from behind. She spins, tiny
          within his massive arms, and is suddenly facing him. He
          JOLTS in surprise, Andromeda's knife in his belly. He
          falls on her, dead.
          Peshet wins her struggle with the Third Rebel, sinking
          her dagger in him. She GASPS. Agenor has thrust his
          blade into her ribs. She totters and COUGHS -- deep and
          bloody. Peshet falls against the wall.
          Andromeda WAILS at the sight. She is pinned beneath the      
          dead weight of the Second Rebel, unable to move. Agenor      
          finishes off Peshet and turns to the Princess.

          Tamburlane -- crest a hill in the RAINY DAWN LIGHT.
          Vidalia is almost transparent. The Expedition reacts in      
          shock to what they see.

          FROM BEHIND THE GROUP
          They're on a shelf above the wide, flat basin that lies      
          outside Joppa. A limitless INHUMAN ARMY -- Centaurs,         
          Minotaurs, Monsters of every stripe -- fills the plain,      
          right up to the city walls.

          Among the regiments of Joppans waiting nervously for the     
          battle are ranks of fifteen-foot AUTOMATA (CLOCKWORK         
          SOLDIERS). OPERATORS feverishly work the mechanisms of       
          the steel soldiers, which flex their artificial limbs and
          weigh their massive weapons.

          Mongke and Tamburlane exchange words. For the first
          time, they look impressed -- but also delighted. This is
          what they live for.
          Spyros looks over at his adopted son.

          Perseus reaches out and touches his foster father warmly.

                         PERSEUS
          You'll have to tell them yourself.
          Vidalia's voice has become weaker.

                         VIDALIA
          The people are frightened. But                              
          they can triumph.. They need only
          one thing.
          Perseus turns to her, a question on his face -- "Tell
          me...                                                       11

          A hero. They're waiting for you,

          Perseus looks back toward the city. At last, there is no    
          uncertainty in Perseus --

          GONG.
          Agenor brings Andromeda barefoot through the mud. The

          Agenor's thugs chain her to the winch at the precipice,     
          hundreds of feet above the raging sea. As the winch is      
          cranked, the chain lifts Andromeda upside down from the     
          ground.
          Agenor pulls Andromeda close and flashes a cruel grin.      
          She spits in his eye. He wipes his eyes and lets go of      
          the chain.

          A mile offshore, a BULGE OF WATER SWELLS and plows toward

          the links above her. With effort, she climbs the very
          chain she dangles from, leaving a slack loop beneath.
          Leviathan's eyes break the surface below, watching          
          Andromeda. With a HOWL, Leviathan HURTLES UPWARDS, jaws

          Leviathan grows huge as it leaps for her. UP, UP, UP.
          The JAWS SNAP CLOSED... just below her climbing feet. So
          close, it BITES ON THE DROOPING SLACK OF CHAIN!
          The monster slides back down, clutching the chain in its    
          jaws. The Princessa plummets with it.                       

          UP ON THE PLATFORM
          The chain unreels wildly, pulls tight... and rips the       
          platform from its anchors. It careens over the edge,
          taking Fantasos, Agenor and their Thugs to their
          screaming death.

          Perseus grips both the chain and the bag in his hand.        
          Leviathan spirals on, but THE WINCH CATCHES ON A REEF and    
          the chain SNAPS! Andromeda, suddenly separated from the      
          monster, sinks, weighted by her shackles.                    
          Perseus, swimming with the raw power of a porpoise, dives    
          after her, but loses his grip on the bag. Desperate, he      
          looks back and forth: Andromeda, the sack -- both
          sinking. Perseus goes after the sack.                        
          Leviathan realizes it has lost the Princess. Huge eyes
          darting, it spots Andromeda and surges down after her.
          Andromeda, drowning, passes out. Tiny bubbles leak from      
          her nose. Leviathan swims down to her, eye as big as her     
          entire body.
          The wreck of a SUNKEN WHALER rests on the ocean floor.
          The Medusa sack FALLS INTO VIEW and catches on a harpoon
          wedged in the deck. Perseus appears, snags the sack and
          is about to kick upward. On impulse, he grabs the
          harpoon.
          Leviathan opens its huge jaws. Andromeda is sucked           
          toward the maw.
          Perseus swims upward toward Leviathan's tail. Perseus        
          concentrates -- a sparking BURST OF WHITE ENERGY shoots      
          through his forearm to the harpoon in his grip.
          LIGHTNING CRACKLES and BOILS the water. He plunges the
          harpoon in the Kraken's tail --
          -- at the same moment Leviathan inhales the unconscious
          Andromeda.
          Contact -- an ELECTRIC FLASH-POINT FLARES and a charge       
          races up Leviathan's spine. Jolted, the monster spits        
          Andromeda out.                                               
          The Kraken twists to lock its enraged gaze on Perseus.       
          Perseus shuts his eyes and yanks Medusa's head from the
          sack. Medusa's hellish eyes ignite channels of boiling
          energy into Leviathan's enormous eyeballs -- hardening
          them to boiled eggs, then rocky spheres.

          113.

                         CONTINUED:
          The monster thrashes, tries to turn -- but unbending
          stone races its length, freezing the gargantuan curves --
          the scuted tail locks mid-flail into a final, permanent
          hook.
          Dead in the water, the grotesque mass sinks like a           
          mountain range, picking up speed as it plunges into the      

                         ABYSS                                                       --                                                           
          Perseus must swim like a God to snatch Andromeda from the    
          downward tug. The stone Kraken barely misses them as it      

                         DROPS --                                                     
          -- and CRASHES in a cloud of silt, SHAKING THE OCEAN
          FLOOR like an earthquake. A CRACK opens in the seabed
          and sucks back the silt. The trench deepens and streaks
          away across the seabed, swallowing all the water above
          it, creating a giant opening to the sky.

          EXT. TIAMAT'S PALACE-GALLEON                                (OCEAN)                                                     - PROW - DAY     

          Tiamat's face contorts, sensing her beloved Leviathan is
          dead. She turns at the sound of GHASTLY CREAKING -- the
          immense length of the galleon buckles into a hole in the
          ocean. As the towering masts drop below wave-level,
          Tiamat raises her arms to the sky --

                         TIAMAT
          I damn you, Zeus! You will hear
          my curses forever in the crash of

                         SURF                                                        --
          Walls of water collapse, burying the Goddess, her ship,                      
          and her malediction deep in her realm. We HEAR a world-                      
          rocking ROAR, which booms off toward --                                      

          EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

          Tiamat's Monster Army is DEAFENED by the BOOM, losing all    
          spirit with the unmistakable certainty that their Goddess    
          is gone.                                                     
          THE TIDE TURNS IN THE BATTLE as the Joppans and their        
          steel allies, the Automata, wade into the ranks of           
          creatures.                                                   
          Mongke and Tamburlane, in the center of the battle, find
          the opposition turning tail. They roar and lift their
          weapons high, surviving yet another fight. Spyros,
          bloodied but unbowed, smiles wide and sits down in the
          mud, exhausted.

          EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - DAY

          The water stills. The sea calms. No sign of Perseus or
          Andromeda. WIND and QUIET...
          CHOOM! Perseus surfaces with Andromeda in his arms,          

          GASPING FOR AIR.

          EXT. CLIFFS OF JOPPA - DAY

          The onlookers rejoice.

          EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - DAY

          BACK WITH Perseus and Andromeda. He looks at her             
          lifeless countenance in agony -- has he failed again as      
          he did with Anteros the fisherman??                          
          Distraught, his muscles go taut around Andromeda, and a      
          short powerful burst of electric energy shoots from his
          arms into her still body -- SHE JOLTS TO LIFE!               
          Movement! Breath! Color returns to her face. Perseus,
          too, breathes again, relieved.
          For the first time since the start of the adventure, they
          find themselves alone, holding each other.

                         PERSEUS
          Hello.
          (as she smiles,

                         RELIEVED)
          Are you all right?
          She takes a moment, doing an inventory. Finally, she
          nods.

                         ANDROMEDA
          I think I am.
          He smiles. She'll never know how close they came to          
          oblivion.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Are you ready to become a king?
          His expression is kind, but unmistakable. "No." She          
          accepts that, rueful.

                          

                         PERSEUS
          Are you ready to become a queen?

          115.

                         CONTINUED:
          She thinks about it, her face beginning to light with
          confidence.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Yes. Yes, I am.

                         PERSEUS
          Then you're ready to go home.
          Perseus raises one arm. The-AIR reverberates to a LOUD      
          BEATING OF WINGS. Andromeda looks up in wonder.
          Pegasus appears out of the sun's glare, gracefully          
          alighting on the water. Perseus helps Andromeda up and
          then climbs on behind her.
          Pegasus takes off. TILT UP WITH them until they are lost    
          from sight.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. BLUE SKY AND WHITE CLOUDS - DAY

          Black smoke RISES to dirty the perfect sky. TILT DOWN

                         TO:

          EXT. SACRED GROUND - DAY

          The Sacred Ground of Joppa in the verdant hills, above      
          the sea, is so beautiful it might be mistaken for           
          Olympos.
          TWO FUNERAL PYRES burn. The citizens of Joppa, by the       
          thousands, commend King Kepheus and Queen Cassiopeia to     
          the afterlife.                                              
          MOVING OVER THE CROWD, WE PUSH THROUGH the flame to find    
          the new ruler of Joppa. Mournful, but cloaked in regal      
          dignity and strength -- QUEEN ANDROMEDA.                    

                         CUT TO:

          A DISTANT POV OF THE QUEEN
          The ceremony and the heavenly setting.

                         PERSEUS
          Perseus views the scene from a nearby hill. Behind him,
          Pegasus waits patiently, grazing the grass. Until --

                         CONTINUED:
          -- the equine suddenly WHINNIES and REARS UP. Just as
          quickly, Pegasus goes silent and BOWS DOWN. Perseus          
          looks in that direction, to find --
          ZEUS the Prime, God of Gods, an eagle perched on his arm.
          He couldn't look more imposing.

                         ZEUS
          Am I to understand you do not
          intend to make this union with the
          Queen Andromeda?

                         PERSEUS
          Yes.

                         ZEUS
          Despite my will and intention that
          you do so?

                         PERSEUS
          Yes.

                         ZEUS
          Would you choose to condemn Men,
          your own people, to suffer more of
          this devastating War?

                         PERSEUS
          I have no people. You have
          stranded me between realms,
          neither man nor God.

                         ZEUS

                         (STERNLY)
          Do you reproach Zeus?

                         PERSEUS
          No. I thank you... Father.
          Zeus, mighty God, reacts to the word. His expression
          softens and he looks on Perseus with growing pride.

                         PERSEUS
          You have freed me. I will not be
          a pawn for Men or Gods.

                         ZEUS
          Does that absolve you suddenly of
          your responsibilities?

                         PERSEUS
          You've made me understand that my
          responsibility is to myself. So
          it is with us all.

                         PERSEUS

                         (INTIMATELY)
          You've put me to a great test. In
          the midst of it, I found the
          courage in my heart to defy Gods.
          I do not know how much of that
          comes from you, Father... and how
          much from my Mother, who I never
          knew.
          Zeus starts, subtly, at the mention of Queen Danae.

                         PERSEUS
          It matters not. Whatever the
          source, I are only grateful.
          He looks off toward the funeral pyres and the human
          throng.

                         PERSEUS
          This war will end the moment you
          choose for it to end... and Men
          agree. I think, perhaps, that is
          the free will that all realms
          share.
          Zeus looks at him, proud, yet wistful -- what an
          offspring, what a creation!

                         ZEUS
          What will you do, Man of free
          will?
          Perseus motions Pegasus forward, and swings up onto his
          back.

                         PERSEUS
          I'm going to find Vidalia.

                         ZEUS
          So... my Son, you will be a pawn
          for love?

                         PERSEUS

                         (LAUGHS)
          Yes, Father, gladly.
          Perseus spurs Pegasus and launches into the sky. And
          soars away.

          FADE OUT.

                                      SHOOTING DRAFT

                                           1985



                

               EXT. CHICAGO - NIGHT TO DAWN

               Thundering north through the glass canyons of the Loop, the 
               elevated train SCREECHES through the city awakening. As it 
               races north across the river past ancient factories giving 
               way to high rise splendor, lights glistening against the 
               dawn, we see the complex business of bringing a city to life 
               in the morning.

               On the Near North Side an assortment of revelers are winding 
               up their night on the town.

               The pressmen loiter outside the Tribune loading docks, and 
               fishing boats are outbound through the Chicago River locks.

               A streetsweeping crew moves through the Fulton Market, 
               Chicago's central meat and produce distribution center.

               At the Merchandise Mart platform the elevated train picks up 
               two old cleaning ladies wearing babushkas.

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               The el train RUMBLES north past the aging tenements of Uptown 
               into the Belmont Avenue Station.

               And down below, a garbage truck is slowly working its way up 
               the alley. A garbage man in city overalls WHISTLES to the 
               driver and the truck stops. He rolls a can to the grinding 
               jaw as the driver sits, tense and alert, scanning the street.

               There's something odd about this driver. And the garbage man 
               too, for that matter.

               EXT. EL PLATFORM - DAY

               SPIDER, a nervous looking black man, steps out onto the 
               platform. As the train pulls away we see him reach into his 
               shirt pocket and CLICKS his ball point pen a couple of times. 
               He WHISPERS into it. It is a concealed radio transmitter.

                                     SPIDER
                         Say, hey, Cub fans, I hope to hell 
                         y'all down there cause we got a big 
                         game today.

               He heads for the stairs and the street below.

               INT. TRUCK CAB - DAY

               The truck cab is equipped with a police radio. The driver, 
               RICH DONATO, adjusts the volume. Over the SPEAKER, HEAVY 
               WITH STATIC, we can hear the SOUND of the RECEDING EL TRAIN.

                                     SPIDER (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         The school bus be waitin.

               Donato motions for the garbage man.

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               EDDIE CUSACK jumps up on the truck's running board and sticks 
               his head in. On the seat beside Donato is a sledgehammer and 
               a sawed off automatic rifle. The two men stare at each other 
               as they concentrate on the CRACKLING RADIO.

                                     SPIDER (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         S'happenin, Doc?

                                     DOC (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         Hey, I got it all right here, my 
                         man. Jus be waitin on you.

                                     SPIDER (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         We ain't got far to go.

               EXT. EL STATION - DAY

               DOC is at the wheel of a late model Cadillac. Spider gets in 
               and they pull slowly away from the curb.

               EXT. EL STATION - DAY

               At the corner in a beat up Pontiac are officers MUSIC and 
               BRENNAN. The two rough looking detectives follow Doc's car 
               through half closed eyes.

               They also HEAR Spider's TRANSMITTER. The quality of the 
               reception improves as Spider and his antennae clear the steel 
               support structure of the el platform.

                                     DOC (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         This early bird shit just ain't my 
                         style.

                                     SPIDER (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         Dig it. Too close to real work for 
                         me.

               Doc and Spider talk in a nervous false bravado.

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               Eddie nods to Donato who grabs a walkie-talkie from the seat.

                                     DONATO
                              (to walkie-talkie)

               SILENCE. Eddie looks at Donato.

                                     EDDIE
                         Where's Cragie?

               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Two cops are against the wall separating the cemetery from 
               the El. CRAGIE, a weathered twenty-five year veteran; and 
               NICK KOSALAS, the new kid on the team. Cragie sits on a crate 
               with a styrofoam cup of coffee.

               Kosalas is trying to maneuver his cup lid off, and still 
               hold on to his walkie-talkie.

                                     DONATO (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         Talk to me left field.

                                     KOSALAS
                              (to mike)
                         Ready sir. Left Field in position.

               Cragie pulls a pint of whiskey from his pocket and sweetens 
               his coffee with a healthy shot. He notices Kosalas, who has 
               set down the thermos and is nervously moving from leg to 
               leg.

                                     CRAGIE
                         Have a shot, kid. A little nerve 
                         tonic.

                                     KOSALAS
                         What's the matter with you?

               Cragie grins and raises his cup to drink. His hand shakes 
               and he has to steady it with the other.

               The RADIO CRACKLES.

                                     SPOTTER (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         O.K., guys, runner on first base.

               INT. SPOTTER APARTMENT - DAY

               A spotter, KOBAS, covers the scene from an abandoned building 
               across the street.

                                     KOBAS
                              (to walkie-talkie)
                         Just turning on Paulina.

                                     EDDIE (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         Double Play, you got him in sight?

                                     MUSIC (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         Yeah, we got the on him. He's headin 
                         for the alley.

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               Eddie wrestles another garbage can into the truck's hopper 
               as Doc's car cruises slowly past.

               Eddie and Spider LOCK EYES for a split second.

               The car moves on and stops at the far end of the alley. The 
               lights switch off. After a moment, Spider and Doc leave the 
               car and check out the scene. Doc carries a satchel.

                                     DOC (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         I say nice and simple now.

                                     SPIDER (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         We real cool, Doc. We're frosty. We 
                         jus' doin' a little business, you 
                         know? Ain't no big thing.

               The two men slip into the back gate of an old tenement. They 
               pass through a gangway to the front of the building, and 
               climb the front stairs.

               Though we can no longer see them, we HEAR a DOOR OPENING, a 
               GREETING in Spanish, and FEET FOUNDING up the steps.

               The garbage truck GRINDS forward and halts again. Eddie comes 
               up to the cab. He is wearing a gun under his overalls. He 
               and Donato listen on the RADIO to the CONVERSATION coming 
               from inside the building.

               INT. COMACHO FRONT STAIRS - DAY

               A muscular Latino, POMPAS COMACHO, leads Spider and Doc down 
               the paint-peeling corridor. The SOUND of BABIES CRYING and 
               FAMILIES WAKING gives a sense of teeming humanity behind 
               every door.

               The Latino knocks at a door heavily fortified with burglar 
               bars. The door opens. The bars are unlocked.

                                     SPIDER
                         How y'all doin?

                                     VOICE (V.O.)
                              (from within)
                         It's O.K. O.K. Como esta?

               Pompas leaves the two men and heads down the stairs toward 
               the front door.

               INT. COMACHO APARTMENT - DAY

               Doc and Spider enter. They're patted down.

               A sleepy eyed Latino woman comes to stand in the bedroom 
               doorway. VICTOR COMACHO barks at her in Spanish, and she 
               disappears into the bedroom.

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               Eddie stands on the running board of the truck with Donato 
               at the wheel. They listen to the RADIO.

                                     DOC (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         Hey, man, we're clean, huh. We ain't 
                         fools.

                                     SPIDER (V.O.)
                         You do that real nice, Pancho. what 
                         say we get married.

               Eddie tosses a soiled Rubic's Cube into Donato's lap.

                                     EDDIE
                         Found you a present.

                                     DONATO
                         Shit, those things will fuck up your 
                         mind.

               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Cragie is watching over the wall with his binoculars. He 
               looks back at Kosalas, who is hopping from foot to foot.

                                     CRAGIE
                         If you gotta take a leak, do it now.

                                     KOSALAS
                         I can't go wading in with my shlong 
                         flapping in the wind.

                                     CRAGIE
                         Sure you can. It's called diversionary 
                         tactics.

               Cragie laughs and swigs straight from the bottle. The RADIO 
               CRACKLES.

                                     BRENNAN (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         What's going on in the ballpark?

                                     DONATO (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         Don't get froggy. Wait for the green 
                         light.

               EXT. COMACHO STREET - DAY

               A painter's van passes Brennan's Pontiac and parks in front 
               of the building half way up the block.

               INT. BRENNAN'S CAR - DAY

               Music doesn't like this.

                                     MUSIC
                         What the hell is this cat up to?

                                     BRENNAN
                         Going to work asshole. What do you 
                         think.

                         At this hour.

                         They got a hardass for a boss. Like 
                         us.

               EXT. COMACHO STREET - DAY

               As Music and Brennan watch from their car, the four painters 
               get out of their truck, unpack their ladders and tools, and 
               begin to carry their equipment into the building next door 
               to the stakeout.

               INT. COMACHO APARTMENT - DAY

               The room is small and bare. A selling den. VICTOR COMACHO 
               and TWO COUSINS, all young and vicious, are sitting around a 
               formica table with the two buyers, Doc and Spider. The 
               Comachos are heavily armed. There is plenty of tension all 
               around, but Doc seems a little more nervous than the rest.

               This is an enormous buy. Doc has placed a bowling satchel 
               full of bundled $20's, $50's, and $100's on the table. Victor 
               is counting it rapidly.

                                     SPIDER
                         This be better than jukin' Seven-
                         Elevens, huh Victor?

                                     VICTOR
                              (to cousins in Spanish)
                         This one's got some balls, huh?
                              (to Spider)
                         I don't juke anybody.

               Victor nods and one of the cousins brings in half a dozen 
               brick-sized bundles of cocaine from the next room.

               Doc slices into one of the bags and with the tip of his knife 
               he drops a bit into a glass vial. He adds clear liquid with 
               an eye dropper and it instantly turns purple.

                                     DOC
                         I say, awright. The royal colors.

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               Eddie's eyes scan the scene as he sorts through a garbage 
               can with a stick.

               INT. PAINTER'S HALLWAY - DAY

               The painters carry their equipment down the long corridor 
               and enter a vacant apartment.

               A door opens in the corridor, and a naked toddler steps out. 
               A Latino teenager comes out to retrieve the child. He sees 
               the backs of the painters, and carries the toddler back 
               inside.

               INT. PAINTER'S APARTMENT - DAY

               The painters are not what they seem. Working quickly, 
               silently, they open their tool kits and lay out their 
               hardware: machine guns and automatics.

               TONY LUNA, a barrel-chested Italian mobster is running the 
               show and it's well rehearsed. His boys, GUS, VITO, and EENIE 
               move like oiled machinery.

               Vito turns on a radio to a Latino station to cover the SOUND 
               of their preparations. They remove the whole window from its 
               frame. Then they rest a wide plank on the window ledge.

               Three feet away is the window of the adjacent building and 
               silhouetted against the shade we can SEE the drug deal.

               Luna'ys check their weapons.

               They put on painters' masks and goggles.

                                     LUNA
                         Okay, by the numbers.

               He puts on his goggles.

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               Over the IDLING ENGINE of the garbage truck, Eddie and Donato 
               HEAR the deal going down on the RADIO.

                                     EDDIE

                         just went in the building next door.

               Eddie looks at Donato.

                                     EDDIE
                         Painters? That building's gonna be 
                         condemned!

               Like a coiled spring, Eddie leaps from the truck and runs 
               for the rear gate, gun in hand.

               Tony and his men face the window across the gangway. Two of 
               them hold sawed off double barreled shotguns. Tony counts it 
               down, and they all fire as one.

               One GIANT BLAST tears into the window. It disintegrates.

               The four men toss aside their empty guns, and grab other 
               guns.

               EXT. GANGWAY - DAY

               Eddie HEARS THE GUNFIRE and hits the wall. He sees the glass 
               showering down around him. He vaults over the backyard fence 
               and head for the porch stairs.

               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Kosalas is finally pissing against the wall.

                                     KOSALAS
                         I knew it.

               Cragie is using the crate to climb the wall. He is up and 
               over, and falls to the ground on the other side. He's still 
               trying to get to his feet when Kosalas comes over.

               They start running, yanking their guns out.

               INT. COMACHO APARTMENT - DAY

               Doc and Spider are blown backwards in their chairs. One of 
               the cousins has fallen across the piles of money and drugs. 
               Victor and the other cousin are slumped on the floor. The 
               woman in the bedroom is screaming.

               Through the jagged glass around the window frame, Tony's 
               boys shove a broad plank.

               EXT. GANGWAY - DAY

               Three floors up, we see the "painters" rush across the gangway 
               to the other building.

               EXT. COMACHO BACK STAIRS - DAY

               EFREN COMACHO, the heavyweight guarding the back door, is 
               distracted by the SHOUTS and GUNFIRE upstairs. Eddie crashes 
               through the door and Efren spins just in time to meet Eddie's 
               blurring attack.

               The struggle on the landing is brief. Efren's size is no 
               match for Eddie's speed and power. With a grunt he sags to 
               the floor.

               Eddie leaps over him and bounds up the steps.

               EXT. COMACHO STREET - DAY

               Brennan, Music and Kobas are now on their way, using parked 
               cars to cover their advance toward the front door of the 
               Comacho building.

               EXT. COMACHO BACK STAIRS - DAY

               Eddie passes the second floor landing and takes a quick look 
               up the porch stairs. The door to the second floor apartment 
               starts to open behind him. He spins and kicks it.

               There stands a terrified old woman looking up the barrel of 
               his gun.

                                     EDDIE
                              (shouts)
                         Police! No se mueve!

               He spins and bounds up the stairway.

               INT. COMACHO APARTMENT - DAY

               The woman is huddled in a corner, still screaming. Tony comes 
               to stand over her, and coldly shoots her. Then he rips off 
               his mask and goggles as his boys clear the bodies and scoop 
               up the drugs and money from the table.

               Victor Comacho lies slumped against the wall, one side of 
               his face and one shoulder bloodied. He appears dead, eyes 
               open. But then he blinks once.

               INT. COMACHO BACK STAIRS - DAY

               Eddie has entered the rear of the apartment. He moves 
               cautiously forward.

               INT. COMACHO APARTMENT - DAY

               Tony and his partners start back over the gangway to the 
               other building. Vito is bringing up the rear.

               Suddenly Victor Comacho comes to life. He gets off A BURST 
               with his AUTOMATIC. Vito catches it in the back.

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               Donato is moving down the gangway when Vito's body -- followed 
               by the scaffold plank -- falls from the sky and CRASHES into 
               the pavement right in front of him.

               INT. COMACHO APARTMENT - DAY

               Eddie jumps into the living room doorway, gun drawn, and 
               takes in the carnage. He kicks the gun out of Victor's hand, 
               and bounds to the shattered bay window and looks down in 
               time to SEE --

               EXT. GANGWAY - DAY

               Donato jumps over the broken body, running through the gangway 
               toward the front of the building.

                                     DONATO
                         They're goin out the front!

               INT. COMACHO APARTMENT - DAY

               The bridge to the other building is gone, but there is a 
               large drainpipe running down the outside of the building. 
               Eddie climbs out on the shattered window sill, and stretches 
               for the pipe. The pipe is just out of reach. Pushing off 
               from the ledge, he jumps for the drainpipe, grabbing it on 
               his way down.

               EXT. DRAINPIPE - DAY

               As he slides down three stories.

               INT. PAINTER'S HALLWAY - DAY

               The painters run down the stairs toward the front of the 
               building.

               EXT. COMACHO STREET - DAY

               Music, Brennan, and Kobas rush the front door of the Comacho's 
               building, and enter.

               EXT. GANGWAY - DAY

               Eddie lands on his feet and heads for the front.

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               Cragie and Kosalas brace themselves on each side of the rear 
               door to the Painters' building. Cragie is white with fear. 
               Kosalas kicks in the door. They enter.

               EXT. COMACHO STREET - DAY

               At the front of the building Donato emerges from the 
               passageway and he's met by a HAIL of GUNFIRE. He jumps back 
               and takes a more cautious look.

               Tony Luna and Gus make a run for the van. Donato steps out 
               from between the two buildings and raises his gun.

               But he hasn't seen Eenie, just coming out of the building 
               next door.

               Eenie fires and Donato goes down, wounded in the foot. But 
               before Eenie can get off another shot --

               -- Eddie leaps from the gangway and drops Eenie with a BURST 
               from his AUTOMATIC.

               EXT. COMACHO STREET - DAY

               Luna pulls out PEELING RUBBER, but he's nearly surrounded. 
               squad cars have pulled in blocking both ends of the street. 
               Another squad car screeches to a halt and both officers jump 
               out and start firing.

               Luna hits the fender of the squad car head on, knocking both 
               officers to the ground. He spins the van around with cops 
               FIRING from every angle, jumps the curb, and roars past the 
               roadblock on the sidewalk with pedestrians leaping in all 
               directions.

               INT. PAINTERS' BACK STAIRS - DAY

               Heart pounding, Cragie leads Kosalas blindly up the darkened 
               steps.

               INT. PAINTER'S HALL - DAY

               A door opens behind Cragie. He whirls and FIRES into the 
               darkness.

               The riddled body of a Mexican teenager, eyes wide with shock, 
               pitches into the hall.

               Kosalas, down the hallway, hugs the wall, petrified.

                                     KOSALAS
                         Cragie?!

                                     CRAGIE
                         It's O.K. I got the sonovabitch.

               Kosalas creeps ahead, gun drawn, just in time to see Cragie 
               pull a small handgun from his pocket and lay it in the boys 
               hand.

               Cragie looks up at Kosalas and their eyes meet.

               EXT. COMACHO STREET - DAY

               Luna's van, it's windshield shot out, takes the first corner 
               on two wheels. Behind him the police scramble for their blue 
               and whites. Half way down the block, the van lurches into an 
               alley.

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               The van hurtles down the alley, splashing through puddles 
               past the loading docks of a packing company. Parked along 
               one side of the end of the alley is a meat truck from the 
               opening montage. A loading ramp leads to the gaping rear 
               doors.

               The thieves have done their homework. The Luna gang slams up 
               the ramp into the rear of the meat truck.

               A bee fy compatriot in a blood stained butcher's smock pulls 
               several sides of beef along the rail and into the truck. 
               With the van concealed, the line of police cars ROAR splashing 
               by.

               INT. PAINTER'S HALL - DAY

               Cragie, kneeling over the body, looks at Kosalas eyeball to 
               eyeball.

               SCREAMS come from within the boy's apartment.

                                     CRAGIE
                              (yelling into the 
                              apartment)
                         Police! Stay where you are!

               They HEAR FOOTSTEPS pounding up the front stairs. Cragie and 
               Kosalas look up.

               Eddie appears at the front of the hall, gun drawn. He sees 
               the boy on the hallway floor.

               He approaches cautiously, taking in the body, the gun, Cragie 
               sitting against the wall, and the distraught Kosalas who 
               stands transfixed by the dead kid. Eddie goes to Kosalas.

                                     EDDIE
                         Take it easy, Kosalas.

                                     CRAGIE
                         The kid didn't dust him. I did.

               Eddie looks at Cragie.

                                     CRAGIE
                         Him or me, Sarge.
                              (pause)
                         The kid saw the whole thing.

               Both Eddie and Cragie look at Kosalas.

                                     CRAGIE
                         Tell him, Nick.

               It almost sounds like an order.

               Kosalas looks like he's going to be sick.

                                     KOSALAS
                              (softly)
                         Yeah, that's how it went down.

                                     EDDIE
                              (pause)
                         Stay here.
                              (to Cragie)
                         Take care of your partner.

               Eddie walks away.

               EXT. GANGWAY - DAY

               The gangway is now filled with squad cars, ambulances, and 
               cops.

               As the paramedics walk Victor Comacho to the ambulance, 
               bloody, bandaged, but very much alive, he and Eddie LOCK 
               EYES for a brief instant.

               Several ferocious looking Comacho relatives have been allowed 
               inside the police lines. One of them steps close to Victor.

                                     VICTOR
                              (to relative)
                         Call Luis.

               The lab technicians arrive.

               The throng of streetwise punks and horrified commuters are 
               across a roped off area.

                                     KOBAS

               Kosalas and Cragie are still with the body. The corridor is 
               blocked off by uniformed patrolmen.

               Kosalas is shakey. Cragie is tries to calm him down.

                                     CRAGIE
                         Look, it's no big thing, Kid. A 
                         friggin' dog and pony show. Some 
                         dumb ass questions by dumb ass 
                         bureaucrats. "When's the last time 
                         you were at the range?" Crap like 
                         that.

                                     KOSALAS
                         Look. It was a fuckin' accident. Why 
                         can't you just be --

                         You born yesterday?! These ain't 
                         cops. They'll roast our ass just 
                         cause we carry a badge. Both of us.
                              (menacing)
                         We stick together on this, kid. We're 
                         partners, right?

               Kosalas nods.

               EXT. GANGWAY - DAY

               Donato sits on the ground as two paramedics work on his foot. 
               Eddie crouches beside him as one medic cuts away Donato's 
               ankle boot.

                                     DONATO
                         Aw man, don't do that. You know how 
                         much these things cost?

               He gasps as they draw the boot off. Donato grabs for Eddie's 
               hand, and squeezes against the pain.

                                     DONATO
                         Eddie. Scam this. A bait shop. Worms,

                         Yeah, what about the winter?

                                     DONATO
                         We winter in Florida. Rubber neck

                         Hand made in Italy.

               Someone points Eddie out to Partida, an attractive, no-
               nonsense woman, who heads for him. Donato sees Partida coming.

                                     DONATO
                         Oh, fuck, Partida. I'm gonna tell 
                         her you shot me.

               The resentment the other cops feel against Partida is readily 
               apparent.

                                     PARTIDA
                         Cusack. You were in charge here?

                                     EDDIE
                         Does it look like it?

               Partida looks at the covered body nearby.

                                     PARTIDA
                              (to Donato)
                         And you were a principal in one of 
                         the shootings?

               Eddie nods.

                                     DONATO
                         OW! A goddamn Dr. Jekyll!

               Eddie smiles at Donato, who with his good foot, kicks at the 
               medic bandaging the wound.

                                     PARTIDA
                         Where's the officer who was involved 
                         in the other shooting?

                                     EDDIE
                              (pointing)
                         Third floor rear.

               As Partida heads for the building, another suited civilian 
               comes over to meet her. The civilian escorts a Mexican 
               grandmother.

               The old lady is agitated, jabbering in Spanish and pointing 
               at the cops.

               Eddie sees this, and then is pulled away as he helps one of 
               the medics lift Donato and carry him to the ambulance.

               Eddie helps Donato into the ambulance.

                                     EDDIE
                         Catch you later, Hopalong.

               INT. HEADQUARTERS - DAY

               The two Comacho lookouts who survived the raid, Efren and 
               Pompas, have been brought in for questioning. The 
               interrogation is taking place in a small room.

               Officers Brennan and Music are here with Eddie.

               The Comachos sit silent as stones.

                                     MUSIC
                              (to Efren)
                         You know that, Efren. When your big 
                         bad brother Luis gets the word, your 
                         ass is freeze dried and fried.

               Efren stares ahead. Music looks at Eddie who is fiddling 
               with the Rubic's Cube, to little success.

               Brennan takes Music's place. He kicks Pompas' chair hard.

                                     BRENNAN
                         Talk you hemorrhoid!

                                     POMPAS
                              (in Spanish)
                         Your mother fucks dogs in the street.

                                     BRENNAN
                         You wanna tune-up? Hey Sarge, you 
                         know why a Comacho's like a cue-ball? 
                         Cause the harder you hit 'em, the 
                         better their English gets.

               It's not a joke, but a threat. Pompas spits at Brennan. 
               Brennan is enraged, but Eddie pushes him back with a hand.

               Eddie faces the Comachos.

                                     EDDIE
                         We're jerking off here.

               Eddie goes out the door.

               INT. HEADQUARTERS HALL - DAY

               As Eddie emerges, he bumps into the Camacho's lawyer SANCHEZ; 
               thirty-eight, well dressed, smooth as silk.

               Sanchez sees the tableau in the room. As Cusack walks down 
               the hall the attorney follows him.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Let's cut the shit, Cusack.

               Eddie ignores him.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Option 1: you can send em downtown. 
                         If Judge Collins didn't get laid 
                         last night, you can probably get him 
                         to arraign my clients for loitering 
                         in their own hallway. He'll set bail. 
                         I'll take care of it. Option 2: 
                         release them here and now and we'll 
                         call it a day.
                              (pause)
                         Up to you.

                                     EDDIE
                         I like to see you earn your money.

               Sanchez backs off. We follow Eddie down the hall.

               INT. KATES' OFFICE - DAY

               The head of Area Four, COMMANDER KATES, is grilling Cragie 
               and Kosalas.

                                     CRAGIE
                         We come up the back stairs. We start 
                         cleanin' the hallway when the deceased 
                         pops out of a doorway with a 25 
                         automatic. I tell him to drop it, 
                         but he's comin. We had no choice. 
                         Kosalas here saw the whole thing.

               Kates turns to Kosalas.

                                     KATES
                         Did you?

               Kosalas looks haggard.

                                     KOSALAS
                         I was on another doorway...

                                     KATES
                         But you saw the action?

                                     KOSALAS
                         I saw him fall.

                                     KATES
                         And the kid was armed?

                                     KOSALAS
                         That's the way it went down.

                                     KATES
                         And you saw the weapon?

                                     KOSALAS
                              (nods)
                         Yes sir. I saw it in his hand.

                                     KATES
                         O.K.
                              (signs document)
                         Cragie, you'll be assigned to 
                         headquarters until the hearing --

                                     CRAGIE
                         Hearing? Who called for a hearing? 
                         The little fuck tried to shoot me in 
                         the back!

               Eddie enters. Kates looks up from his desk.

                                     KATES
                         Ms. Partida --

                                     CRAGIE
                         That piece of shit!

                                     KATES
                         Shut-up, Cragie.
                              (pause)
                         Partida has demanded a formal hearing. 
                         You will be under oath so the 
                         department will provide you with a 
                         lawyer unless you've got your own.
                              (stands)
                         An OPS Review Board member is waiting 
                         to talk to you. Doesn't sound like 
                         you got anything to worry about.

               Cragie gets up. Kosalas, sitting through this interview in 
               stunned silence stands also.

                                     KATES
                         Kosalas, you work with Cusack until 
                         this is over.

                                     KOSALAS
                         Yes sir.

               Kosalas and Cragie exit.

                                     EDDIE
                         I ain't got no time to nursmaid a 
                         rookie. I don't need a partner.

                                     KATES
                              (explodes)
                         Your right! You don't need a partner! 
                         You need a goddamn keeper!
                              (slams fist on desk)
                         Jesus Christ! How do I explain this 
                         one upstairs?
                              (stands)
                         We gave you 600 man-hours, you took 
                         a month planning the damn thing, and 
                         what have you got to show for it? 
                         Nine bodies? A dead informant? One 
                         of my best men shot! For Christ's 
                         sake!
                              (stares at ceiling)
                         You're going to have me back on a 
                         beat busting perverts in the park.

               Kates sits, sighs, suddenly tired.

                                     EDDIE
                         We got a bigger problem. These 
                         Comachos aren't gonna take this lying 
                         down. The animals are out of the 
                         cages.

                                     KATES
                         Just what I need. A goddman war.

               Eddie turns to leave.

                                     KATES
                         Keep track of this business with 
                         Cragie?

                                     EDDIE
                         Yeah.

               The PHONE RINGS.

                                     KATES
                         I'll deal with upstairs.

               Eddie starts to leave again. Kates picks up the phone, and 
               puts a hand over the mouthpiece.

                                     KATES
                         Just get me some answers, huh.

                                     EDDIE
                         That's my job.

               Eddie exits.

               INT. HEADQUARTERS OFFICE - DAY

               Kosalas, without an attorney, is being interviewed by Partida. 
               A court stenographer is silently typing.

                                     PARTIDA
                         ...you have the right to remain 
                         silent. You have the right to have 
                         an attorney present at all times. 
                         Anything you say may be used against 
                         you in a court of law...

               INT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY

               Eddie and Kosalas are parked on an airport access road, 
               watching private planes land and take off. Eddie's car, a 
               five-year old Chevy, is wreckage. The quarter panels are 
               rusted, the radio antenna is a coathanger, and when Kosalas 
               pushes a tape into the cassette player, the windshield wipers 
               start moving.

               Kosalas pops the cassette out, the windshield wipers stop; 
               he throws the cassette into the glove compartment. But now 
               he can't get the door to stay closed.

                                     EDDIE
                         I'm going to have to fix that.

               Eddie has to shout to be heard over the sound of an airplane 
               passing directly overhead.

               Eddie glances at Kosalas who looks uncomfortable.

                                     EDDIE
                         You know, it's kind of interesting. 
                         That 16 year old in the hallway with 
                         the gun? Partida told me he doesn't 
                         have a record. The kid's never been 
                         arrested.

                                     KOSALAS
                         Yeah, well, you know, if you read 
                         the papers, cops only shoot honor 
                         students. Sole support of the family 
                         and all that.

               EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

               The airport bristles with corporate jets departing and 
               arriving.

                                     TOWER (V.O.)
                         ...Lear 9 Lima Kilo number 2 for 
                         landing -- wind south 20, altimeter 
                         two-niner-niner-two...

               And now comes a mystery jet, wearing no company colors, 
               banking in over Lake Point Tower and WHISTLING low over the 
               Planetarium to a touchdown.

               The white Learjet taxis to a halt at the far end of the field 
               as an undistinguished Buick rolls down the ramp to meet it.

               Eddie and Kosalas stand by their car, parked across the runway 
               from the Learjet.

               The jet's engines shut down, the door opens, and a grim but 
               handsome man emerges. LUIS COMACHO, a cruel and uncompromising 
               survivor, has arrived. With him is an incredibly beautiful 
               exotic woman.

               He is met by Pompas and Efren Comacho, the two lookouts who 
               survived the raid. And Victor Comacho, who was wounded in 
               the raid, is here with his shoulder bandaged.

               EXT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY

               From where Eddie and Kosalas are standing it is impossible 
               to hear the conversation at the Learjet, but it is clear 
               that Luis Comacho is upset. They see Luis slap Pompas and 
               Efren. Then he grabs Victor by both arms, ignoring his wound, 
               and screams at him.

                                     KOSALAS
                         Nice fellow this Luis Comacho. Donato 
                         says they call him the Angel-of-Death.

               Victor grimaces, in great pain, and his knees buckle.

                                     EDDIE
                         Real sweetheart.

               INT. LUNA'S HOUSE - DAY

               In the dining room DIANA LUNA, a pretty 19 year old, helps 
               her 80 year old grandmother THERESA decorate a "HAPPY 
               BIRTHDAY" banner, some red and green crepe paper.

                                     MOLLY LUNA (O.S.)
                         Now?

                                     DIANA
                         No!

               Diana and her grandmother grin at each other. They are done. 
               Theresa stands back to admire their work.

                                     MOLLY (O.S.)
                         Now?

                                     DIANA
                         Mama!

               A PHONE RINGS

                                     DIANA
                         Daddy, would you get that!

               Diana rushes into the kitchen and comes right out with a 
               birthday cake, and sets it on the table next to some presents.

                                     THERESA
                         Bella.

               Diana goes to the stairs where her mother sits with her hands 
               over her eyes.

                                     DIANA
                         Keep 'em closed now.

               She leads her mother to the dining room.

                                     DIANA
                         O.K., open 'em.

               MOLLY LUNA opens her eyes. Theresa and Diana beam. Diana 
               kisses her mother who almost cries.

                                     DIANA
                         Happy birthday, momma.

                                     THERESA
                              (in Italian)
                         Happy birthday, Molly.

               Diana hands Molly a card from the table. Molly starts to 
               open it.

               Tony Luna burst in from another room.

                                     TONY LUNA
                         Molly! Pack me a bag! Quick! Ok? 
                         C'mon I'm in a hurry!

               Molly heads for the stairs, leaving behind the half opened 
               card.

                                     MOLLY
                         But Tony, why...?

                                     TONY LUNA
                         Business! C'mon, move. Do what I 
                         tell you!

               Molly goes upstairs. Diana is pissed.

                                     DIANA
                         Don't do it, momma! Make him pack 
                         his own bag.

                                     TONY LUNA
                         I ain't got time to put up with your 
                         bullshit today.

               Tony goes to the phone, dials, gets a busy signal, and slams 
               it down.

               Theresa sits down watching sadly.

               Diana goes to stand in front of her father.

                                     DIANA
                         Listen goddammit! It's momma's 
                         birthday! She deserves better'n this!

               Tony sorts through the closet looking for a jacket.

               Gamiani comes in puffing with a clumsily wrapped present 
               under his arm.

                                     GAMIANI
                         Hey, Tony. What's shaking? Sorry I'm 
                         late. I got stuck on Wacker. Some 
                         spook...

                                     TONY LUNA
                         Victor Comacho is alive.

                                     GAMIANI
                         Oh sweet Jesus.

               Diana is really angry at her father ignoring her.

                                     DIANA
                         You can't go now.

                                     TONY LUNA
                         Shut up!

               He slaps her. She slaps him back, turns, grabs her purse, 
               and runs out.

               Tony watches her go and turns to Gamiani.

                                     TONY LUNA
                         Put someone on the house. And you 
                         keep an eye on her.

               He nods out the door.

                                     GAMIANI
                         You got it, Tony. What about your 
                         uncle?

                                     TONY LUNA
                         What Felix don't know doesn't hurt 
                         him.

               Molly comes down with the bag. Tony takes it from her and 
               starts out the door. Suddenly he turns back, snatches 
               Gamiani's present from his hands, and thrust it at his wife.

                                     TONY LUNA
                         Here. Happy birthday.

               Tony rushes out the door. Gamiani goes to the phone.

               Molly is left alone in the doorway.

               EXT. EDDIE'S STREET - DAY

               Eddie parks in front of his apartment building, leaves the 
               car, and enters the building.

               INT. EDDIE'S HALL - DAY

               Dead on his feet, Eddie reaches the top of the stairs and an 
               object comes flying at him out of the shadows. ODELL, a slim 
               10 year old black kid, fakes a series of karate kicks at 
               Eddie.

                                     ODELL
                         Bow to your master!

                                     EDDIE
                         Later, Odell. It's been a rough one.

                                     ODELL
                         Y' tellin me! We all seen it on the 
                         TV!

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Odell!

                                     EDDIE
                         Bow to your master.

               Odell takes off.

                                     EDDIE
                         Hey, Odell. Here, make yourself crazy.

               The kid stops, and Eddie tosses him the Rubic's Cube.

               Eddie nears his apartment, we hear a MALE VOICE SINGING.

               INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

               The door is ajar. Eddie lives in a modest apartment. FRED 
               PIRELLI, a great bear of a man, 65, sings at the top of his 
               lungs. He is bent over the space heater, tearing it apart.

                                     PIRELLI
                         You look like shit.

                                     EDDIE
                         Thanks, pal.

                                     PIRELLI
                         They had a shot on the tube of you 
                         guys comin' out in front of the 
                         building. How's Donato?

               Eddie collapses on the sofa.

                                     EDDIE
                         Pissed cause he lost a shoe.
                              (pause)
                         Luis Comacho is in town.

                                     PIRELLI
                         He'll collect himself some scalps 
                         before this one's over. Your answering 
                         machine is on the fritz again. Some 
                         woman with a fantastic voice was 
                         callin' about comin' over this weekend 
                         ta help you with somthin', and then 
                         the tape went nuts.

                                     EDDIE
                         Want somthin' to drink?

                                     PIRELLI
                         Does the Pope shit in the woods? Is 
                         a bear Catholic?

                                     ODELL
                         Me too.

               Odell shows in the doorway. Eddie gets up and the kid tosses 
               him the Rubic's Cube -- all done.

               Eddie looks at it, and the kid goes into the kitchen.

                                     EDDIE
                         I hate smart ass kids.

               Odell laughs.

                                     PIRELLI
                         Gonna get down in the 30's tonight. 
                         Your pilot light is out.

               Eddie tosses the Cube into the waste basket and opens the 
               refrigerator.

                                     EDDIE
                         I've been told that more than once.

                                     PIRELLI
                              (seriously)
                         So, who you figure pulled out the 
                         rug? Gypsies? Mob?

               Eddie comes back into the living room, hands a beer and a 
               soda to Odell, and flops back on the sofa with his own beer.

                                     EDDIE
                         Somebody knew what they were doin'. 
                         They blew the top off an anthill.

               Pirelli reaches for his drink and Odell hands him the soda. 
               Pirelli grabs the beer before Odell can drink and switches.

                                     PIRELLI
                         I'd figure the Mob but Scalese ain't 
                         that stupid.
                              (pause)
                         Hah! Sombody put the valve in 
                         backwards.

               Pirelli and Odell turn to Eddie who tries to look innocent -- 
               but fails. Eddie purposefully studies the answering machine 
               on the coffee table in front of him.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Odell! I ain't calling you again!

                                     ODELL
                         Later, fellas.

               Pirelli finishes with the heater, and gets up.

                                     PIRELLI
                         There. Heat.

                                     EDDIE
                         What was the Cubs final score?

                                     PIRELLI
                         8 to 1.

               Eddie punches a button on the answering machine. It spews 
               tape across the table.

                                     PIRELLI
                         Machines just don't like you.

               Pirelli grabs the machine, unplugs it, and carries it out 
               the door toward his own apartment.

                                     EDDIE
                         Maybe I don't like machines.

               EXT. SOLDIER FIELD - DAY

               The machine in question looks like a miniature tank. This is 
               the "Prowler," a robot anti-terrorist vehicle that is being 
               maneuvered around various obstacles in a demonstration for 
               the city's law enforcement agencies.

               The "Prowler" is amazingly agile. And its BULLHORN VOICE 
               breaks everybody up.

                                     VOICE
                              (from speaker)
                         Arretez! Halten Zie! Stop! Do not 
                         move! No se mueve!...

               The machine's three video eyes, searching the crowd 
               independently, give it the appearance of an extra-industrial 
               bug. One camera is mounted on a telescoping mast which extends 
               to give it the perspective of a giraffe. The thing seems 
               almost alive.

               Commander Kates is here, leading a contingent of departmental 
               brass. With them are several dozen officers and a gaggle of 
               city councilmen.

               The Prowler is being put through its paces by the FACTORY 
               ENGINEER. He controls the machine with a pistol-grip device 
               that looks like a small TV camera.

                                     ENGINEER
                         ...After the gyros are locked, any 
                         movement of the hand controller is 
                         duplicated by the 'Prowler.'

               He turns his hand to the right and the Prowler, 50 yards 
               away, sweeps its turret to the right, aiming the twin 30 
               calibre machineguns at the politicians. They move aside.

                                     ENGINEER
                         This simple control system means 
                         that even semi-skilled employees can 
                         operate the unit with a minimum of 
                         training. As they say, "Even a child 
                         can operate it."

               Standing with Chief Kates, Eddie watches the demonstration 
               with contempt. Kates turns to him.

                                     KATES
                         He's talking about you, Cusack. Pay 
                         attention. You're all gonna have to 
                         be qualified on this. It's the future.

                                     EDDIE
                         Just what the world needs, another 
                         gun without a brain.

                                     KATES
                         You're looking at the perfect cop. 
                         The damn thing follows orders.

               Eddie has seen enough.

                                     EDDIE
                         I got better things to do than play 
                         with toys.

               Kates is about to say something when the demonstrator 
               interrupts.

                                     ENGINEER
                         If the Commander will pick someone 
                         to try and elude 'Prowler,' we can 
                         show how our various target 
                         acquisition systems function.

               Kates points to Eddie, and smiles.

               Instantly the turret sweeps the horizon and locks on Eddie 
               as he walks across the astro turf.

               CLOSE-UP of the Prowler's hand controller.

               The MONITOR SCREEN shows the crosshairs on the back of Eddie's 
               head. ON THE SCREEN the digital readout says: LOCKED AND 
               TRACKING.

                                     MACHINE
                              (from speaker)
                         Bang. You're dead.

               Eddie keeps walking, seemingly oblivious to the Prowler. 
               Suddenly he whirls and ducks behind a wall out of the 
               Prowler's sight.

               He pops up with his gun pointed at the Prowler's controller.

                                     EDDIE
                         Drop it.

               The controller, scared shitless, drops the hand control.

               The Prowler dies -- the plug pulled.

               Eddie smiles at Kates, and exits.

               INT. MORGUE VIEWING ROOM - DAY

               The curtain is drawn back from the viewing window and the 
               Comachos SEE the bodies of their cousins. Luis is here with 
               Pompas, Efren, and Victor. Their attorney, Sanchez, has joined 
               them. They are speaking Spanish.

                                     SANCHEZ
                              (subtitle)
                         A war does no good for any of us. It 
                         can only make what is bad worse.

               Luis says nothing. He looks through the window at the bodies. 
               Finally he speaks.

                                     LUIS
                              (subtitle)
                         Get them out of here. Fix them up. I 
                         want them to be beautiful for their 
                         mother.

               He kisses his fingertips and touches the glass.

                                     LUIS
                              (subtitle)
                         I promise you, my brothers, there 
                         will be blood for blood.

               Sanchez sighs.

               INT. MORGUE HALL - DAY

               Luis Comacho storms out of the room into the corridor followed 
               by the others.

               Eddie and Kosalas are just entering. Victor spots Eddie and 
               turns to Luis.

                                     VICTOR
                              (subtitles)
                         This is the cop.

               The Comachos slow down. The two groups survey each other -- 
               Luis, hatred oozing from his eyes. And Eddie, without slowing, 
               looks the vicious Colombian over with cool contempt.

               Eddie walks by.

                                     LUIS
                         How much did they pay you to set up 
                         my brothers, Pig.

               Eddie freezes, makes a slow turn, and meets Luis' eyes.

               Suddenly Eddie moves, faster than anyone else can react to, 
               and he has Luis pinned to the wall, choking him.

                                     EDDIE
                         Stay off my streets, asshole. Or 
                         I'll bite your head off, and shit in 
                         your neck.

               He releases Luis just as quickly, and turns to walk out, 
               Kosalas backing with him, hand on gun.

               Luis gets some air back, and starts to scream.

                                     LUIS
                              (subtitle)
                         You're meat cop! Dead meat!

               The other Comachos have to restrain him.

               INT. MORGUE EXAMINING ROOM - DAY

               Retired detective HANK FLANNIGAN runs the high-tech morgue 
               where the bodies are stacked on trays like bakery buns. 
               Flannigan, a trim, bespectacled Mr. Clean, clicks his false 
               teeth between thoughts.

               The body on the exotic lab table is the gunman Eddie shot 
               during the raid. Eddie is here to confirm the identification. 
               His new partner, Kosalas, is with him, very uncomfortable in 
               this setting.

                                     FLANNIGAN
                         Eenie Verona is the gentleman's name.
                              (looks down)
                         You did a hell of a job on him.

                                     EDDIE
                         I was motivated.

               Flannigan has already pulled Verona's record. He hands it to 
               Eddie who passes it on to Kosalas without looking at it. 
               Kosalas concentrates on the file, uneasy with the dead.

                                     FLANNIGAN
                         Know him?

                                     EDDIE
                         He's a punk. Punk thief. Booster.

                                     FLANNIGAN
                         Looks like he graduated.

                                     EDDIE
                         He had a brother-in-law. They were 
                         tight. Served time together. 
                         Ganelli..., Gagleone...

                                     KOSALAS
                         Gamiani.

               Eddie looks at Kosalas who glances up from the report 
               triumphantly.

                                     FLANNIGAN
                         If I was you, I'd sit on him.

                                     KOSALAS
                         You figure he's connected?

               Eddie just smiles.

                                     FLANNIGAN
                         Looks like you're gonna be busy, 
                         Cusack. Uh, you gonna be using those 
                         Cubs' tickets?

               Eddie reaches into his pocket, and tosses a ticket to 
               Flannigan who grins.

               INT. EDDIE'S CAR - NIGHT

               Eddie and Kosalas cruise the Rush Street area at night. They 
               search the neon lit crowds on the sidewalks for a glimpse of 
               Lou Gamiani.

               EXT. GAMIANI'S STREET - DAY

               On a tree-shaded block of classic brownstones, the unmarked 
               car is parked at the corner.

               INT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY

               Eddie is at the wheel wearing a sportscoat and sweater, 
               scanning the sports page. Kosalas is nervous and chatty, 
               bubbling. He's still reading the records from the morgue.

                                     KOSALAS
                         This Ganiani's a swinger, huh?

                                     EDDIE
                         He's just makin' up for the time he 
                         spent in the joint.

               EXT. GAMIANI'S STREET - DAY

               LOU GAMIANI, 55, Italian, and huge, comes out the front door 
               of a brownstone, and gives a perfunctory kiss to his aging 
               "Playmate", who stands in the doorway in a housecoat. Gamiani 
               comes down the steps, and jumps into a car.

               In the car with Gamiani, a fat man, TITO, is at the wheel. 
               They pull into the street passing the unmarked car.

               EXT. NORTH SIDE STREET - DAY

               Trailing Gamiani and his partner through the North Side 
               neighborhoods, they wind up in Lincoln Park.

               With considerable skill Kosalas and Eddie manage to stick to 
               them undetected.

               EXT. PARK - DAY

               Gamiani and Tito park by the botanical gardens and stroll 
               past the fields of flowers into the zoo. Eddie and Kosalas 
               follow.

                                     KOSALAS
                         Now what? They selling protection to 
                         the bears?

                                     EDDIE
                         Relax kid.

               EXT. CHILDREN'S ZOO - DAY

               Strolling among the baby elephants and fuzzy rabbits, the 
               two heavies could not be more out of place. Tito has a racing 
               form. Lou, tall enough to see over heads, looks like a loose 
               gorilla on the prowl. He is searching for somebody.

               Surrounding the incubators filled with hatching chicks is a 
               cluster of schoolchildren.

               They are having a ball.

               Eddie has noticed DIANA, a lovely 19 year old who is in charge 
               of the children.

               And she has noticed Gamiani. She's visibly upset.

                                     KOSALAS (V.O.)
                         What's this? Kinda young for that 
                         old fart ain't she?

                                     EDDIE (V.O.)
                         Just watch, kid. Learn.

               Diana leaves the children with the zoo lecturer.

                                     DIANA
                         Be back in a minute.

               She crosses to the two goons and looks up at Gamiani.

                                     DIANA
                         What do you want?

                                     LOU
                         Your Papa worries about you.

                                     DIANA
                         Get out of here, Lou. Leave me alone.

               Gamiani shrugs, his pal Tito seems embarrassed, but they 
               don't move.

               INT. GORILLA HOUSE - DAY

               The CHILDREN SCREAM, and LULU, the half-ton baboon flies 
               into frame, swinging down from the artificial branches of an 
               iron tree in the three story central cage. The children clutch 
               at Diana in delightful terror. The gorilla, inches away, 
               kisses the thick glass that separates them.

               Lulu swings to the upper branches and sits, arms crossed, 
               staring eyeball-to-eyeball at her human counterpart, Gamiani. 
               Tito eats popcorn.

               Eddie and Kosalas walk behind a mother and child, each holding 
               a balloon.

               EXT. LIBRARY - DAY

               Diana is on the front steps of the library saying good-bye 
               to two of the children from the zoo. She hands them over to 
               their mothers, and goes up the steps into the building.

               Gamiani and Tito pull over and park down the street.

               Eddie comes around the corner, and follows her in.

               INT. LIBRARY HALL - DAY

               The sign on the door tells us this is the city's Special 
               Education Program office. Diana enters the office and confers 
               briefly with another staff member.

               INT. LIBRARY HALL - DAY

               Through the open door of the Special Education Program office, 
               Eddie observes Diana chatting with her co-workers.

               INT. READING ROOM - DAY

               Eddie follows as Diana walks through the great hall past 
               long tables and out the other door.

               EXT. LIBRARY - DAY

               Diana comes down the steps, wading through the swarm of 
               homebound commuters, and catches a cab.

               And head and shoulders above the crowd, scanning the tops of 
               heads, is Lou Gamiani.

               Tito comes around the corner in his car, and pulls up to the 
               curb. Gamiani jumps in, and they take off after Diana's cab.

               Eddie and Kosalas follow in Eddie's car.

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               Diana enters an apartment building.

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               By the time Diana exits it is dark. She is with a friend, 
               and both are in some kind of Halloween costume. They catch a 
               cab.

               EXT. PARTY STREET - NIGHT

               The taxi stops in front of an ancient brick loft building. 
               Diana and her friend get out and hit the buzzer at an unmarked 
               door. The door opens and they disappears inside.

               Gamiani's car cruises past. It pulls up at the corner and 
               it's lights switch off.

               Eddie's car pulls up. Eddie hops out. Kosalas slides behind 
               the wheel.

               INT. EDDIE'S CAR - NIGHT

               Eddie leans down to the open drivers window.

                                     EDDIE
                         Hold here a second.

               Eddie goes to the back of the car, and Kosalas follows him 
               in the rearview mirror, losing sight when Eddie pops open 
               the trunk.

               Kosalas watches the party goers enter the building.

               There is a tapping at the window.

               Eddie has donned a baseball uniform, matching cap, and now 
               carries a baseball bat with a pair of cleats hanging from 
               it.

                                     EDDIE
                         Keep with Gamiani.

               Eddie tosses the keys back to Kosalas, and heads to the 
               building. Kosalas calls to him.

                                     KOSALAS
                         Bang a few for me.

               INT. PARTY STAIRS - NIGHT

               In the darkened stairway Eddie joins a group of outrageously 
               dressed characters. The door at the top of the stairs bursts 
               open on a punk-funk art student Halloween party.

               INT. PARTY - NIGHT

               A hundred people are jammed into the studio. It feels like 
               the Star Wars Saloon. The LIVE MUSICIANS match the look of 
               the party. The costumes are outrageous. Everyone is dancing.

               Eddie looks the place over. He spots Diana.

               Eddie walks over to her, grabbing a drink along the way. He 
               sidles up to Diana.

                                     EDDIE
                         Wanna play ball?

               She looks him over taking in the outfit, the bat.

                                     DIANA
                         Are you pitching?

                                     EDDIE
                         Some people say I've got a pretty 
                         good inside curve.

                                     DIANA
                         I don't know. You look strictly minor 
                         league.

               She smiles.

                                     EDDIE
                         I'm Eddie.

                                     DIANA
                         I make it Eddie-The-Cop.

                                     EDDIE
                         You've had a lot of experience with 
                         cops?

                                     DIANA
                         All bad.

               She is angry now, and walks away from him.

               Eddie watches her go, and is about to follow. He sets his 
               drink down, and turns to find a girl, luscious as hell, 
               dressed like a Frederick's wet dream, making eyes at him. 
               She takes his bat, and gives it a long, lascivious lick.

                                     EDDIE
                         You'll get slivers.

               He walks by her.

               INT. PARTY BACK ROOM - NIGHT

               Eddie steps over and around an assortment of wasted witches 
               and gooned out goblins snorting lines on the coffee table to 
               get to Diana who is tensely by herself.

               He grabs her purse.

                                     DIANA
                         Hey, what the hell do you think you're 
                         doing?

                                     EDDIE
                         I thought you knew all about cops. 
                         You don't put anything up your nose 
                         do you?

               Eddie searches Diana's purse. He find her drivers license.

                                     EDDIE
                         Diana Luna?
                              (pause)
                         You're Tony Luna's daughter?

               He drops the license into the purse and hands it back to 
               her. She stares him in the eye defiantly.

                                     DIANA
                         I don't know where he is, and I don't 
                         really give a shit.
                              (tired)
                         When are you people going to realize 
                         I don't have anything to do with my 
                         father.

               Eddie tries to give her his card.

                                     EDDIE
                         For when you need a friend.

               She won't take it.

                                     DIANA
                         I've got all the friends I want.

               Eddie puts the card into her purse.

                                     EDDIE
                         But do you have all the friends you 
                         need?

               She walks away angrily. Eddie watches her leave, and then 
               steps over a few of the wasted witches to get to the phone 
               on the drug laden coffee table. He dials.

                                     EDDIE
                              (to phone)
                         This is Sergeant Cusack. I want a 
                         team to cover a house on the southwest 
                         side.
                              (pause)
                         L-U-N-A, Anthony.
                              (pause)
                         Yeah. Crazy Tony Luna. I don't think 
                         he's around, but if he shows up bring 
                         him in.

               The dope-smoking party-goers stare at this cop in shock. One 
               of the ladies tries to casually cover the cocaine with a 
               magazine. Eddie hangs up the phone, and pushes past them to 
               the door.

                                     EDDIE
                              (nods)
                         Catch you later.

               He is out the door.

               INT. GYM - DAY

               Several plainclothes officers, some of them women, stand on 
               either side of the door with their backs to the wall, guns 
               at the ready. One of the men reaches out and POUNDS on the 
               door.

                                     OFFICER
                         Police! Open up!

               They rush the door and SMASH it, SHOUTING and scrambling 
               into the apartment.

                                     KOBAS (V.O.)
                              (from bullhorn)
                         Awright awright hold it.

               The instructor, Kobas, walks in criticizing their style.

                                     KOBAS
                         For Christ's sake! You tryin to get 
                         your partner killed, Jackson?

               This is not the real thing; only practice.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL --

               INT. GYM - DAY

               The apartment is only a mockup set in the corner of this 
               vast skylit city warehouse. Runners race around the track at 
               the perimeter.

               On the wall are large photos and diagrams of the Prowler. 
               Below the photos are sign-up sheets for the required training 
               sessions.

               In another corner is the weight room, the ring, and the 
               workout area. Eddie is here, working out, sparring with a 
               partner who has large padded mits on each hand.

               INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

               Brennan and a couple of buddies approach Kosalas as he ties 
               his gym shoes. Brennan is carrying a petition. He hands it 
               to Kosalas and looks around the room. He spots another cop. 
               Cragie is in the background putting on his jacket.

                                     BRENNAN
                              (shouts across the 
                              room)
                         Hey, Mahoney. I want you to help me 
                         get some signatures on this letter 
                         for Cragie.

               Brennan looks down at Kosalas who is hesitating. Kosalas 
               looks back at Cragie. There eyes meet. He signs.

               Cragie comes by and slaps him on the back.

                                     CRAGIE
                         Way to go, partner.

               INT. GYM - DAY

               We see Music talking to several cops working out the exercise 
               machines, and getting signatures on Cragie's petition.

               INT. GYM - DAY

               Eddie gives his sparring partner, Howard, a furious series 
               of blows, driving him back. They are kickboxing.

                                     HOWARD
                         Let's try the mitts for awhile.

               Eddie nods. He sees Cragie cross the gym and exit. As Cragie 
               goes out, Donato comes in on crutches. Everybody shouts a 
               greeting.

               Eddie sits down to change gloves, and take his footpads off.

                                     DONATO
                         Say, partner.

                                     EDDIE
                         How ya doing, Richie?

                                     DONATO
                         Swinging. How's this? Two G's, we 
                         get a sausage and beef stand stand 
                         outside Wrigley Field. You pass the 
                         beef, I take the cash. Free games. I 
                         got a contact downtown.

                                     EDDIE
                         How you gonna watch the game if you're 
                         hawking sandwiches?

                                     DONATO
                         Never thought of that. TV? Hey, I 
                         tell you about this nurse I met? 
                         Talk about physical therapy.

               The sparring partner returns, and Eddie goes back to practice.

                                     DONATO
                         She's got this friend just dying to 
                         meet you. Intensive care.

               Eddie grins.

               Brennan comes up to Donato, and hands him the petition. Donato 
               signs quickly.

                                     DONATO
                              (to Eddie)
                         Later, partner.

               Eddie nods to him, concentrating on the sparring.

                                     BRENNAN
                         Hey, Cusack. How about taking the 
                         gloves off long enough to sign this 
                         for Cragie.

                                     EDDIE
                         This about the hearing?

                                     BRENNAN
                         You bet.

                                     EDDIE
                         I pass.

                                     BRENNAN
                              (angry)
                         What the fuck's the matter with you?

                                     EDDIE
                         He's burnt, Brennan, and you know 
                         it. He was a good cop, but he ain't 
                         now.

               PUNCH! Eddie hits the mit so hard that Howard is knocked 
               back a couple of steps.

                                     BRENNAN
                         Get off your high horse, Cusack. He 
                         made a couple of mistakes, OK. The 
                         guy was a hero. What the fuck does a 
                         bunch of civilians know about comin' 
                         up some shithouse stairway day after 
                         day, scared outta your shorts.

               PUNCH! With a whirling kick, Eddie knocks the mit right out 
               of the Howard's hand, and across the gym.

               Eddie turns to face Brennan, nose to nose.

                                     EDDIE
                         We're all scared, Brennan. Cragie 
                         should have been off the street a 
                         long time ago. He's gonna hurt 
                         somebody else with his bullshit. 
                         Maybe even you.

               Eddie goes back to punching. Brennan storms out.

               EXT. LATIN STREET - DAY

               A funeral cortege makes it's way sedately down the street 
               past the Comacho owned pool hall. Two hearses, a flower car, 
               a limo, and several other cars with funeral stickers on their 
               windshields pass bye. The slain Comacho cousins from the 
               raid are being escorted to the cemetery.

               Luis Comacho is in the limo along with the woman from the 
               airport.

               INT. BRENNAN'S CAR - DAY

               Brennan and Music are following the procession. Brennan is 
               on the radio.

                              (to mike)
                         The funeral director says they plan 
                         on cruisin right past luna's house.

               EXT. LUNA'S STREET - DAY

               Tito, one of Tony Luna's bodyguards, watches from the steps 
               of Luna's porch as a procession of cars follows the hearses 
               slowly up the street.

               At the end of the block, an old man is selling produce to 
               the neighborhood housewives off the tailgate of his truck. 
               They watch the procession in wonder.

               INT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY

               The cortege passes the unmarked car down the block from Tony's 
               house. Eddie is watching. Kosalas is with him.

                                     KOSALAS
                              (to radio)
                         They're wastin' the show. Tony's not 
                         even in town.

                                     EDDIE
                         He'll get the word.

               Across the street, WE SEE another bodyguard joint Tito on 
               the front steps. They stand, arms folded, watching the 
               procession.

               INT. LIMO - DAY

               Luis Comacho takes a flower and tosses it out the window as 
               he cruises past the two goons. Their EYES LOCK. Tito walks 
               up and grinds the flower into the ground with his shoe.

               EXT. LUNA'S STREET - DAY

               Brennan and Music bring up the rear in their ummarked car.

               INT. LUNA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Tito, the body guard, picks up the phone.

               At the pay phone next to a lakeside bait shop, Tony Luna is 
               getting the word. He's worried.

                                     LUNA
                              (to phone)
                         What the fuck are you talkin about? 
                         Nobody's gonna touch nothin. Just 
                         stay put.
                              (pause)
                         I give a shit about their fuckin 
                         parade?

               A floozy slides up next to him, and he puts an arm around 
               her waist.

                                     LUNA
                              (to phone)
                         They wanna throw flowers we can fix 
                         it so they're pushing up daisys.

               He laughs. The girl joins in like she's supposed to.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               A tan Dodge rolls over the rutted scrapyard roadway, bouncing 
               toward the immense old warehouse along the river's edge. The 
               city seems to have abandoned this remote industrial area; 
               giant grain elevators, rusting freighters and vast scrapyards 
               surround us.

               INT. POMPAS' CAR - DAY

               Pompas and Efren Comacho drive through the gate and enter 
               the warehouse as the door opens for them.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               The car halts in the vast empty chamber. It is quickly 
               surrounded by members of the Comacho family. They begin to 
               unload the car. The trunk is filled with cases of heavy 
               ammunition.

               At the back of the warehouse, other Comachos are test firing 
               their weapons.

               INT. LUIS' OFFICE

               Luis is directing things as they are preparing for battle. 
               The weaponry spread on the table is astonishing.

               EXT. HARBOR - DAY

               Eddie's beat up Chevy is parked beyond the line of yachts 
               toward the end of the pier. Eddie gets out of the car. Kosalas 
               looks worried.

                                     KOSALAS
                         I can back you up.

                                     EDDIE
                         Stay by the radio.

               Eddie walks to the 75 foot steel cruiser tied to the end of 
               the pier.

               Eddie walks up the gangplank.

               EXT. YACHT - DAY

               An ape in a suit, ROCCO, appears.

                                     ROCCO
                         What the hell you doin' here? Off, 
                         asshole.

               Rocco goes for Eddie. A couple of quick blows and Rocco is 
               in the water. Eddie continues up the gangway to the rear of 
               the boat.

               EXT. YACHT - DAY

               Eddie finds FELIX (THE RAIL) SCALESE sitting on a chaise 
               lounge, reading. A beautiful girl lays on her stomach on a 
               deck pad typing at a personal computer terminal.

               Scalese looks up at Eddie. He is momentarily discombobulated, 
               but recovers.

                                     SCALESE
                              (referring to computer)
                         The modern age's answer to the crystal 
                         ball. Marvelous. If you know how to 
                         read it.
                              (pause)
                         Listen. If you have some extra cash, 
                         buy oranges. The price is low, and I 
                         can promise you the threatened 
                         trucking strike will be avoided.

                                     EDDIE
                         We talking about a bribe, Scalese?

                                     SCALESE
                         It's a prediction.

               Another beautiful bikinied girl comes by and gives Scalese a 
               tall cool drink.

                                     SCALESE
                         No. I wouldn't try to bribe Eddie 
                         Cusack.

               He drops the name with a smile. Eddie doesn't react.

                                     SCALESE
                         You're incorruptible. Untarnished. I 
                         hear they call you stainless steel 
                         on the street. Me, I think you're a 
                         fuckin' pain in the ass.

                                     EDDIE
                         Thanks.

                                     SCALESE
                              (frowning)
                         It's not a compliment.

                                     EDDIE
                         I'm looking for your nephew.

                                     SCALESE
                         Tony? Forget it. Tony Luna's none of 
                         your business.

                                     EDDIE
                         Wrong. Tony just made himself my 
                         business.

                                     SCALESE
                         No he didn't. We take care of our 
                         own. Just like the cops. Just like 
                         the Comachos. You understand.

               Eddie sits down next to Scalese and looks him in the eye.

                                     EDDIE
                         He shit on my turf, old man. And I'm 
                         going to nail him and anybody else 
                         tied to him. You understand, Felix?

                                     SCALESE
                              (with cool rage)
                         Nobody threatens Felix Scalese.

                                     EDDIE
                              (softly)
                         It's not a threat. It's a prediction.

               On the shore, Kosalas is honking the car horn to get Eddie's 
               attention. Eddie rises.

                                     EDDIE
                         There's a shitstorm coming. You better 
                         get yourself a good umbrella.

               The girl at the computer terminal watches him leave.

               EXT. YACHT - DAY

               Eddie walks by as Rocco, soaking wet, is pulling himself 
               from the water. Eddie pushes him into the water again.

               Kosalas is still sounding the HORN.

               EXT. HARBOR - DAY

               Eddie runs toward the car.

               EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

               A body lies in the flowers in the service area next to the 
               giant greenhouse. Several unmarked cars and two blue and 
               whites are parked in the dirt drive as Eddie and Kosalas 
               pull up. The cops have roped off the area. Music and Brennan 
               are there.

               Eddie looks at the body as Music comes over.

                                     MUSIC
                         Tony Luna's bagman.

               Kosalas looks at the body.

                                     MUSIC
                         They call that a Columbian necktie.

               Kosalas winces.

                                     MUSIC
                         They found the manager of Tony's 
                         restaurant hanging from a hook in 
                         his kitchen. Looked like someone 
                         tried to carve a canoe out of him. 
                         Tony's used car lot on Ashland is 
                         burning as we speak. The head salesman 
                         is a fried zuccini.

                                     KOSALAS
                         Oh Jesus. It's starting.

               Eddie stands to one side.

                                     EDDIE
                         Let's go.

               EXT. LUNA'S STREET - DAY

               A kid on a bike makes his way up the quiet tree-lined street, 
               tossing newspapers onto the porches of the block.

               Around the corner at the end of the block, the produce truck 
               starts slowly forward. As it turns onto Luna's block, a car 
               pulls up behind it and stops, blocking the street.

               The produce truck parks at the curb in front of the Luna 
               house. A neighbor from across the street approaches. The 
               front door of Luna's house opens, and Tito emerges, helping 
               Tony's aged mother down the steps to buy vegetables.

               INT. PRODUCE TRUCK - DAY

               On the floor near the wheelwell is the dead produce man.

               EXT. LUNA'S STREET - DAY

               The rear doors of the produce truck swing open. The neighbor, 
               Tito, and Tony's mother are instantly killed.

               From outside three Comachos enter the open front door of the 
               Luna house. We hear the SOUND of MUFFLED GUNFIRE from inside.

               INT. LUNA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Bits and pieces. A Shattered orange juice container. Eggs 
               cooking on the stove. A woman's vanity.

               On the floor; a woman's legs, a housecoat, slippers. A 
               silhouette of a Comacho in the hallway RAKING one of Tony's 
               guards.

               A family photo on the mantle which includes Diana and her 
               father is BLASTED to bits.

               EXT. LUNA'S BACK YARD - DAY

               One of Tony's men tries to escape through the back of the 
               house. He is pursued by a Comacho who guns him down.

               EXT. LUNA'S STREET - DAY

               Luis Comacho sits in a car in the next block surveying the 
               scene. The cousins are walking briskly out. They jump in a 
               car and drive off.

               INT. LUIS' CAR - DAY

               Luis nods to his driver. They pull away.

               EXT. LUNA'S STREET - DAY

               The street is QUIET again. Next door, a neighbor, wearing 
               only his underpants and carrying an old pistol, stands 
               trembling in disbelief.

               EXT. LAKE - DAY

               Pines reflect in the dappled lake as Tony Luna rows slowly 
               for shore. He ties up at the dock. He's taking his tackle 
               out of the boat when one of his boys comes running down to 
               the dock.

               We cannot hear the conversation but we can see Tony drop the 
               tackle box and we can hear his SCREAM echo across the water.

               EXT. EDDIE'S STREET - DAY

               Eddie runs down the rear stairs to Kosalas' unmarked car. He 
               opens the driver's door, pushes Kosalas across the seat, and 
               gets behind the wheel. He PEELS OUT.

               INT. UNMARKED CAR - DAY

                                     KOSALAS
                         Music's at the scene.

               Eddie picks up the mike.

                                     EDDIE
                              (to mike)
                         Was there a girl? Late teens. Reddish 
                         hair.

                                     MUSIC (V.O.)
                              (on radio)
                         Two male caucasians, two female. One 
                         mid-to-late forties. The other a 
                         grandmother.

               With the SIREN full out, LEANING ON the HORN, he simply puts 
               his foot on the floor and sends the car into a four wheel 
               drift that slides into a neat U-turn.

               EXT. LIBRARY - DAY

               Eddie leaves the car running, and burst through the main 
               entrance flashing his badge at the stunned security guards.

               INT. LIBRARY - DAY

               Eddie races through the corridors and reading rooms searching, 
               Kosalas arriving at his heels.

               INT. LIBRARY - DAY

               Gamiani tells Diana about her mother and grandmother.

               INT. LIBRARY - DAY

               Three Comachos; Pompas, Efren, and ANGEL, search for Diana.

               EXT. LIBRARY - DAY

               Lou Gamiani emerges from the building with Diana. She is 
               terrified.

               He checks out the scene, then descends the crowded steps and 
               crosses the street, keeping a sharp lookout.

               EXT. FLOWER SHOP - DAY

               Luis and Victor Comacho loiter by the outdoor flower stand 
               next to the library. They watch the activity on the library 
               steps.

               EXT. LIBRARY - DAY

               Distracted for an instant by a cluster of conventioneers, 
               Lou fails to notice the two Comachos who have fallen in step 
               behind them. He goes down with a gasp, almost silently, a 
               knife sticking from his back. A Comacho grabs Diana's arm. 
               She jabs him in the eyes, and runs.

               Diana disappears into the crowd.

               Hysterical citizens scatter in all directions. A woman stands 
               in horror unable to keep from looking at Gamiani's body lying 
               on the sidewalk. She SCREAMS.

               Eddie and Kosalas come crashing out of the entrance of the 
               museum.

               The girl isn't here.

               Eddie spots a commotion at the end of the block, under the 
               el station.

               He dashes down the steps and across the street with traffic 
               screeching to a halt.

               Kosalas flags down a blue and white, and barks for backup, 
               then tears out after Eddie.

               EXT. WABASH AVENUE - DAY

               In the shadow of the el tracks, Diana runs for her life, 
               racing north on Wabash through crowds of shoppers with the 
               Comachos moving relentlessly a half block behind.

               Opposite Marshall Field's, she abruptly cuts across traffic 
               and runs into an alley between the giant men's and women's 
               stores.

               With terror in her eyes, Diana runs, searching frantically 
               for a guard, a policeman, somebody with a gun. But the 
               Comachos are closing in on her.

               She dives through a revolving door into the building.

               INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

               Diana runs past the perfume displays, notions, and lingerie, 
               and out the Randolph Street exit.

               EXT. RANDOLPH STREET - DAY

               Two Camachos, who stayed on the street, spot her as she 
               leaves.

               Racing through the alley, Eddie spots them running in the 
               next block.

               EXT. LAKE STREET - DAY

               Running east on Lake Street, she glances over her shoulder. 
               She doesn't see them. She ducks into the alley. But the 
               Comachos round the corner just in time to catch a glimpse of 
               her.

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               This alley leads to the lower level of Michigan Avenue. She 
               turns back to find the exit blocked by the Comachos. She 
               flees downward.

               INT. LOWER MICHIGAN - DAY

               The green flourescents of the "Emerald City" give a deathly 
               cast to the underground street as Diana rounds the corner, 
               and collapses against the wall. Her heart pounding like a 
               frightened deer, she has run as far as she can.

               Pompas Comacho and two of his colleagues come racing around 
               the corner. They spot her crouched against the wall.

               She starts to SCREAM but Angel grabs her by the collar and 
               pulls her up to his face and she stops, wide-eyed with terror 
               as he touches her throat with his knife.

                                     POMPAS
                         Come on, Chika. We gonna have some 
                         fun. You gonna take us to your father.

               We hear a loud metallic CLICK. We see the barrel of a huge 
               revolver. They wheel to see Eddie crouched, gun drawn, in 
               the alley entrance.

                                     EDDIE
                         Pompas, you're getting to be a fucking 
                         pain in the ass.

               The boys put their hands up, but Eddie doesn't see the third, 
               SAMO, coming up behind him.

               Angel grabs Diana by the hair, shielding himself, and starts 
               backing up the stairs that lead to the street.

                                     EDDIE
                         Let her go, pooch.

               Samo jumps Eddie, and the gun goes flying. It hits the 
               pavement and bounces off the high curb into the street.

               In a staggering blur Eddie takes out the Comachos, kicking 
               the last one end over end. But Angel and the girl have 
               disappeared to the street above.

               Eddie retrieves his gun and runs up the steps.

               EXT. STATE LAKE EL STATION - DAY

               With a knife at her side, Angel Comacho leads Diana up the 
               steps of the old el station. They pass through the turnstyle 
               out onto the platform just as the train pulls to in. Angel 
               forces her onto the train.

               Eddie comes pounding up the steps and onto the platform just 
               in time to stop the closing train door with his foot.

               INT. EL TRAIN - DAY

               Eddie wedges his way aboard and the train pulls out. The 
               passengers looks at him like he's crazy.

               Eddie works his way through the cars toward the rear.

               Angel spots him. Knife still in hand, he pulls Diana from 
               car to car past the terrified passengers until finally he is 
               cornered at the end of the train. Angel searches frantically 
               for a way out.

               Eddie enters. Diana sees him.

                                     ANGEL
                         Another step, and I take her head 
                         off.

                                     EDDIE
                         You don't have the balls.

               Eddie takes another step.

               Diana slams her elbow into Angel's groin, and breaks free.

               Angel jumps back. He breaks open the rear door and climbs 
               out.

               EXT. EL TRAIN - DAY

               Angel climbs up the back of the car onto the roof.

               Eddie's right behind him.

               The spectacular pursuit from car to car on the roof of the 
               speeding el train is witnessed by startled second-floor 
               secretaries whose desks look directly out at the roof of the 
               passing cars.

               VERY HIGH ANGLE

               Angel and Eddie's figures appear as specks, roaring through 
               the canyon of skyscrapers.

               ON TRAIN ROOF

               A low bridge forces both men to hug the roof of the train. 
               Eddie recovers first and grabs Angel, pulling him down. They 
               roll from side to side on the roof, nearly slipping over the 
               side. With a desperate shove, Angel breaks free. Eddie points 
               his gun at him. The train is now over the Chicago River. 
               Angel dives into the water.

               Eddie reholsters his gun and dives in after him.

               INT. EL TRAIN - DAY

               We see Diana's looking out the window of the train. She 
               follows Eddie's decent with her eyes.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               Dozens of startled pedestrians line the bridge railing as 
               Eddie swims toward Angel, bobbing in the middle of the stream.

               A hotdogger in a speedboat is racing up the river and Angel 
               is directly in his path. The skipper, showing off for his 
               passengers, doesn't notice him until he hears the sickening 
               THUNK under the keel. The boat's wake is suddenly red with 
               blood.

               EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY

               Eddie is helped from the water by a couple of passersby.

               He stands there, soaking wet, looking around.

               A crowd is gathering. We hear SIRENS in the background. Then 
               he spots her.

               Diana is standing on the bridge watching him.

               EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

               Eddie walks to Diana, and she folds into his arms. He holds 
               her a second.

               EXT. LAGOON - DAY

               Eddie, now in dry clothes, and Diana walk along the lagoon.

               They talk, argue, and she sits on a bench and cries. Eddie 
               comforts her.

                                     DIANA
                         Where are you taking me?

                                     EDDIE
                         Downtown first. Then I'm gonna place 
                         you in protective custody.

                                     DIANA
                         The hell you are!

                                     EDDIE
                         You'll be safe --

                                     DIANA
                         I'll take my chances.

               INT. EDDIE'S HALL - NIGHT

               Eddie and Diana climb the stairs.

               INT. PIRELLI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               The DOORBELL buzzes repeatedly.

                                     PIRELLI
                              (shouts)
                         Keep your goddamn pants on!

               Pirelli, padding across the floor in his shorts, looks like 
               a bear called out of hibernation. He has a service revolver 
               in his hand. He peers through the peep hole, then unbolts 
               the door.

                                     PIRELLI
                         This your idea of a social call?

               Eddie enters with Diana.

                                     EDDIE
                         Fred Pirelli, this is Diana. Diana 
                         Luna.

               Pirelli reacts to the name.

               Diana is in a daze, close to shock.

               Pirelli takes her and leads her to the couch.

                                     PIRELLI
                         C'mon, kid. Let's get you off your 
                         feet.

               Eddie motions him aside.

                                     EDDIE
                         Can you put her up till I find her 
                         old man?

                                     PIRELLI
                         Does a bear...?

                                     EDDIE
                         Am I putting you on the spot?

                                     PIRELLI
                         I spent 30 years on the spot. What 
                         ever you need.

               Eddie starts to go, and Diana reacts, suddenly frightened.

                                     DIANA
                         Eddie?

                                     EDDIE
                         I'll be right across the hall. I'm 
                         just gonna clean up.

               He leaves.

               INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT

               Eddie falls fully clothed onto the mattress. The PHONE RINGS.

               He rolls over in disbelief, staring at the ceiling.

               It RINGS, and RINGS again and again and again. He finally 
               picks it up.

               INT. TAVERN - NIGHT

               This is the after-hours watering hole for the police force 
               and half the cops we've seen so far, including Cragie, are 
               clustered at the bar or playing darts at the back of the 
               room. There are a half a dozen women there also. Three of 
               them are cops.

               Kosalas is here too. He's been drinking. He leans against 
               the wall talking on the pay phone by the men's room.

                                     KOSALAS
                              (to phone)
                         Say, Eddie. Why don' you come by and 
                         tip a few?
                              (pause)
                         Cause I gotta talk to you.
                              (pause)
                         Yeah, I know. But we gotta talk.
                              (pause)
                         Please.
                              (pause)
                         Yeah, at Mike's.

               He hangs up and heads back to his table, passing Officer 
               Music at the bar.

                                     MUSIC
                         You oughta crash, man. You had a 
                         helluva day.

               EXT. TAVERN - NIGHT

               Two tough looking guys are watching the entrance to the bar 
               from a car parked across the street. We can HEAR the NOISE 
               from the BAR.

                                     FIRST HOOD
                         Love it, Flash. Gonna be a slide. 
                         Easy in, easy out.

                                     SECOND HOOD
                         Just a quick and dirty?

                                     FIRST HOOD
                         Yeah, yeah, nothin to it. You know 
                         the drill.

               They check their weapons.

               INT. TAVERN - NIGHT

               Everybody but Kosalas is having a good time. Donato, flanked 
               by two girls, foot up on a chair, entertains a small crowd.

                                     DONATO
                         He picks her up on Forty-third, and 
                         he's takin' in. She says, "Say, baby. 
                         Ain't no need for goin' downtown." 
                         An' she pulls back her skirt. So the 
                         dumb shit climbs in the back an' 
                         takes a piece...
                              (starts to chuckle)
                         ...an' leaves the keys in the front 
                         and locks the two of 'em in the squad. 
                         And he hasta kick out the window 
                         see, an' she starts screamin', "Rape! 
                         Rape!" An' they charge him with rape 
                         an' every other fuckin' thing in the 
                         book. Internal Affairs is gonna give 
                         him a kayak and a lantern an' put 
                         him out in the lake.

               A group laughs at the story. There is a stillness at the 
               front door. One of the hoods from outside steps in. He wears 
               a leather coat.

               The heads at the bar turn.

               He walks the length of the bar and enters the john. He is 
               obviously out of place in this saloon. Nobody has both hands 
               on the bar.

               The front door opens. The other hood steps in, walks up to 
               the bar, and orders.

                                     SECOND HOOD
                         Bartender. Gimme a black russian and 
                         a Courvoisier.

               The First Hood comes out of the bathroom and walks up to the 
               bar. Suddenly he whips a sawed-off shotgun from under his 
               coat.

                                     FIRST HOOD
                              (bellows)
                         Yo! Get your hands up motherfuckers. 
                         This is a ho --

               THIRTY HAMMERS CLICK. Thirty guns are drawn.

               The room is frozen. Only the JUKEBOX makes a sound. The two 
               hoods, eyes fixed on the array of iron pointed at them, can't 
               even swallow. Finally...

                                     SECOND HOOD
                              (to partner)
                         You stupid motherfucker.

               The cops swarm the hoods and in an instant they are on the 
               floor being cuffed and roughly handled. Kosalas is at the 
               end of the bar, frozen, his gun still in his holster.

               EXT. TAVERN - NIGHT

               Eddie gets out of his car and heads for the front door.

               INT. TAVERN - NIGHT

               The place is in an uproar -- everybody doubled up with 
               LAUGHTER -- as the two luckless hoods, handcuffed together, 
               are lying on the filthy tavern floor under a table. They 
               continue to berate each other.

               Eddie enters.

                                     SECOND HOOD
                         My old lady tol' me you was fucked 
                         up in the head. Do I listen? Piece o 
                         cake, you say. Snap, you say. Nothin 
                         to it, you say.

                         Shut up over there.

               Donato spots Eddie and calls to him.

                                     DONATO
                         Eddie! Partner! Meet Ruthie. Dental 
                         Hygienist. She's oral.

               Ruthie giggles.

                                     DONATO
                         And this is... Marlene. She works 
                         for a proctologist.

               Marlene swats at him.

                                     DONATO
                         Siddown, partner. I got a proposition 
                         for you.

                                     EDDIE
                         Not now, Donato.

                                     DONATO
                         O.K. O.K. But just let me plant two 
                         words in your brain. Alligator 
                         farming.

               Eddie shakes his head and walks to the back of the room where 
               Kosalas sits hunched over a drink, the only man in the room 
               not laughing. He looks up whens Eddie pulls over a chair.

                                     KOSALAS
                         Beer?

               Eddie nods, and Kosalas signals the waitress. There is a 
               long beat at Kosalas fidgets and Eddie waits.

                                     KOSALAS
                         Looks like I'm caught between the 
                         rock and the hard place, Sarge.

               Eddie just looks at him.

                                     KOSALAS
                         You know I really wanted to be a 
                         good cop, but... shit. It's hard 
                         enough sometimes just to stay alive. 
                         Comes so easy to you. You got all 
                         the fuckin' answers. Me, I'm still 
                         tryin' to find the questions.

               Eddie is still silent. Kosalas takes a swig of his beer, and 
               finally blurts is out.

                                     KOSALAS
                         Cragie planted the gun on the kid. 
                         Just wasted him, and then I... I 
                         don't know what to do about the 
                         hearing tomorrow...

                                     EDDIE
                         Tell the truth.

                                     KOSALAS
                         See. It's all so nothin' for you. If 
                         I talk straight every cop on the 
                         force will shit on me. If I don't... 
                         Cragie gets away with murder.

                                     EDDIE
                         And the chance to do it again. Next 
                         time he might take away a cop. That 
                         make any difference?

                                     KOSALAS
                         He's my partner.

                                     EDDIE
                         Your partner's selling you out, 
                         Kosalas. He kills an unarmed kid, 
                         and now he's risking your ass to 
                         save his own.

                                     KOSALAS
                         It was a mistake.

                                     EDDIE
                         It cost an innocent kid his life.

                                     KOSALAS
                         I know that! I KNOW THAT!

               He is too loud, and attracts attention.

                                     KOSALAS
                              (softly)
                         Jesus. I see that kid's face every 
                         time I close my eyes.

                                     EDDIE
                         Tell 'em like it is, Nick. I'll back 
                         you up.

               Eddie gets up and walks away.

               INT. TAVERN - NIGHT

               The two amateur holdup men are being hustled out to the paddy 
               wagon as Eddie heads for the door. Someone grabs his arm.

               It's Cragie, a little drunk.

                                     CRAGIE
                         Nice to see you out with the boys 
                         for a change, Sarge.

                                     EDDIE
                         Hello, Cragie.

                                     CRAGIE
                         They tell me my Sergeant wouldn't 
                         sign for me. You want to tell me 
                         why?

                                     EDDIE
                         You know why.

                                     CRAGIE
                         No. Tell me.

                                     EDDIE
                              (gently)
                         You were a good cop for a lot of 
                         years. You've passed your limit now 
                         Cragie.

                                     CRAGIE
                         Fuck you. Where do you get off?

                                     EDDIE
                         Right about here.

               Eddie walks out the door.

               INT. EDDIE'S HALL - NIGHT

               Eddie buzzes the door. Pirelli opens it. He lets Eddie in, 
               scans the hall, and closes it.

               INT. PIRELLI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Pirelli sets down his gun, and pours Eddie a cup of coffee.

                                     PIRELLI
                         She's havin' a bad night. Gave her a 
                         shot of brandy. Maybe she'll sleep.

                                     EDDIE
                         Giving liquor to a minor, Pirelli?

               He turns to leave.

                                     EDDIE
                         I'll be back right after the hearing 
                         tomorrow, and you can get some sleep 
                         then.

               INT. PIRELLI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Eddie cracks the door and peeks in. Diana sits on the bed, a 
               lonely forlorn figure.

               She looks at Eddie, and tries a smile that fails.

               Eddie walks over to sit on the bed next to her.

               She falls apart, and lies down, on the verge of crying, 
               collapsing so that her head rest in Eddie's lap.

               They are quiet like that for a moment, she curled into a 
               ball, Eddie stroking her hair.

                                     DIANA
                         What do you do when you don't have 
                         anyone?

                                     EDDIE
                         You find someone.

               She looks up at him.

                                     DIANA
                         Could you... Hold me for a while?

               Eddie lays on the bed beside her. She curls up in his arms, 
               and closes her eyes. Eddie's eyes remain open.

               INT. HEARING ROOM - DAY

               The Civilian Review Board is in the Office of Professional 
               Standards. The panel consists of eight civilians. It is a 
               real cross-section of the city of Chicago. Leon Partida chairs 
               the proceedings. We recognize several faces from the opening 
               bust.

               An old Mexican woman is on the stand facing the panel. Cragie 
               sits at a table with his representative, facing the officials.

               A female panel member is questioning the old woman.

                                     MALE PANEL MEMBER
                         How far were you standing from where 
                         your grandson was shot, Mrs. Murillio?

               The question must be TRANSLATED by a bumbling clerk, the old 
               woman answers in Spanish, then the answer is translated.

                                     CLERK
                         In the next doorway. Four meters.

               The room is packed. In addition to the police officers, 
               character witnesses, and friends of the dead kid, there are 
               a dozen reporters.

               Eddie enters and looks over the scene. He nods to Donato, 
               sitting at the rail with his foot propped up.

                                     DONATO
                         How you doin', Sarge?

                                     EDDIE
                         What's the score?

                                     DONATO
                              (nods toward witness)
                         Kid's grandmother says Cragie threw 
                         down the pistola.

               Eddie takes a seat. Officer Cragie is called back to the 
               witness stand.

                                     PARTIDA
                              (to steno)
                         Officer Cragie has already been sworn.
                              (pause)
                         Officer Cragie, you have heard Mrs. 
                         Murillio's testimony --

                                     CRAGIE
                         Yes, sir.

               Cragie is neat as a pin, humble, cooperative to a fault.

                                     PARTIDA
                         You have heard her tell this panel 
                         that she saw you lay the gun in her 
                         grandson's hand.

               He feigns compassion.

                                     CRAGIE
                         I'm not saying the woman would make 
                         this up. But there's no way she could 
                         have seen anything from where she 
                         was standing in a hallway that dark.
                              (pause)
                         Like you said, she's the boy's 
                         grandmother.

                                     PARTIDA
                         If it was dark, Officer, how were 
                         you sure Vega had a gun?

                                     CRAGIE
                         We were lucky. There was a glint of 
                         light, a reflection comin off the 
                         barrel of the weapon.

               EXT. EDDIE'S ALLEY - DAY

               A carload of Comachos, including Luis, cruises down the street 
               and parks in the alley next to Eddie's building.

               INT. OPS HALL - DAY

               The hearing is in recess and the hall is filled with smokers 
               and coffee drinkers.

               Eddie is getting a BUSY SIGNAL on the pay phone.

               Donato approaches.

                                     DONATO
                         You think he'll get a pass?

                                     EDDIE
                         You heard it all. What do you think?

                                     DONATO
                         If the hearing was over I'd have to 
                         put my money on the old lady.
                              (smiles)
                         But Kosalas's next. My bet's on 
                         Cragie.

                                     EDDIE
                         The kid may surprise you.

               Eddie dials the number again. Still a busy signal.

               INT. PIRELLI'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Pirelli has Eddie's answering machine plugged in, and is 
               tinkering with the insides.

               Diana comes into the living room, toweling her wet hair, 
               just out of the shower, but in her street clothes.

               INT. HEARING ROOM - DAY

               Kosalas is on the witness stand.

                                     PARTIDA
                         And right after you heard Officer 
                         Cragie's gun discharge, what did you 
                         do then?

                                     KOSALAS
                         I immediately advanced down the hall.

                                     PARTIDA
                         And what did you see?

                                     KOSALAS
                         The deceased, Vega, lying on the 
                         floor. Officer Cragie was checking 
                         his vital signs.

                                     PARTIDA
                         What happened then?

                                     KOSALAS
                         We recovered a .25 calibre automatic 
                         from the teenager's right hand.

                         Did you see that weapon in Vega's 
                         hand before Officer Cragie fired?

                                     KOSALAS
                         Yes, sir.

               Cragie leans back.

               A ripple is felt in the crowd. The reaction of the boy's 
               relatives, delayed by translation, is one of outrage.

                                     PARTIDA
                         No more questions.

               As Kosalas steps down he keeps his eyes on the floor ahead 
               of him avoiding eye contact.

               Eddie leans back in his seat. A couple of people get up and 
               head for the door.

               Eddie gets to his feet and heads for the door. Partida hits 
               the gavel.

                                     PARTIDA
                         I'd like to now call Sergeant Cusack.

               Eddie halts with his hand on the knob.

               INT. PIRELLI'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Pirelli works on the answering machine, but the phone is 
               reconnected. Diana is looking at photographs on the wall.

                         You made that uniform look good.

               Pirelli looks up.

                                     PIRELLI
                         That good looking gorilla next to me 
                         is Eddie's father. Better than good 
                         cop. Killed in the line of duty. 
                         '71.
                              (pause)
                         Another cop shot him. An accident.

               He goes back to the machine.

               INT. EDDIE'S HALL - DAY

               The Comachos come up the stairs, led by Luis. They stop at 
               Eddie's door. They pull out their guns, and kick the door 
               in.

               Across the hall, Pirelli's door opens, and Pirelli, holding 
               his pistol steps into the hall.

               The Comachos turn and fire, blasting Pirelli back into his 
               apartment.

               Through the open door we see Diana dash across the living 
               room.

               INT. PIRELLI'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Luis and his men burst in.

               Diana runs for the phone.

               A Comacho takes it from her and rips it from the wall.

               Diana is caught by two Comachos.

               INT. HEARING ROOM - DAY

               Eddie is on the witness stand.

                                     EDDIE
                         I can't comment on that. It was over 
                         before I got there.

                                     PARTIDA
                         You are his superior officer, are 
                         you not?

                                     EDDIE
                         Cragie's in my unit, yes.

                                     PARTIDA
                         Did you give the men their various 
                         assignments?

                                     EDDIE
                         I did.

                                     PARTIDA
                         Did you request that officer Cragie 
                         be on your TAC team?

                                     EDDIE
                         No, I didn't.

               Partida lifts a document from the table.

                                     PARTIDA
                         Sergeant... I have here a department 
                         document dated 24 September, of last 
                         year. It is a request by you, to 
                         your superiors, to have Officer Cragie 
                         transferred to another unit. Are you 
                         familiar with this document?

                                     EDDIE
                         Yes.

               The room listens to every word.

                                     PARTIDA
                         Why did you request his transfer?

                                     EDDIE
                         Maybe 30 years is too long for anyone 
                         to look at the city's guts, Mr. 
                         Partida.

                         What happened to this request?

                                     EDDIE
                         It was denied.

               Partida lifts another document.

                                     PARTIDA
                         This is a letter of support for 
                         Officer Cragie.
                              (hands it to him)
                         Everyone in his unit signed it but 
                         you.
                              (pause)
                         Why?

               Eddie glances over the letter and hands it back.

                                     EDDIE
                         I don't agree with what it says.

                                     PARTIDA
                         Are you saying you do not believe 
                         Officer Cragie is fit to work the 
                         streets of Chicago?

                                     EDDIE
                         That's what I'm saying.

               INT. OPS HALL - DAY

               The reporters are clustered around Eddie as he emerges but 
               he walks past them back to the pay phone. He puts in a quarter 
               and dials. Frowns.

               The cops in the corridor are passing the word about Eddie's 
               testimony, discussing it in little clusters. Their appearance 
               is frightening. Eddie dials another number.

                                     EDDIE
                              (to phone)
                         I just dialed 348-6610, and I get 
                         this funny buzz. Check the line for 
                         me? Thanks.

               Cragie, backed up by a couple of buddies, comes up to him.

                                     BRENNAN
                         Seems to me the man's got his tongue 
                         stuck to his asshole, Cragie.

                                     CRAGIE
                         Hey, that don't bother him. He's the 
                         fuckin White Knight.
                              (to Eddie)
                         You wanna take on the whole world by 
                         yourself? Now you're gonna get your 
                         chance, Sarge.

               They walk down the hall.

                         out of service. I've reported it.

               Eddie drops the phone.

               INT. OPS HALL - DAY

               Eddie races down the hallway past hostile clusters of former 
               friends.

               EXT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY

               Roaring north on the boulevard without regard to traffic, 
               Eddie speeds toward his house in his rattling Chevy.

               INT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY

               Eddie rockets through the red lights LEANING on his HORN.

               Eddie runs up the stairs, and slows when he sees Odell. The 
               boy is sitting on the floor, head in his hands, crying.

               Just past Odell, several uniformed policemen are standing 
               over Pirelli's body. They step back as Eddie approaches.

                                     COP
                         He was a friend of yours wasn't he?

                                     EDDIE
                         Yeah.

               INT. PIRELLI'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Eddie hurries to the bedroom and back. He rushes out of the 
               apartment.

               Eddie runs for the Chevy and peels away from the curb.

               Eddie is on the radio, speeding west on Diversey Parkway.

               Music is standing on a streetcorner talking to a couple of 
               hookers.

               Down the street, Brennan waits in their unmarked car.

                         I could use a cup of coffee.

               EXT. POOL HALL - DAY

               Eddie squeals to a stop, hops out of the car, starts for the 
               pool hall.

               Eddie enters the poolhall.

               INT. POOL HALL - DAY

               The place is busy. Everybody in sight is either mean or ugly. 
               Eddie enters and a dozen pair of eyes are on him.

               The pool players not connected with this confrontation take 
               one look at him, hang up their cues, and split.

               Eddie heads for the back of the room. A pair of heavyweights 
               fall in behind him. One of them grabs Eddie.

                                     HEAVY
                         Hey, you ain't got no business back 
                         there.

                                     EDDIE
                         I want your opinion I'll beat it out 
                         of you.

               Eddie spins with deadly precision and catches them in mid-
               step and they go down like gut-shot rhinos.

               He heads for the rear hallway and everybody clears a path.

               He steps up to the door in back and kicks it in.

               INT. POOL HALL BACK ROOM - DAY

               A startled Camacho, DEGAS, looks up, straw in hand with a 
               line of coke on a mirror on his desk.

                                     EDDIE
                         Where is Luis?

                                     DEGAS
                         Get the hell out of here.

               Eddie grabs Degas by the hair and starts slamming his face 
               into the mirror which shatters with every blow.

                                     EDDIE
                         Talk to me, Degas, or I'll hit you 
                         with so many lefts you're gonna beg 
                         for a right.

               He holds up Degas' head to look him in the eye. Blood and 
               cocaine stain the man's face.

                                     DEGAS
                         He's coming here. He's on his way.

               Eddie lifts the head once and gives Degas one punch in the 
               face that sends him ass over teakettle across the floor.

               INT. POLICE COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - DAY

               Beneath the lighted map of Area 4, the police dispatcher 
               trying to raise Eddie's backup.

               The dispatcher at the next panel overhears the call.

                         1462. That's Cusack, right?

               First dispatcher nods.

                         Good luck finding a backup for that 
                         character.

               INT. POOL HALL - DAY

               Eddie opens the door and emerges from the back room. A dozen 
               Comacho goons have gathered. Behind them are another two 
               dozen hostile spectators. But no sign of the backup.

               He pulls out his gun. The remaining innocent bystanders split 
               for the exit. Eddie walks forward into the room. The Comachos 
               and their soldiers stand around him. Several have guns.

               Eddie keeps them under the point of his gun. He gets to the 
               door and has to turn his back on it to keep the gang in his 
               sights.

               A gun is pressed into Eddie's back. He drops his gun.

               Luis kicks Eddie across the room. Eddie lands at the feet of 
               the gang.

                                     LUIS
                         Take him apart.

               Eddie springs to his feet, and in the same motion decks his 
               nearest attacker. The battle is on. Hardwood pool cues crack 
               around him.

               The first four or five never get a chance to lay a finger on 
               him. Battered and broken, they litter the billiard tables 
               and floor. But Eddie is outnumbered 20 to 1.

               Cragie and Kosalas sit at the bar. The TV is off, and the 
               few customers pay attention to the police monitor.

                                     DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         ...request verification for backup 
                         for unit 1462. Patrol 47, are you in 
                         the area.

                                     OFFICER (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         Squad. 47. We're having vehicular 
                         problems. Not able to respond.

               Cragie smiles. Kosalas looks ashamed.

               EXT. SQUAD CAR - DAY

               Two uniformed police sit in a cruiser.

                                     DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                              (from radio)

               One cop turns to the other.

                                     COP
                         Fuck him.

               INT. POOL HALL - DAY

               Coming at Eddie now from all sides, the Comachos wear into 
               him. Finally they begin to connect. Blind-sided, he goes 
               down and they are on him like jackals.

               They drag him to the top of the rear stairs, and kick him 
               down to the alley.

               It seems like they are about to finish him off when suddenly 
               all is quiet. The crowd parts. Eddie looks up through swollen 
               eyes to see Luis Comacho standing above him, cool as ice. 
               Luis reaches down and pulls Eddie's head up by the ear.

                                     LUIS
                         The sun comes up. You give me Luna, 
                         or the girl dies -- slow.

               Luis kicks him in the face.

               EXT. POOL HALL ALLEY - NIGHT

               Eddie opens a bloody eye and looks over his surroundings. 
               He's alone. He moves, a joint at a time, checking himself 
               out.

               Staggering to his feet, he opens a spiggot on the wall. He 
               lets the cold water wash over his head.

               INT. POOL HALL - NIGHT

               Donato hobbles through the deserted pool hall, his pistol in 
               his hand.

               EXT. POOL HALL ALLEY - NIGHT

               Donato comes out the back door of the poolhall, and finds 
               Eddie sitting on his haunches and resting against a wall 
               between two garbage cans.

                                     DONATO
                         I would have been here, Sarge. They 
                         kept it from me.

                                     EDDIE
                         You're Ok, Hopalong.

               Donato holsters his gun, and helps Eddie to his feet.

                                     DONATO
                         Listen, I'm havin' a drink with this 
                         friend of mine, name of Mickie. She 
                         works on a computer over in the 
                         Federal Building, FBI. I got here as 
                         soon as I heard.

                                     EDDIE
                         They got Diana Luna.

                                     DONATO
                         That's what I'm tryin' to tell ya. 
                         Mickie told me she read on the wire 
                         Tony Luna's comin' into Union Station 
                         at ten tonight.

               Eddie runs down the alley toward his car.

               EXT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

               Eddie's car pulls up. He gets out and runs inside.

               INT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

               A train sits at the platform. Tony Luna is walking down the 
               platform.

               INT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

               Eddie runs through the cavernous lobby.

               EXT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

               Eddie arrives in time to see Tony step into a waiting Cadillac 
               that immediately takes off.

               Eddie races up the ramp to his car.

               EXT. UNION STATION - NIGHT

               Eddie jumps into his car, and roars away in pursuit of the 
               Cadillac.

               EXT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

               Tony settles in, and then sees Scalese sitting calmly in the 
               back seat.

                                     TONY LUNA
                              (surprised)
                         Hello, Felix.

                                     SCALESE
                         Hello, Tony.

               Tony moves for his gun. The hood next to Tony relieves him 
               of his gun, using his own for persuasion.

                                     SCALESE
                              (sighs)
                         You see, Tony. You make no sense. 
                         You start a war... Waste people... 
                         Money... You're like a kid, Tony. 
                         You're a bad boy.

               Tony is scared. The driver spots something in the rearview 
               mirror.

               EXT. LOOP - NIGHT

               The Cadillac rockets through the empty orange-lighted canyons 
               of the financial district, with Eddie in hot pursuit.

               EXT. UPPER WACKER - NIGHT

               Roaring north on Wacker past an astonished group in front of 
               the Civic Opera House, the Cadillac drops out of sight on 
               the down-ramp to Lower Wacker.

               EXT. LOWER WACKER - NIGHT

               This bi-level street is as different as night and day. The 
               lower level's eerie green lights make us feel like we're 
               under water. Iron girders and concrete pillars support the 
               street above.

               LOW WIDE ANGLE

               The Cadillac races through this vast man-made cavern, past 
               the sub-level loading docks and service entrances of 
               skyscrapers above. City work crews and all night commercial 
               deliveries dot both the upper and lower levels of the chase.

               INT. EDDIE'S CAR - NIGHT

               Eddie is gaining in the battered Chevy. The Cadillac rockets 
               up the next ramp to the street level.

               EXT. UPPER WACKER - NIGHT

               The Cadillac zooms up from below, crosses the intersection, 
               and immediately takes the next down-ramp. Eddie flies up 
               from below, briefly airborne, barreling after them into the 
               tunnel.

               EXT. LOWER WACKER - NIGHT

               A block later the Cadillac heads topside again. Eddie takes 
               a gamble and goes straight ahead.

               At the next down-ramp, the Cadillac descends and Tony's boys 
               find themselves doing 70 knots side by side with Eddie in 
               the other lane.

               In the narrow concrete tunnel, the two cars battle each other 
               like bulls in a chute, each one trying to cut the other off, 
               bouncing from each other into the walls and back again.

               INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

               The goon next to Luna is trying to get a shot off at Eddie.

                                     SCALESE
                         This sonovabitch is crazy!

               Tony sees his chance and he lunges for the gun. In the 
               struggle, the gun goes off and drills Rocco, the driver, 
               through the side of the head.

               EXT. LOWER WACKER - NIGHT

               The Cadillac ROARS out of control, its dead driver's foot 
               pressing the accelerator to the floor. Scalese, in the front 
               seat, tries to grab the wheel.

               Eddie is all over the road trying to avoid them. The river 
               and the curve are ahead.

               Scalese's car hits the median at high speed, rolls, and slides 
               SCREAMING into a concrete pillar and EXPLODES.

               Eddie stands on the brakes as his car slides alongside the 
               flaming wreckage.

               INT. EDDIE'S CAR - NIGHT

               Eddie's car is on fire now, and the doors have been rammed 
               shut. He kicks the window out on the passenger side.

               EXT. LOWER WACKER - NIGHT

               Eddie runs for his life. The explosion knocks him to his 
               knees.

               He gets up and moves away, looking back at Luna's and 
               Scalese's spectacular funeral pyre.

               EXT. LOWER WACKER - NIGHT

               The fire engines and police cars are arriving from every 
               direction.

               With the flames still lighting his face, Eddie is making a 
               call.

                                     EDDIE
                         You tell Luis I got Tony Luna for 
                         him. Get me a time and place.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               Diana is in bad shape. She is tied up. Numb with terror she 
               listens, not comprehending, as the Comachos discuss their 
               plans for her in Spanish.

               Luis comes over to her, and with his knife begins cutting 
               off part of her clothes.

                                     LUIS
                         Your cop friend is smart. Too smart 
                         and he dies. Then I take care of you 
                         personally.

               EXT. LOWER WACKER - NIGHT

               Eddie's car is totally ablaze. He walks past the streaming 
               hoses and slips into a parked blue and white, it's mars lights 
               still flashing. He roars off.

               INT. GYM - NIGHT

               The giant door opens, and a lone blue and white pulls in and 
               parks.

               The place is deserted except for the duty officer who sits 
               in his tiny office watching television with his half-naked 
               girlfriend.

               Eddie enters silently, glances into the duty office, and 
               heads to the other end of the large hall.

               In the background we see the practice apartment set, the 
               boxing ring, and several special task force undercover 
               vehicles seen before.

               INT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

               Eddie opens his locker and takes out his sawed-off automatic 
               shotgun. He checks the action. He loads it. He fills a duffle 
               bag with ammo and drops in another gun. He closes the locker 
               and heads out.

               INT. GYM - NIGHT

               The duty officer is still occupied. Eddie eases past him and 
               checks the key-board at the desk. He finds what he's looking 
               for. He lifts a set of keys from the hook.

               EXT. GYM - NIGHT

               From inside, we hear the SOUND of a TRUCK STARTING.

               EXT. EXPRESSWAY - DAY

               This city garbage van, an immense blue semi-trailer, is moving 
               south on the Dan Ryan at incredible speed, pushing traffic 
               out of the way like a battleship slicing through Sunday 
               boaters.

               Eddie is at the wheel.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               Among the dockside ruins of the old facility, Luis carefully 
               checks his snipers and lookouts. Shouting in Spanish, he 
               directs them into position.

               From the distance we see a signal from the Comacho stationed 
               at the top of a huge grain elevator overlooking the Calumet 
               Harbor.

               INT. GYM - DAY

               Kosalas enters. The place is in chaos. He joins the crowd 
               gathered in the center of the facility. Brennan and Cragie 
               are here. So is Music. Commander Kates has just arrived.

                                     KATES
                         What the hell is goin on?

                                     BRENNAN
                         Cusack made off with a truckload of 
                         armour.

                                     MUSIC
                              (shakes his head)
                         He's a fucking one man army now.

                                     CRAGIE
                         What'd I tell ya. The sonofabitch is 
                         crazy.

               Kosalas wanders through the wreckage. He is stunned. He is 
               starting to wake up.

                                     KATES
                         OK, everybody. No more games. Where's 
                         Cusack.

               The men all look at him silently.

               Kosalas turns on them.

                                     KOSALAS
                         I can't swallow this shit! Eddie 
                         Cusack's out there takin' on the 
                         world by himself. And you fuckin' 
                         heros are gonna sit on your goddamn 
                         asses!

               He is mad and loud.

                                     CRAGIE
                         Cool it kid.

                                     KOSALAS
                         Don't you fuckin' tell me to cool 
                         it. I won't cool it. I'm not going 
                         to fuckin' lie for you any more.
                              (to Kates)
                         I lied, Commander. He laid a gun on 
                         that kid. I saw the whole thing.

                                     CRAGIE
                         You little fuckin' bastard!

               Cragie jumps at Kosalas, but Kosalas is ready for him, and 
               braces Cragie against the wall.

               With one hand Kosalas slams Cragie again, and reaches down 
               with his free hand, lifting Cragie's pants leg and extracting 
               a drop-gun from it's concealed holster.

                                     KOSALAS
                         What's this for partner? Your next 
                         fuck up?

               Kates steps in and separates them.

                                     KATES
                              (to the others)
                         Get someone in the air. We're gonna 
                         find Cusack.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               Diana, now hanging from her wrists like a slab of beef, is 
               guarded by a couple of Luis' boys, eyeing her hungrily.

               Luis enters.

                                     LUIS
                              (subtitles)
                         Take off the gag. I want them to 
                         hear her.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               Luis scans the daybreak sky. He and Efren take up positions. 
               Above them and around them, every line of fire is covered.

               EXT. GRAIN ELEVATOR - DAY

               From the lookout's POV atop the towering grain elevator, WE 
               SEE several garbage trucks moving in and out of an adjacent 
               dump.

               One of them seems familiar to us.

               INT. TRUCK CAB - DAY

               Eddie's eyes search the harbour as he maneuvers slowly 
               alongside a rusting freighter. He stops and gets out.

               EXT. GRAIN ELEVATOR - DAY

               Eddie opens the rear of the truck and lowers a ramp.

                                     EDDIE
                         Here we go partner.

               He picks up his gun and a duffle bag from the cab and heads 
               out.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               The Comachos are ready and waiting. Luis walks through the 
               middle of the vast empty plant toward the front, checking on 
               his troops one last time.

               EXT. DOCK - DAY

               Against the grotesque shapes of the surrounding scrapyards, 
               Eddie moves quickly from one concealment to the next, crouched 
               low, advancing on the abandoned factory at the end of the 
               dock.

               He lays down his duffle and pulls out a Halliburton case. He 
               opens it.

               EXT. GRAIN ELEVATOR - DAY

               From inside the garbage truck WE HEAR an ENGINE STARTING. It 
               REVS a couple of times. And from within the container 
               compartment of the truck emerges the Prowler. It clatters 
               down the ramp.

               EXT. GRAIN ELEVATOR - DAY

               The lookout spots the Prowler moving down the dock. He can't 
               believe his eyes.

               He sights on the machine and FIRES.

               And in the distance, the Prowler senses the insult and 
               immediately turns its camera eye up to him.

               The lookout FIRES again. Immediately, the turret swivels and 
               the twin MACHINEGUNS ROAR.

               It's a long way down.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               The SOUND of MACHINEGUN FIRE from outside galvanizes the 
               Comachos. Luis runs through the long building toward the 
               front with half a dozen of his men, all SHOUTING.

               EXT. DOCK - DAY

               Eddies eyes watch the miniature monitor of the Prowler's 
               hand controller. On the monitor WE CAN SEE the Comachos 
               running out in the front of the factory from the camera on 
               top of the Prowler.

               Eddie gets up and moves toward the factory. He looks up at 
               several high broken windows.

               EXT. DOCK - DAY

               The Prowler is having a field day. It's electronic sensors 
               trace the source of every hostile shot and immediately return 
               a withering stream of hot lead that chews the surrounding 
               scenery -- and several Comachos -- to pieces.

               But Eddie has not figured out how to control the Prowler's 
               BULLHORN VOICE command system. It continues to BARK ORDERS 
               to the dead hoodlums in three languages.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               Luis runs through the empty plant toward the office screaming 
               to Diana's guards.

                                     LUIS
                              (subtitles)
                         Now! Do it now! Kill her!

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               Diana, tied to the chair, is momentarily alone as the guards 
               rush out to the floor of the factory to see what's happening.

               The two guards, their guns flying from their hands, are 
               hammered back into the room by Eddie who blasts through the 
               door after them.

               Diana is petrified.

               INT. SQUAD CAR - DAY

               Kosalas and Kates are in the same car. Kosalas is driving.

                                     DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                              (from radio)
                         ...Harbor Patrol reports gunfire and 
                         explosions in the vicinity of Calumet 
                         Harbor...

                                     KATES
                         That's Cusack.

               Kosalas spins the wheel into a U-turn.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               The "Prowler" rolls around the corner, its brutal turret 
               bristling with firepower. It is driving Luis and the other 
               stupefied Comachos further back into the building.

               Eddie guides his deadly partner with the hand controller.

               The Comachos dive for cover and spray the miniature tank 
               with AUTOMATIC FIRE. But they are no match. Two continuous 
               streams of hot lead chew up the place, splintering the loading 
               dock and the catwalk hiding places and disintegrating the 
               structure, churning the Comachos to hamburger.

               COMACHO SHOT RINGS OUT

               Eddie goes down and the Prowler hand controller falls to the 
               ground, shattered.

               The Prowler goes berserk, SPRAYING DEATH in a 360 degree 
               circle until all the ammo is gone.

               Then SILENCE.

               Eddie touches the blood on the side of his leg. It's not 
               serious.

               It appears everyone is out of ammunition. But a few Comachos 
               are still hidden in the factory.

               Eddie is after them like a tiger. Victor, shoulder still 
               bandaged, never has a chance. He goes down, battered and 
               broken.

               But Luis has crept up behind Eddie. He jumps over a steel 
               plate. He's going for Diana, a long knife in his hand.

               Eddie reaches for a reload. Puts it in his magnum. Aims, and 
               blows Luis away just as he reaches for Diana.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               Across the littered battlefield, Eddie escorts Diana toward 
               the light streaming through the factory entrance. He takes 
               off his jacket and wraps it around Diana's shoulders.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               The pier is crawling with cops with more arriving every 
               second.

               A fire boat is extinguishing the blaze set by the Prowler's 
               incendiary ammunition.

               The bodies of the Comachos lying everywhere astound the 
               arriving "Home Team."

               Officer Kosalas screeches to a halt and jumps from his car. 
               Brennan and Music are running down the dock. Donato, a cast 
               on his leg, hobbles after them.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               Emergency vehicles are arriving, and more squad cars, paddy 
               wagons, and fire engines.

               Eddie walks by the cops toward an ambulance, now carrying 
               Diana. Kates calls out after him.

                                     KATES
                         Hey, Cusack!

               Eddie stops, slowly turns around.

               There is a long pause.

                                     KATES
                         I'm glad you don't follow orders.

               Eddie hands Diana over to the waiting medics, who put her in 
               the ambulance.

               We pull back further and further until we see the rest of 
               the Home Team. The ambulance, carrying Diana, pulls away 
               with it's lights flashing.

               Eddie walks down the pier alone.

                                         THE END

               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN, NORTH CAROLINA. DAY

               ON A BLACK SCREEN: Credits.

               A RAUCOUS VOICE (SWIMMERS) CHANTING IN THE CHEROKEE LANGUAGE.

               A RANGE OF MOUNTAINS SLOWLY EMERGES: shrouded in a blue mist 
               like a Chinese water color. Below them, close to a small 
               town, YOUNG MEN, armed with vicious sticks and stripped to 
               the waist, come charging in a muscular, steaming pack.

               Their opponents, also swinging sticks, attach the pack.

               A ball, barely round, made of leather, emerges, smacked 
               forwards by INMAN, who hurtles after it and collides with a 
               stick swung by SWIMMER, a young and lithe American Indian. 
               Inman falls, clutching his nose. The ball bobbles on the 
               ground in front of him. He grabs it and gets to his feet, 
               the blood pouring from his nose.

               His team form a phalanx around him and he continues to charge.

               A PRISTINE CABRIOLET pulled by an impressive horse, comes 
               down towards the town. It has to pass across the temporary 
               field of play, parting the teams. Some of the contestants 
               grab their shirts to restore propriety as the Cabriolet and 
               its two exotic passengers passes by.

               The driver is a man in his early fifties, dressed in the 
               severe garb of a minister, MONROE. And next to him, a self-
               conscious girl in the spotless elaborate, architectural skirts 
               of the period, is his daughter, ADA. Inman, using his shirt 
               to staunch his battered nose, looks at Ada, astonished by 
               her. An angel in this wild place.

               Now Swimmer stops chanting and begins, more hesitantly, to 
               translate into English:

                                     SWIMMERS VOICE (V.O.)
                         You will be lonely. You will howl 
                         like a dog as you walk alone. You 
                         will carry dog shit cupped in your 
                         hands. You will be smeared with dog 
                         shit. Your spirit will wane and 
                         dwindle to blue, the colour of 
                         despair... 

               As the Cabriolet passes, SWIMMER takes the ball an with a 
               whoop starts to run towards the opposing goal. The game 
               resumes. Ada looks back as the men swarm into each other, 
               sticks and fists flailing.

               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. NIGHT

               A SIDE OF BEEF turns on a huge barbecue. The battered teams 
               eating, drinking hard liquor, rehearsing victory and defeat, 
               illuminated by a roaring bonfire. Swimmer is sewing up a 
               gash in Inmans cheek as he continues to translate:

                                     SWIMMER
                         ...This is your path. There is no 
                         other. That's a curse you can use on 
                         the Yankee before battle.

                                     INMAN
                         And that works?

                                     SWIMMER
                         You have to say it in Cherokee.

                                     INMAN
                         You said it to me in Cherokee.

               During this, Monroe and Ada have arrived, escorted by SALLY 
               SWANGER, a local woman, middle-aged, kindly, and her husband, 
               ESCO, a glorious curmudgeon. The Monroes are introduced to 
               various locals. Inamn watches them, on the other side of the 
               crowd. The Reverend Monroe, his daughter Ada. Up from 
               Charleston, bringing God's word to you heathens! Is Esco's 
               preferred introduction. Building a church. Inman watches 
               Ada, moves his head to keep her in view as Swimmer stitches, 
               and winces with pain.

                                     SWIMMER
                         So keep your head still.

               Sally collects plates for the Monroes. Hands them to Ada and 
               her father, who wait, patiently, for silverware. Esco takes 
               a plate, picks up a skewer of meat, bites on it. Monroe 
               pluckily follows suit.

                                     INMAN
                              (to Swimmer)
                         Anyway, there won't be any war. And 
                         if there is, they say it won't last 
                         a week.

               CAPTION: PETERSBURG, VIRGINIA. JULY 30TH, 1864. IN THE FOURTH 
               YEAR OF THE CIVIL WAR.

               A STAND OF TREES. The pastoral lush green Virginia. A RABBIT 
               surfaces from its hole. Peace and beauty.

               A second RABBIT shakes itself from the ground, darts into 
               open ground to confront the FORBIDDING TRENCHES OF THE 
               CONFEDERATE AND UNION ARMIES, RANGED AGAINST EACH OTHER ON 
               THE OUTSKIRTS OF PETERSBURG. Massive wooden barricades in 
               the shape of crosses, rows of X's, define the two lines. The 
               Federals have been laying siege for months. So early and 
               it's already hot. The trees are an oasis of green in a world 
               of mud between the two stark and ugly scars of the trenches.

               IN THE CONFEDERATE LINES, the men are rousing, boiling water 
               for coffee or to shave, smoking, stiff from night. There's a 
               large gun emplacement and some men still sleep against the 
               stub-nosed cannon. Another RABBIT is disturbed from its hole. 
               Ears pricked up to a distant rumbling.

               INT. TUNNEL. PREDAWN.

               A dark hole. Some evil place. A scraping sound. Shapes 
               burrowing forwards at a crouch. A silent purpose.

               Young OAKLEY, freshly recruited, approaches a group of men, 
               like him Highlanders from Company F of the 25th North Carolina 
               Regiment. He doles out breakfast. Inman, loading his heavy 
               LeMats pistol, its nine rounds, is not hungry. Oakley serves 
               another, ROURKE, last seen in the scrum at Cold Mountain. 
               Oakley keeps his head low as he serves.

                                     ROURKE
                         Don't worry, son. Those Yankee boys 
                         keep store hours. They ain't open 
                         yet.

               INT. TUNNEL. PREDAWN

               Shadows and shapes. A BARREL rumbles along the tunnel. It 
               reaches a kneeling figure, who rolls it forwards. A relay 
               team. At the end of the tunnel, where it widens, a man, naked 
               to the waist, crouches, stacking the barrels.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. PREDAWN

               A RABBIT, scared up, darts along the trench. Rourke sees it, 
               beckons to another Cold Mountain boy, Butcher.

                                     BUTCHER
                         That's fresh breakfast. Shoot him!

                                     ROURKE
                         I'm not firing, start the damn war 
                         off.

               Butcher chases after the rabbit, Rourke in raucous support.

               INT. TUNNEL. PREDAWN

               The crouching man has wrapped FUZE WIRE around the last 
               barrel, and now retreats, paying out the wire as he does so, 
               as each man in the tunnel crawls backwards behind him.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. DAWN

               Rourke weaves through the gun emplacements, laughing.

                                     ROURKE
                         That's my rabbit!

               Great sport. Inman, fifty yards away, looks over, amused, 
               goes back to his gun.

               INT. TUNNEL. DAWN

               The fuze wire is lit. It fizzes towards the barrels.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. DAWN

               Rourke is running BUT NOW THE GROUND BUCKLES UNDER HIM AND 
               HE'S BEING LIFTED SLOWLY INTO THE AIR, the earth swelling.

               AN APOCALYPTIC EXPLOSION. FOUR TONS OF DYNAMITE RIP THE GROUND 
               OPEN IN A CRATER 135 FEET LONG, 90 FEET ACROSS, 30 FEET DEEP.

               HORSES, GUNS, MEN ARE BLOWN TO PIECES AND THROWN UP INTO THE 
               AIR.

               INMAN DISAPPEARS UNDER DIRT AND DEBRIS.

               Pandemonium. The Confederates are in complete disarray. The 
               Federals pour forwards across NO MANS LAND, through the 
               peaceful oasis of trees, roaring the roar of attack. They 
               flood towards the crater, hundreds of them, charging into a 
               dense and impenetrable WALL OF SMOKE.

               THEN THEY'RE INSIDE THE GREAT GASH OF CRATER AND CAN'T GET 
               OUT AGAIN, arriving at an insurmountable wall of mud.

               The Confederates regroup. Orders are yelled. Chaos developing 
               into battle.

               The Confederates begin firing into the crater. Guns and mortar 
               wheel round and empty into what is becoming a terrible death 
               trap.

               Inman gets to his feet. Oakley with him, and rushes through 
               the smoke to the pit, emptying his LeMats into the crater.

               LATER: A BLACK REGIMENT from the Union join the attack. Bodies 
               falling on bodies as the Federals charge in and pack their 
               comrades even tighter. The Confederates make a pincer movement 
               outside the Crater, forcing all the Federals in. It's 
               Medieval.

               No escape.

               THE CONFEDERATES jump into the pit to engage the Federals. 
               Hand to hand fighting. Too close for rifles, just bayonets, 
               and guns swung like clubs and Inman sliding down into that 
               hell, tiring the nine rounds, then the shotgun charge, which 
               does a terrible damage. Primitive. Unutterable carnage. Men 
               killing each other in embraces, soldier crushed against 
               soldier, desperate to survive, to kill, to live. An oozing 
               layer cake of bodies, dead and frantically alive, drowning 
               in slick.

               YOUNG OAKLEY loses his rifle and picks up a magazine case, 
               clubbing his opponent, then slips onto him and is stuck with 
               a bayonet, the pain of which makes him squeal.

               INMAN GOES AT IT. He's a warrior, punching and stabbing and 
               firing. A coldly efficient killer. He's grabbed from behind 
               and crushed, a hand gouging at his face, an almighty struggle.

               He falls and lands on top of Oakley, and he and his Federal 
               opponent fight to the death with the wounded boy as their 
               pillow. The slaughter continues over and around them, the 
               sound, the sound of hell and madness. The boy has his arm 
               around Inman, like lovers.

               LATER: The Confederates run after the retreating Union 
               soldiers, firing, cavalry riding them down. Inman stands, 
               the boy's blood all over him, exhausted and appalled. The 
               crater, behind him, an abattoir of men. The victors are 
               yelling, pumped mad with adrenaline. Butcher comes alongside 
               Inman.

                                     BUTCHER
                         That was something! That's hell and 
                         we've been there! Kicked old Nick's 
                         asshole.

               A WOUNDED BLACK SOLDIER sits up as Butcher celebrates.

               Butcher runs over, but can't find a charge for his musket. 
               He looks around in the stack of corpses, pulling out weapons,

               tries one: not loaded, throws it down, tries another: not 
               loaded. The wounded man can't get up, tries to drag himself 
               like a crab away from Butcher. Inman yells at him, appalled.

                                     BUTCHER
                         You got a charge?

               He picks up another musket. It fires. The wounded Federal 
               slumps back, dead.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. DUSK

               THE AFTERMATH. The dead being piled up for burial, divided 
               into allegiance. Wounded prisoners able to walk are led away.

               A great deal of casual looting. Of boots, of equipment, of 
               personal items. Inman sees a soldier in the crater, lining 
               up wounded Federals, putting their heads in a row. THE MAN 
               EXTRACTS A HAMMER FROM HIS BELT AND, SATISFIED HE HAS AN 
               ECONOMIC ARRANGEMENT, PROCEEDS DOWN THE LINE, SMASHING EACH 
               SKULL.

               Inman turns away, sees another Rebel, extravagantly costumed, 
               a strange FIDDLE head protruding from his knapsack. This is 
               STOBROD THEWES. He's bent over a dead Federal, examining his 
               mouth. He reaches behind his back and roots around in the 
               knapsack, producing A PAIR OF PLIERS, WHICH HE INSERTS INTO 
               THE CORPSE'S MOUTH. He's yanking away when A SWINGING BOOT 
               connects with his head and knocks him to the ground.

               Startled, he looks up to see Inman hovering over him.

                                     STOBROD
                         That's gold in his mouth he got no 
                         need for.
                              (shrugs)
                         We take his boots.

               He examines his fiddle for damage. Some orderlies pass, 
               lifting OAKLEY away on a gurney.

               Oakley's pale as a maiden, the life leaking from him. Inman 
               walks a way with him. Oakley looks up, desperate to be brave.

                                     OAKLEY
                         I got a few. You saw?

                                     INMAN
                         I saw.

                                     OAKLEY
                         I know you don't recognise me. I'm 
                         Mo Oakley's boy.
                              (Inman finds this 
                              incredible)
                         It's okay. I was thirteen when you 
                         all left. Am I going to die?

               Inman flicks his eyes to the Orderly, whose look confirms 
               the boy's wounds are certainly mortal.

               INT. FIELD HOSPITAL. NIGHT

               Inman sits on the ground beside Oakley's cot. Around them, 
               the wounded are certainly dying, makeshift care, oil lights, 
               groans.

                                     OAKLEY
                         I'd like to hear some music while I 
                         go.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. NIGHT

               Inman walks around the campfires. He hears some fiddle music. 
               It's Stobrod.

               Stobrod sees Inman. Inman stares, his expression an 
               instruction, the turns and walks away.

               INT. FIELD HOSPITAL. NIGHT

               Stobrod stands over Oakley. Consults with Inman.

                                     STOBROD
                         What about Bonaparte's Retreat? That's 
                         one I play.

                                     OAKLEY
                         Play me something sweet. Like a girl's 
                         waiting for me.

               Stobrod looks at Inman, confused.

                                     OAKLEY
                         Play me something like there's nothing 
                         to fear from a merciful Lord.

                                     INMAN
                              (to Stobrod)
                         You heard him.

                                     STOBROD
                              (nervous)
                         I only know a couple of tunes.

                                     OAKLEY
                         Like when you're thirsty up at 
                         Bishop's Creek and the water is so 
                         cool.

               Inman glares at Stobrod. And Stobrod starts to play.

               Hesitant, then with gathering confidence, improvising, 
               increasingly expansive, as if he's as surprised as everyone 
               else. Oakley's lips move. A whisper. Inman leans in.

                                     OAKLEY
                         I'm reaching Cold Mountain before 
                         you.

               Stobrod plays. It's wrenching. Oakley stills. Inman abruptly 
               puts his hand on the neck of the fiddle, stopping Stobrod. 
               The boy is dead. Inman gets to his feet and walks away.

               INT. CONFEDERATE TENT. NIGHT

               A dozen men in the tent. Inman has a BOOK, its cover gone, 
               rolled up and tied with a leather strap. His bookmark is A 
               FADED TINTYPE PHOTOGRAPH of a solemn young woman. He unwraps 
               the book carefully and reads a page by the sickly light next 
               to his bedroll. An OFFICER comes into the tent, approaches 
               Inman, who makes a stand.

                                     OFFICER
                         Don't get up, soldier. You are 
                         mentioned tonight in my report. You 
                         are a credit to the Highlands, to 
                         North Carolina and to the Cause.

                                     INMAN
                              (tight)
                         Do you have news, sir, on my 
                         application for transfer?

                                     OFFICER
                         I know. A bloody day. It's what our 
                         General said: Good thing war is so 
                         terrible else a man might end up 
                         liking it too much.

                                     INMAN
                         Sir. It was my understanding the 
                         medical corps was desperate for 
                         volunteers.

                                     OFFICER
                         Right now, soldier, it's me who is 
                         in need of volunteers. There's a 
                         dozen Yankees in that stand of trees 
                         between us. Stuck there from the 
                         retreat. Come daylight they can shoot 
                         us down for sport.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. NIGHT

               A beautiful night. Lots of stars. Inman and three others, 
               including Butcher, slide over the top of the trench, far to 
               one side of the stand of trees. The plan is to cast a wide 
               arc that will bring them around back of the trees, closer to 
               the enemy side than their own. The four men slither over the 
               ground. They pause. Inman has arrived at a tangle of corpses.

               He slithers over them.

               They work their way towards the trees. THERE ARE A HALF DOZEN 
               FEDERALS CROUCHING IN THE COVER OF THE TREES. They are dozing. 
               Only one of them sits with a rifle surveying the Confederate 
               lines, the others have their backs to the enemy, sitting 
               against the trunks, grabbing a few minute's sleep.

               As the four rebels approach, still crawling, one of the 
               Federals opens his eyes, sees the attack, shifts for his 
               rifle. INMAN IMMEDIATELY STANDS UP, FIRING INSTANTLY, killing 
               him and two others, while Butcher throws himself at another.

               The exchanges are brief and savage and one of Inman's party 
               and all of the Federals lay dead. Then the rebels break from 
               the trees.

               A FLARE goes up, then another, both from the Confederate 
               trenches. INMAN AND HIS ACCOMPLICES ARE PICKED OUT IN A 
               BRILLIANT GREEN LIGHT. Shots follow, from both sides, aimed 
               at the three returning men as they zigzag towards their own 
               lines. As they get close, voices cry out, rippling down the 
               trench, joining their own admonitions: Don't shoot, Hold 
               your fire, they're our boys, Hold your fire!!! They're almost 
               home. Butcher is laughing, whooping. Then just as suddenly 
               he falls, wounded. Inman stops, turns back, runs to him.

               Inman collects Butcher, drags him, carries him. They're fifty 
               yards from their lines. A BULLET CATCHES INMAN IN THE NECK.

               He goes down like a tree, blood pouring from his neck. Lying 
               on the ground, he watches the phosphorescent lights slowly 
               fade to black, all sound fading with them.

               EXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. 3 YEARS EARLIER. DAY

               A WOODEN JOIST swings across the view of the Blue Ridge. Men 
               are swarming over the roof of an unfinished CHAPEL, below 
               which appears the small town of COLD MOUNTAIN. Among the 
               workers, armed with nails and hammer, knees clutching a 
               rafter, is Inman, fresh and a whole lifetime younger. Rourke 
               and Butcher are also there hammering, building, kidding around 
               and Oakley, barely a teenager.

               Below them, women are setting up a lunch for the workers, 
               ADA amongst them. She has the circumspect air of the blue 
               stocking, uncomfortably aware of the dirt beneath her hem, 
               the men's radar for her every move. Inman watches her as 
               Sally Swanger approaches.

                                     SALLY
                              (to Ada, as Monroe 
                              moves off)
                         Ada, how are you settling in? Are 
                         you liking the farm?

                                     ADA
                         Very much. It's beautiful country.

                                     SALLY
                         So listen -- if you would say hello 
                         to one of these fools, I'll get a 
                         field cleared this weekend.

                                     ADA
                         Anyone? Like a forfeit?

                                     SALLY
                              (pointing at Inman 
                              who immediately looks 
                              away)
                         No. Him in particular, up in the 
                         rafters. Been pressing me all morning.

               UP ON THE ROOFBEAMS OF THE CHAPEL, the men are preoccupied 
               with talk of secession from the Union.

                         making a church.

               Ada comes over, carrying a tray of lemonade glasses. Calls 
               up to Inman.

                         Hello.

               Inman swings down. He feels the other men staring, burning a 
               hole in his head.

                         staring. Inman.

                         They're not my friends.

               He drops down to ground level, takes the lemonade, scowls at 
               the other guys. They're breaking for lunch and as they make 
               their way to the trestle tables -- they enjoy jostling Inman.

                                     INMAN

                         So, was there something in particular 
                         you wished to say to me?

                                     INMAN
                              (thinks about it)
                         Not that comes to me.
                              (hands back the glass)
                         I'll say thank you for the lemonade.

               And he turns and joins the other men gathering round the 
               tables for lunch. Ada watches him, intrigued. Rourke and co. 
               approach ESCO SWANGER, a known sympathizer with the North, 
               to give him a bad time.

                                     ROURKE
                         Esco loves the Yankees.

                         I prefer a Yankee to a halfwit.

               Inman arrives just as Rourke points a warning finger at Esco.

               He pushes the finger down to get by. Esco continues:

                                     ESCO
                         What is it you think you'd be fighting 
                         for?

                         The South.

                         And what's that when it's at home?

               Esco's sons, ELLIS AND ACTON, who're working at the other 
               end of the building, have now arrived at the table.

                                     ACTON
                         Pop, you causing trouble?

                                     ESCO
                         No.

                                     ELLIS
                         That means yes.

                         You cut the wood, you carry the water 
                         for good old King Cotton. Now you 
                         want to fight for him. Somebody has 
                         to explain it to me.

                                     ACTON
                              (to Rourke and the 
                              others)
                         Don't even try.

               The others are desperate to tease Inman.

                         How's the lemonade? Sweet?

               Ada, at the lemonade stand again, watches them laughing at 
               Inman, who keeps his head fixed on the table.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. NIGHT

               INMAN, ON A GURNEY, carried, someone with a cloth to his 
               neck, which is soaked through with blood. They start to run 
               with him, heading for the field hospital, worried that he 
               will die before the wound can be staunched, cauterized.

               Throughout, A STRANGE MUSIC PLAYS, discordant notes jangling:

               EXT. SWANGER FARM. COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               -- from A PIANO, lashed to a cart, as it bounces along the 
               lane, passing the Swanger Farm. Sally comes out to look. 
               It's Ada riding next to one of the farmhands, a second boy 
               keeping watch over the piano. Sally goes over.

                                     SALLY

                              look)
                         Inman's down in the bottom field, 
                         clearing his debt.

                         twice, by two different men. Both of 
                         them -- they were hunting for a 
                         simile, what was I like -- and thistle 
                         came right to them.

                         why not go down and say hello.

               EXT. BOTTOM FIELD, SWANGER FARM. DAY

               Inman's working in the field, stripped to his undershirt, 
               hot work, wielding a scythe. He hears something and looks up 
               at the edge of the lane, ADA IS PLAYING THE PIANO, which is 
               still strapped to the cart. She briefly raises a hand to 
               Inman, then nods to the farmhand who sets them on their way 
               again. Inman smiles, waves back, watching as the cart rumbles 
               off down the track.

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               It's pouting with rain. INSIDE THE FARMHOUSE, ADA IS PLAYING 
               THE PIANO.

               Men and women crowd into the parlour, in best clothes, 
               celebrating the completion of the Chapel. Inman is outside 
               on the porch, his coat soaked, water pouring off his hat. He 
               looks at Ada. She finishes. Monroe steps in front of the 
               applause, smiling. His words of thanks leak through the window 
               to Inman, who stands, watching, listening.

               INT. PARLOUR, BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               Monroe circulates, with Ada. He nods at a group of men, who 
               congregate in one part, not mingling. Their leader, TEAGUE, 
               might be a minister himself, favouring a black dress coat, a 
               black crow in the corner, eyes flashing. Ada doesn't know 
               them. Esco comes by. Monroe puts a hand on his arm.

                         man don't kick a snake. One time the 
                         Teague family owned the whole of 
                         Cold Mountain. My farm, your farm, 
                         all belonged to his grand-daddy. 
                         Teague wanted this place bad. You 
                         got it. He's here sniffing out an 
                         advantage.

                         There's no advantage here, but to

               And Teague raises his glass across the room.

               Ada appears at the door opening it onto the porch. She's 
               carrying a tray with drinks. Acknowledges Inman.

                         What can I do for you?

               Inman hovers, awkward. Ada appears, awkward.

                                     INMAN
                         I have some sheet music. Belonged to 
                         my father. No use to me.

               Ada comes forward, takes the package.

                                     MONROE
                         You must come in.

                                     INMAN
                         I should probably get along.

                                     ADA
                         Mr. Inman is more comfortable 
                         outdoors. Perhaps we might take a 
                         walk.

                                     MONROE
                         A splendid idea.

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Monroe and Inman and Ada touring the farm. It's a biggish 
               property, over three hundred acres. And well-tended by the 
               dozen slave farmhands who work it, some of whom are dotted 
               about in the landscape. Rolling mountains dominate the view.

                                     MONROE
                              (expansive)
                         I want to get sheep into this field. 
                         A big field doesn't look right without 
                         sheep. You're a lucky fellow, Mr. 
                         Inman, you've had this view all your 
                         life.

                                     INMAN
                         I think so.

                                     MONROE
                         It's a special view. I dragged my 
                         poor daughter to Cold Mountain from 
                         Charleston because of my Doctors -- 
                         they say my heart is weak -- so the 
                         air's meant to do me good. But it's 
                         the view I think heals.

               Ada walking behind, comes alongside the two men, threading 
               her arm into her father's but, by so doing, also arriving 
               next to Inman.

                                     MONROE
                         I have to get on my visits. Can I 
                         offer you a ride back into town?

               Inman looks at Ada. No word.

               INT. PARLOUR, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               From the window Ada watches the Cabriolet head towards town.

               At the piano, she unwraps the leather lace from the package 
               of music. Inside the first book of music, there's a 
               DAGUERREOTYPE OF INMAN with his LeMats, a typical Confederate 
               pose. Some of the music has left its imprint on the picture, 
               the notes like a melody over Inman's face. Ada picks them 
               out on the piano.

               The ebullient sound of Shape Singing. A noisy choir letting 
               rip --

               INT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN, MAY 20TH, 1861. DAY

               -- THE WHOLE CHURCH IS SINGING, MEN TO ONE SIDE: WOMEN TO 
               THE OTHER. Monroe conducts, sings. Inman is there, as is 
               Ada. He fixes on her neck, the way the hair falls.

               The door bursts open. Young OAKLEY, apologetic nod to Monroe, 
               sits at the back, then leans forward, as the singing 
               continues, to say something to Rourke, who says something to 
               Butcher, the news spreading like wildfire. Rourke gets up, 
               leaves. Butcher gets up next, follows. Another man. Another.

               Depleting the male voices, until only women and some of the 
               older men are singing and one side of the church is 
               practically empty.

               Inman, remains, fixed on Ada. Who does not look round.

               EXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               Those left in the congregation now spill out into what has 
               become a melee as the NEWS OF SECESSION goes up. Enormous 
               excitement, particularly among the boys, who now seem 
               curiously attractive to the girls. Inman blinks out into the 
               sun, Ada finds him. They're awkward as they watch other 
               sweethearts embracing.

                                     ADA
                         Well, you have your war.

               TEAGUE AND HIS MEN COME RIDING UP THE STREET, their horses 
               clearing a path amongst the celebrating crowd. Teague reins 
               in his horse and rides it up against Esco Swanger.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Those who follow Lincoln, or preach 
                         abolition, best keep one eye open 
                         when they're sleeping, Old Bogey Man 
                         might get you!

               Inman steps between Esco and Teague, holding the reins of 
               Teague's horse, easy and dangerous.

                                     INMAN
                         Are you the law all of a sudden?

               Teague produces a document, which he waves in the air.

                                     TEAGUE
                         That's right, son. Home Guard for 
                         Haywood County. I'm the law from 
                         today. You all go fight now. We'll 
                         watch your sweethearts.

               And he spurs on his horse, his fellow Home Guard falling in 
               behind, riding on over the ridge. Inman walks to Ada.

                                     INMAN
                         You might be safer back in Charleston.

                                     ADA
                         But then who'll be waiting for you?

               She puts a hand on his arm for a second. They both want to 
               get to the point of declaration but don't know how. They 
               stand, people noisy around them, those about to leave, those 
               about to be left.

                                     INMAN
                         I'm going to walk back inside the 
                         Chapel.

               And he does so, making his meaning clear for her to follow.

               INT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               Inman walks inside. Stands with his back to the door. It 
               opens and closes. Inman turns. It's Monroe.

                                     MONROE
                         Did you want a quiet word?

               Now the door opens again and it's Ada. She's dismayed to see 
               her father.

                                     INMAN
                         Just some quiet.

                                     MONROE
                         Of course Ada.

               He indicates they should both leave. Inman sits at a bench.

               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               Monroe and Ada come into town in their cabriolet. They pass 
               under banners proclaiming the Confederate cause: Old Rip's 
               Awake! Watch out Yankees! The trap draws up by the Cold 
               Mountain General Store. Monroe lets Ada down.

                                     MONROE
                              (of his appointment)
                         I'll daresay Dr. O'Brien'll want to 
                         do a test or two.

                                     ADA
                         And then there'll be a coffee or 
                         two, a brandy or two...

               Monroe smiles in acknowledgement, gets back in the trap. Ada 
               heads into the store.

               INT. BEDROOM. ROOMING HOUSE. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               INMAN SITS ON HIS BED, wearing pants and a vest. His room is 
               like a monk's cell. Nothing in it. Inman's trunk is packed.

               He's polishing his boots, in his bare feet. One hand inside 
               the boot, the other blacking it. There's a knock at the door.

               He opens it. It's Ada. He abruptly closes the door on her.

               INT. HALLWAY, ROOMING HOUSE. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               Ada waits outside. She's not sure what's happening. Then 
               Inman opens the door. He's buttoning his shirt. His boots 
               are on, one conspicuously dirty, one highly polished. Somebody 
               walks up the stairs, carrying a jug and bowl. They separate 
               as the man passes them. They're tender, awkward.

                                     ADA
                         I found you this book. William 
                         Bartram. They tell me it's good. I 
                         think he writes about these parts, 
                         the author, so...

               Inman takes it.

               She has something else. Wrapped in paper.

                                     ADA
                         And this...
                              (hands it to him)
                         I'm not smiling in it. I don't know 
                         how to do that, hold a smile, so now 
                         I'm solemn...

                                     INMAN
                         Ada...

                                     ADA
                         What?

               HE KISSES HER, pressing into her, his arm circling her waist.

               Below them the sound of a MARCHING BAND. It's the RECRUITMENT 
               PARADE and brings Rourke and Butcher racing down the stairs.

               Inman pulls away from Ada as the boys hurtle for the front 
               door.

                                     ROURKE
                         Let's go!

               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               Rourke, Butcher, and then Inman appear in the doorway of the 
               Rooming House, and then fall in with the motley crew of 
               Volunteers AS THEY MARCH BY WITH THE BAND AND THE ENLISTED 
               SOLDIERS. The town is out to wish them well, parents, younger 
               brothers, sweethearts walking alongside their brave men. Ada 
               comes to the door of the Rooming House. Inman looks back and 
               sees her, but almost immediately loses her in the crowd. THE 
               DRUMMERS DRUM, THE CROWD CHEERS, THE RECRUITS MARCH UP THE 
               HILL --

               EXT. BEHIND CONFEDERATE LINES, VIRGINIA. DAY

               -- AND THE WOUNDED AND THE WRETCHED STRAGGLE ALONG THE 
               RAILROAD.

               A TRAIN with the seriously injured snakes past the back of 
               the Confederate lines -- its suburbs of supplies, arriving 
               and departing troops -- and into peaceful country. FIDDLE 
               PLAYS, THEN A BANJO.

               INT. BOX CAR. DAY

               A CROWDED WAGON. It's a cauldron, and those able smash through 
               the wooden walls to make a breathing hole. Some have their 
               heads thrust out like crated poultry. INMAN IS IN THERE, 
               neck bandaged, its ugly seepage making a bloody necklace. 
               The light plays black and white through the boarded sides of 
               the boxcar, flashing on Inman's face as he drifts in and out 
               of consciousness. He focuses and sees the strange head of 
               STOBROD'S FIDDLE. Stobrod is serenading him, accompanied by 
               an angel-faced and extremely heavy child-man, PANGLE, whose 
               grin of delight seems permanent even in this claustrophobic, 
               grim world. Inman is panicked, puts a hand to push the fiddle 
               away. His voice is a croak, spoiled.

                                     INMAN
                         I'm not dying.

                                     STOBROD
                              (to Pangle)
                         What'd he say?

                                     PANGLE
                         Says he ain't about to die.

                                     STOBROD
                              (to Inman)
                         Truth to tell they say you are, 
                         Soldier. We'll meet again, in the 
                         better world.

               He changes his tune, and the tempo, finding a foot-slapping 
               rhythm, the two musicians grinning at each other. Inman lapses 
               back into unconsciousness. The rhythm becomes a hammering 
               sound...

               EXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               -- AS A MAN HAMMERS A TINTYPE OF HIS SON'S FACE into the 
               wooden porch of the Chapel, where it joins many other 
               portraits of those lost to the war. Monroe presides. One of 
               the slaves from Black Cove holds the ladder for the bereaved 
               father. Other families wait, with their own daguerreotype to 
               mount. It's a memorial service without bodies.

               Riders approach. Home Guard. Teague brings his horse up 
               alongside Monroe at the Chapel door, tips his hat in 
               condolence to the bereaved families. With him is a young, 
               intensely beautiful and flamboyant rider, BOSIE, his hair 
               long, a single fingernail bizarrely overgrown. Somehow 
               sinister.

                                     TEAGUE
                         My condolences to you all.

                              slave)
                         Keep an eye on the negro. They want 
                         what the white man got -- all of you 
                         watch out your brave boys give their 
                         lives to war and meantime your slaves 
                         carry murder, rape and arson to your 
                         firesides.

               EXT. APPROACH TO BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Cold Mountain at its loveliest. The CABRIOLET with Monroe 
               and his daughter heads towards the farm. At a bend they meet 
               a couple of riders, TWINS, from Teague's Home Guard, riding 
               furiously past them. Monroe reins in the trap and lets them 
               thunder past before continuing on their way home. Monroe is 
               intrigued by Ada, as if he's never looked at her before.

                                     ADA
                         What?

                         You're looking -- at this moment, I 
                         don't know why -- you're looking 
                         exactly like your mother.

               She squeezes his arm.

                                     MONROE
                         We commiserate about the folly of 
                         this terrible war.
                              (they ride in silence)
                         Do you worry when there's no word 
                         from him?
                              (no response)
                         From Mr. Inman?

                                     ADA
                         Yes. But then I've tried counting 
                         the number of words which passed 
                         between Mr. Inman and me.
                              (looking ahead, seeing 
                              smoke)
                         Is that a bonfire? So close to the 
                         barns.

               Then they see THE FAMILY OF SLAVES turn off the road as their 
               cabriolet approaches, running away into the fields.

                                     ADA
                         What's going on?

                              (shouting at the 
                              disappearing slaves)
                         Hey! Stop there! Hey!

               Monroe gets out of the cabriolet and runs into the fields 
               after the retreating family, who are carrying bundles, chairs, 
               personal items, all loaded up. Ada has already taken the 
               reins and has driven up to the house. THE BARN IN WHICH THE 
               SLAVE FAMILY HAD LIVED IS ON FIRE. Monroe catches one of the 
               women, remonstrates with her. She's upset, distressed, one 
               of her sons comes back, pushes Monroe to the ground. They 
               hurry away. Monroe gets up, hurries to the fire.

               A FIGURE SWINGS IN THE HEAT OF THE FLAMES, HANGING FROM A 
               BEAM. Monroe spies it as he catches up with Ada.

                                     MONROE
                         Dear God.

                                     ADA
                         No, Daddy, it's not real.

               The figure swings round. IT'S AN EFFIGY, A GROTESQUE 
               CARICATURE OF A BLACK MAN.

                                     MONROE
                              (appalled)
                         What is wrong with us all?

               Ada turns and runs off.

                                     ADA
                         I'll get help.
                              (shouting over her 
                              shoulder)
                         Keep away from the flames.

               Monroe stands and considers the flames. Ada turns back once 
               more to see him -- a small man silhouetted against the blaze.

               INT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. DAY

               INMAN lies; bandaged, eyes closed, in THE BALLROOM OF A 
               COLONIAL MANSION, co-opted as one ward of a Confederate 
               hospital. Rows of beds, the wounded and the dying, are lodged 
               between some vestiges of the room's former glory.

               SOME LOCAL WOMEN, conscious of their duty to the cause, are 
               brought through by an exhausted doctor, who's lost all his 
               grace. The windows are open, but it's still insufferably 
               hot, the muslin curtains barely moving.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Most of these men will be dead by 
                         the morning or, if they're stubborn, 
                         by nightfall. I have other men outside 
                         in the quadrangle waiting for the 
                         beds.

               The women try to process this, the attitude.

                                     DOCTOR
                         So, any kind word will be a blessing.

               One woman is overpowered by the stench, gags.

                                     DOCTOR
                         It's the heat. I'm sorry. They rot.

               The women begin to approach the beds.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Don't pray. If they're not God fearing 
                         you can stir up a hornet's nest.

               MRS. MORGAN, nervous, decent, sits next to INMAN. His mouth 
               is moving. She doesn't know what he's saying.

                                     MRS. MORGAN
                         I'm sorry, you want water?

               She bends to him again. His voice is a faint croak.

                                     INMAN
                         Pigeon River. Little East Fork.

               The Doctor is on his exit, stops at the bed.

                                     MRS. MORGAN
                         I'm sorry. I don't know what he's 
                         saying.

                                     DOCTOR
                         They ramble. Names of loved ones.

                                     MRS. MORGAN
                              (listening to Inman)
                         Pigeon River. Is that a place? Cold 
                         Mountain?

               The Doctor shrugs, not a detective, moves on, stops at the 
               man in the next bed. Has a brief look, calls to a nurse.

                                     DOCTOR
                         This man is dead.

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. LATE AFTERNOON

               Monroe and Ada are outside, a picnic at the summer table, 
               autumn leaves blowing up around them. Nearby the charred 
               skeleton of the barn. Ada gets up, clears away.

                                     MONROE
                         Thank you.

                         For your Providence, Oh lord, we 
                         thank you.

                                     ADA
                         Amen. That was the last of the ham.

                         It was delicious.

                         I have to learn how to cook.

                                     MONROE
                         I was going to say something in 
                         Chapel. Perhaps some of the womenfolk 
                         will volunteer.

                                     ADA
                         I can't have people coming here and 
                         cooking for me!

                                     MONROE
                         It's my fault. I should have raised 
                         you less like a companion and more 
                         like a young woman. I'm sorry.

                                     ADA
                         I'm not sorry, but I don't know how 
                         we'll get through another winter.

                                     MONROE
                         Will you play me something? Something 
                         peaceful while I look over my sermon.

               Ada takes the dishes away. He gets out his papers, his pen 
               and ink.

               INT. PARLOUR, BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK

               ADA PLAYS THE PIANO. Chopin's Prelude in E Minor. Outside in 
               the garden, Monroe has adjourned to his striped campaign 
               chair, and is hunched over his notes. The door of the parlour 
               is open and the music floats over to him as he works.

               Ada plays. A FEW SPOTS OF RAIN appear at the window. Then 
               the steady drumming of a summer shower.

                                     ADA
                              (still playing)
                         Daddy, bring the tablecloth in with 
                         you!

               She plays some more. Monroe hasn't come in. The rain splashes 
               on to the window..

                                     ADA
                         Daddy, come inside before you drown!

               After a few more bars, she stops playing and, curious, goes 
               to the door. She stands at the doorway. MONROE'S SERMON IS 
               CAUGHT IN THE WIND AND BLOWS AROUND HIM, THE INK RUN TO

               ABSTRACTIONS, his hand dropped and visible to Ada as, with 
               dread, she approaches. SHE CATCHES THE SODDEN PAPERS, CHASING 
               AFTER THEM, THEN REACHES HER DEAD FATHER.

               He's like a fish, his face shining with the rain, and glass 
               eyed. She leans in to him, her head to his heart, then runs, 
               oblivious to the rain, her dress already drenched, runs down 
               the lane.

                                     ADA (V.O.)
                         Dear Mr. Inman...

               INT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. NIGHT

               INMAN'S FACE as he drifts in and out of consciousness. Mrs. 
               Morgan, the hospital volunteer, sits by Inman's bed. She 
               holds ADA'S UNOPENED LETTER, badly weather damaged, the pages 
               stuck together, the writing blurred where the ink has run.

                                     MRS. MORGAN
                         It's come to you by way of Virginia.

               There are various dates, which she decodes.

                                     MRS. MORGAN
                         It's not too recent -- written this 
                         past winter. I'm afraid I can't read 
                         who it's from. Dear Mr. Inman,

               INT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               Ada is writing at her father's desk. A lonely room.

                                     ADA (V.O.)
                         -- I'm still waiting, as I promised 
                         I would, but I find myself alone and 
                         at the end of my wits --

               INT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. NIGHT

               Mrs. Morgan reads to Inman, trying to decipher the letter:

                                     MRS. MORGAN
                         -- at the end of my wits, so now I 
                         say to you, plain as I can, come 
                         back to me. Come back to me is my 
                         request.
                              (can't read the next 
                              bit)
                         Then something I can't read, 
                         something, come back to me.

               Inman is very still. Then, eyes glinting with determination, 
               gives a TINY NOD.

                                     OFFICIAL (O.S.)
                         By order of Zebulon Vance, Governor 
                         of this great state of North Carolina: 
                         any soldier turned deserter is guilty 
                         of treason and shall be hunted down 
                         like a dog. 

               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               Ada walks down the hill from the Chapel. There is an absence 
               of young people, but the older folk are gathered round the 
               General Store where a UNIFORMED OFFICIAL is reading from a 
               document.

                                     OFFICIAL
                         -- Any man takes in a deserter is 
                         likewise guilty of treason.

               The Official is flanked by Teague, Bosey and the twins, puffed 
               up with self-importance. Ada has to walk around him to enter 
               the store.

                                     OFFICIAL
                         The Home Guard is powered to enter 
                         any place it sees fit, without notice 
                         or constraint. Names of all deserters 
                         will be posted in every town, 
                         published in every newspaper.

               INT. GENERAL STORE, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               The Official continues outside as Ada enters. Ada approaches 
               Mrs Castlereagh, the owner.

                                     ADA
                         Is there a letter for me?

                                     MRS. CASTLEREAGH
                         Nothing -- we're getting no post 
                         through at all -- although if you 
                         slip out back the material you ordered 
                         has arrived.

               They go to the back of the store, to a screened-off area. 
               Mrs. Castlereagh hands her over a packet of material. There's 
               another, more furtive, transaction to take place. Mrs 
               Castlereagh hands over a second parcel as if it were 
               narcotics. Ada tears at the wrapping. It's a parcel of books.

                                     MRS. CASTLEREAGH
                         If folks knew I was taking deliveries 
                         from the North.

                         The sooner we lose this war the 
                         better. Already one boy gone, another 
                         with his leg took off at the knee. 
                         That's enough.

                         All I know is they say not one boy 
                         in ten from these mountains is coming 
                         home again and most of them are 
                         deserters.

               EXT. GENERAL STORE, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               Ada emerges, almost collides with Teague. She wriggles past 
               him, tries to make her package invisible.

               EXT. APPROACH TO BLACK COVE FARM - DAY

               IT'S WINTER. A solitary RIDER jogs his horse through the 
               frost, towards Black Cove farm.

               Ada is working at a handpump, failing to coax water from the 
               well. She's wrapped in blankets. The farm is somewhat unkempt 
               and so is she. The hem of her skirt is frayed. She rips at 
               it tearing off a strip of material, which she binds around 
               the handle in an attempt to thaw the mechanism. Then she 
               looks up to see the horseman approaching. It's Teague. Ada 
               immediately heads inside the house.

               Teague arrives at the house, takes a brace of RABBITS from 
               his saddlebag. He heads for the gate. The gate needs oiling, 
               the path is overgrown, he looks at the pump handle, the 
               abandoned pitcher.

               Ada opens the door, pinning her hair.

                         I reckoned you might need fattening 
                         up.

               Ada takes them. She is very queasy with these dead animals.

               He turns and stops at the gate, runs his hands through his 
               hair and uses the grease to ease the hinge. Then steps up 
               onto his horse, and rides away. Ada watches him. Shudders.

               INT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               Ada comes into the kitchen. A weak oil-lamp reveals THE TWO 
               RABBITS, partially covered on a plate, flies buzzing around 
               them, a little liquid leaking from them. Ada takes a knife 
               and contemplates skinning gutting them. Suddenly she gathers 
               them up and runs out.

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               ADA BURIES THE TWO RABBITS. The wind howls. She covers the 
               little hole with soil and stones. Pumps out water to wash 
               her hands. Thinks she hears a noise, listens, alert to any 
               unfamiliar sounds, then hurries back to the house.

               INT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               Ada comes inside, she closes the door. Locks it. Puts a chair 
               against it. Goes upstairs, to her bedroom.

               INT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               Ada enters her bedroom. It's a chaos of books, clothes, 
               dishes. She closes the door, sets another chair against it.

               Then drags her armchair up against that, books and papers 
               spilling onto the floor. She props up Inman's portrait, on, 
               the chair, as if he were guarding her. Sits on the bed and, 
               desolate, begins to write:

                         Should I imagine you are dead and,

                         with a faint heart.

               THERAPY FOR WOUNDED SOLDIERS. Some of those convalescing 
               swim or are helped to paddle in the healing sea. There are 
               rudimentary wheelchairs. Inman, a long way from home, is 
               amongst those sitting in one of these, very still, grey and 
               sick -- but alive. He pulls at the dressing on his neck, 
               exposing the still raw and livid wound to the sea air.

               Inman has his Bartram, his bookmark is the battered and foxed 
               picture of Ada, which he considers, before continuing to 
               read.

               Behind him A HUNDRED SLAVES AT WORK IN THE FIELDS, and behind 
               them the Mansion which has become the hospital. A series of 
               bells, of shouts, and the slaves stop working, prepare for 
               the long walk home, congregating, then forming a line, herded 
               by the foremen.

               Inman eases his position to bend over and dip his bandage in 
               the seawater. He brings the wet bandage to his neck, considers 
               the ocean, his fellow ragtag of wounded, the slaves, the 
               great fields, the Mansion. The whole meaning of this war 
               around him. A GRAVEL VOICE STARTS TO SING THE BLUES, CONTINUES

               -- A tintype of OAKLEY is added to the Chapel's votives, 
               hammered in alongside Rourke and Butcher. There are fifty or 
               more images now, the paint flaking around them. The exterior 
               of the Chapel, three years on, has taken on the burden of 
               recording history.

               There is no minister, no services, just the votives, 
               daguerreotypes or simply the names of those missing in action, 
               accompanied by tiny vases of wildflowers. The town shrouded 
               in mist, and quiet.

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. SPRING. DAY

               EVERYWHERE SIGNS OF PROFOUND NEGLECT, like a Grimm's fairy 
               tale of a deserted house. The fields are overgrown with weeds, 
               the gardens abandoned. The chickens have deserted the henhouse 
               and are wandering around the outbuildings, scuffing at the 
               packed dirt.

               Sally and Esco come up the overgrown path, avoiding the 
               chickens, and knock at the door.

                                     SALLY
                         Ada! Ada, It's Sally.

               They're seen from ground level, through a boxwood, as their 
               feet patrol the ground, turn away from the door, and then 
               retreat, their voices drifting away. Ada is there, crouching 
               in her hidey-hole, a blanket on the ground, her book. She 
               wants to reveal herself, but is too embarrassed.

                                     ESCO
                         Will you look at the state of this 
                         place!

                         Poor soul. She's got nobody and 
                         nothing and three hundred acres of 
                         misery.

               During this a ROOSTER, black and gold, struts into the 
               boxwood. As the rooster approaches, Ada shudders, tries to 
               shoo it away without alerting her presence. Ada peers through 
               the boxwood as Sally and Esco close the gate and recede. The 
               rooster comes at her again. She rises up, kicking out at it, 
               while he flares his wings, spurs flaying at her. Ada runs 
               from the boxwood, tormented by the triumphant rooster, which 
               continues to fly and scratch, driving her into the house.

               INT. ADA'S BEDROOM BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ada dabs at the scratches, her dress rolled down to the waist 
               to reveal her arms and shoulders. Now she shucks off the 
               dress completely and tries to find a clean replacement. There 
               isn't one, so she hunts through the overflowing laundry basket 
               for something less dirty.

               INT. MONROE'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ada enters her father's room, wearing undergarments.

               Everything as he left it and, in contrast to the rest of the 
               house, extremely tidy. She opens a wardrobe, finds one of 
               his coats, puts it on. It's much too big, and she rolls up 
               the sleeves, catches her pinched face and disheveled face in 
               a swivel mirror. She turns the mirror away and the image 
               swings into --

               EXT. GATES OF HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. DAY

               -- the figure of Inman walking, frail, grey. A kind of 
               lurching walk, as if his balance isn't guaranteed. He gets 
               close to the gate and interests a Guard, on the lookout for 
               would-be deserters. A BLIND MAN IS SELLING PEANUTS which he 
               roasts over a small fire. He's always singing. Inman 
               approaches. When Inman speaks, his voice is a croak.

                         head cent. I fear it might turn me 
                         hateful.

                         Then we don't agree. There's not 
                         much I wouldn't give for ten minutes 
                         of someplace.

                                     BLIND MAN
                         Someplace or someone.

                                     INMAN
                         Same difference.

                                     BLIND MAN
                         You watch yourself. They're shooting 
                         men who take themselves a walk.

               EXT. TREE PROMENADE, CHARLESTON. DAY

               Inman and a bunch of other walking wounded make their way, 
               under supervision, towards the town. The grandeur of the 
               approach, the carriages. The sorry state of the soldiers.

               INT. COURTHOUSE, CHARLESTON. DAY

               TWO GREAT TRESTLE TABLES, LOADED WITH CLOTHES. Underneath 
               the tables, boots -- laced together, origins various. The 
               charitable womenfolk are helping match clothes to recovering 
               soldiers, some of whom are still on crutches, or in 
               wheelchairs. Inman finds a black dresscoat, some pants, a 
               pair of boots. He accumulates a little pile. On his way out, 
               AN ELDERLY AND STAUNCH CONFEDERATE GENTLEMAN shakes his hand 
               and gives him an apple from the barrel.

               EXT. TEMPORARY BARBERSHOP, CHARLESTON. DAY

               Inman emerges from the Courthouse and joins the line for a 
               shave at the makeshift barbershop set up outside the 
               Courthouse. Two barbers, two chairs. A VERY ELEGANT SQUARE, 
               SOME STUCCO-FRONTED BUILDINGS, A GLIMPSE OF THE MONEYED SOUTH 
               IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THE MODEST TOWN OF COLD MOUNTAIN. AN 
               AUCTION HOUSE OPPOSITE ADVERTISES SLAVES, CATTLE, LAND...

                                     BARBER
                         Next.

               Inman settles in the seat. The Barber contemplates his scraggy 
               beard, the livid, scabbed wound on his neck.

                                     BARBER
                              (nervous)
                         I'll cut your hair, but I ain't about 
                         to shave you. That thing opens up, 
                         your head's liable to falloff.

               INT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. PREDAWN

               It is almost dawn. The window by Inman's bed is a frame giving 
               onto the still dark world. The Night Guard passes by on its 
               patrol of the perimeter. A CLEAN-SHAVEN INMAN IS FULLY DRESSED 
               UNDER THE COVERS. He gets his hat, pushes his book into his 
               knapsack and, with one step up, WALKS OUT OF THE WINDOW AND 
               INTO THE WORLD.

               EXT. THE OCEAN BY THE HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. DAWN

               Inman, his footprints in the sand, as he hurries along by 
               the edge of the ocean, away from the hospital...

               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

               -- as Ada walks, the wind kicking up around her, past the 
               Swanger place. She's bent and curiously dressed in her 
               father's coat.

                                     SALLY (V.O.)
                         Ada...

               Sally Swanger calls out from the field. She's concerned at 
               Ada's gaunt, ragged appearance. Ada waits for her approach.

                                     SALLY
                         You're skinny as a whippet, girl -- 
                         you're coming indoors with me.

                         I can't. I'm not -- I need to clean 
                         some clothes.

                                     SALLY
                         Great God, you ever looked at my 
                         husband! I can't get him to wear 
                         decent Church clothes Christmas 
                         morning. Hang on to me, the wind'll 
                         blow you over.

               And she folds her arm into Ada's. They walk up the lane.

               INT. SWANGER FARM. AFTERNOON

               Ada eats. Esco across from her contemplating her evident 
               appetite, the oversized man's jacket. Sally ladles more food 
               onto Ada's plate.

                                     SALLY

                              other)

                         but it's what folks do, like when 
                         they dangle a needle over the belly 
                         to see if you're carrying a boy or a

               EXT. YARD, SWANGER FARM. LATE DAY

               AN IMAGE -- DISTORTED, WATERY. IT'S HARD TO RESOLVE BUT COULD 
               BE A CORRIDOR OF TREES. THE SUN LOW AT ONE END, THE SILHOUETTE 
               OF A FIGURE WALKING SLOWLY FORWARDS, A SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF 
               CROWS.

               Ada is bent backwards over the well, a hand mirror glinting 
               down into the blackness. The reflection is elusive against 
               the bright evening sky, the sun almost set, and low.

                         See anything?

                         I tried many a time, never saw a 
                         dickybird.

               The image is clearer. The trees sharpen, the figure walking, 
               the steep incline of the corridor, all fiercely black and 
               white as if it were a carpet of snow and black hieroglyphs 
               of trees, and crows flying. The trick of the glass and the 
               watery disc of the well surface. A buzzing in Ada's ears, 
               something like a distant music. Then the figure seems to 
               suddenly pitch forwards, but at that moment, Ada -- canted 
               over, getting dizzy has to move and the image flies away, 
               replaced with the sky, the flash of the setting sun.

                         You all right?

               Ada's faint. She sits up, blank, a little shaken.

                         Yesterday I found myself crouched

               EXT. PLANTATION. DAY

               Inman walks along an expanse of marshland. Great cranes fly 
               heavily over him.

                         I thought I saw you there, walking 
                         back to me --

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. LATE AFTERNOON

               Ada is writing in her father's campaign chair, a blanket 
               wrapped around her, a rake propped next to her.

                                     ADA (V.O.)
                         -- or wished I did.

                         That cow wants milking.

               Ada looks up from her writing with a start. She covers her 
               letter, guiltily, instinctively. In front of her, at the 
               gate, is A YOUNG RAWBONED, FERAL WOMAN, OF INDETERMINATE 
               ORIGINS. She is barefoot, and dressed in a hand-dye_ shift 
               of blue. Her name is RUBY.

                         help. Here I am.

               Ada is instantly defensive, intimidated.

                         I'm sure of it. He's Lucifer himself. 
                         I go near him he's at me with his 
                         spurs.

                         I despise a flogging rooster. Where 
                         is he?

               Ada gets up, nods to the corner of the yard. Ruby goes over.

               The Rooster gathers himself up for a new opponent.

               IN ONE MOVEMENT SHE PICKS UP THE BIRD AND TWISTS OFF ITS 
               HEAD.

                                     RUBY
                         Let's put him in a pot.

               EXT. CORNFIELDS. DAWN

               Inman's walking on a track which passes through cornfields, 
               the crop high and thick around him. He stops, hearing 
               something. Riders. He wades into the field, seeking cover in 
               the tall crop, lying in the dirt. Horses appear. HOME GUARD 
               MEN ON PATROL, A CHAIN GANG OF PRISONERS: SLAVES, DESERTERS 
               IN TOW, A COUPLE OF FEDERAL SOLDIERS. They have dogs, which 
               sniff and growl, intrigued by the fields, called back by the 
               Home Guard.

               Inman waits until they're well out of sight. AS HE GETS TO 
               HIS FEET IN THE GREAT FIELDS, ANOTHER BODY APPEARS, THEN 
               ANOTHER, THEN ANOTHER, THEN ANOTHER, ALL SLAVES ON THE RUN 
               DOTTED AROUND THE FIELD. He walks to the road, paying no 
               heed to them. They assemble, paying no heed to him and move 
               off in the opposite direction. Inman turns, looks at them.

                                     INMAN
                         Hey!
                              (they stop, turn)
                         I'd pay a dollar for an egg. A piece 
                         of cheese.

               They look at him, then continue on their way.

               Ada wakes up to persistent knocking.

               Ruby emerges, followed by Ada, chewing on a tomato.

                                     RUBY

               Ruby's already pitching hay. Turns to Ada.

                                     RUBY
                         You mucking out?

               Ada half-asleep, obedient, stunned by this energy.

                                     RUBY
                         Three years I was in school before 
                         my daddy -- saying God rest his soul 
                         is like wishing him what he had in 
                         life, cause he lived to rest, he was 
                         born tired -- before my daddy decided 
                         there was better use for my backside 
                         than have it sat all day in front of 
                         a blackboard.

               EXT. A FIELD OF WEEDS, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ruby dictates a list to Ada as they bustle along.

               Ada scribbles, walks, scribbles.

               Ruby up a ladder, inspecting the roof.

               Ruby doing her version of soil analysis, scrunching the earth, 
               tasting it, spitting it out. Ada makes a face.

                         Clear and turn this field. No harm

               Ruby, delighted, contemplates the bounty of apples.

                         You got a cider press or would that

                         Actually, yes, I think we do.

               Ruby whoops, jogs away. Ada, exhausted takes a bite of an 
               apple, watches her.

               EXT. A BLUFF. NIGHT

               INMAN WALKS A ROCKY TRACK, FALLING AWAY TO THE RIVER AT ONE 
               SIDE, A STEEP CLIFF TO THE OTHER, the way itself broken and 
               precarious, bad country to meet an enemy.

               Inman sees A LIGHT in the distance, a torch flicking in and 
               out of view, like a star to follow. He stops, narrows his 
               eyes to focus on the view, listening hard. He pulls out the 
               Lemats.

               A MAN, ALL IN BLACK, A HORSE IN TOW, IS AT THE EDGE OF THE 
               GORGE.

               The horse has a burden -- a sack or wrapped bundle draped 
               over either side of the saddle. The attempts to heave the 
               bundle onto his shoulders. He can't, and the bundle slips to 
               the ground, cover falling enough to glimpse an arm, a head. 
               IT IS THE BODY OF A BLACK GIRL. The man tries again to lift 
               her. He's clearly upset, despairing, his hat comes off to 
               reveal long, dandy's hair, all extravagant curls. He staggers 
               with the weight of the girl, heading for the lip of the deep 
               gorge.

               He kisses the girl again and again, cheeks, mouth, mumbling 
               to her. He's at the edge now and can just let her go. THEN 
               INMAN'S GUN IS AT HIS TEMPLE.

                                     INMAN
                         Don't let go. Just back up, nice and 
                         steady, do this all in reverse, you're 
                         going to end up with her draped back 
                         over your animal.

                                     VEASEY
                         Don't pull that trigger. I am a man 
                         of God.

                                     INMAN
                         I've killed several of them.

                                     VEASEY
                         I mean I am God's minister.

                                     INMAN
                         What part of God's business is 
                         throwing a woman down a gorge.

                                     VEASEY
                         A slave woman, can you see that in 
                         this light? She's black as a bucket 
                         of tar.

               He's retreating, on his way back to the horse.

                                     INMAN
                         Is she dead?

                                     VEASEY
                         Drugged her. Like you would a 
                         butterfly. And I care for her, that's 
                         the heartbreak of it.

               He has the girl back on the horse. Inman brings the torch up 
               to his face. It's tear-stained.

                                     VEASEY
                         She's got my bastard in her belly. 
                         What kind of pistol is that I never 
                         saw the like of it?

               EXT. VEASEY TOWN. NIGHT

               Inman leads the horse, with Veasey ahead of him, hands tied 
               behind his back, desperate for a reprieve.

                                     VEASEY
                         I'm begging you. It's better you 
                         blowout my brains than return me to 
                         this place.

                                     INMAN
                         Where does she live?

                                     VEASEY
                         In our house. She sleeps in our 
                         kitchen. You don't know me, friend, 
                         but the good Lord punished me with 
                         want. I am all appetite. That's all 
                         I do all day is want: food, the female 
                         parts...

                                     INMAN
                         Shut your mouth. I don't want a sermon 
                         every time I ask a question.

               They're in the town's main drag now. There's a Chapel and 
               next to it, a small house.

                                     INMAN
                         This your place?

                                     VEASEY
                         Dear God of misery.

                                     INMAN
                         You're going to put her back where 
                         she sleeps.

                                     VEASEY
                         I do that the Members will lynch me. 
                         Consorting with a nigger, adultery, 
                         siring a bastard while serving as 
                         their preacher. We're a strict 
                         congregation we've churched men for 
                         picking up a fiddle on the sabbath.

                                     INMAN
                         So you reckoned to kill her.

               Disgusted, Inman approaches the front door of the house.

                                     VEASEY
                         There's a back door. Have pity.

               And he leads Inman down a side path.

               INT. VEASEY HOUSE. NIGHT

               Veasey comes in, now carrying the girl. Inman comes behind, 
               the gun trained on Veasey as he sets her down by the fire.

                                     VEASEY
                              (whispering)
                         Thank you. I was going to do a 
                         grievous wrong.

               He looks longing at the girl as he puts the blanket around 
               her shoulders. He turns to Inman.

                                     VESEY
                         You tasted dark meat? Sweet as 
                         liquorice. I think I should go back 
                         up to my wife. She wakes at the 
                         slightest noise.

               Inman is incredulous that he thinks he can just go to bed...

                                     INMAN
                         You find me some paper and a pen.

               EXT. CHAPEL, VEASEY TOWN. DAWN

               INMAN HAS TIED A VERY DISTRAUGHT VEASEY TO A TREE IN FRONT 
               OF HIS CHAPEL. Inman is pinning a sheet of paper above 
               Veasey's head. It's covered in handwriting. A dog barks.

                                     VEASEY
                         You're not entitled to judge me! 
                         You're nothing but an outlier, plain 
                         as daylight!

               Inman has pulled a handkerchief from Veasey's jacket. He 
               stuffs it into his mouth, cutting this diatribe short. And 
               then he walks away leaving Veasey tied to the tree, cursing 
               through the handkerchief.

               INT. ADA'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. PREDAWN

               Ada asleep. Ruby enters, shattering the calm.

                                     RUBY
                         Morning. Pigs: you have any loose in 
                         the woods?

                                     ADA
                         No. What? No. We bought our hams.

                                     RUBY
                         There's a world more to a hog than 
                         the two hams! Lard, for example, 
                         we'll need plenty --

               She picks up some discarded laundry, contemplates the 
               overflowing laundry basket.

                                     RUBY
                         The catastrophe of Ada Monroe's 
                         laundry.
                              (marching out)
                         I can feel you shutting your eyes.

               EXT. BOTTOM FIELD. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ada and Ruby working with the horse to make the beginnings 
               of A SPLIT RAIL FENCE. As they struggle with a heavy rail, 
               Ruby is testing Ada.

                                     RUBY
                         What's this wood?

                                     ADA
                         I don't know. Locust?

                                     RUBY
                         Where's North?

                                     ADA
                         North is, North is --

                                     RUBY
                         Name me three herbs growing wild on 
                         this farm.

                                     ADA
                              (frustrated with Ruby 
                              and with herself)
                         I can't! I can't! All right? I can 
                         talk about farming in Latin. Will 
                         that do? I can read French. I know 
                         Harmony and Counterpoint. I know my 
                         Bible. I can name the principal rivers 
                         of Europe, but don't ask me to name 
                         one stream in this county. I can 
                         embroider, but I can't darn, I can 
                         arrange cut flowers, but I can't 
                         grow them. If a thing has a function, 
                         if I might do something with it, it 
                         wasn't considered suitable.

                                     RUBY
                         Why?

                                     ADA
                         Ruby, you could ask why? about pretty 
                         much everything to do with me.

               They manage to get the first line of rail set down.

                                     ADA
                         This fence is about the first thing 
                         I've ever done that'll produce an 
                         actual result.

                                     RUBY
                         So you never wrapped your legs around 
                         this Inman?

               An old-fashioned look from Ada...

               EXT. SUNKEN FOREST. DAY

               Inman finds himself in A SUNKEN FOREST OF PINE. He moves 
               warily, his beard longer, his figure gaunt, his clothes 
               weathering to a uniform smudge of charcoal.

               He hears DOGS BARKING IN THE DISTANCE, FAINT SHOUTS. He picks 
               up his pace, skirts round the swampy lake.

               EXT. CAPE FEAR RIVER. DUSK

               Inman comes to the bank of a HUGE RIVER. The water, as the 
               light begins to go, is the color of mud, with bubbles, 
               belching to the surface, full of ugly prominent. Inman is 
               almost jogging now, an ear tracking his still distant 
               pursuers. The river is too wide to contemplate swimming and 
               now it begins to curve left, forcing him -- against his 
               judgment, to circle back. He approaches A SMALL JETTY.

               A sign: Ferry $5. Yell Loud.

               On the far bank there's A CABIN ON STILTS above the highwater 
               mark. Inman calls out, reluctantly, his voice still a kind 
               of growl. Then again.

               A TINY FIGURE steps out of the cabin and waves before jumping 
               into a small canoe. The canoe heads against the current, the 
               rower's back bent with the effort. As the canoe approaches, 
               Inman sees that the ferryman is, in fact, A YOUNG GIRL, not 
               eighteen. She doesn't look at him. He produces five dollars. 
               She eyes the bill with contempt.

                                     FERRYGIRL
                         For five dollars I wouldn't give a 
                         parched man a dipper of this 
                         riverwater.

                                     INMAN
                         Sign says ferry, five dollars.

                                     FERRYGIRL
                         This look like a ferry? My Daddy's 
                         dead, or gone off to the Federals, 
                         don't matter which. I'm the way across 
                         now.

                                     INMAN
                         What's the name of this thing?

                                     FERRYGIRL
                         Nothing but the mighty Cape Fear 
                         River, is all.

               A dog barks in the distance. Getting closer. Inman turns to 
               the sound. The Ferrygirl is well aware of her leverage.

                                     FERRYGIRL
                         Nobody crosses this water unless 
                         they're running from someplace. Some 
                         cross one way, some the other: makes 
                         no difference, they're all running. 
                         You want to wait for your friends?

                                     INMAN
                         I can give you thirty dollars script.

                                     FERRYGIRL
                         Let's go.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Hey! Hey! Wait!

               Inman is astonished to see VEASEY stumble out of the trees. 
               His head is shaved, his face bruised and swollen, his clothes 
               castoffs and ill-fitting, cinched at the waist with rope. He 
               stumbles towards Inman, urging him to get on with the journey.

                                     VEASEY
                         Keep going. We're both in trouble.

               He gets straight into the canoe.

                                     INMAN
                         No. Get out.

                                     VEASEY
                         It's Homeguard. Made me tell them 
                         all about you.

                                     INMAN
                         I should have shot you when I had 
                         the chance.

               Shouts, more barking. Inman jumps in the canoe, and they're 
               off. The Ferrygirl turns the boat around, rows them away 
               from the jetty with the grace of someone doing something for 
               the thousandth time.

                                     VEASEY
                         I'm not looking for revenge, by the 
                         way. For what you did to me. No, I'm 
                         a Pilgrim now, like you, traveling 
                         the road, paying our dues, relying 
                         on the kindness of strangers.

                                     INMAN
                         You're nothing like me and the last 
                         thing I want right now is a 
                         conversation.

                                     VEASEY
                              (to Ferrygirl)
                         You recall Job in the scriptures? I 
                         will give free utterance to my 
                         complaint. I will speak in the 
                         bitterness of my soul. That's our 
                         friend here...
                              (to Inman)
                         They cut off my hair. Which was hard. 
                         I was vain about my hair.
                              (to Ferrygirl)
                         I had good curls. But I deserved it. 
                         I'm the Reverend Veasey. Have I seen 
                         you in church?

               Inman sits, scouring the bank for sign of his pursuers. The 
               sun is sinking fast.

                                     FERRYGIRL
                         I'm saving for a cowhide, and when I 
                         get it I aim to get a saddle made, 
                         and when I get me a saddle I'll save 
                         for a horse, and when I got a horse 
                         I'll throw on the saddle, and then 
                         you won't see my sorry ass round 
                         this swamp again.

               She has no love for the river. Another gurgle of viscous 
               bubbles around the canoe.

                                     VEASEY
                         What's that?

                                     FERRYGIRL
                         Catfish. 'gator. Keep your hand in 
                         the boat. Already looks like some 
                         critter chewed his neck.
                              (she looks at Inman)
                         Thirty more dollars, we can go to 
                         the cabin. I'll pull this dress over 
                         my head.

                                     VEASEY
                              (excited)
                         Have we got thirty dollars?

               A sharp sound, a tiny thwack of ball on meat. The Ferrygirl 
               SUDDENLY SLUMPS BACK and falls into the water.

               Veasey grabs out at the oar, but it goes, too. The girl sinks 
               quickly, A BLOODY GAP to the side of her head. Inman, on his 
               knees and stretching, can't help her. Then a second noise as 
               A HOLE THE SIZE OF A FIST appears in the canoe, just at 
               waterlevel. Water pours into the canoe. Dogs bark, and now 
               FIGURES are visible at the jetty. HOME GUARD. One of them 
               has a sniper's rifle and is loading for a third shot. Inman 
               can see him sighting the rifle. They lie flat in the canoe.

               ANOTHER GREAT FIST OF WOOD is gouged out. Now the boat is 
               almost full of water. Veasey spits out a foul mouthful. INMAN 
               ROCKS THE CANOE AND LETS IT TURN OVER ONTO THEM, Veasey 
               surfaces from under it, clutching the wood as a raft, but 
               the canoe CATCHES INMAN A BLOW TO HIS HEAD and he sinks. 
               Veasey hauls him to the surface and, surprisingly strong, 
               holds him with one fist, the boat with the other, lets the 
               current take them, pulling them under, then up, under, then 
               up, but clinging on, as the rifle continues to deliver its 
               assault, another shot into the boat, another into the water 
               near to Veasey's arm.

               THE GIRL'S BODY comes by them, carried by the river, the 
               dress billowing out almost covering her head. The sun has 
               gone, the light fading, the canoe sliding downriver away 
               from their aggressors.

               EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CAPE FEAR. NIGHT

               In the moonlight, the canoe drifts into the muddy bank and 
               Veasey drags a half-drowned Inman to land, both of them 
               retching with the vile river water. AN ALLIGATOR eases into 
               the river not ten feet from where they lie, lungs heaving. 
               They get up. Veasey to his feet, Inman to his knees.

                                     VEASEY
                         You okay?

               Inman nods, coughs. And Veasey AIMS A KICK at Inman's head, 
               knocking him back into the mud.

                                     INMAN
                         Jesus, god!

                                     VEASEY
                         I figure that righteous, given our 
                         history. Otherwise I'd bear a grudge 
                         on our journey.

                                     INMAN
                         There's nowhere I'm going with you 
                         except to Hellfire!

               INT. ADA'S BEDROOM. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               Ada, her hair plaited in a new and simpler configuration, is 
               working on Ruby's hair, while Ruby experiments with some 
               earrings.

               A pile of Ada's jewelry on the bed beside them.

                                     ADA
                         Agricola poetis viam non monstrat.

                         Which means?

                                     ADA
                         The farmer does not point out the 
                         road to a poet.

                                     RUBY
                         Which means? Should be the other way 
                         round

                                     ADA
                         Which means, I suppose, which means 
                         the poet should know where he's going.

                                     RUBY
                              (of Ada's hairdressing)
                         It's no wonder you're helpless and 
                         hopeless if it takes this long to 
                         fix your hair.

                              knows all these 
                              phrases by heart)
                         It's appalling what's in my head.

                         No, it means: A change of place does 
                         not change a character.

                                     RUBY
                         Well that's surely true even in 
                         English.

                                     ADA
                         You can keep those earrings.

                                     RUBY
                         We can't keep anything.

                                     ADA
                         I have to keep the bangles. They 
                         were my mother's.

                                     RUBY
                         Well that's all. The rest is for 
                         trading. Else they can bury you in 
                         your finery.

                         You're done.

               There's a small mirror on a stand. It has Inman's picture 
               stuck in it. She picks it up, removing the tintype, and 
               holding it up for Ruby to see her hairstyle.

                                     RUBY
                         Good God! Okay.

               She takes the mirror and shows Ada her simple plait.

                                     ADA
                         I like it.

                         Takes two minutes. That's what I 
                         like.

               She puts the earrings back in the pile.

                                     RUBY
                         How much do you love that piano?

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK

               THE PIANO jangles down the rutted lane on the back of Mr. 
               Roy's cart. Ada watches, A SMALL FLOCK of sheep milling around 
               her in the path. Ruby is dragging a big sow towards the yard. 
               Ada picks up one of two sacks and staggers towards the house.

               INT. KITCHEN, BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK

               Ada arrives in the kitchen. They've got it under control 
               now, scrubbed and orderly. She puts the sack down next to 
               another one. Her hands are calloused, the finger nails cracked 
               and ruined, stripes of earth under them. Ruby comes in, 
               struggling with the last sack, pleased.

                                     RUBY
                         We're careful we'll get through the 
                         winter now. I made old man Roy give 
                         me ten of those sheep on account of 
                         I said they were so small put together 
                         they were no bigger than six proper 
                         sheep.

                                     ADA
                         My father always wanted sheep on 
                         this land.

                                     RUBY
                         I'm sorry you had to lose your piano. 
                         I cut off my hair once, for money. 
                         My daddy got two dollars for it. 
                         Made a wig for a rich feller in 
                         Raleigh.

               They're working as they talk, taking the sacks into the 
               larder, putting out stuff for the evening meal.

                                     RUBY
                         Stobrod called himself a musician -- 
                         my daddy -- he could play six tune 
                         on a fiddle. Got himself shot dead 
                         at Petersburg. I was like his goat 
                         or some creature tethered to a post. 
                         He left me once, up the mountains. I 
                         was eight. He was gone over two weeks.

                                     ADA
                         Oh Ruby.

                              (defiant)
                         I was all right! He'd walk forty 
                         miles for liquor and not forty inches 
                         for kindness.

                                     ADA
                         And your mother?

                                     RUBY
                         Never met her. We're the same in 
                         that regard. He said she was -- he 
                         told me a thousand stories -- she 
                         was a wolf or an indian or a donkey. 
                         Don't say much for him, except you 
                         know he'd be fast to work up a sweat 
                         on a tree if he thought there was 
                         pleasure in it.

               There's a pause. Ruby not easy with her emotions. Abruptly 
               she jumps up.

                                     RUBY
                         There's cows to milk.

               EXT. RIVER, EN ROUTE TO SALISBURY. DAY

               Inman stands in the river, hoping to catch a fish, trying to 
               concentrate. Veasey presides, complaining...

                                     VEASEY
                         Used to be as regular as morning 
                         prayers. Matter of fact I could set 
                         my watch by my bowels. That beeswax 
                         you fed me, day before yesterday, it 
                         stops a man up. Open my gut now they'd 
                         find turds stacked up like little 
                         black twigs.

               On a parallel track across the river, RIDERS... impossible 
               to say whether Home Guard or a Federal Raiding Party. Inman 
               splashes out of the water, pushes Veasey down, silencing 
               him. The riders pass.

               Veasey spots something shining in the grass, picks it up. 
               IT'S A LONG TWO-HANDED SAW.

                                     VEASEY
                         Hey! Look at this!
                              (flexing it)
                         This is a good saw.

                                     INMAN
                              (getting up)
                         It's not yours. You take it, you 
                         make us another enemy. You're a 
                         Christian -- don' t you know your 
                         commandments?

                                     VEASEY
                         You'll find the good Lord very 
                         flexible on the subject of property. 
                         We could do a lot with this saw...

               Inman is vexed, walks away. Veasey follows, experimenting 
               with the saw's music when flexed. Inman stalks on.

               EXT. NEAR A FORD. DAY

               Inman way ahead, full of purpose. Veasey still has the saw, 
               trots to catch up.

                                     VEASEY
                         Why you in such a hurry the whole 
                         time?
                              (no answer)
                         Hurry or slow the destination is 
                         always the same. It's only the journey 
                         that is different. That's either in 
                         the Good Book or I made it up.

               Inman suddenly stops, scowling, puts up a hand, listens.

               Inman carefully scouts the track then, with great caution, 
               edges towards the river bank.

               A HEAVY SET MAN labours in the water. He's contemplating THE 
               HUGE BLACK CARCASS OF A BULL which has slipped into the ford 
               and died. The man is wet and exasperated.

                                     VEASEY
                         Good day to you!

               The man turns, his spirit evidently lifted by the prospect 
               of help. His name is JUNIOR. He's working on roping the 
               animal.

                                     JUNIOR
                         My old bull, wandered off and died 
                         in this here creek. Fouled up our 
                         water is how I found it.

               Veasey is immediately an authority on bull removal.

                                     VEASEY
                         This is a tricky one.

               The three men contemplate the carcass, swatting away the 
               swarms of flies. Junior offers a swig from a jug of liquor.

               Inman refuses, Veasey takes a long pull, shudders happily.

                                     VEASEY
                         The name for the Bull's member is a 
                         tassel. I learned that and never 
                         forgot it.

                                     JUNIOR
                         Reckon I need a train of mules.

                                     VEASEY
                              (walking away)
                         I'm getting an idea. My saw is the 
                         remedy. Let's saw up some wood and 
                         make levers.

                                     INMAN
                         Then what?

                                     VEASEY
                         Lever him out. This'll work!

               He walks into the wood.

                                     JUNIOR
                         Where you two sports heading?

                                     INMAN
                              (inscrutable)
                         I don't know where he's heading. I'm 
                         going down the road. And I got a 
                         good way to go before nightfall.

                                     JUNIOR
                              (acknowledging his 
                              attitude)
                         Charitable of you to make a stop. 
                         Ain't for me to be curious.

                                     VEASEY
                              (emerges from the 
                              woods)
                         How do you work this damn thing?

                                     INMAN
                              (to Veasey)
                         Give me that saw.
                              (to Junior)
                         Come on.

               He takes the saw, walks to the bull, gets on one side, 
               indicates Junior should go to the other.

                                     INMAN
                         Let's do this in chapters.

               And they begin to SAW OFF THE BULL'S NECK.

               LATER, and they're in A VILE STEW OF BLOOD AND INNARDS. The 
               stomach opens and its contents gush into the creek. Veasey 
               is disgusted, draws back. The two other men haul up the rest 
               of the animal onto the banks. They're exhausted.

                                     INMAN
                         You might want to leave off that 
                         water for a day or two.

                                     JUNIOR
                         There'll be a tang, I'd imagine.

               EXT. TRACK APPROACHING JUNIOR'S CABIN. EVENING

               Junior, Inman and Veasey come around a bend and there's A 
               BIG CABIN LOOMING. It's in such poor repair that one end has 
               slipped from the stones which serve as it's foundation and 
               STANDS BADLY TILTED OVER. Junior roots up another hidden jug 
               of liquor, which he drinks from, then hands to Veasey.

                                     JUNIOR
                         There's my place. Hope you can stomach 
                         a yard chock-full of females. Brought 
                         my woman home, she showed up with 
                         her three so-called sisters and their 
                         brats. The noise in that place is 
                         something awful. It's why I go 
                         hunting.

                                     VEASEY
                              (considering the wild 
                              camber)
                         Looks a bit crooked.

                                     JUNIOR
                         It is on a bit of a tilt. Them 
                         females. They all roll down one end 
                         each night!

                                     VEASEY
                         -- Roll me over!

                                     JUNIOR
                         -- In the clover

                                     VEASEY
                         One good fart -- that'll tip over!

               They guffaw, delighted in the alcohol haze. Veasey suddenly 
               exclaims, hand in the air, rushes into the bushes.

                                     VEASEY
                         Oh God of my God! Hallelujah! 
                         Hallelujah!

                                     JUNIOR
                         What's up?

                                     VEASEY
                         The Israelites! The tribes of Israel 
                         are about to flee from the banks of 
                         Egypt! Hallelujah!

                                     INMAN
                              (explaining to Junior)
                         He's got a shit coming on. It's 
                         overdue.

                                     JUNIOR
                              (bewildered)
                         And he's a Preacher? Like a Christian?

                                     INMAN
                         Like a Christian.

                                     JUNIOR
                         Good God.

               EXT. JUNIOR'S CABIN. DUSK

               The three men arrive at the yard. DOGS AND CHILDREN MILL 
               AROUND THE VISITORS. FOUR WOMEN COME OUT, one after the other 
               each of them in simple shifts which seem to emphasis their 
               voluptuousness, or so it seems to Veasey. They freely stare.

                                     JUNIOR
                         These two boys is stopping for supper. 
                         They're on the road to Atonement.

               The women consider the men, then disappear back inside.

                                     VEASEY
                         Atonement is not a place.

                                     JUNIOR
                         So what is it when it's at home?

                                     VEASEY
                         Those are fine examples of the female.

                                     JUNIOR
                         Take them all and leave the saw. Be 
                         a sight more use.

                                     SHYLA
                              (reappearing)
                         If they want to get in a tub there's 
                         an hour before food.

                                     JUNIOR
                         They love to scrub a man.
                              (to Shyla)
                         Put the water on the boil.
                              (back to the men)
                         It's my liquor, gets their titties 
                         swinging.

                                     VEASEY
                              (excited)
                         God damn!
                              (to Inman)
                         I was right about sheep droppings 
                         those stools -- like rock hard. Quite 
                         astonishing.

               INT. SMOKEHOUSE AT JUNIOR'S CABIN. DUSK

               No real furniture. Veasey is shaving. Inman stows his knapsack 
               behind the woodburning stove, on which a big kettle of boiling 
               water steams away. Then he gets in the tub, his back to the 
               door.

               Shyla comes in, brings the kettle over to the tub, pours in 
               the steaming water. She appraises Inman. It's intensely 
               sexual.

                                     SHYLA
                         That's battered flesh.
                              (of his neck wound)
                         I could work a finger in there.

                                     VEASEY
                         He's a hero. Took that wound at 
                         Petersburg.

                                     INMAN
                         He doesn't know what I am.
                              (uncomfortable with 
                              her stare)
                         Thanks.

                                     SHYLA
                              (to Veasey)
                         He's shy, ain't he?

                                     VEASEY
                         Wait up a few minutes, I'll be in 
                         that tub, then we'll see who's a shy 
                         one.

                                     SHYLA
                         I want to poke my thumb in his holes.

               A second woman comes to the door. Dolly.

                                     DOLLY
                         Lila says supper's up.

               INT. JUNIOR'S CABIN, NIGHT

               LILA, JUNIOR'S WIFE, spoons out stew from a vast pot. The 
               table crammed with customers -- her three sisters, the three 
               men, the herd of dogs and filthy children. Nobody speaks. 
               Each time Lila bends over to spoon out of the pot, her 
               cleavage strains against the flimsy fabric of her dress. 
               Veasey's mesmerized. Inman is also getting drunk, his eyes 
               increasingly glazed. When Lila makes to sit down next to 
               Junior, he slides a hand up her dress, exposing a naked 
               buttock, which he strokes and pinches as he pulls away.

                                     LILA
                         Hey!

               Junior grins, looks over at Inman, then nudges Veasey.

                                     JUNIOR
                         He's gone now. Look! His eyes have 
                         gone.

                                     INMAN
                              (vaguely, drunk)
                         What?

                                     VEASEY
                         Dolly?

                                     DOLLY
                         S'me.

                                     VEASEY
                         Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae. That's a 
                         poem. That's a poem.

               He begins to recite, has a verse in his mind.

                                     VEASEY
                         Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae
                              (but he can' t summon 
                              it)
                         Da-da da-da da-da dae...
                              (vague)
                         ...there's a poem there.

                                     JUNIOR
                         I'm leaving soon as I'm full.

                                     VEASEY
                         Really. Goodbye.

                                     JUNIOR
                         Got a bunch of traps needs visiting. 
                         I'll be back tomorrow, before dark. 
                         You'll still be here?

                                     VEASEY
                         That's my fervent prayer.

                                     JUNIOR
                         My house is your house.

                                     INMAN
                              (suddenly)
                         Like to wash their hands and pray.

                                     VEASEY
                         Say again?

                                     INMAN
                         Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae.

                                     VEASEY
                         That's Job. Don't say much but even 
                         liquored up there's a preacher in 
                         him.

               Inman gets up suddenly, sways.

                                     INMAN
                         I'll say my goodbyes, got miles and 
                         miles to go before sunset.
                              (head spinning)
                         I'll just quickly lie down.

               And he stumbles over to the fire where he instantly curls 
               up.

                                     VEASEY
                         I'm heading for that smokehouse and 
                         I'm ready to be washed clean of my 
                         dirt.

               He gets up, wanders out of the door. Junior's eyes glint. He 
               jerks his head towards the girls then in the direction of 
               the smokehouse.

                                     JUNIOR
                         You go tend to him.
                              (to Lila)
                         I'll be seeing you.

               He picks up his gun and leaves Dolly gathering up the children 
               and herding them out.

                                     DOLLY
                         Come on you -- get!

               Shyla stays, Mae having gone off after Veasey. Lila waits 
               until the children have gone. They consider Inman supine by 
               the fire.

                                     LILA
                         He's mine. You can go rub yourself 
                         off on the Preacher.
                              (of Inman)
                         Gonna make him hug me till I grunt.

               Lila shepherds Shyla out, shuts the door, swigs from the 
               jug, walks over to Inman, then turns to the big table and 
               pushes pots and plates way down to one end to make a playing 
               field.

               Then she bends over the prostrate Inman.

                                     LILA
                         Hey!

               Inman stirs, glazed.

                                     LILA
                              (kneeling down to him)
                         You want to see what Mamma's got for 
                         you?

               SHE SLIPS A SLEEVE OF HER DRESS TO REVEAL A FULL BREAST.

               Inman is drunk, doesn't think he's awake. She takes her breast 
               to his mouth, and Inman suckles. Then she puts his hands 
               under the dress which rides up as his hands move between her 
               legs. She's naked.

                                     LILA
                         That's good. Ain't that sweet?

               SHE PULLS INMAN TO HIS FEET, KISSES HIM, THEN TURNS HER BACK 
               AND LIES FACE DOWN ON THE TABLE, HER BARE ASS UNDULATING IN 
               THE AIR.

                                     LILA
                         You just get on and ride me all the 
                         way to China.

               He doesn't move, except to sway, eyes glazed. She turns.

                                     LILA
                         You shy? You need a hand?
                              (goes to his buttons)
                         Let's have a look see what we can 
                         muster.

               She's kneeling now, her dress hunched up around her middle, 
               working the front of Inman's pants. He's in a swoon, 
               surrendering to her, getting aroused, his hand cupping her 
               head. ON CUE, THE DOOR CRASHES OPEN AND HE'S STARING DOWN 
               THE BARREL OF JUNIOR'S SHOTGUN.

               As Lila turns, Junior KICKS HER violently in the head, 
               knocking her over.

                                     JUNIOR
                         You little bitch! Look at you! Cover 
                         yourself up!

               NEXT HE SWINGS THE SHOTGUN BARREL AGAINST THE SIDE OF INMAN'S 
               HEAD. Inman falls back. Junior goes to the door and whistles.

               AND WITH THAT THE ROOM FILLS UP WITH A GROUP OF HOME GUARD 
               BRISTLING WITH WEAPONS AND PURPOSE. THEY SEIZE INMAN, DRAG 
               HIM OUT AS JUNIOR SPITS AND KICKS AT HIM.

               INT. SMOKEHOUSE AT JUNIOR'S CABIN. NIGHT

               Lila enters the smokehouse, hand to her bruised head. VEASEY'S 
               ON THE FLOOR, WITH DOLLY ASTRIDE HIM, HIS ARM CRUSHING A 
               NAKED MAE INTO AN EMBRACE. He considers Lila, beams:

                                     VEASEY
                         I had a special prayer you'd come 
                         visit.

               THREE MEN BURST IN BEHIND HER, RIFLES RAISED.

               EXT. JUNIOR'S CABIN. NIGHT

               Veasey led out, a CHAIN GANG waiting -- a bedraggled 
               collection of prisoners, slaves, deserters -- and now INMAN. 
               Veasey is joined to the line. It starts to rain.

               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

               Ruby and Ada at the door of the Swanger house. They both 
               wear Monroe's clothes by now, like two little men. THEY'RE 
               CARRYING A SMALL SACK, A PIE UNDER A CLOTH. Ruby hammers at 
               the door, a little impatient. Sally Swanger opens it, has to 
               decode who it is under the clothes, the hats.

                                     SALLY
                         Ada Monroe and Ruby Thewes! Look at 
                         you both!

                                     RUBY
                         Look at us both what?

                                     SALLY
                         Like a coupla scarecrows after a 
                         thunderstorm.

                                     RUBY
                         We need a scarecrow, birds eating up 
                         half our winter garden.

                                     ADA
                         Sally's right. We should both stop 
                         toiling and stand a while with our 
                         arms stretch out. I'll volunteer.

                                     RUBY
                         We got something for you.

                                     ADA
                         For all your kindness. Coffee. And a 
                         pie.

                                     RUBY
                         That's real coffee. It ain't hickory 
                         and dirt.

                                     SALLY
                              (taking the gifts)
                         Thank you both.
                              (of the pie)
                         Ruby, I look forward to this. We all 
                         do. Esco and me.

                                     RUBY
                              (grinning at Ada)
                         She made it.

                                     ADA
                         I made it.

                                     SALLY
                         Good God in Heaven.

                                     RUBY
                              (by way of 
                              recommendation)
                         I'm still alive.

               Sally's strangely awkward, lingering at the door, staring at 
               the gifts...

                                     RUBY
                         We'll be getting along.

                                     SALLY
                              (nodding)
                         I know Esco's going to be real sorry 
                         he missed you. You all take care.

               They all kiss, then the girls walk back down the path. Ruby 
               is vexed.

                                     RUBY
                         That strike you as odd?

                                     ADA
                         What?

                                     RUBY
                         Stood at her front door?

                                     ADA
                         Sally?

                                     RUBY
                         Number one -- I know that woman all 
                         my life. I never stood outside her 
                         house -- she'd invite a wolf inside 
                         if it knocked on the door.

                                     ADA
                         Perhaps, I don't know, perhaps she 
                         was busy.

                                     RUBY
                         Number two -- Old Man Swanger was 
                         inside that house: I could smell his 
                         pipe burning. Number three -- look 
                         at these fields.

                                     ADA
                         What about them?

               She contemplated the stubble fields they're passing.

                                     RUBY
                         We came by here a week ago, they 
                         were waist high in hay.

               EXT. A PATH. DRIVING RAIN. NIGHT

               The Home Guard ride, bent under their oilskins, as the rain 
               tips down. Between the horses, unprotected and drenched, 
               their prisoners trudge along the muddy path. Inman and Veasey 
               among them. Veasey has grown some beard.

               AN OLDER MAN COLLAPSES, lies where he falls, not moving.

               There's a domino effect and so Inman falls on top of him. He 
               picks himself up, then tries to pull up the older man. He 
               doesn't move.

                                     INMAN
                         He's dead.

               The horses plough on. Inman shouts to BROWN, the leader.

                                     INMAN
                         This man's dead!

               Nobody pays any attention. He has to drag the body.

               EXT. VEASEY TOWN. DAY

               THE HOME GUARD ESCORT THE PRISONERS PAST VEASEY'S OLD CHURCH.

               More days have gone by and taken their toll on the prisoners, 
               Veasey and Inman are haggard and filthy and reduced. The 
               Home Guards stop for food, a wash, a break, chain the 
               prisoners to a horse rail.

               Citizens go by, Veasey knows them all. Some of them spit 
               contemptuously at the Deserters. None of them recognise 
               Veasey.

                                     VEASEY
                         Am I so altered that they don't see 
                         me?

               Somebody walks by with a young child.

               Veasey looks at Inman.

                                     VEASEY
                         I christened that child.

               The child stops, looks without recognizing, is tugged away 
               from the chain gang by his mother. One of the other prisoners, 
               SHEFFIELD, leans in to Inman, his voice low.

                                     SHEFFIELD
                         I'm looking to get out of this. They 
                         drag us back to fight -- we're just 
                         target practice for the Federal boys.

                                     INMAN
                         You run, we're all running with you, 
                         the lame and the stupid, of which we 
                         number both.

                                     SHEFFIELD
                         Either way we're fucked. Run or don't 
                         run.

                                     INMAN
                         Just give me some warning so I can 
                         tell the guard -- I'm not getting 
                         shot again for some cause I don't 
                         believe in.

               A GROUP OF SLAVES ARE WALKING BY, CARRYING SACKS. One of the 
               women is pregnant. Veasey studies the group, sees the pregnant 
               woman, recognizes her.

                                     VEASEY
                              (mesmerized)
                         That's Rebecca. That's Rebecca.
                              (he hisses)
                         Rebecca!

               In daylight it's apparent that Rebecca is a real beauty. She 
               turns at the sound of her name, stops, is confused. She sees 
               Veasey and approaches, appalled at his condition.

                                     REBECCA
                         Mas?

                                     VEASEY
                         Is it well with you?
                              (Rebecca nods)
                         I've been repenting for what I did. 
                         I've walked the road of atonement.

                                     REBECCA
                         Your curls is all gone.

               THE GUARD KICKS HIM.

                                     GUARD
                         Hey!

                                     VEASEY
                              (holding his head, to 
                              Rebecca)
                         God Bless you.

               Rebecca, reluctant, rejoins the other slaves, walks away 
               with them, but then turns back to look at Veasey. She clearly 
               cares about him. And seeing her has somehow broken his heart.

               He turns away from Inman, towards Sheffield.

                                     VEASEY
                         I'm with you. I got a baby coming.

               EXT. RAILROAD TRACK. DAY

               THE CHAIN GANG TRUDGES DOWN THE TRACK, horses on either side 
               of them, steep banks forming a V for the railroad. A TRAIN 
               IS COMING. Brown rides up to the prisoners, herds them off 
               the track. The train approaches quite slowly -- the boxcars 
               full of wounded soldiers. Some of the Home Guard dismount, 
               take out pipes. The prisoners wait, one of them sits down.

               Sheffield says something to Veasey, who casually yanks up 
               the sitting prisoner. Inman suddenly understands what's going 
               to happen. The train is almost on them.

                                     INMAN
                         No!

               But it's too late. SHEFFIELD JERKS FORWARD IN FRONT OF THE 
               TRAIN, PULLING ALL THE OTHERS WITH HIM, their reluctance 
               tempered by the possibility of being crushed by the oncoming 
               train.

               SOMEHOW THE CHAIN GANG GETS ACROSS THE TRACK, stumbling and 
               chaotic, the chains yanking tight, then loose, the tight 
               causing a collapse, the loose a recovery.

               They run alongside the train, blocking themselves from the 
               fire of the Guard, Sheffield screaming tactics -- and then, 
               as the train starts to pull past them, they run up the bank, 
               now all as a unit scrambling to the steep summit.

               ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRAIN THE HOME GUARD HAVE REMOUNTED 
               THEIR HORSES AND ARE RIDING HARD ALONGSIDE IT. Then they 
               have sight of the escaping prisoners silhouetted at the top 
               of the bank like a line of paper dolls stretched out along 
               the ridge. Sheffield's yelling with adrenaline, Veasey joins 
               in, elated. One of the guards raises a rifle, steadies himself 
               on his horse, FIRES. He catches Veasey, who crumples, spinning 
               round and falling down the bank, until Inman uses all his 
               strength and practically lifts him in the air. The chain 
               recovers and works back up the bank.

               But then A SECOND BULLET catches another prisoner and this 
               time the effect is catastrophic -- THE WHOLE GANG JUST FLIPS 
               OVER AND PLUMMETS DOWN THE BANK. The Home Guard approach, 
               firing randomly at the bodies as they tumble into the ditch 
               by the side of the track. Until all movement ceases. Inman 
               has a wound to his head which bleeds profusely, almost 
               completely covering his face. Brown arrives, considers the 
               carnage.

                                     BROWN
                         Get these sacks of shit under the 
                         ground.

               INT. BARN, BLACK COVE FARM. DAWN

               Ada's milking. It's barely daylight. She's slowly becoming a 
               country girl. Ruby appears in the doorway.

                                     RUBY
                         Someone's been in the corncrib.

                                     ADA
                         You sure?

                                     RUBY
                         It's a coon or possum. Scratched out 
                         a fist hole in the side. This place! 
                         I'm telling you -- we grow, others 
                         eat. I'll go into town, take the 
                         last of the cider and trade for a 
                         trap.

               INT. MONROE'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ada is in Monroe's bedroom, looks out as Ruby goes off to 
               town, jugs of cider swung either side of the horse. Ada goes 
               over to Monroe's closet, pulls out some clothes.

               EXT. THE WINTER GARDEN, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ada buttons Monroe's dress coat and completes the SCARECROW 
               she's spent the day making, save for the hat, which she now 
               fixes on, pushing in a hat pin to secure it. She's made a 
               stern black thing and steps back to consider it.

               Horsemen come riding along the lane. It's Teague and his 
               men.

               He doesn't stop but raises his hat to Ada.

               INT. KITCHEN, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ada looks out at the Winter Garden. From that distance it 
               really does look like her father out in the field, arms 
               outstretched as if waiting for her to run to him. She finds 
               it unbearable, her tears coming, runs out into the fields, 
               attacks the scarecrow, pulling off the hat, the clothes...

               EXT. RAILROAD TRACK. MORNING

               THE SOUND OF TINY BELLS. A misty drizzle. A GOAT snuffles 
               around in the freshly turned dirt: A hand, pale and wet, 
               protrudes from the thin layer of earth covering the bodies 
               of the murdered Chain Gang.

               SOMETHING SHIFTS UNDER THE DIRT, breaking the surface. Inman 
               wedged under three or four corpses -- their limbs and chains 
               wrapped around him, has regained consciousness. He coughs, 
               can't breathe properly, tries to work himself some air, 
               spitting out dirt. He makes a noise to distract the goat, 
               rattling the chains. Inman rears up, the bodies slithering 
               off him, but even then the animal only retreats a yard or 
               two. VEASEY SLIDES FACE UP, A BULLET IN HIS FOREHEAD LIKE A 
               MYSTICAL THIRD EYE. Inman feels a surprising loss and 
               tenderness. He heaves again, groaning with the pain of new 
               and old wounds.

               EXT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               Ruby rides back from town along the river. An ugly looking 
               trap tied over the horses and three or four bulging sacks. 
               By an abandoned mill she sees the Home Guard under the trees.

               She slows up.

                                     TEAGUE
                         What you looking to catch?

                                     RUBY
                         What?

                                     TEAGUE
                         With that trap.

                                     RUBY
                         We got some critter stealing our 
                         corn.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Still but the two of you up there, 
                         is it?

                                     RUBY
                         You know it.

                                     TEAGUE
                         When we get a cold night, camped 
                         out, trying to keep the rule of law, 
                         protecting girls like you from 
                         Federals and deserters, that's a 
                         thought warms us
                              (to his men)
                         ain't it? -- the two of you up there 
                         on my Grand-daddy's farm, dressed in 
                         men's clothes. Warms us right up. 
                         What you got in the sacks?
                              (to the men)
                         Looks like human heads! Eh? Looks 
                         like a bunch of heads. We got 
                         competition!

               Ruby rides on. She rides around the bend -- she's not far 
               from the Swanger farm.

               EXT. RAILROAD TRACK. DAY

               Goats, their bells tinkling, munch around the tracks. One of 
               them turns at a noise -- a GROTESQUE VISION -- A MOVING, 
               SEETHING MOUND OF DIRT. It's Inman, inching along the 
               embankment, the chain of dead bodies in tow, a macabre tug 
               of war. He considers the goats, they consider him. He rears 
               up and finds himself STARING DOWN THE BARREL OF A SHOTGUN.

               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

               Sally is pinning out white sheets, they're filling out like 
               sails in the afternoon wind. Ruby rides up. Sally seems a 
               little vexed to see her. She walks down to the gate.

                                     SALLY
                         Ruby...

                                     RUBY
                         I'm not stopping, Sally. I'm not 
                         snooping neither. Just you should 
                         know Teague and his boys are lurking 
                         down by Pigeon River, the old mill.

                                     SALLY
                              (after a beat)
                         You tell Ada that was a good pie.

               Ruby rides off. Sally watches, then goes inside the house, 
               her energy changing immediately, as if she might faint.

               EXT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. AFTERNOON

               HARSH WHISTLES. A secret place, in the heart of a forest. 
               There's the answering sound of SMALL BELLS, a chorus of them. 
               Inman is dragged into view on a makeshift litter. Goats 
               appear, they herd around the figure dragging the litter. 
               IT'S AN OLD WOMAN, silver haired, her face a leather map, 
               her clothes leather, everything about her like old leather. 
               HER NAME IS MADDY.

               She and Inman round a bend and there's Maddy's house -- AN 
               OLD CARAVAN, long grown into the ground and plaited with 
               vines and creepers. Inman tries to sit up. An old whiskered 
               BILLYGOAT butts up against Inman, knocks him down. Maddy 
               pays no attention to the struggle, heads inside her caravan.

                                     MADDY
                         Mind that Billy, he's the jealous 
                         kind.

               She emerges, with a bowl of water, rags, washes his face, 
               pushing back his hair to look at his wound, puts a finger to 
               the gash on his neck professional in her appraisal. Inman is 
               barely conscious, he groans, trying to defend himself.

                                     MADDY
                         Pay no attention to me. What happened 
                         to your head?

                                     INMAN
                         Fighting.

                                     MADDY
                         And your neck?

                                     INMAN
                         Different fighting.

                                     MADDY
                         You're the color of a cadaver. I'll 
                         fix you. I can fix you up.

                                     INMAN
                              (speaking of his spirit)
                         Mister -- you could fix me I'd be in 
                         your everlasting debt.

                                     MADDY
                         Debts, fighting -- them words don't 
                         mean much round here. For the record, 
                         I'm a female of the species.

               EXT. BOTTOM FIELD, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ruby rides up to the farm. She rides past the winter garden, 
               admires THE SCARECROW -- WHICH NOW PARODIES ADA, the same 
               outfit she once wore to visit Inman, the same dress, same 
               hat. Ruby grins as Ada comes over from the field.

                                     RUBY
                         The hat's a nice touch.

               Ruby gets off the horse, and they start unloading sacks.

                                     RUBY
                         You're quiet.

                                     ADA
                         I cried for my Daddy. I dressed up 
                         the scarecrow in his suit and he 
                         came back, his arms out, said you 
                         never cried enough, you never cried 
                         enough.

                                     RUBY
                         Well now you did.

                                     ADA
                         Then I thought, it's not my Daddy, 
                         it's my sweetheart. I saw him once 
                         that way, when I looked down Sally's 
                         well. So I dressed the scarecrow in 
                         the dress I wore the day he left. In 
                         case his spirit flies over looking 
                         out for me.
                              (of the vicious looking 
                              trap)
                         That looks terrible.

               Ruby opens the sacks.

                                     ADA
                         Cabbages.

                                     RUBY
                         I bargained like Lucifer. We can 
                         make all kinds of good eating.

                                     ADA
                         Such as?

                                     RUBY
                         Cabbage. Slaw, sauerkraut, cabbage 
                         soup, fried cabbage, stuffed 
                         cabbage...

               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

               TEAGUE'S MEN RIDE UP TO THE FARM. Esco's out in the field, 
               labouring away, but with his shotgun by him. Teague stops 
               alongside the field, the rail between him and Esco. Esco 
               stops working, picks up his shotgun and goes over. Teague 
               has four men with him. MO and JO, the twins, huge, and with 
               the appearance of having less than one brain between the two 
               of them, GRAYLING, a reluctant-looking man, funereal in his 
               bearing, and BOSIE.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Afternoon.

               The riders slowly fan out, almost as if choreographed.

                                     ESCO
                         Don't spread out. Why they spreading 
                         out?

                                     TEAGUE
                         I'm not spreading out. I'm sitting 
                         here.

               Esco comes over the rail fence, his gun loose in his hands.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Never knew a man worked in his field 
                         with a shotgun.

                                     ESCO
                         There's a war on.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Got to watch out for the Bogey Man.

               He starts to fish out a tobacco pouch. Esco's gun swings up.

               Teague shows him the leather pouch, shrugs, starts to make a 
               cigarette.

               INT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

               From inside the house, Sally watches everything. Her view 
               impaired by the sheets.

               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

               Mo dismounts. Ambles past Esco, looks behind the sheets. 
               ESCO KICKS OUT AT HIM, the shotgun rigid and pointing.

                                     ESCO
                         Get off my land.

               Mo examines his breeches for a dust mark, wipes it off, 
               retreating in a turkey walk of examining and dusting.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Your boys come back.

                                     ESCO
                         Ain't seen my boys in four years. 
                         They're fighting other boys, not old 
                         men and women.

                                     TEAGUE
                              (to his men)
                         He means us. He's referring there to 
                         us.
                              (to Esco)
                         So you won't care if we take a look 
                         around?

                                     ESCO
                         What I gotta give you? A chicken? A 
                         lamb?

                                     TEAGUE
                              (shrugs)
                         Sure.

                                     ESCO
                         Right then.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Thing is -- you got one barrel and 
                         there's five of us. Not a fair fight.

               BOSIE SUDDENLY DROPS OFF HIS HORSE, ROLLS ON THE GROUND.

                                     BOSIE
                         Bogey Man! Bogey Man!

               Esco is momentarily distracted and, in that instant, Mo kicks 
               out at him, knocking the gun from his hands, which fires 
               into the air, a shocking sound.

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ruby and Ada digging a trench by the smokehouse, laying in 
               the pale heads of cabbage. They hear the distant shot.

                                     RUBY
                         What's that?

               They stop. Listen. Look at each other, start running.

               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

               Jo sets on Esco, knocking him-backwards into a sheet, where 
               it gets twisted, while Jo kicks and punches, little spots of 
               blood staining the sheet with each blow. MO PULLS OUT HIS 
               SABRE AND RUNS ESCO THROUGH, LEAVES THE SABRE IN DEEP, PINNING 
               ESCO TO THE SHEET, THEN SPINNING HIM ROUND IN THE SHEET SO 
               THAT IT TIGHTENS. A stain grows out from the blade, huge and 
               spreading. Teague walks to Esco.

                                     TEAGUE
                         You're harbouring deserters. I can 
                         confiscate every animal on this farm, 
                         every plate, every sheet, every little 
                         pellet of chicken shit -- I can 
                         confiscate your old lady's asshole, 
                         so don't offer me a bird.

               Sally runs out, screaming. She tries to pull out the sabre.

               MO REVERSES HIS RIFLE AND CLUBS HER TO THE GROUND.

                                     TEAGUE
                              (sharply)
                         Hey!

               Mo backs away. Sally is screaming. She watches, helpless, as 
               Esco dies in front of her, the sheet growing a darker red.

                                     TEAGUE
                         You got your bait. Set it on the 
                         hook.

               BOSIE, SMILING, FETCHES A ROPE FROM HIS HORSE, ALREADY NOOSED 
               AT ONE END. HE FLIPS THE LOOP OVER SALLY'S HEAD.

               INT. BARN, SWANGER FARM. DAY

               ELLIS AND ACTON SWANGER emerge from their hiding places, 
               unable to bear the sound of their mother's screams. They're 
               carrying an axe, a pitchfork, mad for revenge.

               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

               BOSIE IS DOING SOME SORT OF DANCE ALONG THE FENCE RAIL. He's 
               very graceful, his hair flying, his hands out, one finger 
               nail extremely long, his boots stamping down on the fence.

               UNDER HIS STOMPING FEET, THE RAIL POST IS PRESSED ON SALLY 
               SWANGER'S THUMBS. She can't scream any longer, because the 
               noose has practically strangled her. The rope's tied off to 
               Bosie's horse, which yanks on the noose with every slight 
               movement. Sally is prostrate in the dirt.

               Her two boys come running from the barn. TEAGUE CASUALLY, 
               SHOOTS ELLIS WITH HIS RIFLE. BOSIE LETS ACTON GET ALL THE 
               WAY TOWARDS HIM AND THEN SHOOTS HIM FROM A YARD AWAY, THE 
               GUN SUDDENLY SPRINGING INTO HIS HAND. AS ACTON FALLS, BOSIE 
               DOES A FLIP TO DIVE OFF THE POST AND LAND ON HIS FEET NEXT 
               TO ACTON'S BODY.

               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DUSK

               Ada and Ruby, riding together on the horse, arrive at the 
               Swangers.

               SALLY IS STILL PINNED UNDER THE FENCE POST. The noose around 
               her neck has been tied off to the post so that she can't 
               move. There's a bloody sheet draped over the edge of the 
               well. Blood on the ground. Ruby heaves at the fence.

                                     RUBY
                         I can't get this damn thing off her.

                                     ADA
                              (at the well, looking 
                              down)
                         Dear Lord in heaven.

                                     RUBY
                         Ada, I can't get this off her!

               Ada runs over. They struggle, can't lift it. Sally's lips 
               are moving.

                                     RUBY
                         What darling? What?

               She bends down, listens to her. Looks up at Ada.

                                     RUBY
                         She's saying don't bother.

                                     ADA
                         Wait!

               She grabs a thick log off the stack, staggers back and in a 
               second they've inserted it into the fence and levered it up 
               and away from Sally's hands. They fall back onto the dirt.

               Ruby cradles Sally. Ada nods towards the well.

                                     ADA
                         There's someone down there. I think 
                         it's Esco.

               Ruby looks over at the well, then at Ada.

                                     RUBY
                         This world won't stand long. God 
                         won't let it stand this way long.

               INT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. DAY

               An exotic interior, many crocks and jars, bunches of herbs, 
               wrapped papers of dried things, like a woodland apothecary 
               store. Inman wakes up. He finds himself in a small cot, 
               wrapped in blankets, a poultice at his neck. He doesn't know 
               where he is or how long he's been there.

               EXT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. DAY

               Maddy's sitting on a stool. There's a circle of stones where 
               her fire lives and she sets the tinder to it. Inman emerges 
               from the caravan. He's pale and unsteady.

                                     INMAN
                         How long have I been sleeping?

                                     MADDY
                         Not long enough.

                                     INMAN
                         I can't stop here. I'm a deserter. 
                         They find me here things could be 
                         bad for you.

                                     MADDY
                         What they going to do? Cut short my 
                         young life? Sit down before you fall 
                         down.

               She calls over a little goat. It ambles over affectionately 
               and nuzzles into her hand. She strokes it and scratches under 
               the chin. The creature gets increasingly tranquil.

                                     INMAN
                         How long you been up here?

                                     MADDY
                         What year are we? '63?

                                     INMAN
                         Last time I checked it was '64.

                                     MADDY
                         I'd say twenty six years.

                                     INMAN
                         Twenty six years!

                                     MADDY
                         I could move on anytime. I've seen 
                         most of the world anyway, Richmond 
                         in the North, south almost to 
                         Charleston. You're going somewhere 
                         or you are somewhere, what's the 
                         difference?

               She's still stroking the goat. It looks as if it's asleep.

                                     MADDY
                         I've learned a person can survive 
                         off pretty much of a goat. I can't 
                         abide a chicken, but a goat gives 
                         you company and milk and cheese and 
                         then, when you need it, good meat.

               In a single motion she has a knife in her hand and has SLIT 
               THE THROAT OF THE GOAT, putting the bowl underneath its neck 
               to catch the blood, still stroking the goat, which blinks as 
               if it were only surprised and not dying.

                                     MADDY
                         So you've been fighting?

                                     INMAN
                              (as if he might break)
                         I could be at killing for days 
                         sometimes, in the hand to hand, my 
                         feet against the feet of my enemy 
                         and I always killed him and he never 
                         killed me.

                                     MADDY
                         He gave it a try, to look at you.

                                     INMAN
                         I guess he did.

                                     MADDY
                         See I think there's a plan. There's 
                         a design. For each and every one of 
                         us.

               During this she's shucked the skin off the goat with the 
               authority of someone who's done this a thousand times.

                                     MADDY
                         You look at nature, a bird flies 
                         somewhere, picks up a seed, shits 
                         the seed out, a plant grows. Bird's 
                         got a job, seed's got a job.

               And the goat is now thin and pink, eyes bulging, a piece of 
               meat.

               INT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. EVENING

               A woodburning stove with a single cooking plate -- on which 
               pieces of the goat meat, sprinkled with herbs, are sizzling 
               in a pan.

               INMAN IS EATING LIKE A MAN POSSESSED, WRAPPING THE MEAT IN 
               CORN FRITTERS AND PUSHING THEM INTO HIS MOUTH. Maddy watches 
               him, adds another mound of meat to his plate. Inman nods in 
               thanks, but -- doesn't look up.

               She opens a jar and takes out a handful of dried poppy heads, 
               puts them near the stove, then dips into another jar and 
               pulls out what look like old cheroot stubs.

                                     MADDY
                         Take one of these now with your food.

               Inman is circumspect, views the stub lozenge with suspicion.

                                     MADDY
                         Swallow it. If you die I'll give you 
                         your money back.

               Inman puts it in his mouth, gags at the taste of it. She 
               hands him a beaker with milk to wash it down.

                                     MADDY
                         Our minds aren't made to hold on to 
                         the particulars of pain, the way we 
                         do bliss.

               She starts steaming the poppies.

                                     INMAN
                         It's true...

                                     MADDY
                         What is?

                                     INMAN
                         What you remember.

                                     MADDY
                         What's her name?

                                     INMAN
                         Ada.
                              (At the food)
                         -- Sometimes I think I'm crazy when 
                         I'm just hungry --
                              (another mouthful)
                         Ada Monroe.

                                     MADDY
                         And is she waiting for you?

                                     INMAN
                         She was. I don't know. Or if she'd 
                         know me. I'm like the boy who goes 
                         out in winter for firewood comes 
                         back in the spring with a whistle.

               Maddy pricks open the poppies and collects their opium, then 
               hands Inman the liquid.

                                     MADDY
                         Now drink this. It visits the pain. 
                         And you'll sleep.

               He drinks the laudanum she's made.

                                     INMAN
                         I've had to put myself in the way of 
                         people's kindness.

                                     MADDY
                         I hope you found it.

               She dips a cloth in the steaming water, unbuttons his shirt. 
               She has a crock of what looks like treacle and vaseline. She 
               smears this salve over the neck wound and into his scalp. 
               Inman surrenders to the drug.

                                     INMAN
                         The passenger pigeons fly south, the 
                         berries ripen. Whether I see them or 
                         not, whether a man dies, or a war is 
                         won.

                                     MADDY
                         That's the laudanum getting to you. 
                         That's good. Say something more.
                              (she kneels to his 
                              leg)
                         Raise that up for me.

               He obliges. She grimaces at the state of it, where the chain 
               has chewed into the flesh. Gets to work.

                                     INMAN
                         She gave me a book. Ada Monroe. Man 
                         by the name of Bartram. Wrote about 
                         his travels. I carried that book 
                         through every battle. I left it 
                         someplace, got to get it back. 
                         Sometimes just reading the name of a 
                         place near home -- Sorell Cove, Fire 
                         Scale Ridge -- was enough to bring 
                         me to tears. Thing is I've been 
                         thinking -- those places belonged to 
                         people before us, to the Indian -- 
                         and he had a different name. What 
                         did he call Sorell Cove? How can a 
                         name not even the real name break 
                         your heart? It's her, she's the place 
                         I'm heading. And I hardly know her. 
                         So how can a person who's maybe not 
                         even a real person -- I don't know 
                         what I'm talking about -- I have to 
                         close my eyes...

               He slides off the stool and lays on the floor. Maddy goes 
               over to her cot and pulls off a blanket which she drapes 
               over him.

               EXT. YARD, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ada in the henhouse, collecting eggs, is confident now among 
               the birds. She emerges to find Ruby walking out of the 
               backdoor with the shotgun and a determined look.

                                     RUBY
                         It's a man.

                                     ADA
                         What is?

                                     RUBY
                         Raiding our corn. Got him in the 
                         trap. That's him yelping.

                                     ADA
                         You're not going to shoot him!

                                     RUBY
                         I don't want him to shoot me.
                              (of the gun)
                         Can you fire this thing?

                                     ADA
                              (making it clear she 
                              can't)
                         Yes.

               They head towards the corn crib, bundled up against the cold.

               A MAN IS KNEELING AT THE CORN CRIB, perfectly caught in the 
               art of stealing, his head forced away from view. Ruby hands 
               Ada the gun and approaches, warily.

                                     RUBY
                         Listen up -- you got a barrel trained 
                         on your rear-end.

                                     STOBROD
                         Get me out of this dang thing. My 
                         fist's about to drop off.

                                     RUBY
                         You got a weapon?

                                     STOBROD
                         No ma'am. I'm begging you. I'm already 
                         on my knees, otherwise I'd get down 
                         on them.

                                     RUBY
                              (suddenly recognises 
                              the voice)
                         Unbelievable! Stobrod Thewes.

                                     STOBROD
                         Ruby? God damn!

                                     ADA
                         What?

                                     RUBY
                              (to Ada, disgusted)
                         That's my daddy...

               She walks up to him and KICKS HIM HARD AS SHE CAN ON HIS 
               BACKSIDE.

               INT. KITCHEN, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               A strip of fabric, homemade bandage, being wrapped around 
               Stobrod's badly gashed hand. Ada is tending to him. Ruby is 
               cooking at the range, not remotely warm towards her prodigal 
               father, who looks rather comfortable. Stobrod looks at her.

                                     STOBROD
                         Just so's you know -- I can eat while 
                         she's doing this -- in case you're 
                         holding off.

                                     RUBY
                         Just so's you know -- you're not 
                         eating inside. Number One -- they 
                         hang people round here for taking in 
                         deserters. Number two -- even if 
                         they gave out prizes -- you'd still 
                         eat outside.

                                     STOBROD
                         You're scarred.

                                     RUBY
                         I'm what?

                                     STOBROD
                         Your heart. Scarred. I did wrong to 
                         you.

                                     RUBY
                         You'd be scarred. You'd be really 
                         scarred if I hadn't wrapped them 
                         trap teeth in sacking. Which was her 
                         idea.

                                     STOBROD
                         I hurt you.

                                     RUBY
                         Good God!

                                     STOBROD
                         I wrote fifty tunes with you in mind. 
                         Ruby this, Ruby that, Ruby with the 
                         eyes that sparkle.

                                     RUBY
                         Hey! Let's agree: you beat me, you 
                         abandoned me, you ignored me, you 
                         beat me some more -- all of that is 
                         better than Ruby with the eyes that 
                         sparkle!

                                     STOBROD
                         I'm changed. People change. War 
                         changes people something terrible.
                              (to Ada)
                         Ruby's told you -- I've no doubt -- 
                         I wasn't always the best...

                                     RUBY
                         You were an asshole.

                                     STOBROD
                         I can't disagree with that. I was.

                                     RUBY
                         Get him out of here!

                                     STOBROD
                         Music's changed me. I'm full of music, 
                         darling. I wish I'd brung my fiddle 
                         Hey Ruby! Got a new fiddle -- it's 
                         got a little snake's rattle in the 
                         body -- took it off a dead federal 
                         in Virginia. That's a beautiful 
                         fiddle. It's full of tunes, Ruby. 
                         Don't know if it's from that little 
                         rattle locked up in it, or from 
                         something untied my heart.

               Ruby walks over with a crock, wrapped in a cloth.

                                     RUBY
                         You're all set.

                                     STOBROD
                              (sincerely)
                         Bless you both.

               He goes to the door.

                                     RUBY
                         Ain't you got a proper coat?

                                     STOBROD
                         Darling, I'm fine. And you just say 
                         the word, I won't come back neither. 
                         I don't want to put either you or 
                         your mistress here in any bother.

                                     ADA
                         I'm not Ruby's employer.

                                     STOBROD
                         Oh, okay, who is?

                                     RUBY
                         Nobody.
                              (Stobrod digests this)
                         I'll make up food for you, you come 
                         Sundays before it's light, I'll leave 
                         it behind the Old Frazier Mill.

                                     STOBROD
                         Do you know who really needs a coat, 
                         darling, is my partner, fat boy name 
                         of Pangle. We're hiding up in the 
                         caves and he feels the cold like a 
                         thin man, but ain't no coat'll fit 
                         him.
                              (leaving)
                         I love you, Ruby. In case the sky 
                         falls on our head. You're a good 
                         girl.

               And he's gone. Ruby scowls. FIDDLE MUSIC BEGINS.

                                     RUBY
                         He is so full of manure, that man, 
                         we could lay him on the dirt and 
                         grow another one just like him.

                                     ADA
                         So that's Stobrod Thewes.

                                     RUBY
                         It is and that's the last you'll see 
                         of him.

               EXT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. DUSK

               THE FIDDLE CONTINUES, A BANJO JOINS IN.

               Maddy is loading up Inman for his journey. She hands him a 
               bulging goatskin satchel.

                                     MADDY
                         That's medicine and goatmeat. You're 
                         sick of both.

                                     INMAN
                         I have a deal to thank you for.

               She hands him an ancient flintlock pistol.

                                     MADDY
                         And that's just for show, or -- if 
                         you can get close enough -- a wild 
                         turkey.

               She turns, abruptly, mingles in with her goats. Inman nods, 
               knows that she doesn't want a fuss, although he wants to 
               make one, and turns himself, heads away from the caravan.

               EXT. WOODS. DAY

               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. A TURKEY calls. And again.

               JUNIOR is hunting. He creeps through this clearing, eyes 
               peeled for the turkey, gun at the ready. His dog growls, and 
               he puts a hand over its mouth. He listens. Another call.

               Junior moves, without sound, in its direction, stops for 
               several seconds under a tree, listening. He looks up. INMAN 
               IS PERCHED IN THE TREE. THE PISTOL FLASHES IN HIS HAND.

               EXT. JUNIOR'S CABIN. DAY

               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Inman drags Junior's corpse in to the 
               yard. The dogs whine and slobber over the body. Inman goes 
               straight into the Smoke House.

               INT. SMOKE HOUSE AT JUNIOR'S CABIN. DAY

               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Inman reaches behind the stove and 
               retrieves his bag. He checks for the LeMats, for the Bartram, 
               opens it, locating the tintype of Ada, which he considers, 
               as the dogs howl outside, joined with another wailing.

               EXT. JUNIOR'S CABIN. DAY

               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Inman emerges with his bag, LeMats at 
               the ready. The women are all keening over the corpse, as it 
               a saint had passed away. Dogs, women all howling. A chicken 
               bobs in, investigates the glob of blood on Junior's skull.

               Inman walks away, doesn't look at the women, who don't look 
               at him.

               INT. RUBY'S ROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. DAWN

               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Ruby wakes up. Looks out of the window.

               Ada, also woken, comes into Ruby's room. STOBROD IS OUTSIDE 
               WITH PANGLE, VIOLIN AND BANJO. Ruby opens the window, 
               scowling. Stobrod beams, stops playing, holds up the food, 
               points at Pangle in his new coat. Pangle waves.

                                     RUBY
                         Get on back where you came from!

               Stobrod and Pangle smile and hurry away.

               EXT. PATH IN HILL COUNTRY. DAY

               WINTER SETTING IN. Inman, increasingly a stick figure in the 
               landscape, wasted and fragile, trudges along through fallen 
               leaves. He still limps from the leg irons. No shelter 
               anywhere. He unwraps a paper containing some scraps of goat 
               meat and corn bread. He walks and eats, fishes out a lozenge, 
               tries to swallow it, washes it down with a drink from his 
               flask. Opens the crock of salve and rubs the treacly grease 
               into his neck and ankle. The path splits. He doesn't know 
               which way to go, A CROW repeatedly caws off to the left and, 
               taking it as a sign, Inman goes in that direction.

                         My love for Heathcliff resembles the

               INT. ADA'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               Ada in the bed, reading to Ruby from Wuthering Heights.

                                     ADA
                         -- a source of little visible delight, 
                         But necessary.

                                     RUBY
                         She ain't gonna marry Linton, is 
                         she? She said -- whatever our souls 
                         are made of his and mine are the 
                         same. You can't say that and then 
                         marry Linton.

                                     ADA
                         We'll find out.

                                     RUBY
                         Okay.

                                     ADA
                         Tomorrow.

                                     RUBY
                         I'm not waiting until tomorrow.

                                     ADA
                         Ruby, I'm falling asleep.

               She lies back in her bed. Ruby takes the book, lies across 
               the bottom of the bed, as Ada goes to sleep.

                                     RUBY
                         Little visible delight, but necessary. 
                         I like that...

               EXT. SMALL WOOD. NIGHT

               DRIVING RAIN. Inman shelters under a huge tree, whose split 
               trunk provides a mean shelter. He inserts himself into the 
               cleft of it, a black thing in a black tree, like a troll. He 
               stands, shivers, sodden, desolate.

               EXT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT

               A LITTLE CABIN. Its lights coming through square windows 
               like a chinese lantern. Inman considers it, the risk versus 
               the shelter.

               The sleet still pelts down on him and he decides to approach.

               Closer he can hear a sound coming from the house. IT'S A 
               BABY'S INCESSANT CRY. HE SEES A YOUNG WOMAN WALKING ROUND 
               AND ROUND IN THE ROOM, CLUTCHING THE BABY WRAPPED UP IN A 
               QUILT.

               Inman knocks hard on the door. The light from the lamp goes 
               out, although the fire still gives the room a clear glow.

                                     INMAN
                         I'm one man alone. I'm a Confederate 
                         soldier on furlough. I have no bad 
                         intention. I need shelter and food.

               THE TINY SOUND OF THE DOOR BEING BOLTED.

                                     INMAN
                         Can I at least sleep in the corn 
                         crib -- just for some shelter? I'll 
                         be on my way come morning.

               No answer. Inman accepts this as a rebuttal, and trudges 
               back towards the road.

                                     SARA (V.O.)
                         I've got a rifle.

               Inman turns. A gap in the door appears, the figure barely 
               seen.

                                     INMAN
                         Fair enough.

               The baby's crying behind her.

                                     SARA
                         There's some beans and corn pone, 
                         all I got. You better come in.

               INT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT

               Inman enters the cabin. It's a single room. A big fire. The 
               baby on the bed, a rudimentary crib unoccupied next to it. 
               The woman is already at the little stove. She turns to him. 
               She's painfully beautiful. But sad and fragile. Inman, despite 
               himself, is mesmerized.

                                     INMAN
                         Thank you.

                                     SARA
                         I'm alone here, as you can see, with 
                         my baby. I need to believe you mean 
                         no harm.

               Inman takes out his gun. She starts, terrified.

                                     INMAN
                         No, I mean to give it to you.

               He turns it handle forwards and offers it to her.

                                     SARA
                         I don't want it. I had my way they'd 
                         take metal altogether out of this 
                         world. Every blade, every gun.

                                     INMAN
                         Is your baby sick?

                                     SARA
                         He cries. I don't know. He cries a 
                         lot. My man is dead. He took his 
                         wound at Fredericksburg. Never saw 
                         his boy.

               She never once looks at him. Her eyes on the floor or the 
               food or the baby.

                                     INMAN
                         I'm sorry.

                                     SARA
                         It's pretty much what you'll get if 
                         you knock on any door of this war. 
                         Man dead, woman left.

               She hands him a plate of steaming beans. An onion perched on 
               top.

                                     SARA
                         It's mean food but it's hot.

               She goes over to the bed and picks up her baby and starts 
               the same business of walking him, singing the while, an odd 
               lament. Inman eats, looks at her, at the child and the fire.

               He picks up the onion, bites into it. Sara looks across.

                                     INMAN
                              (ashamed of his hunger)
                         There's no hunting on the road, just 
                         cress and --

               He takes another bite. Sara picks up the baby.

                                     SARA
                         I need to feed this man, if you could 
                         look away.

               Inman, embarrassed, turns his back to her. He sits finishing 
               the food while she puts the baby to her breast, slipping the 
               shoulder from her dress. While the baby feeds.

                                     SARA
                         Used to have a cow, few goats. Raiders 
                         took them. Made me kill our own dog 
                         on the porch. That poor creature 
                         watched over me. Nothing left now 
                         save a hog and couple of chickens to 
                         live off till spring. I'll have to 
                         kill that hog and make sense of the 
                         flesh and divisions which is something 
                         I never did.

                                     INMAN
                         I could do that for you in the 
                         morning.

                                     SARA
                         I'm not asking.

                                     INMAN
                         It's what I'd gladly do for you for 
                         what you're gladly doing for me. I'm 
                         Inman by the way. That's my name.

                                     SARA
                         I'm Sara. My baby's Ethan.

                                     INMAN
                         Glad to know you both.

               EXT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT

               Sara walks ahead of Inman. She carries a pile of clothing, a 
               pair of boots. It's still wretched outside, she hugs the 
               house, the porch barely offering shelter. INMAN FOLLOWS, 
               with a bowl of steaming water and a small towel over his 
               arm. She hands him the clothes.

                                     SARA
                         You look about his size. He was 
                         another man straight up and down.

               There's a palpable attraction between them, so that every 
               exchange seems to contain a promise, a sexual charge.

                                     SARA
                         I don't even have a blanket.

                                     INMAN
                         I got a blanket.

                                     SARA
                         I'll leave you the lamp.

               By the dim light, Inman peels off his clothes, sets to work 
               with the bar of soap and the cloth to scrub himself clean. 
               He can be seen from the window and finds himself turning 
               away to pull off his pants.

               INT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT

               Sara sits at the cot, still singing to the baby, then gets 
               up, goes to the window, sees Inman dressing, walks to the 
               door, lets it open a little, but not so as she can be seen.

                                     SARA
                         They fit?

                                     INMAN (O.S.)
                         Pretty much. These boots are good 
                         boots.

                                     SARA
                         I'll say good night.

                                     INMAN (O.S.)
                         Good night.

               EXT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT

               Inman settles down into the corncrib. He's cold and everything 
               is damp and lumpy and uncomfortable. He pulls his thin blanket 
               around him. The wind is howling. He levers himself up, looks 
               at the house with its warm invitation, can almost feel Sara 
               in there. He reluctantly settles down again.

               HE HEARS A NOISE, STEPS APPROACHING. HE REACHES FOR THE LEMATS 
               UNDER THE BLANKETS.

                                     SARA
                         Will you come inside?

               She stands in a shift, a blanket over her shoulders. Her 
               body under the cotton very clear to him. She turns and goes 
               back inside.

               INT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT

               Inman comes in. Sara is sitting on her bed. Long silence.

                                     SARA
                         Could you do something for me? Do 
                         you think you could lie here, next 
                         to me, and not need to go further?

                                     INMAN
                         I don't know. I'll try.

               He sits on the bed as she slips under the covers, and then 
               removes the boots, his shirt, gets under the covers. There's 
               an electric space between them. Then Sara begins to cry, 
               pulls his arm to open up so that she can be folded into him.

               SHE SOBS, SHUDDERING IN THE BED.

                                     INMAN
                         I'll go. I'll go, shall I?

                                     SARA
                         I don't want you to.

               They lie, staring up at the ceiling, her tears falling. A 
               FIDDLE PLAYS HEAVY WITH YEARNING...

               INT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN. CHRISTMAS DAY. NIGHT

               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Stobrod is playing the fiddle, his bowing 
               hand still lightly taped and a fingerless mitten covering 
               it. They're in the abandoned Mill, a derelict space, which 
               has been cheered up with some rudimentary Christmas 
               decorations. Ada, Ruby and Sally Swanger, her hair now almost 
               completely white. Some token presents. Pangle is picking at 
               a banjo, his grin infectious, and a third player, GEORGIA, 
               with a harmonica. As they play:

                                     PANGLE
                              (of Sally)
                         She don't speak.

                                     STOBROD
                         She can't speak. I told you.

                                     PANGLE
                              (smiles at Sally)
                         Is she feeble then?

                                     STOBROD
                         No.
                              (to Sally)
                         Don't mind him.
                              (to Ruby)
                         Hey Ruby: what about this?

               He starts the tune of Wayfaring Stranger. Ruby groans.

                                     STOBROD
                         Don't make that face -- you listen: 
                         c'mon Georgia...

               And he starts up again, but this time GEORGIA BEGINS TO SING.

               He's like a pale angel and sings with a soft, true voice.

               Ruby finds herself taken by this boy's voice and by Stobrod's 
               extraordinary invention as he takes the tune off on a wild 
               journey. Ruby sits next to Ada, fiddles with her bracelets, 
               slips one from Ada's wrist and slides it over her own.

               Ada at the window as, outside, SNOW FLAKES BEGIN TO FALL.

               Stobrod opens the door of the Mill. The SNOW FLAKES dissuade 
               him from venturing further. He goes back inside.

               THE DOOR SHUTS, FIDDLE MUSIC LEAKS THROUGH THE DOOR, FOLLOWED 
               BY BANJO AND HARMONICA.

               INT. SARA'S CABIN. EARLY

               Sara, dressed, agitated -- the baby already complaining -- 
               is urgently shaking Inman. Hissing at him:

                                     SARA
                         Get out of here, quick!

               Inman surfaces from deep sleep.

                                     SARA
                         Federals are coming. They find you 
                         here it'll go bad on all of us.

               Inman is up, grabbing clothes, boots, his gun.

                                     INMAN
                         I can try and fight them.

                                     SARA
                         No, my baby. Please no! Just get.

               She pulls up the window in back of the cabin. Inman throws 
               things out into the freezing morning. He has his pants on, 
               but is otherwise naked. He swings over the window and down 
               onto the frosty ground.

               EXT. SARA'S CABIN. EARLY

               Inman picks up his stuff and, at a crouch, runs for cover to 
               the wood which borders the property. He can hear horses and 
               a commotion at the front of Sara's cabin, but doesn't look 
               round until he's sheltered by the trees.

               FEDERAL SOLDIERS, a raiding party, have dismounted and are 
               already wrangling with Sara. Inman watches, pulling on his 
               shirt, shivering, then his boots.

               Sara is standing in front of the hogpen, as if to protect 
               the animal, but one of the soldiers, PISTOL, barges her to 
               one side, toppling her, and opens the gate, starts herding 
               the hog out into the yard. A second soldier, NYM, emerges 
               from the cabin, carrying Ethan. Sara starts up, struggles 
               with him, is again knocked down.

               INMAN HAS TO WATCH AS THEY DRAG HER OVER TO A FENCE POST AND 
               ROPE HER TO IT THEN SLIP THE BLANKET OFF THE BABY AND LAY IT 
               ON THE GROUND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YARD.

               Then Sara starts to scream.

               Inman is dressed. Boots on. He looks back at the yard. The 
               men sitting, smoking, prepared to wait, their breath coming 
               out in gusts in the freezing air. Flakes of snow fall.

                                     PISTOL
                         We got all day.

                                     SARA
                         My baby's sick! Cover him up! He's 
                         shaking! Have some pity.

               A third Federal, BARDOLPH, chases after the chickens, gathers 
               them up.

                                     SARA
                         I got nothing. I swear.

               Nym gets close to her, putting his rifle to her chest.

                                     NYM
                         That ain't necessarily so.

                                     SARA
                         Yes! Take me inside! Let's all go 
                         inside! Take my baby inside and then 
                         we'll do whatever you want.

               Nym unties her. Pistol has a rope around the hog and now 
               leads it towards the horses.

                                     SARA
                              (screaming)
                         There's nothing! You take that hog 
                         I'm as good as dead. Cover up my 
                         boy!

               She's wailing, an unbearable ululation. NYM SLAPS HER, TWICE, 
               HARD.

               INT. SARA'S CABIN. DAY

               The door is kicked open. Nym pushes Sara inside, kicks the 
               door shut, REVEALING INMAN STANDING BEHIND IT.

               EXT. SARA'S CABIN. DAY

               Bardolph, a chicken in his arms, goes over to the baby.

                                     BARDOLPH
                         This is ready to get a fit going. 
                         It's shuddering. It's gone blue.

                                     PISTOL
                              (to Nym)
                         How long does he want? Hey! Leave 
                         some for the rest of us.

               Pistol heads towards the cabin. As he approaches the door, 
               Bardolph rearranges the blankets to, cover the baby. Pistol 
               opens the door. Nym is on top of Sara. Pistol laughs, enters, 
               and is clubbed down by Inman, who steps out onto the porch, 
               while SARA SHRUGS OFF THE BODY OF NYM, HIS THROAT CUT.

               Bardolph looks up to see Inman walking towards him. Bardolph 
               has left his weapon by the fence.

                                     INMAN
                         Move away from the baby.

               Bardolph obeys, terrified. Sara runs out, collects Ethan, 
               gives a little moan of anguish, runs back inside the cabin.

                                     BARDOLPH
                         Don't shoot.

                                     INMAN
                         Take off your boots.
                              (Bardolph does so)
                         Take off your pants, and your shirt.

                                     BARDOLPH
                         Don't shoot me, please. We're 
                         starving. We haven't eaten.

                                     INMAN
                         You'd better get running before you 
                         catch your death of cold.

                                     BARDOLPH
                              (nods, terrified)
                         Thanks, thank you. I will.

               AND THEN A SHOT RINGS OUT AND HE CRASHES TO THE GROUND, DEAD.

               Behind Inman, Sara stands with a rifle.

               EXT. SARA'S CABIN. LATE DAY

               THERE'S A HUGE FIRE GOING, WITH A CAULDRON HUNG OVER IT. THE 
               HOG HANGS UPSIDE DOWN FROM A TREE, BLOOD DRIPPING INTO A 
               BOWL.

               There's a sense of ritual and order: the chapters of 
               transforming the hog into food.

               Sara is inside the cabin, the door open onto the yard. She 
               holds the baby by the fireplace, swaddled up tight.

               She tries to put him to her breast, but he won't feed. She 
               puts Ethan back in his crib, comes outside.

               Now Inman is butchering the hog, chopping down either side 
               of the spine to make two sides of meat. Now Sara is holding 
               up a sheet of hog fat, as if it were a lace shawl. Now she's 
               rendering the fat into lard. Now Inman's salting the two 
               hams. Now Sara's washing the intestine. She sings all the 
               while -- I dreamed that my bower was full of red swine and 
               my bride bed full of blood -- they don't really converse. 
               Inman continues to work.

               Sara goes back inside to Ethan's crib. Inman glances back, 
               but can hardly bear to, her anxiety so palpable. THE BABY IS 
               DEAD. She looks at it. She takes it up in her arms. Kisses 
               its forehead.

               Makes a strange stifling noise. Inman doesn't look at her.

               She comes out again, shovels some of the food into a plate, 
               serves it up to Inman, gently touching him as she does so. 
               Then serves out food for herself. Inman starts to eat.

                                     SARA
                         Good?

               Inman nods. She collects up the knapsacks, including Inman's, 
               and goes back inside the house with them. Inman squats, 
               eating, glancing back towards the cabin. There's the sudden 
               shocking report of a revolver.

               Inman, knowing what it is, goes slowly towards the house and 
               its two dead bodies. His own face is a rictus, the eyes thin 
               slits. If he gave into his grief it would never cease.

               INT. SARA'S CABIN. DUSK

               From the house, the silhouette of Inman working outside in 
               the day's dying light, snow falling around him. He's digging 
               a grave.

               Inside the house, TWO BUNDLES, the small body wrapped in a 
               blanket, the other wrapped in the bed's patchwork quilt.

               EXT. CABBAGE PATCH, BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK

               Still snowing. Ruby trudges past Ada who is digging out a 
               couple of heads of the buried cabbages.

                                     ADA
                         Do you think he's dead?

                         Who?

                         This snow. Isn't it supposed to fall 
                         with bad news?

                                     RUBY
                         Bad news is girls get working. I'm 
                         going to round up the animals.

                         This'll settle.

               She walks past. Ada stares into the distance where

               EXT. WILD COUNTRY. LAST LIGHT

               -- the snow falls down on Inman. He's hardly visible in its 
               gusting waves. Just a thin black question mark, hunched over 
               the elements, moving slowly forwards...

               EXT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               THE SNOW HAS STOPPED. It's left a carpet on the ground.

               Stobrod, Pangle and Georgia emerge from the Old Mill. THEY 
               MAKE HEAVY FOOTPRINTS as they set off up the hill towards 
               the mountain.

               EXT. PATH IN THE MOUNTAINS. DAY

               Inman comes sliding down a crumbling slate hill and onto the 
               path. He cornea to a place where the path suddenly drops 
               away to reveal a view of the geography. And there, finally, 
               in the distance, Inman can see the blue ridge. Somewhere in 
               there is home, is Ada. He goes on.

               EXT. SLOPES OF COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               Pangle walks too close to Stobrod and steps on the back of 
               his boot which promptly detaches itself from Stobrod's foot.

               Stobrod turns -- and with a raised finger -- pushes Pangle.

               PANGLE FALLS IN THE SNOW, ARMS SPREADEAGLED, AND SMILES.

               EXT. PIGEON RIVER BEHIND THE OLD MILL. DAY

               SOME HORSES CLUSTER around the Stobrod party's footprints.

               Bosie swings acrobatically over his horse, to hang over the 
               tracks, then up again into his saddle, looks at Teague. The 
               Home Guard plod slowly forward in the direction of the tracks.

               EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. EVENING

               A CLEARING, fringed by poplars. Stobrod is making a fire.

               Pangle appears with an armful of firewood, his big grin a 
               fixture. Then Georgia appears. He's carrying A SMALL BUCK, 
               frozen and covered with snow.

                         It's frozen. How long it been there 
                         for?

               Teague examines the snow's imprinted silhouette of Pangle.

               EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

               STOBROD SINGS AND COOKS. PANGLE ACCOMPANIES HIM ON BANJO, 
               Georgia joins in the chorus. Stobrod pulls one of the hickory 
               stick skewers out of the fire, blows on the, meat, smells, 
               smells again, looks at Georgia, takes a bite. Chews.

                         Edible.

               Pangle takes another stick, burns his fingers.

                                     PANGLE

                         It's good. I think it's good.

               EXT. THE KILLING GROUND. COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

               The three men are asleep. The fire still burning. They're 
               lying like petals of a flower around it. Suddenly Georgia 
               sits bolt upright, grimaces, gets up stumbles away from the 
               fire, toward a stand of trees, from which come the vivid 
               sounds of violent nausea.

               Teague rides up to the fire, the other riders with him --

                                     STOBROD
                         Not come to my ears.

                                     TEAGUE
                         You don't know where this cave is?

                                     STOBROD
                         No, sir.

                                     PANGLE
                         You do, Stobes! He means --

                                     STOBROD
                         Right, right! he means, there is a 
                         cave, right, it's up over the other 
                         side, big cave, we played some music 
                         up there, never occurred to me they 
                         were deserters. Near Bearpen Branch.

                                     PANGLE
                         Ain't nowhere near Bearpen Branch! 
                         It's this side! He's always getting 
                         lost. That cave -- we live there! -- 
                         it's over on Big Stomp. Tell you how 
                         I always find it. There's a big old 
                         locust tree fell down across the 
                         path, that points straight at it, 
                         like a finger, always a dozen 
                         squirrels round that tree. You gets 
                         to the tree, sit on it, and there's 
                         your entrance, straight in front of 
                         you, tree points at it. Come right 
                         to your hand, them squirrels --
                              (makes a chirping 
                              sound)
                         -- Chrrrpppp! Chrrrrppp!

                                     TEAGUE
                         Sounds good. Okay, let's eat, let's 
                         hear some music.

               EXT. TREES NEAR KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

               Georgia watches as the music starts, Stobrod playing and 
               singing, Pangle joining in at the chorus. Their improvising 
               is wild, profound, Stobrod chording the fiddle, Pangle 
               following him, then, finishing with another verse and ending 
               with the title declaimed by Stobrod.

                                     STOBROD
                         I call this tune: Ruby's Lament.

               EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

               Something like compassion has flickered over Teague's face. 
               Mo and Jo nod to the music's secret rhythms. Only Bosie seems 
               detached, contemplating his long fingernail. The music 
               finishes. The Home Guard applaud.

                                     PANGLE
                         What'd you make of that?

                                     BOSIE
                         Heartbreaking.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Stand over by that tree.

                                     STOBROD
                         Me?

                                     TEAGUE
                         Over by that tree. Over there. Take 
                         your boyfriend.

               Stobrod gets up, carrying his fiddle, heads over to a big 
               old poplar. Nods at Pangle.

                                     STOBROD
                         Come on.

               Pangle gets up, banjo in his hand. Puts his arm around Stobrod 
               as if they were about to be photographed. The Home Guard 
               gather around them. From the trees Georgia watches, helpless. 
               Pangle grins at Teague.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Don't smile.

                                     PANGLE
                         What?

                                     TEAGUE
                         Quit smiling.

                                     STOBROD
                         He always smiles. He don't mean 
                         nothing by it. I told him this world's 
                         got nothing worth a smile.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Put your hat over your face.

                                     PANGLE
                         What do you mean?

                                     TEAGUE
                         Cover your face with your hat.

               PANGLE TALES OFF HIS HAT, HOLDS IT OVER HIS FACE. THE MOMENT 
               HE OBLIGIES, TEAGUE'S CARBINE SPRINGS UP IN HIS HAND AND 
               BLOWS THE HAT AWAY SEVERAL OTHER SHOTS FOLLOW. STOBROD FALLS 
               UNDER PANGLE, THE BULLETS FLYING.

               EXT. TREES NEAR THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

               Georgia lies prostrate in the snow, shuddering under the 
               report of each bullet.

               EXT. BOTTOM FIELD, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ruby working in the snow, in the field, clipping a sheep's 
               feet, the animal on its back between Ruby's knees. She looks 
               up to see GEORGIA RUNNING ACROSS THE FIELD TOWARDS HER, 
               calling out her name. From the kitchen window, Ada looks on 
               as he reaches Ruby, the story pouring from him. Ada emerges 
               from the house, walks towards the bad news.

               INT. STOREROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ruby sorting out a kit of shovels, blankets. Ada comes in 
               doesn't know how to help her friend, who shows no emotion.

                                     ADA
                         I told Georgia he can stop here, 
                         sleep in the barn. He's got nothing 
                         inside him. He'd walk out of here 
                         and die in the snow.

                                     RUBY
                         He can milk the cows. I was worrying 
                         about that. It'll be dark in a couple 
                         of hours. I's ten hours climb from 
                         here. He's drawn a map.

                                     ADA
                         Okay.

                                     RUBY
                              (boiling)
                         You know these fools stayed the night 
                         in the Mill? That's Stobrod -- he 
                         can't do one good thing without adding 
                         the bad. Left tracks in the snow all 
                         the way up for them Home Guards to 
                         follow. That's a sign says shoot me!

                                     ADA
                         Ruby, I'm so sorry.

               Ada moves towards her, puts her arms around her. Ruby is 
               rigid. Ada stops embracing her.

                                     RUBY
                         We should get going.

               She's tying up the kit. She doesn't know how to grieve.

                                     RUBY
                         Every piece of this is a man's 
                         bullshit. They call this a war a 
                         cloud over the land, but they made 
                         the weather. Then they stand in the 
                         rain and say: shit! It's raining!
                              (tears welling)
                         If I cry one tear for my Daddy I 
                         stole it off a crocodile.

               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN. EVENING

               THE SNOW IS FALLING HEAVILY. RUBY AND ADA TRUDGE UP THE

               MOUNTAIN, dressed in Monroe's clothes, hats pulled down, 
               leading the horse, which is loaded up with tools and supplies. 
               A choice of paths. They start up one, then Ruby decides 
               against it, consults the map, and they reverse, pulling the 
               horse back and then yanking it up the other path.

               EXT. PI STRUCTURE, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

               Ruby and Ada have made a fire. They sleep under a stone 
               structure, which forms a natural pi shape, the fire in the 
               entrance, the snow caught in its light.

               EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. MORNING

               Ada and Ruby arrive at the scene of murder.

               Pangle is keeled over at the old Poplar, snow covering him. 
               Only his girth and a glimpse of coat identify him.

               Ada brushes some of the snow from his face, revealing the 
               death wound, then lays a hand in blessing on his head.

                                     ADA
                         I don't understand.

                                     RUBY
                         Maybe Teague's took him. They did 
                         that with the Swanger boys -- didn't, 
                         they? -- dragged them into town, 
                         then strung them up as warning... 
                         it's snowed since, so I can't read 
                         the story on the ground.

               Ada fishes out Pangle's banjo from the snow. It's broken and 
               the strings hang slack.

                                     RUBY
                         Let's dig.

               LATER -- and RUBY FINISHES OFF THE GRAVE, hammering in a 
               stone to mark the place. Ada walks away towards the creek, 
               to wash her hands. She bends and rinses her face.

               As she looks up SHE SEES STOBROD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE 
               CREEK; half-in, half out of the water, slumped against a 
               tree, blood everywhere, staining the crust of snow which 
               covers him.

                                     ADA
                         Ruby! Ruby!

               Ruby arrives at Ada, looks to where she's looking, walks 
               straight into the creek, all her love contained in the urgency 
               with which she hurtles to her father, oblivious to the 
               freezing water. She puts a head to his chest, seeks out a 
               pulse at his wrist. Calls back to Ada.

                                     RUBY
                         He's still breathing!
                              (to Stobrod)
                         God damn! Daddy; Daddy -- it's Ruby. 
                         Don't you die on me again.
                              (to Ada)
                         He's still breathing!

               EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. AFTERNOON

               A mean fire burns by the creek. RUBY TURNS A KNIFE IN THE 
               FLAMES. Stobrod's back is exposed. Just by the shoulder blade 
               is an ugly grey and purple bulge the size of a crabapple. 
               Ruby turns to Ada, who is helping.

                                     RUBY
                         Pack a pan full of snow. I need good 
                         clean water, boiled up.

               She cuts the skin and prises out a slug which she drops in 
               the snow and rolls around to clean. Stobrod doesn't move. He 
               could be dead. Ada loads the pan with snow.

                                     ADA
                         Let's get him home. We have herbs 
                         there and it's warm.

                                     RUBY
                         He'll die first. He's got hardly no 
                         blood left in him.

                                     ADA
                         He'll die lying here.

                                     RUBY
                         There's a place further on up. Used 
                         to be. Old Cherokee place. There's 
                         good water right by it.

               Ada puts the snow-packed pan on the fire.

               EXT. BY THE OUTLIER'S CAVE, COLD MOUNTAIN. AFTERNOON

               Squirrels frolic. Teague sits on the trunk of a fallen tree.

               He feeds the squirrels, looking straight ahead where the 
               mouth of a cave winks back at him.

               EXT. TREE TUNNEL NEAR CHEROKEE VILLAGE. AFTERNOON

               THE TWO WOMEN EMERGE FROM A STEEP TUNNEL OF TREES IN A 
               CHESTNUT GROVE. There's a stream and, up on the bank, A 
               CLUSTER OF BLACK CONICAL HUTS, made up of chestnut logs, 
               abandoned and slightly sinister looking. They approach one 
               of the huts, its door long lost. The snow has drifted in. A 
               second hut has a door which they pry open. It's dark and 
               cold, but apparently still weatherproof. They get Stobrod 
               off the horse and carry him inside, then come out again to 
               unload the horse of its remaining load.

                                     ADA
                         This horse is weary. He's ready to 
                         give up the ghost.

               Ruby picks up the blankets and provisions and goes back inside 
               to her father. Ada takes the horse to another hut and, despite 
               his great reluctance, pushes him inside.

                                     ADA
                         Good boy.
                              (she blows into his 
                              nostrils, calming 
                              him)
                         That's warmer, isn't it.

               Ada wouldn't even recognize this practical, hardy woman she's 
               become. Stringy and of few words. She sets off towards the 
               tree tunnel, passing Stobrod's hut.

                                     ADA
                         I'm getting firewood.

               EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. DUSK

               Inman approaches the Killing Ground. He studies the ground, 
               finds Pangle's grave. Blood has left its black writing in 
               the snow and he finds first where Stobrod has been, where 
               the bullet had been removed, then the journey away, still 
               tiny, telltale spatters of blood, and the hoof prints and 
               boot prints of two walkers and one loaded horse. He puts his 
               hand into the ashes of Ruby's fire, can't feel any warmth. 
               It's getting dark. He takes a drink from the stream, shudders 
               at the cold.

               INT. STOBROD'S HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. NIGHT

               The fire burns, a pall of smoke. Stobrod lies on the ground, 
               swathed in blankets. Coughs. Ruby sits next to him, wipes 
               the hair from his forehead. Ada opens her eyes, looks, closes 
               them, listens to the fire, a strange squeaking as it burns.

                                     ADA
                         That wood -- that sound when it burns 
                         that mean more snow?

                                     RUBY
                         Yes, it do, country girl.

               EXT. TRACK, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAWN

               First light. The sun creeps up, a red streak of dawn. Inman 
               walking, his head bent to the tracks. He walks quickly, even 
               as the terrain gets more steep. As he bends to the snow -- 
               where a spot of blood has fallen into a hoof print -- A FLAKE 
               OF SNOW LANDS ON HIS HAND. Then a second. He looks up. The 
               snow falls.

               He starts to move more quickly, racing the snow as it seeks 
               to erase the tracks. The snow thickens.

               EXT. TREE TUNNEL NEAR CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING

               In the Chestnut Grovel A DOZEN WILD TURKEYS pick their way 
               across the snow. A shotgun lines up its sight at one of them.

               The trigger is squeezed. An explosion of feathers.

               EXT. THREE WAY CROSSING, COLD MOUNTAIN. MORNING

               Inman hears the shot. Then a second, the sound ricocheting 
               around him. He can't quite identify its source but he runs 
               again, heading for the Chestnut trees he can see above him.

               EXT. TREE TUNNEL NEAR CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING

               Ada collects the two turkeys, the first creatures she's ever 
               shot. Doesn't quite know how to hold them. She straightens 
               up and sees, at the other end of the tree tunnel, backlit by 
               the morning sun, THE SILHOUETTE OF A MAN. She drops the 
               turkeys tires to reload the shotgun.

               Inman comes down the tunnel, approaching the hunter he sees 
               through the snow at the other end of it.

                                     ADA
                         Turn round and go back where you 
                         came from.

               Inman is bewildered by this woman's voice in a man's outfit, 
               keeps walking, peering through the snow. Ada fires a warning 
               shot. Inman, still some distance, suddenly understands.

                                     INMAN
                         Ada? Ada Monroe?

                                     ADA
                         I do not know you.

               After all this time, all this way, Inman could give up the 
               ghost.

                                     INMAN
                         Then I believe I made a mistake.

               He turns, walks heavily away from her. Then he turns again, 
               completely lost, without compass.

                                     INMAN
                         If I knew where to go I'd go there.

                                     ADA
                              (finally recognising 
                              him)
                         Inman?

               He nods. They don't know how to speak to each other, just 
               stand awkwardly, some distance apart, the emotion stones in 
               their throats. Eventually --

                                     ADA
                         You'd better come with me.

               And with that, she starts to sob, and sob.

               VERY HIGH ANGLE: Inman walks towards Ada. They embrace.

               INT. STOBROD'S HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING

               Ada enters, Inman behind her. Ruby looks up from Stobrod.

                                     ADA
                         Ruby, this is Inman.

               Ruby digests this. Considers this ghost of a man.

                                     RUBY
                         Congratulations, I should send you 
                         out with a shotgun more often. He 
                         looks as he needs sleep.

                                     INMAN
                         I may need to.

                                     RUBY
                         Be my guest. You shot or something?

                                     INMAN
                         Not lately.

                                     RUBY
                         Hungry?
                              (Inman nods, Ruby to 
                              Ada)
                         He woke up.

                                     ADA
                         Stobrod?

                                     RUBY
                         Said -- your mommy's name was Grace 
                         then closed his eyes again.

               EXT. CHEROKEE VILLAGE. DAY

               Ada comes out of Stobrod's hut, a glimpse of Inman sleeping 
               on the floor, heads for another hut which Ruby is sweeping 
               out. The snow has stopped. Ada stands in the door, watches 
               Ruby. Ruby's resistance to Inman is palpable.

                                     ADA
                         He's asleep. They both are.

                                     RUBY
                         I'm not surprised. Your man looks 
                         played out.

                                     ADA
                         I saw him. I realize now.

                                     RUBY
                         Saw him when?

                                     ADA
                         In Sally Swanger's well. A tunnel of 
                         trees. The man like a black smudge 
                         in the snow, the sun behind him.

                                     RUBY
                         Well there you are.

                                     ADA
                         Funny thing is it wasn't the same. 
                         The image. It wasn't snowing. And in 
                         the well, he was, as if he were 
                         falling.

                                     RUBY
                         You probably don't remember it right.

                                     ADA
                         I remember it exactly. There were 
                         crows, these black crows flying 
                         towards me. I thought I was seeing 
                         him fall. Instead I was seeing him 
                         come back to me. All this while I've 
                         been packing ice around my heart. 
                         How will I make it melt?

                                     RUBY
                         Better get a fire going.
                              (goes to the fireplace)
                         I've got big plans for that farm. 
                         Got a vision in my mind of how that 
                         Cove needs to be.

                                     ADA
                         I know you have.

                         There's not a thing we can't do 
                         ourselves.

               INT. ADA AND RUBY HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. NIGHT

               THE FIRE BURNS. Ada lies awake. Ruby sleeping. Ada gets up, 
               steps out into the snow, her blanket around her.

               EXT. ADA AND RUBY HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. NIGHT

               Inman is outside his cabin. Only the light escaping from the 
               cabin, fire lights them, almost silhouettes.

                                     INMAN
                         I'm sorry. I was trying to be quiet.

                                     ADA
                         I couldn't sleep.

                         -- I got no appetite left to be in a 
                         room with wounded men.

                                     ADA
                         I can't see your face.

                                     INMAN
                         It's not a face you recognised.

                         Did you get my letters?

                         I got three letters. Carried them in 
                         that book you gave me. The Bertram.

                                     ADA
                         I must have sent 100. Did you write 
                         to me?

                         Whenever I could. If you never got 
                         them I can summarize.

                         No, it's --

                                     INMAN
                         I pray you're well. I pray I'm in 
                         your thoughts. You are all that keeps 
                         me from sliding into some dark place.

                         But how did I keep you? We barely 
                         knew each other. A few moments.

                         A thousand moments. They're like a 
                         bag of tiny diamonds glittering in a 
                         black heart. Don't matter if they're 
                         real or things I made up. The shape 
                         of your neck. The way you felt under 
                         my hands when I pulled you to me.

                         That kiss -- which I've kissed again 
                         every day of my walking.

                         Every day of my waiting.

                                     INMAN
                         Maybe you can't see my face, but if 
                         you could see my inside, my whatever 
                         you want to name it, my spirit, that's 
                         the fear I have deeper than any gash 
                         on my neck. I think I'm ruined. They 
                         kept trying to put me in the ground, 
                         but I wasn't ready, no ma'am, no 
                         more ready than that scoundrel in 
                         there's not ready to die on us. But 
                         if I had goodness, I lost it. If I 
                         had anything tender in me I shot it 
                         dead.

               Ruby stomps out of the hut.

                                     RUBY
                         Number one -- shut this door, it's 
                         freezing.

               She's at the door to Stobrod's hut. She contemplates them.

                         all night I'm going to sleep in with 
                         him.

               And with that she enters Stobrod's hut, slamming the door.

                         Now I can't see anything.

               A long pause.

                         I'll say goodnight.

                                     ADA
                         I don't think Ruby's vacating my hut 
                         so that you can sleep in a different 
                         one.

               INT. ADA AND RUBY HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. NIGHT

               Ada puts logs onto the fire. After a few moments a knock.

                                     ADA
                         Come in.

               Inman enters. They don't know the rules for this.

                                     ADA
                         Whatever comes to pass between you 
                         and me, I want Ruby to stay in Black 
                         Cove.

                                     INMAN
                         Right.

                                     ADA
                         As long as she wants. And if she 
                         never leaves I'll be glad.

                                     INMAN
                         More a question could she put up 
                         with me.

                                     ADA
                         And you understand she's my friend, 
                         she's not a hired hand and she doesn't 
                         empty a night jar unless it's her 
                         own.

                                     INMAN
                         Sure.

                                     ADA
                         This war's made some things pointless. 
                         It's hard to imagine a wedding. I 
                         think even my father would recognize 
                         that.

                                     INMAN
                         Ada, I want to marry you. If you'll 
                         have me.

                                     ADA
                         Isn't there's some religion where 
                         you just have to say I marry you, 
                         three times, and then you're man and 
                         wife.

                                     INMAN
                         I marry you. I marry you. I marry 
                         you.

               Ada laughs, unsettling Inman.

                                     INMAN
                         Why's that funny?

                                     ADA
                         No, I think it's I divorce you three 
                         times and then you're not married 
                         anymore.

                                     INMAN
                         I can wait for you.

                                     ADA
                         You waited enough. I certainly did. 
                         I marry you. I marry you. I marry 
                         you.

               And they kiss, tentative, then more urgent.

                                     ADA
                         I'm sorry about the way I look. In 
                         these clothes.
                              (Inman shakes his 
                              head)
                         And there are so many buttons.
                              (starts to undress)
                         Will you turn your back?

                                     INMAN
                         Not for all the gold dollars in the 
                         Federal Bank.

               She stands holding her clothes in front of her to cover 
               herself. He takes them from her, drops them to the floor.

               EXT. CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING

               A crisp, cold beautiful morning. They're packing up, all 
               their clothes in layers. Inman prepares the horse. Ruby and 
               Ada carrying bundles out of the huts. Inman approaches Ruby.

                                     INMAN
                         You go ahead. I'll follow with the 
                         horse at a pace your daddy can 
                         tolerate.

                                     ADA
                         We can all go together.

                                     INMAN
                         It's safer this way. No one has 
                         quarrel with you.

                                     RUBY
                         He's right.

                                     INMAN
                              (to Ruby)
                         I gather I need permission if I reckon 
                         on living at Black Cove.

               Ruby gives a curt nod, goes over to Stobrod's hut. Inman 
               gets close to Ada.

                                     INMAN
                         We'll get to you by nightfall.

                                     ADA
                         You be safe.

               She puts her hand to his mouth which creases into a smile.

                                     INMAN
                         Your Mr. Bartram speaks about some 
                         category of fly born on the hide of 
                         a cow. It flies up into a tree and 
                         waits and waits until it smells cow. 
                         It can wait a year, two years, I 
                         don't know, maybe longer. Then a cow 
                         comes along and it wakes up, flies 
                         down, lays its eggs on the cow. 
                         There's purpose for you.

                                     ADA
                         And am I the fly in this story, or 
                         the cow?

               INT. STOBROD'S HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. DAY

               Ruby is wrapping a fragile Stobrod for the journey.

                                     STOBROD
                         You come up the mountain for me, 
                         darling, I'd be dead otherwise, dead 
                         and gone.

                                     RUBY
                         You'd have found some other fool to 
                         rescue you.

                                     STOBROD
                         He's sweet on you, that Georgia boy.

               He coughs for a long time.

                                     RUBY
                         If you say a thing and then cough 
                         it's a lie. Daddy, stay on that horse, 
                         and don't lose him or sell him. We'll 
                         need him on the farm.

               EXT. CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING

               And then the two women are off, little men in their outfits, 
               tramping off in the snow. Inman watches.

               EXT. TRACK NEAR THREE WAY CROSSING, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               Ruby and Ada walk.

                                     RUBY
                         I hope that Georgia boy's been seeing 
                         to the animals.

                                     RUBY
                         I was not. I was thinking on swollen 
                         udders -- and before you say same 
                         difference...

                                     ADA
                         I'm saying nothing.

               Ruby elbows her.

                                     RUBY
                         Miss lovey-dovey!

               Ada elbows her back.

               EXT. THREE WAY CROSSING, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               Inman has roped Stobrod to the horse which he pulls down a 
               steep slope. Behind him, their hooves muffled by the snow, A 
               GROUP OF RIDERS JOIN THE TRAIL, IN SLOW BUT STEADY PURSUIT.

               Inman walks on, apparently oblivious to who's behind him. He 
               and Stobrod are some distance from broken ground, a fringe 
               of trees.

                                     INMAN
                              (quietly to Stobrod)
                         Don't look round.

                                     STOBROD
                         Got it.

                                     INMAN
                         How many men does he have?

                                     STOBROD
                         There were five. You can't reason 
                         with that man.

                                     INMAN
                              (takes off his gloves)
                         I got a conversation stopper.
                              (they're getting closer)
                         Closer we get to that broken ground 
                         the better.

               Inman opens his coat. Stobrod looks at the Lemats. They're 
               at the edge of the trees.

                                     INMAN
                         You hold on tight, do you hear? When 
                         I say three, look round, nice and 
                         slow.

                                     STOBROD
                         Okay.

                                     INMAN
                         One, two, three.

               Stobrod looks round. Inman doesn't. Teague has some new bodies 
               in his entourage but they're all dead. A SPARE HORSE HAS 
               THREE CORPSES HUNG OVER IT, ANOTHER HORSE DRAGS A MAKESHIFT 
               LITTER WITH A COUPLE MORE, SOUVENIRS OF THEIR CAVE VISIT. 
               Teague waves.

                                     TEAGUE
                         God damn! You're a hard fucker to 
                         put down.
                              (they approach)
                         Good directions to that cave from 
                         the fat boy -- saw the squirrels, 
                         sat on the tree made some friends, 
                         brought some back with me.

               His riders begin, quite casually, to fan out.

               IN ONE MOVEMENT, INMAN SLAPS THE FLANK OF THE HORSE. WHICH 
               CAREERS DOWN THE TRACK, THEN TURNS AND FIRES, TWICE, BEFORE 
               PITCHING HIMSELF INTO A ROLL TOWARDS THE TREES. HIS FIRST 
               SHOT KNOCKS JO FROM HIS HORSE, THE SECOND MO, WHO FALLS INTO 
               THE SNOW, BLEEDING FROM THE GROIN AND SCREAMING. The riderless 
               horse gets tangled up with the others.

               Inman is in the trees, shots around him. He doesn't move 
               away from, but towards the riders inside the line of trees. 
               Grayling charges him, riding into the trees. INMAN SHOOTS 
               HIM, THEN RUSHES FROM THE TREES, FIRING, MISSING BOSIE, WHO 
               RIDES AWAY, EVIDENTLY NOT RELISHING THE FIGHT, AND THROWS 
               HIMSELF AT TEAGUE, WHOSE HORSE IS BUCKING WILDLY. Teague's 
               carbine fires an involuntary shot into the air. Inman yanks 
               the gun from his hand with his own left hand and lets go the 
               shotgun barrel of the Lemats with the other, the big pistol 
               almost leaping from his hand with the recoil. TEAGUE'S CHEST 
               OPENS OUT AS HE'S THROWN OFF THE HORSE. Mo is still screaming.

               Inman walks over and shoots him in the head, then walks to 
               Teague, who is saying something, the blood blotting the snow 
               under him.

               Inman studies him, picks up the Spencer carbine, turns to 
               look where Bosie has gone, steps up onto Teague's horse, 
               reins the horse in, and trots it over to the prostrate Teague, 
               LEANS OVER AND SHOOTS HIM DEAD. He turns the horse in the 
               direction Bosie had headed. He can't see horse or rider, but 
               in the stand of Hickory Trees ahead, THE GUSTS OF STEAMING 
               BREATH betray them both. He rides slowly towards the stand 
               of trees.

               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               Ada and Ruby walking. They hear the shots. Ada turns and 
               starts to run through the snow, her hat flying from her head.

               EXT. STAND OF HICKORY TREES, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               Inman's horse is parallel to Bosie, who is deep inside the 
               trees but also riding, slowly. It's like a dance.

                                     INMAN
                         Come out of there.

                                     BOSIE
                         No, sir. Here's fine.

                                     INMAN
                         I just have to shoot the horse from 
                         under you.

                                     BOSIE
                         Shoot her. She's not mine. You riding 
                         Mr Teague's mare?

                                     INMAN
                         I am.

                                     BOSIE
                         He dead?

                                     INMAN
                         I hope so.
                              (wearily, as he brings 
                              his horse inside the 
                              trees)
                         Look, how old are you? Give me your 
                         gun and ride home, I'm done fighting. 
                         I'm sick of it.

                                     BOSIE
                         I give you my gun you'll shoot me 
                         dead.

                                     INMAN
                         I will not shoot you, but nor am I 
                         walking down that mountain looking 
                         over my shoulder for you.

                                     BOSIE
                         That's what they call a conundrum. I 
                         tell you what I've got on my side.

                                     INMAN
                         What have you got on your side?

                                     BOSIE
                         The confidence of youth.

               And in that second HE PRODUCES HIS GUN AND FIRES. INMAN HAS 
               ALREADY FIRED THE LEMATS AND THE BOY, SHOT IN THE HEAD, FALLS. 
               CAUGHT BY ONE STIRRUP THE HORSE BOLTING. INMAN WATCHES, STOCK 
               STILL, THEN MAKES A COUGH, AS IF CLEARING HIS THROAT, AND A 
               THIN MIST OF BLOOD SPRAYS FROM HIS MOUTH.

               EXT. RIDGE, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               Ada and Ruby running. THEY REACH STOBROD, HIS HORSE STOPPED, 
               DRINKING FROM THE CREEK. Stobrod, barely conscious, hanging 
               halfway down its flank, held on by the ropes.

               Ada hurries on, taking the shotgun from Ruby, who tends to 
               her father.

               EXT. A GROVE OF TREES, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               Ada runs past the horse dragging the cave corpses. She hardly 
               stops to look at the bodies, just rushes on.

               THE GROUND SIMPLIFIES AND SHE'S AT THE BOTTOM OF A GROVE. A 
               STEEP INCLINE, THE SUN LOW AND IN FRONT OF HER. SHE SEES A 
               BRILLIANT FRAME OF BLACK TREES, AND THEN A SUDDEN FLURRY OF 
               ANGRY CROWS FLYING TOWARDS HER. AT THE TOP OF THE HILL IS A 
               SMALL HIEROGLYPH OF A MAN.

               FINALLY, THE IMAGE FROM THE SWANGER WELL EXACTLY AS SHE FIRST 
               SAW IT.

               THE FIGURE RAISES A HAND, BRIEFLY, THEN PITCHES FORWARD INTO 
               THE SNOW.

               She runs, her heart broken, towards the body of Inman. He's 
               dead, the red flag of his life ebbed, away in the snow. Ada 
               falls to her knees and pulls him over, the snow crusted on 
               his face, which she wipes away with great tenderness, then 
               sits, his head in her lap, as Ruby slowly comes up the hill 
               towards them.

               A VIOLIN PLAYS, quite raucous.

               INT. KITCHEN, BLACK COVE FARM, EASTER. DAY

               A GIRL, about five or six, with Ada's curls, sits at the 
               table cradling a tiny lamb, which won't feed from the nippled 
               bottle she offers it. She tries again. Ada comes in suddenly, 
               takes a knife from the kitchen, and hurries out.

                                     ADA
                         You bring that lamb outside.

               The girl gets up, carries the lamb out into the field.

               EXT. FIELD, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               THE SOUND OF THE FIDDLE CONTINUING, JOINED BY A BANJO, It's 
               a glorious spring morning, Black Cove Farm at its most 
               luxuriant, the path edged with brilliant flowers. There are 
               more animals in evidence. The girl emerges from the house 
               and sees Ada in the field, surrounded by sheep. She hurries 
               over.

               ADA IS EXPERTLY SKINNING A STILLBORN LAMB. The little girl 
               is horrified.

                                     GRACE
                         What are you doing!

                                     ADA
                         He came out dead, love.

               She has the skin off the lamb, which lies like a little pink 
               cat on the ground. She approaches Grace, takes the live lamb 
               from her arms, the girl resistant, frightened.

                                     GRACE
                         Don't kill him!

                                     ADA
                         I'm not going to kill him. But we 
                         have to try something or else he's 
                         going to die.

               She takes the skin and wraps it round Grace's lamb. Then 
               puts the covered lamb into the pen with the dead lamb's 
               mother.

               It goes to the sheep and, after a few false starts, starts 
               to feed, accepted as a surrogate.

                                     ADA
                         Isn't that a small mercy.

               And A VOICE joins in with the fiddle and banjo.

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               STOBROD is playing, on his repaired fiddle. His hair is now 
               completely grey. GEORGIA is playing the banjo and singing, 
               although. A SMALL CHILD with Georgia's reddish coloring keeps 
               invading his picking hand trying to join in. RUBY HAS ANOTHER 
               GEORGIA CHILD IN HER ARMS, but is also trying to serve food.

               She passes Georgia and touches the top of his head. SALLY 
               SWANGER is pouring water from a jug, Ada emerges from the 
               kitchen, with a big pie, racing to the table.

                                     ADA
                              (laughing)
                         Hot hot hot hot hot!!!

               From behind her, Grace appears, carrying a jug of milk, puts 
               it on the groaning board of the table. Grace has a full plate 
               in front of her, picks up a fork to spear some meat.

                                     ADA
                         Grace Inman, nobody said eat.
                              (then to Stobrod)
                         Mr. Thewes...

               The music stops. And there's quiet except for the sound of 
               animals: lowing, barking, braying, bleating.

                                     ADA
                         For good friends, good food, good 
                         family: for all our blessings -- Oh 
                         Lord we thank thee. Amen.

                                     ALL
                         Amen !

               And they eat.

                                         THE END
CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND

                  based on

       CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND

        an unauthorized biography by
                Chuck Barris




                                 third draft (revised)
                                           May 5, 1998

MUSIC IN:   OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL

TEXT, WHITE ON BLACK:


            This film is a reenactment of actual
            events. It is based on Mr. Barris's
            private journals, public records, and
            hundreds of hours of taped interviews.

FADE IN:

EXT. NYC STREET - NIGHT

SUBTITLE: NEW YORK CITY, FALL 1981

It's raining.    A cab speeds down a dark, bumpy side-street.

INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS

Looking in his rearview mirror, the cab driver checks out his
passenger: a sweaty young man in a gold blazer with a "P"
insignia over his breast pocket. Several paper bags on the
back seat hedge him in. The young man is immersed in the
scrawled list he clutches in his hand. A passing street
light momentarily illuminates the list and we glimpse a few
of the entries: double-coated waterproof fuse (500 feet);
.38 ammo (hollowpoint configuration); potato chips (Lays).

GONG SHOW

An excerpt from The Gong Show (reenacted). The video image
fills the screen. We watch a fat man recite Hamlet,
punctuating his soliloquy with loud belching noises. The
audience is booing. Eventually the man gets gonged. Chuck
Barris, age 50, hat pulled over his eyes, dances out from the
wings to comfort the agitated performer.

                      PERFORMER
            Why'd they do that? I wasn't done.

                      BARRIS (AGE 50)
            I don't understand. Juice, why'd you
            gong this nice man?

                         JAYE P. MORGAN
            Not to be.     That is the answer.

The studio audience laughs.

                                                            2.



INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT

The cab sloshes to a stop in front of a liquor store. The
young man gets out, jogs through the rain toward the
fluorescent storefront. The cab driver waits, listens to
staticky reports in a foreign language on his radio. The
meter is running. The back seat is piled high with bags.

GONG SHOW

Chuck Barris spastically dances on the screen along with Gene
Gene the Dancing Machine. Barris turns to the camera, points
at it.

                      BARRIS
            We'll be right back with more stuff.

INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT

The back of the cab is filled with even more bags and boxes.
The cab stops. The young man gets out and confers with a
shady looking guy on the corner. The young man pulls out a
big wad of cash. Money and a small package change hands.
The meter in the cab is at thirty-five dollars and change.

THE GONG SHOW

Chuck Barris is being sniffed in the crotch by a large dog.
The audience howls with glee. Suddenly the video image
explodes. Slow motion sparks and shards of glass shoot
toward the camera. We pull back to reveal we're in a
darkened, messy hotel room. We pan across the walls, past
taped-up, yellowed newspaper clippings with headlines like
"Gong Show a New Low in Television", "The Dumbing of
America", and "Chuck Barris is the Decline of Western
Civilization." We come to rest on a naked middle-aged man
crouching in the shadows in the corner, holding a gun. This
is Chuck Barris. The television continues to sputter, spark,
and smoke. There is a knock at the door.

                      BARRIS
                (mumbly)
            Fuck. Shit. Piss.


Naked Barris, still holding the gun, seems panicked. He
hesitates, trying to determine his options. Should he answer
the door? Should he climb out onto the window ledge?
Finally, he creeps to the door and peeks out the peephole for
a long moment. He unlocks the door, opens it. The sweaty,
young man, a bellhop, stands there with his many bags.



                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                              3.
CONTINUED:

He tries to appear casual as takes in the sight: a naked
Chuck Barris holding a gun, an exploded, smoking tv set in
the background.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
              (weakly)
          More stuff?

                    BELLHOP
          Yes sir, Mr. Barris. Everything you
          requested. Except I couldn't find a...
              (consults list)
          ... DH-10 directional fragmentation mine.

                    BARRIS
          Well, it's late.
              (mumbling and bowing)
          But thank you. Thank you for trying.
          You are a scholar and a...

Barris trails off, gives a quick glance both ways down the
hall, then motions for the bellhop to enter. The bellhop
places the bags on a table, fishes in his pocket and pulls
out some bills.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          Keep it. It's okay. Keep it.    You are a
          scholar and a...

Barris trails off.

                    BELLHOP
              (eyes averted)
          Thank you, sir.

Suddenly Barris becomes agitated.

                    BARRIS
          Why are you not looking at me like that?
          Do I look ugly to you?
              (runs to the mirror)
          It's the not sleeping. I'm not sleeping,
          see. I have a lot on my...

Barris trails off. There is a pause.   The bellhop attempts
to make conversation.

                    BELLHOP
              (re: exploded tv)
          Um, another Gong Show rerun, sir?

The naked Barris approaches the bellhop, drapes his arm over
the young man's shoulder and walks with him.


                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                              4.
CONTINUED: (2)


                    BARRIS
              (conspiratorially)
          You know what I'd do? -- And don't tell
          anybody -- I'd rub... I'd rub Alpo brand
          dog food on my dick so the dogs would
          stick their noses into my... dick.
          Guaranteed big laugh, right? That was my
          trick, my great contribution to the
          world. How wouldn't I degrade myself, I
          ask you.

There is a silence.

                       BARRIS (CONT'D)
                 (screaming)
          I ask you!
                    BELLHOP
          I... I... I don't know, sir.

Suddenly Barris punches himself in the head, flops down on
the unmade bed. The bellhop glances at Barris's bare ass,
looks away.

                    BELLHOP (CONT'D)
          Mr. Barris, maybe if you just don't watch
          the show every night, you wouldn't have
          to --

                    BARRIS
          I always pay for the damn tv's, don't I?
              (turning to face him)
          Don't I?!

                    BELLHOP
          It's -- Yes, you do, sir, and we
          appreciate that -- It's just that
          there've been complaints from some of the
          other guests, and Mr. Andrews, the
          assistant manager, requested that I --

                    BARRIS
          Still? Complaints? I specifically used
          the silencer this time! Specifically!

                    BELLHOP
          Well, the people in 917 found a bullet
          lodged in their wall. And while we want
          to accommodate you -- we certainly value
          your patronage -- there is an issue of
          customer safety.

Barris lets this sink in.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                            5.
CONTINUED: (3)


                    BARRIS
          Yes, of course.

Barris finds his pants draped over a chair, pulls out his
wallet, holds some more money out to the bellhop.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          My apologies. Buy -- 917, is it? -- buy
          them a magnum of your finest champagne.
          And... and your finest spackle. Oh, and
          get me a bag of plastic army men while
          you're out. I forgot to tell you before.

The bellhop sighs, takes the money.

                    BELLHOP
          Thank you for your understanding, sir.

The bellhop exists.

                    BARRIS
              (calling after)
          And some black socks!   Seven black socks,
          you rascule!

Barris locks the door, dumps the contents of the bags onto
the floor, fishes through the mess for a cigar, puts the
cigar in his mouth, studies himself in a full length mirror.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          Bellhop Johnson was clearly repulsed by
          the sight of me. And why not? I'm
          wrinkled...
              (searches for simile, then
               proudly)
          ... like a prune. Covered in liver
          spots...
              (searches for simile)
          ... like an old guy. My hair is falling
          out in clumps, leaving exposed patches of
          white, sickly scalp. A flabby inner-tube
          of fat hangs from my waist, practically
          obscuring my bedraggled prick -- dark and
          shriveled and dead. Still leaking urine
          even though I left the toilet ages ago.
          My asshole itches. Hemorrhoids abound.
          George Orwell said every man has the face
          he deserves by fifty. Does every man
          have the asshole he deserves by fifty, as
          well? Does every fifty year old asshole
          have the asshole he deserves?

                                                             6.



EXT. TERRACE - DAY

This feels real, verite. The actual Chuck Barris, smoking a
cigar, is being interviewed. He stands outside his villa in
St. Tropez, older than the middle-aged Barris depicted in the
hotel room, and talks to someone off-camera.

                    ACTUAL BARRIS
          It was 1981. I had holed myself up in
          this New York hotel. Parker Hotel.
          Terrified of everything. Ashamed of my
          life.

                     INTERVIEWER (O.C.)
          Ashamed?   What do you mean?

Barris walks through a small vegetable garden as he talks,
occasionally adjusting a stake or pulling out a weed.

                    ACTUAL BARRIS
          When you're young, your potential is
          infinite. You might do anything, really.
          You might be great. You might be
          Einstein. You might be Goethe. Then you
          get to an age where what you might be
          gives way to what you have been. You
          weren't Einstein. You weren't anything.
          That's a bad moment. But I remembered
          something Carlyle wrote: "... there is no
          life of a man, faithfully recorded, but
          is a heroic poem of its sort, rhymed or
          unrhymed." I realized my salvation might
          be in recording my wasted life,
          unflinchingly. Maybe it would serve as a
          cautionary tale. Maybe it would help me
          understand why.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Barris, now in a hotel terrycloth bathrobe and a porkpie hat,
sits at a desk and types manically.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          My name is Charles Prescott Barris. I
          have written pop songs, I have been a
          television producer. I am responsible
          for polluting the airwaves with mind-
          numbing, puerile entertainment. In
          addition, I have murdered thirty-three
          human beings. I am damned to hell.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

                                                              7.



EXT. PHILADELPHIA STREET - DAY

It's sepia. Three year old Chuck, dressed somewhat girlishly
and sporting a blonde pageboy haircut is being posed on a
pony by a photographer. His mother stands by anxiously as
the boy totters on the animal.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in
          1931, my early childhood remains
          accessible to me only as a series of
          elliptical, enigmatic memories.

INT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAY

A smiling butcher hands a slice of bologna to young Barris,
who puts it in his mouth.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          The taste of bologna fresh from the
          butcher.

EXT. CEMENT YARD - DAY

A baby doll is set afire.   Young Barris dances around it.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          The sickly sweet smell of a burning
          babydoll on a crisp autumn day.

INT. CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - DAY

Young Barris is being dressed by his mother. We're close on
the velvet material being slipped over his head.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          Velvet brushing against my tender young
          skin, as my mother dressed me.

EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

Young Barris rolling on the ground in battle with another
boy, as a crowd of children look on.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          A constant, inarticulate rage leading to
          fist fight after fist fight.

INT. CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - MORNING

Young Barris watches dust motes lit by the early morning
sunlight pouring through his bedroom window.


                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                             8.
CONTINUED:


                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          The calm I felt watching dust suspended
          in the early morning sunlight.

INT. CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - NIGHT

Young Barris sits on the floor and watches the shadow of a
man walking upstairs. The young boy is clearly terrified.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          I remember fear.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

Toddler Barris watches his mother change clothes. He studies
her pendulous breasts. She looks down, smiles warmly.

                       BARRIS (V.O.)
          Love.

                    MOTHER
          You like the way mommy looks, Chuckie?

                       BARRIS (AGE 4)
          Yes.

                    MOTHER
          I bet you would like to be a mommy some
          day, wouldn't you?

                    BARRIS
          Yes, mommy. Please.

                    MOTHER
          C'mere, you.

His mother lifts the little boy to her breasts and presses
his face against them. He is in heaven.

INT. CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY

Four year old Chuck sits at the dining room table with
several other four year olds. They all wear party hats.
Barris's father, a milquetoast middle-aged man enters in
birthday hat, carrying a cake decorated with four lit
candles. He leads the children in "Happy Birthday Dear
Chuck" as young Chuck beams.

                       BARRIS (V.O.)
          Rejection.




                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                              9.
CONTINUED:


Chuck glances at the kitchen doorway. His mother stands
there, staring at him. She dressed in black mourning
clothes, complete with veil.

INT. NURSERY - DAY

Young Chuck peeks in as his mother sits in a rocking chair
and holds Barris's infant sister. She fusses with the bows
and frills on the baby's outfit. The light in the room is
golden and warm.

                       BARRIS (V.O.)
          Expulsion.

We move in on the little boy's devastated face, then follow
him as he turns and walks down the hall into darkness.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

A sixteen year old Barris lies on his back on a couch lazily
tossing a football in the air. Tuvia, a thirteen year old
girl, sits on the floor playing with a puppy. In the
background, throughout the scene, we hear the inept playing
of scales on a bass violin.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          When I was sixteen I had an experience
          with my little sister's friend Tuvia that
          left an indelible impression.

                       BARRIS (CONT'D)
             Phoebe's no Walter Page, huh, Tuvia?

                    TUVIA
          I don't know who that is.

                     BARRIS
          Of course you don't.
              (beat)
          Why are you waiting around anyway,
          listening to this cacophonous cacophony,
          when you could be in your own abode
          disrupting the lives of your own
          siblings?

                    TUVIA
          I don't know what anything you say means.

                      BARRIS
          No.    You wouldn't, would you.


                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                          10.
CONTINUED:


Barris watches Tuvia playing with the dog. She gets on all
fours and yelps, imitating the dog. This excites the dog,
who bounces around her. Barris studies Tuvia's exposed white
underwear for a while. This excites Barris. Finally he
pulls an afghan off the back of the couch and drapes it over
his pants. We hear him unzip his fly.

                      BARRIS (CONT'D)
          Hey.

                    TUVIA
              (not looking)
          What?

                    BARRIS
          Hey, Tuvia.

                    TUVIA
              (turning)
          Wha-at?!

Tuvia sees Barris fiddling with something under the afghan.
She gets quiet.

                    BARRIS
          You wanna lick it?

Tuvia snorts, goes back to playing with the dog.

                      TUVIA
          No.    Why should I?

                    BARRIS
          Well, for one thing it tastes like
          strawberry. My sister tells me you love
          strawberries.

                    TUVIA
          Yeah, well... I hate strawberries.

                    BARRIS
          Honestly, a man's penis tastes exactly
          like a strawberry lollipop.

                    TUVIA
          Look, I know that's not true, so --

                    BARRIS
          It is true. It's weird but it's true.    I
          just read a research paper on it.

Tuvia looks at the afghan.

                                                           11.



INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Middle-aged Chuck Barris turns from the typewriter and stares
out the window at the dark night sky.

                    BARRIS
              (sadly wistful)
          My first love.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Tuvia's face jerks up into frame.   She spits.

                    TUVIA
          Uchh. Yech. It doesn't taste anything
          like strawberry, you creep.

The dog sticks his head under the afghan.   Barris shoos him
away.

                    BARRIS
              (curious)
          Well, what does it taste like?

Tuvia gets up.

                    TUVIA
          Y'know, I'm gonna tell your mother what
          you just did.

                    BARRIS
          If you do, I'll tell your mother you made
          our dog lick your crack.

                       TUVIA
          I did not!

                    BARRIS
              (shrugging)
          So what?

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Middle-aged Barris types as the camera glides over some of
the acquired detritus in his room: skin magazines, a gun and
silencer, liquor, a copy of Beyond Good and Evil, a disguise
kit, a kid's sprouted lima bean science fair project.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          Perhaps my whole life turned at that
          point. The repulsiveness of my sex
          confirmed by the tastebuds of a ripening
          pubescent girl.

                                                             12.



MONTAGE

Sequence of young Barris unsuccessfully attempting to pick up
girls at bars, unsuccessfully attempting to cop a feel on a
date in a movie theater, standing on a front porch
unsuccessfully attempting to kiss a girl good night, standing
outside of a movie theater in the rain, holding an umbrella
over his head and checking his watch.

                    BARRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And so I found myself in a downward
          spiral of debauchery. Endlessly chasing
          pussy. My only focus in life: to get
          laid, to get blown, trying to fool myself
          into believing that given the right
          combination of circumstances and
          deception, maybe the Tuvias of the world
          could desire me the way I desired them.
          I only wanted to be loved.

INT BAR - NIGHT

Barris is fighting another drunken guy.   He's getting
pummeled.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          A constant, inarticulate rage led to bar
          fight after bar fight.

The two men get tossed from the bar.

EXT. BAR - CONTINUOUS

The other guy gets up, brushes himself off, orients himself,
and after a moment starts beating Barris again.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

SUBTITLE: New Jersey Turnpike, 1955

A bus drives along. We see from the sign above the
windshield that it is bound for New York.

INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS

Young Barris, age 24, in traveling clothes and red hunting
cap, stares out the window.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          As much as I tried, I couldn't understand
          my past and my present was miserable, so,
          at twenty-four, I decided what I needed
          was a future...

                                                             13.



EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER (1955) - DAY

Young Barris, suitcase in hand, looks up at the impressive
building. People hurry by.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          ... I had heard that television was an
          industry with a future.

Barris enters the building with resolve.

INT. NBC STUDIOS (1955) - DAY

Young Barris, age 24, dressed in an NBC blazer is leading a
group of sheep-like tourists down a hall.

                    BARRIS
          Next, we'll have a look at the studio
          where they produce the Today Show.

The tourists "ooooh." Another tour group comes around a
corner. This one is led by Georgia, a perky, blonde southern
girl. The two groups squeeze past each other. Chuck tries
to make eye contact with Georgia. He smiles at her, but she
ignores him.

INT. NBC COMMISSARY - DAY

Barris is at the cash register paying for his food. He looks
around for a place to sit. He spots Georgia, sitting with a
female friend, and he sits at a table behind, so as to listen
unobserved to their conversation.

                     GIRLFRIEND
          That fella Raymond in payroll is kinda
          cute, huh?

                    GEORGIA
          Cute's all well and good, Mary Ann, but
          what you want is a man who's goin'
          places. A go-getter on the management
          fast-track.

Barris registers this information.

INT. NBC PERSONNEL OFFICE - DAY

Barris stands at the counter talking to a female clerk.

                    BARRIS
          Management trainee application, please.

The clerk hands him an application without looking up.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          How many people applying for this so far?

                    CLERK
              (calculating)
          Let's see, including you... about two
          thousand.

                    BARRIS
          For how many positions?

                    CLERK
              (looking up and smiling)
          Five.

INT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

Barris sitting with a book and copying the names of three of
the board of directors of RCA onto his application under the
heading of "Personal References."

INT. BARRIS'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Young Barris is having sex with Georgia. They finish.
Barris rolls off her and onto his back. Georgia sighs.

                    GEORGIA
          Tell me again.

                    BARRIS
          Head of network sales at thirty.   Head of
          the entire network at forty.

                    GEORGIA
          And?

                     BARRIS
              (rote)
          Dead of a heart attack by fifty with all
          my millions left to you.

                    GEORGIA
          You're wonderful. I love you, Mr. Chuck
          Barris, management trainee.

She climbs on top of Barris and begins kissing him all over.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          Life was sweet. For a minute.

                                                             15.



INT. BARRIS'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

Georgia is looking radiant as she reads a movie magazine.
Barris enters. She runs over to kiss him.

                       GEORGIA
          Baby doll!

                    BARRIS
          I got fired.

She pulls away, studies him for a moment, lets it sink in.

                       GEORGIA
          Fired?

                     BARRIS
          Fired.   F-I-R...

                     GEORGIA
          Fired?   What the fuck did you get fired
          for?!

                    BARRIS
          I don't know, efficiency cutback. Some
          bullshit... Look, it's gonna be...

                    GEORGIA
          Well, I'm pregnant, you fuck!

          Yeah, pregnant!

                    BARRIS
          What the fuck did you get pregnant for?!

                    GEORGIA
          What do you mean, what the fuck did I get
          pregnant for? You got me fucking
          pregnant, you fuck!

                    BARRIS
          Well, fuck you.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

Barris sits drunkenly at the bar.   He talks to a drunken guy

CONTINUED:


                       BARRIS
             So I figured I'd skip town. I intend to
             be important, y'know, I can't be saddled
             with this.. But then I remembered
             something Carlyle said: "Do the duty
             which lies nearest thee."

                       BAR FLY
             Who's Carlyle?

                       BARRIS
             Dear God, why do I even bother?

                       BAR FLY
             Hey, fuck you, you condescending prick.

                       BARRIS

The guy punches Barris. A fight ensues.

                 (pissy)
             Looks like I was just late.

Barris barely acknowledges this, continues to watch tv.

INT. BARRIS'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

Barris and Georgia are in bed. Georgia is asleep.        Barris
opens his eyes, quietly climbs out of bed.

INT. APARTMENT - DAY

Another verite-looking interview. A middle-aged blonde
woman, the actual Georgia, is talking to someone off-camera.
Sitting next to her is a Jewish-looking middle-aged man.

                       ACTUAL GEORGIA
             I woke up and he was gone. No note. No
             nothing. I never saw him again. Until
             that stupid tv show he did.

INT. COMMUTER TRAIN    - DAY

We're close on a copy of the NY Herald Tribune. The headline
reads Clark Testifies Before "Payola" Committee. We pull
back to see young Barris, in a suit, reading the paper in a
passenger car of a moving train.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          In '61 I was thirty. I had become a
          minor suit at ABC. It was during the
          music payola scandal...

INT. TV STUDIO - DAY

American Bandstand is taping. The studio is filled with
dancing teens. Barris sits off to one side behind an
imposing desk in the semi-darkness, suspiciously watching
Dick Clark's every move, and taking copious notes. Clark
glances over nervously.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          ...so my job was to commute to Philly
          every day to the American Bandstand
          tapings, and keep an eye on Dick Clark.

INT. OFFICE - DAY

The actual Dick Clark is being interviewed.

                    DICK CLARK
          Chuck Barris? He spooked me. I tried to
          keep on his good side becuase he was sort
          of... spooky.

                       INTERVIEWER (O.C.)
          How so?

                    DICK CLARK
          I dunno, there was something in his eyes.
          Something dark, like unbridled ambition,
          maybe. Or an inarticulate rage.

EXT. PALISADES PARK - NIGHT

Barris walks through the crowds. A dark look in his eyes as
he follows some giggling teenage girls in poodle skirts.

          On weekends I used to hang around
          amusement parks. Because that's where
          the young girls were.

INT. BARRIS'S TENEMENT APARTMENT - NIGHT

Young Barris lies in bed masturbating.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          I wrote a song about my experience.

The song "Palisades Park" begins.

                    FREDDIE CANNON
          Last night I took a walk after dark/to
          see a place called Palisades Park/to have
          some fun and see what I could see/that's
          where the girls are

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. TV STUDIO

A sign above the stage reads The Dick Clark Saturday Night
Beechnut Show. Freddie Cannon is on stage singing "Palisades
Park" as a crowd of 1962 teenagers dance on the studio floor.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          I got it to Freddie "Boom Boom" Cannon
          through my friendship with Dick Clark.
          Dick really wanted to help me out.

                    FREDDIE CANNON
          I took a ride on the shoop de shoop/that
          girl I sat beside was awful cute/and when
          we stopped she was holding hands with
          me/my heart was flying/up like a rocket
          ship/down like a roller coaster/fast like
          a loop de loop/round like a merry go
          'round...

Young Barris watches happily from behind the cameras. He
spots, Debbie, a pretty, bland young woman with headphones
and a clipboard. He sidles over to her.

                    BARRIS
          Hi.

                    DEBBIE

          Oh.    Uh-huh.

                    BARRIS
          It's number three on the pop charts.

Barris pulls out music magazine clipping as proof.

                      DEBBIE
          Huh.

INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Barris and Debbie are having dinner.

                    BARRIS
          See, I believe there's a great future in
          television.

                      DEBBIE
          Uh-huh.

                    BARRIS
          So I'm going to take my royalties and
          create a pilot. A pilot is what they
          call a test tv show.

                    DEBBIE
          I work in tv.

                    BARRIS
          Yeah. It's gonna be a game show. I
          believe there's a great future in game
          shows.

                    DEBBIE
          That's good.

                    BARRIS
          Everyone loves game shows, right?

          That's great then.

                    BARRIS
          I'm on my way!

There is a long, awkward silence.    They both saw away at
their steaks.

INT. DEBBIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Barris and Debbie are having sex, sort of mechanical.
They're plowing through, kind of like sawing through their
steaks. When it's over, they both just lie there.

INT. DEBBIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Young Barris, in his underwear, sits alone in the semi-
darkness and stares out the window. The front door unlocks
and a woman enters, backlit from the hallway. She turns on
the light. This is Penny Pacino, eighteen, a beatnik in a
black leotard and skirt and black mascara. She has red hair.
She sees Barris on the couch.

                     PENNY
          Hello.

                     BARRIS
          Hi.   Don't be alarmed    I'm with Debbie.

                    PENNY
          Yeah, I figured.

Penny walks past him, drops her keys and bag on the counter,
and enters the kitchenette. Barris watches her ass.

                    PENNY (CONT'D)
          You hungry?

                    BARRIS
          Um, no thanks.

                     PENNY
          Thirsty?

                    BARRIS
          If you have a beer.

Penny returns with two beers, hands one to Barris.      She sits
in a chair across from him. They both drink.

                   PENNY
         So how was sex with Debbie?   I've always
         wondered.

                   BARRIS
             (a little taken aback)
         It was good. Fine. Thanks for asking.

                   PENNY
         No problem. I just got fucked by this
         drummer cat. A really righteous Negro
         hipster.

                    BARRIS
         Huh.   Interesting.

                   PENNY
         See, I believe in the brotherhood of man.
         Last week I got fucked by an Oriental.
             (beat, studies him)
         What are you?

                       BARRIS
         Jew.

                   PENNY
         That's what I thought. I had a Jew, but
         he was Sephardic. You look Ashkenazi
         (pronounced Ashkuh-Natzee), I'm guessing.

                       BARRIS
          Ashkenazi.

                  PENNY
         Right. Ashkenazi... I haven't balled one
         of them.

                   BARRIS
         You're a romantic.

                   PENNY
         Eh, I just don't get into all the
         bullshit between cats and chicks.

                    BARRIS
          I know what you mean.

          Don't I know it.

                     PENNY
              (beat)
          We could ball if you want.     I seem to
          like you pretty well.

                    BARRIS
          Well, that would be good. But, you know,
          I'm kind of here with Debbie. It doesn't
          seem right.

                     PENNY
          Yeah. That's true. I didn't think of
          that.
               (getting up)
          Well, I'm going to bed. Nice meeting
          you.

Penny shakes his hand and heads off.

                    BARRIS
          What's your name?

                       PENNY

          Oh, you're the one who wrote that
          Palisades song. I love that song.     It's
          such sentimental bullshit.

Penny exits into her bedroom.   Barris drinks his beer.

INT. BARRIS'S TENEMENT APARTMENT - DAY

Barris and Penny are having sex on the kitchen floor.      It's
quite passionate.

INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - LATER

Penny is taking a bath in the tub in the kitchen while Barris

          Just because we fucked, doesn't mean

                    BARRIS

          And that's what it's about. A pretty
          girl asks three handsome guys, who she
          can't see, silly questions. And based on
          their answers, she picks one to date.

              (holds up notebook, shakes it)
          Look. Ideas. Okay?

                    PHOEBE
          You're thirty-two years old, and you have
          no career and no prospects.

                    BARRIS
          Thanks for the status report, Phoebe.
          Look, I just gotta come up with the right
          concept. Then, boom.
              (holds up notebook again)
          Which, by the way, I've almost got.

                    PHOEBE
          You're breaking mom's heart.     You know
          that, don't you?

Barris looks out the window at his emaciated mother sitting
in the yard in an old wicker-backed wheelchair and staring
off into space.

                    BARRIS
          Somehow, and don't ask me why, Phoebe, my
          being born broke mom's heart.

Barris watches his mother for a long moment.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          Hey Phoebe, you ever see what's-her-name,
          Tuvia, anymore?

                      PHOEBE
          Who?

                     BARRIS
          Tuvia.   Your friend.   Tuvia.   The girl.

                    PHOEBE
          Oh. No. I heard something. I think she
          got divorced recently or something.

                      BARRIS
          Oh, yeah?

                                                             27.



EXT. FRONT PORCH - DAY

Barris knocks on the door. There is some movement inside and
a woman answers the door. This is older Tuvia, 20's,
attractive but a little hard-edged now. She balances a baby
on her hip

                       OLDER TUVIA
          Yes?
              (registers)
          Well, if it isn't Strawberry-dick Barris.

                       BARRIS
          Hi, Tuvia.

Barris taken by the changes in Tuvia. The baby and the full,
milk-producing breasts get him excited.

                    OLDER TUVIA
          What do you want?

                    BARRIS
          I came by to apologize.

                       OLDER TUVIA
          Okay then.

She closes the door.    He knocks again.   She opens the door.

                    OLDER TUVIA (CONT'D)
          Well, if it isn't Strawberry-dick Barris.
          Now what do you want?

                    BARRIS
          So I'm back in town. For a while.      I
          thought maybe you and I could --

                    OLDER TUVIA
          Jesus, you've got to be kidding.

Tuvia closes the door. Barris stands there for a moment,
considers knocking again, then turns and leaves.

EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - NIGHT

We move along a park bench, past several homeless people, one
holding an old doll, others holding other sad items. We come
to Barris. He's wrapped in a horse blanket and holding the
miniature cardboard Dating Game set. An open notebook sits
on his lap. The pages are blank, except for one entry: The
Something Else Game. Barris holds a pen poised to write, but
doesn't.

                                                            28.



INT. BAR - DAY

Barris is drunk and in a fight. He is losing, flailing,
swinging wildly. Jim Byrd, a middle-aged, business man-
looking guy, in tinted glasses and sideburns, watches from
the bar. Eventually Barris and the other brawler get thrown
out of the bar. Byrd takes a sip of his drink.

EXT. BAR - DAY

Barris sits on the curb, nursing his wounds.    Byrd exits the
bar and casually approaches.

                    BYRD
          You're a pretty angry young fella, aren't
          you? Can't fight worth a damn though.

                    BARRIS
          Screw off, fag. Don't think I haven't
          seen you watching me in that bar for a
          week now.

                    BYRD
          Kind of a loner, I'd say. Fairly bright.
          A tad anti-social. Mad at the world.
          Can I buy you lunch?

                    BARRIS
          Look, there's a schoolyard half a block
          down. Why don't you go trolling there?

Barris gets up and starts to walk away.

                    BYRD
          I could teach you at least thirty
          different ways to kill a man with a
          single blow, Mr. Barris.

Barris stops.

                    BYRD (CONT'D)
          Might help you in future bar fights.
          Just a thought.

Barris just stands there.

                    BYRD (CONT'D)
          Oh, and there's money in it.    Good money.

Barris turns.

                                                              29.



INT. DINER - DAY

Barris and Jim Byrd sit in a booth.   Barris is wolfing a
hamburger. Byrd sips coffee.

                    BARRIS
              (mouth full)
          ... and I figure if I can keep afloat
          until I come up with my next game show
          idea, then all will be copacetic.

                    BYRD
          That sounds great, Chuck. Y'know, I've
          never known a television producer before.
          I'm impressed.

                    BARRIS
          Yeah, yeah. So what's this money deal
          you were talking about?

                    BYRD
          Well, I work for a government agency, and
          I can always use good, enthusiastic men
          to help me carry out my directives.

                    BARRIS
          What kind of work?   What government
          agency?

                    BYRD
              (matter-of-fact)
          Problem solving work.   For the Office of
          Diplomatic Security.

                    BARRIS
          Office of what? Never heard of it.     Is
          that the fucking CIA or something?

                    BYRD
          Please be discreet, Mr. Barris.

                    BARRIS
              (whispering)
          Jesus, it is the fucking CIA! Hell, I'll
          be a spy! Where do I sign up? Are you
          fucking with me? You're fucking with me,
          aren't you?

                    BYRD
          Hardly. And you wouldn't be with the
          company. You'd be a contract agent.
          Independent. No official tie to any
          agency. Is that understood?

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                              30.

                       BARRIS
              (beat)
          Why me?

                    BYRD
          As you know, I've been watching you. For
          years, actually. I've only let you know
          about it for the last week.

Chuck stops chewing.

                       BARRIS
          Jesus.

                    BYRD
          I'm happy to report you fit our profile,
          Mr. Barris. Are you interested in this
          work?

Long pause.

                    BARRIS
          Well, what's the profile?

                    BYRD
          Are you interested in this work, Mr.
          Barris?

                    BARRIS
          Yeah, sure, I wanna be a secret agent.
          Contract agent. Whatever. Get to fuck
          beautiful Eastern European women. Wear a
          trenchcoat. Sounds like a kick.

                    BYRD
          The work we do is very serious. It's
          essential in quelling the rise of
          communism and allowing democracy to gain
          its rightful foothold around the globe.

                      BARRIS
          Sure.    Yeah. Okay.   That's good.

EXT. ABANDONED ARMY BASE - DAY

The place is ramshackle and overgrown.   It looks deserted.    A
barbed-wire fence surrounds it.

INT. BASE REC ROOM - DAY

A severe-looking instructor is teaching a class to an
assembled group of scary-looking men: losers, psychos,
mercenaries, Latin American thugs, and Chuck Barris.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                             31.
CONTINUED:


                    INSTRUCTOR #1
          There are several efficient methods of
          killing a man, were you to find yourself
          without a weapon. The edge of your hand
          against the adversary's Adam's apple.
              (demonstrates on mannequin)
          This will crush the windpipe causing
          strangulation and death.

The students take notes.

                    INSTRUCTOR #1 (CONT'D)
          Boxing your adversary's ears with proper
          force will cause his ear drums to burst
          and possibly result in bleeding in the
          brain. And death.

EXT. BARRACKS - NIGHT

It's dark. Byrd sits on a step, smoking a cigarette.     Barris
approaches.

                    BARRIS
          You're training me to be a killer.

                    BYRD
          See, Chuck, I knew you were fairly
          bright.

                    BARRIS
          I can't kill people.    My future is in
          television.

                    BYRD
          Listen, you're thirty-two years old and
          you've achieved nothing. Jesus Christ
          was dead and alive again by thirty-three.
          Better get cracking.

                    BARRIS
          I have ideas for shows.

                    BYRD
          Oh, good. Why don't you spend another
          six months developing 'em while staring
          out the window at mommy's house next to
          poor dead Albert the dog.

                       BARRIS
             How do you know all that?

                    BYRD
          I know everything about you, Chuck. For
          fuck's sake, I know which hand you jerk
          off with.

Barris lifts his hands, tries to remember.

                    BYRD (CONT'D)
          Right. Leave in the morning, if you
          want. But I'm here to tell you this is
          honest work for good pay. You'd be
          helping to make the world safer. And
          your country would be grateful.

Byrd rises, stubs out his cigarette in his hand.

                    BYRD (CONT'D)
          It'll toughen you up.

Barris sits there staring into the blackness.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Another big, frightening instructor stands before the class.
Behind him is a full-sized diagram of a man which illustrates
all major arteries and organs. He is demonstrating the
proper way to grip a knife, then using the knife, he points
to various sites on the body.

Angle on Chuck Barris. He has copied the diagram of the man
in his notebook and is writing "Carotoid artery carries blood
to brain. Death in seconds." He then writes: "Game show
idea: Slice of Life. Interesting!!"

EXT. FIELD - DAY

Several canvas dummies are propped up in the field. Barris
and other students slash at the dummies with big knives.

                    INSTRUCTOR #1
          Glycerin is, of course, the best-known
          nitrating agent. Now keep in mind,
          nitroglycerin is extremely unstable. A
          slight tap, a one degree change in
          temperature and it'll blow up in your
          hands. Yee-haa, let's mix us up a batch!

Instructor #1 holds up a beaker.

                    INSTRUCTOR #1 (CONT'D)
          Everybody take your 75 ml beaker and fill
          it to the 13 ml level with fuming red
          nitric acid, 98% concentration.

The students nervously pour nitric acid into beakers.

INT. BUNKER - DAY

The severe instructor is demonstrating how to use an army
field telephone to torture a man. A canvas dummy is tied to
a chair as the instructor attaches wires from the telephone
to the dummy's genitals and to his mouth. The students watch
closely, take notes.

EXT. BARRACKS - DAY

The students with suitcases and in traveling clothes are
hugging and saying good-bye. The end of summer camp. A
tearful Barris heads toward one of the waiting buses. Byrd
pulls him aside, discusses something with him.

INT. PLANE - DAY

Byrd and Barris, now dressed in a suit similar to Byrd's, sit
in first class. Byrd stirs his scotch and water with his
finger as he stares at nothing out the window.

EXT. AIRSTRIP, MEXICO CITY    - DAY

SUBTITLE: MEXICO CITY, 1965

A commercial airliner comes in for a landing.

INT. CAFE - DAY

Barris, Byrd, and two sleazy, sweaty men, Benitez and
Brazioni, sit in a booth in the back of the dark cafe.
Benitez opens up his brief case and pulls out a pile of
grainy photos of a man leaving a residence and a street map.
He lays them on the table.

             Si.   In the flesh.

                    BYRD
          What have you got for me, Manny?

                    BENITEZ
              (re: map)
          Renda leaves his apartment every day at
          8:30, alone, walks east two blocks to
          this news kiosk, buys a paper and heads
          south four blocks to the plaza of the
          Museum Nacional to read it.

                    BYRD
          Okay. Chuck, you're here at 8:25. Dress
          like a tourist. Start walking north.
          You should pass Renda here. Stop him and
          ask him in bad Spanish where the museum
          is. Make sure he doesn't understand what
          you're asking.

                        BARRIS
          Okay.

                    BYRD
              (to Brazioni and Benitez)
          You'll be parked here. Brazioni, you're
          behind the wheel. Benitez, you're on the
          street leaning into the car chatting with
          Benitez. When Chuck stops Renda, you
          turn to help with the directions, stick a
          gun into Renda's ribs, and direct him
          into the back seat. Chuck, you get in
          first. Renda's between you and Benitez.
          Brazioni, whaddaya got?

Brazioni opens a case to reveal three Walther P-38 pistols.

                    BYRD (CONT'D)
          Nice. You got suppresers with those, I'm

INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

Brazioni and Benitez are at a table, drunk, sweaty and loud,
flirting with some women. Byrd sits at the bar, sipping a
scotch. Barris enters, spots Byrd, sits down next to him.

          Don't fuckin' dance with me, Barris.
          Renda's bad for the Tea and Biscuit Co.
          He's bad for me personally. You work for
          me, and Renda's bad for me. You're now

          United States of Jim Byrd.

          Look, this is --

Byrd grabs Barris and pulls him over to a dark corner of the
room. No one looks up. He pushes Barris against the wall.

                    BYRD
          There's no backing out now, Chuck. We've

          I was just --

                    BYRD
              (softening)
          I like you. I really do. And you're
          gonna do fine tomorrow. And we're gonna
          become great friends. And you're gonna
          have a very nice little career. But
          you've got to grow up. There's a war on.

                      YOUNG BARRIS
          What war?

                    BYRD
              (walking away)
          That's not your concern.

INT. MEXICAN HOTEL ROOM   -   NIGHT

It's hot. There are two twin beds in the room. Byrd sleeps
soundly in one. Barris lies in the other, eyes wide open.

EXT. MEXICO CITY STREET - DAY

Renda is buying a newspaper at the kiosk. He completes the
transaction and takes a few steps with his paper. Barris
blocks his way, holding a phrase book and shaking.

                    BARRIS
          Excusa me, por favor, Senor.

Renda stops.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          Donde es-bla ra-ba-blala los bloteros?

                    RENDA
          No comprende.

Renda tries to get away from this pesky tourist.   Barris
follows him, calling after him.

                    BARRIS
          Ra-bla-bla-mamos las minjares?

Renda picks up his pace, as does Barris.   Benitez approaches.

                    BENITEZ
          May I be of some assistance here?

Renda appears relieved, until he feels the gun in his back.

                                                            37.



INT. CAR - DAY

Renda's in the back between Barris and Benitez. Brazioni
drives. Renda seems pale and nervous, as does Barris in his
gaudy tourist wear and sunglasses. The car drives slowly
through the crowded Mexico City streets. They arrive at a
jammed intersection and are suddenly confronted with a big
parade. It's Day of the Dead; the streets are filled with
dancing skeletons. It's wild and frightening. Brazioni
glances at Renda in the reaview mirror.

                    BRAZIONI
          Day of the dead.

EXT. FIELD - DAY

The car stops in a deserted field. Barris gets out first.
His shirt is soaked through with sweat. Suddenly there's a
commotion inside the car. Renda has gotten hold of a gun.
He shoots Brazioni and Benitez. Barris panics and dives
behind the car. Renda steps cautiously outside of the car,
looking for Barris. Barris grabs Renda's foot. Renda falls,
the gun flies from his hand. Barris kicks the gun under the
car, his own gun drawn. He points the gun at Renda, who is
on his stomach. Barris doesn't shoot. He's scared, shaking
wildly. Renda looks up at Barris, trying to figure him out.
He slowly rises to his feet, turns to Barris with a pleading
look in his eyes.

                    RENDA
          Por favor. No me mates, senor.   Tengo
          tres bebes.
Barris sucks in a deep gulp of air. His hand shakes.   He
pulls out Spansh-English dictionary.

                     BARRIS
          Again.

                     RENDA
          Que?
                     BARRIS
                   Repitolo.
          Again.

                    RENDA
          No me mates. Tengo tres bebes.
Barris flips through the dictionary. A church bell chimes,
startling Barris. His gun goes off accidentally and the
bullet hits Renda in the face, tearing most of it away.
Renda falls, but is still alive. He screams out of where his
mouth was. A wedding party emerges from the distant church.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                             38.
CONTINUED:


                       BARRIS
          Oh Christ.     Oh crap.

Barris tries to stop Renda from screaming by covering the
hole in Renda's face. Barris throws up, some of it landing
on Renda's pants. He wipes his own mouth with his bloody
hand and looks at the still screaming Renda. The churchgoers
are starting to squint in Barris's direction. Barris shoots
Renda again. And again and again and again and again. More
blood spatters Barris's clothing and face. The church bell
continues to chime.

INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

Barris and Byrd sit side-by-side in first class.    This time
Barris has the window seat and stares out.

                       BYRD
             Beautiful country, isn't it?

                       YOUNG BARRIS
             Yeah.

                       BYRD
             You did us proud, Chuck.

Barris doesn't say anything.

                       BYRD (CONT'D)
             Renda was a bad guy. He really was.

                       BARRIS
             Yeah.

INT. APARTMENT - EVENING

Barris enters carrying an overnight bag and some mail. He
flips on the hall light and stares at himself in a mirror.

                       BARRIS (V.O.)
             I had changed. I could see it in my
             eyes. Something dark.

Barris notices a fleck on the side of his nose.    It's dried
blood. He distractedly rubs at it.

EXT. FIELD - DAY

Renda's contorted face in close-up as he is shot.   Blood
spurting. Echoey church bells chime.

                       RENDA
             No me mates. Yo tengo tres bebes.

                                                             39.



INT. APARTMENT - EVENING

Barris puts down his bag, pulls the Spanish-English
dictionary from his pocket, and tries to translate what Renda
said. It takes him a while but he does.

                    BARRIS
          "Don't kill me. I am three babies." I
          am three babies? What the fuck does that
          mean?
              (studies dictionary)
          Oh. "I have three babies." Oh, God.

Barris drops to the floor and throws up into a trash can.
Out of the corner of his eye, he catches a movement in the
living room. He lurches backwards, knocks over the can.
Vomit spills onto the carpet.

                    PENNY (O.C.)
              (groggily)
          Chuck, is that you throwing up?

In the dim light from the hallway, Barris spots Penny lying
on the couch. She is dressed as a hippy. A backpack and a
duffel lie on the floor next to her.

                    BARRIS
          Jesus Christ, Penny. You scared the shit
          out of me. What are you doing here?

                    PENNY
          Sorry. I just been crashing here for a
          few days. Waiting for you. Where you
          been, man, where you been?

                     BARRIS
          Mexico.   Just on a little vaca...

                    PENNY
          You drank the water, didn't you?

                     BARRIS
          Yeah.

                    PENNY
          You're not supposed to. Montessori's
          Revenge. You're not even allowed to open
          your mouth or your eyes when you take a
          shower. It's crazy. How come our water
          is so good and their water is poison?
          It's the same ocean.

           I don't know.

                     PENNY
           It's weird, huh?
               (beat, then proudly)
           So I'm a hippy now. Look.

Penny stands in the dimness to show off her outfit.

                     PENNY (CONT'D)
           I've been in San Francisco, and it's
           amazing. Everybody loves everybody and
           there's lots of colors. We're gonna
           change the world, Chuck. Come back with
           me and be my old man, okay? Not that
           old! Ha ha ha.

                     BARRIS
           Penny, I'm a little tired now, so...

                      PENNY
           Oh!   You gotta hear this song!

Penny shrieks excitedly as she runs to the record player.
She turns it on, plugs in a strobe light. "Sunshine Superman"
starts up. Penny sings and dances along, directing the
lyrics at Barris. Barris looks around at his strobing
apartment. He sees Penny's mess: pot paraphenalia, anti-war
posters, a gold dove painted on the wall with a phone number
underneath.

                     PENNY (CONT'D)
               (singing)
           "Cause I made my mind up, you're going to
           be mine..."

                     BARRIS
           Penny, what did you do to my wall?

                     PENNY
               (looking)
           Oh, it's a guy who called a couple a days
           ago. Gold-Bird. Isn't it pretty?

                     BARRIS
           Leonard Goldberg?! You're kidding?
               (dials phone anxiously)
           Hello, this is Chuck Barris returning for
           Leonard Goldberg.

Pause.   Barris paces.   Penny sings and dances in background.

                       GOLDBERG (PHONE VOICE)
          Hi, Chuck!

                    BARRIS
          Mr. Goldberg! I'm so sorry I didn't get
          back to you right away. I was out of
          town. Vacationing in Mexico.

                    GOLDBERG
          Good for you. Listen, Chuck. We've
          ended up with a damn hole in our daytime
          schedule. I've been reviewing some
          options, and it occurred to me there
          might be a place here for you and your
          baby.

                    BARRIS
          My baby, Mr. Goldberg?

                    GOLDBERG
          The Dating Game.
              (joshingly)
          That is your baby, isn't it, Chuck?

                    BARRIS
          Yes sir, it is.

                    GOLDBERG
          Are you still interested?

                     BARRIS
          Yes sir.   Very interested.    Sir.

                    GOLDBERG
          Good man. We'll need to start airing in
          about six weeks. Is that do-able for you
          and your people?

                       BARRIS
          My people?     Six weeks?   Sure.   Yes sir.

                     GOLDBERG
          Great.   Keep me posted.

Dial tone. Barris sits there, phone in hand, then throws up
again into the trash can. Penny stops dancing, watches.

                    PENNY
          Damn Mexicans and their water.

                                                         42.



INT. DATING GAME SET - DAY

An episode of the show is being taped.   Barris paces
nervously behind the camera.

                    BLONDE BACHELORETTE
          Bachelor number two, what would I like
          most about you?

                    BEANPOLE BACHELOR
          I am very romantic and I would send you
          flowers every day.

The studio audience "awwws."

                    BLONDE BACHELORETTE
          Aww. That's sweet. Bachelor number
          three, what would I like most about you?

                    FRIZZY-HAIRED BACHELOR
          My big cock.

The bachelorette makes a mock-horrified expression as the
studio audience erupts in laughter. Barris buries his face
in his hands.

INT. DATING GAME SET - DAY

A brunette bachelorette asks a question.

                    BRUNETTE BACHELORETTE
          Bachelor number one, what nationality are
          you?

                    HANDSOME BACHELOR
          Well, my father is Welsh and my mother is
          Hungarian, so I guess that makes me Well-
          Hung.

The audience goes wild.   Barris pulls at his hair.

INT. DATING GAME SET - DAY

A black bachelorette asks a question.

                    BLACK BACHELORETTE
          Bachelor number three, I play the
          trombone. If I blew you, what would you
          sound like?

The audience screams with delight.

                                                             43.



INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY

Leonard Goldberg, a bunch of network executives, and Barris
sit around a conference table and watch a tv. On it is The
Dating Game. A black bachelor is responding to the trombone
question.   He simulates the receiving of a blow job, moaning
and writhing in his seat as the studio audience howls.
Barris has his head in his hands. Goldberg signals an
assistant, who switches off the television. The executives
look quite grim.

                     GOLDBERG
          Chuck, quite frankly these episodes are
          unairable.

                    BARRIS
          Look, Len, the show's spontaneous, it's
          unscripted. That's it's charm. I can't
          control what people say.

                    EXECUTIVE
          Be that as it may, Mr. Barris, we can't
          have black men getting blow jobs on
          national television!

                    GOLDBERG
          The point isn't that he's black, Hank.

                     EXECUTIVE
              (beat)
          Well, I know that. That's not what I
          meant.

                    BARRIS
          Look, Len, nobody is indifferent to these
          shows. Right? And that's good. Show
          business must avoid indifference at all
          costs.

                    EXECUTIVE
          Even when taste is involved?

                    BARRIS
          Taste is just a word.

                    EXECUTIVE
          You don't fuck with taste, my friend!

                    BARRIS
              (uncomprehending)
          What does that even mean?   I don't even
          under --

CONTINUED:


                    GOLDBERG
          Chuck, we cannot air this stuff. That's
          it. If you can't figure out how to
          retain your spontaneity without the
          contestants being lewd, we're going to
          have to pull the show.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

Barris is drunk and brooding. He picks a fight with a big
man who has unintentionally knocked into him at the bar.
Barris is brutal and effective, utilizing the techniques he
learned from one of the scary instructors at training camp.
This gives him an idea.

INT. DATING GAME SET - DAY

The contestants are onstage.   Barris appears, warm and
charming.

                    BARRIS
          Hi, folks. Before we begin taping today,
          I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Peter
          Jenks of the Federal Communications
          Commission.

The severe training camp instructor joins Barris onstage.

                    INSTRUCTOR #1
              (increasingly psychotic)
          Thank you, Mr. Barris. I don't know if
          any of you are aware of this, but it's a
          federal offense to make licentious
          remarks on a network television
          broadcoast. The penalty for this
          disgusting, un-American behavior is one
          year in prison or a ten thousand dollar
          fine or both. Anyone making a sick,
          subversive remark tonight will be
          arrested immediately. I will then
          personally escort the offender to federal
          prison for booking under edict number 364
          of the Broadcast Act of 1963. And it's a
          long drive to that prison. Just you and
          me. No other witnesses --

                    BARRIS
              (jumping in)
          Any questions?

There are none. The contestants are paralyzed with fear.
Jenks is red-faced, trembling.


                                                    (CONTINUED)

          Okay.   Have fun, everybody!'

EXT. TERRACE - DAY

The actual Barris being interviewed.

                    ACTUAL BARRIS
          Sometimes as a younger man I stretched
          the truth to get what I wanted. "Through
          all the lying days of my youth/I swayed
          my leaves and flowers in the sun;/Now I
          may whither into the truth." Yeats. You
          heard of him?

                     INTERVIEWER (O.C.)
          Yeah.   Of course.

                     ACTUAL BARRIS
          Sure you have.
              (beat)
          Anyway, my little lie worked. We aired
          and become a big hit. A phenomenon,
          really.

INT. BARRIS'S OFFICE, BARRIS PRODUCTIONS - DAY

SUBTITLE: BARRIS PRODUCTIONS, LOS ANGELES, 1967

This is the sixties and the office is crazily appointed.
Street signs, funny posters, faux Tiffany lamps, mobiles,
lava lamps, an inflatable sex doll, etc. Barris, 36, is
behind his desk, feet up and on the phone. He wears a t-
shirt and jeans and loafers. This is a new Barris, confident
and successful and hip and relaxed and slovenly. Outside in
the bullpen area we hear the hustle and bustle, laughing and
screaming of a busy but casual office.

                    BARRIS
              (into phone)
          Terrific, Rod! Yeah, I'll get back to
          you on Monday. Great. Thanks. Bye.

Barris hangs up the phone. His jovial facade disappears.   He
opens up his ice bucket. It's empty.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
              (yelling)
          Ice! Ice! Ice! Ice! Ice!

Loretta, Barris's pretty young secretary, enters with a new
bucket of ice. She is braless and shoeless.

                    LORETTA
          Jesus, Barris, take a Darvon.

Loretta drops the bucket of ice on his desk. Barris grabs
her arm, pulls her toward him, kisses her on the back of the
neck.

                       BARRIS
          Hey, baby.

Loretta acts annoyed, but it's playful.

                       LORETTA
          Asshole.

                      BARRIS
          I know.    Sit. Talk to me.

Loretta sighs and drops into a bean bag chair. Barris puts
some ice in a glass and pours himself a scotch.

                    LORETTA
          I'm busy. We're in the middle of a
          bachelorette crisis out there.

                    BARRIS
          I just got a call from the network.
          Drink?

                    LORETTA
          You got any weed?

                       BARRIS
          I wish.

                    LORETTA
          Then I'll have a drink.   Bad news?

Barris pours a drink for Loretta. She gets up, takes it off
the desk and falls back down into the bean bag.

                    BARRIS
          The Tammy Grimes Show is being pulled
          from Saturday night.

                     LORETTA
              (mock concern)
          Oh my God!
              (drily)
          So?

                    BARRIS
          They want to put a prime-time version of
          the Dating Game on in its place.

                   LORETTA
          Shit! You're kidding!     That's fucking
          great!

                    BARRIS
          But they say the day-time version's not
          hot enough. They want me to make it more
          exciting for night-time. I got forty-
          eight hours.

                    LORETTA
          What do you have so far?

                    BARRIS
          Nothing. Bupkis. I mean, the show is
          what it is. I don't have a clue. This
          could be my big break, Loretta.

                    LORETTA
          Yeah, I know. Don't blow it.

Loretta smiles at him, downs her drink, gets up and pads out
of the office. Barris watches her ass.

                    BARRIS
          Thank you for your help.

                    LORETTA
              (not looking back)
          Hey, I brought the ice.

She is out the door.   Barris picks up his guitar and noodles
on it.

INT. DATING GAME SET - LATER

Barris paces on the darkened set. He is trying to think. A
shadowy figure appears at the top of the bleachers and creeps
down the aisle. Barris is deep in thought and doesn't hear.
The man appears behind Barris and locks his arm around
Barris's neck. Barris is startled, choking and flailing
trying to remove the arm. He can't. Finally the man
releases Barris and tweaks his crotch. Barris turns wildly
around. It is Jim Byrd.

                    BYRD
          Boy, didn't I teach you anything?



                                                     (CONTINUED)

                    BARRIS
          You son of a bitch!

Barris swings at Byrd.   Byrd easily blocks the punch.

                    BYRD
          You're so rusty, it's embarrassing.

                    BARRIS
          You're a stupid fucking turd, you know
          that?

                    BYRD
          Can I buy you lunch?

INT. MARTONI'S - DAY

Jim is downing his bourbon and signals the waitress for
another. Barris, still pissed, sips a martini.

                    BYRD
          Ah, lighten up, hombre.

                    BARRIS
          My fucking neck hurts.    Okay?

                    BYRD
          Poor baby. Look, I've been put in charge
          of a fairly large wet operation and I
          could use your help.

                    BARRIS
          Have you noticed, Jim, I've got a tv show
          on the air? I don't need to kill people
          for hire anymore.

                    BYRD
          I know you don't need to.    But you'd like
          to.

                    BARRIS
          That's insane.

Byrd shrugs, unconvinced.    He sips his drink.

                    BYRD
          Think of it as a hobby. An avocation.
          Something you do to relax. You can be an
          assassination enthusiast, a murder bug.

             I've got important things to think about
             here. I don't have time to fuck around
             with you.

                       BYRD
             Okay, I'll help you out with your little
             show. Tit for tat. That's the kinda guy
             I am. I've seen this Dating Game of
             yours, Chuck. And I have a thought.

                       BARRIS
             What, now you're a television producer?

                    BYRD
          Hey, I'm CIA operative John Q. Public
          when it comes to tv and that should make
          my opinion of interest to you.

                       BARRIS
             Let's hear it then.

                    BYRD
          Well, what do you have now? The couple
          gets sent to some stupid second-rate
          Hollywood shitcan restaurant, right?
          Sets you back fifty bucks? That's not
          too exciting a prize to us vicarious-
          living boobs out in TV-land.

                    BARRIS
          Yeah, what's your point?

                    BYRD
          Up the stakes, Chuckles. Send 'em to
          some exotic locale. Europe, Southeast
          Asia, for example.

                    BARRIS
          The network's not going to let me send
          two unmarried kids on vacation together.

                    BYRD
              (shrugs)
          Send 'em with a chaperone. Some
          respectable old lady with a sewn closed
          snatch.

                    BARRIS
              (considering)
          Y'know, that's not half bad.

                    BYRD
          I'm telling ya. And... And sometimes you
          can be the chaperone, Chuckie. Let's say
          we have a job for you in Austria. You, a
          successful tv producer, above suspicion,
          chaperones the young couple, and while
          you're there, blam! you take care of some
          Company business. It's the perfect
          cover. TV producer by day, CIA operative
          by night.

                    BARRIS
          I told you, I don't have to kill people
          for money anymore.

                    BYRD
          Chuck, when I said you fit our profile,
          very little of that had to do with you
          needing the money. Some of it, but very
          little. You liked it with Renda, Chuck.
          I saw it in your eyes. You liked it but
          you botched it. Don't you want to get
          really good at something, Chuck?

Barris stares at Byrd.

INT. BOOTH (DATING GAME SHOW) - DAY

The director calls the shots. Barris stands in the back
watching the show in progress. On the stage is a pretty
blonde bachelorette in a short black dress and three
bachelors. Bachelors two and three are attractive and
stylishly dressed and groomed. Bachelor one is a fat, not-
too-bright looking guy in a yellow-ochre leisure suit. His
slow, unfocused delivery contrasts with the fast, sharp
chatter in the booth.

                    DIRECTOR
              (rapidly)
          Ready one, take one. Ready three, take
          three. Ready one, take one.

                    BLONDE BACHELORETTE
          Number one, can you please tell me what a
          girl is like who hasn't been on a date
          before and how you can tell she hasn't
          been on a date before?

                    DIRECTOR
          Ready two, take two.   This guy has never
          been on a date.

Everyone in the booth laughs.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                      BARRIS
            Jesus, she's gotta pick this guy.   This
            is just too good.

                      FAT BACHELOR
            ... I'll ask her what she likes to do and
            --

                      DIRECTOR
            Ready one, take one.   Ready two, take
            two.

                      FAT BACHELOR
            And if she doesn't know what she likes to
            do --

                      DIRECTOR
            Ready three, take three. The only date
            he's ever had is with his right hand.

Guys in booth laugh, except Barris.

                      FAT BACHELOR
            ... then I'll know she hasn't done it
            yet.

EXT. PICCADILLY CIRCUS - DAY

SUBTITLE:    LONDON, 1967

It's all mod and colorful. Chuck Barris shuffles along,
taking in the sights with the Dating Game couple. The blonde
bachelorette did indeed pick the fat guy. But it's clear she
thinks she made a mistake and pays him no attention
whatsoever, walking about twenty feet in front of him and
Barris. Barris seems bored.

INT. PUB - DAY

Barris enters the pub alone. He's dressed in a blonde wig
and moustache and glasses. It's crowded and he searches the
room for someone. He spots a pretty young woman by herself
at a table. She wears white go-go boots.

                      BARRIS
            Excuse me, is this seat taken?

                      WOMAN
            By you.

Barris sits across from the woman.

                    BARRIS
          London is wonderful this time of year,
          isn't it.

                          WOMAN
          Yes it is.

                     BARRIS
              (beat)
          Oh. Sorry.

Barris gets up, glances around, spots another pretty young
woman in white go-go boots, sitting by herself. He
approaches her.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          Excuse me, is this seat taken?

                          PATRICIA
             By you.

Barris sits.

                       BARRIS
             London is wonderful this time of year,
             isn't it?

                       PATRICIA
             Especially the fog. It affords one
             solitude, even in a city full of people.

                          BARRIS
             I'm Chuck.

                       PATRICIA
             Yes, I gathered.

                       BARRIS
             And you are?

                       PATRICIA
                 (smiles)
             Here you go, Chuck.

She hands him a manila envelope, and stands to leave.

                    BARRIS
          At least give me a made-up name.
          Something for me to cry out during those
          dark nights of the soul.

                     PATRICIA
          Very good, Chuck. I'm pleasantly
          surprised. You're not like the other
          murderers.

She smiles and leaves. Barris watches after her, then opens
the envelope and pulls out a black and white photo of a man.

EXT. WESTMINISTER ABBEY - DAY

It's raining. A bored Barris, dressed normally, waits with
the fat bachelor under an umbrella near the entrance. The
fat bachelor checks his watch.

                    FAT BACHELOR
          I thinks he's really pretty and I want to
          be her boyfriend.

EXT. CHURCH COURTYARD - NIGHT

Barris, in wig and moustache, stands in the middle of the
empty, dark courtyard.

                    ENGLISHMAN
              (loud whisper)
          Here.

Barris approaches.

                    BARRIS
          Do you have it?

                    ENGLISHMAN
          Do you have it?

                       BARRIS
          Sorry.     Yeah.

Barris reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out an
envelope. The Englishman takes it, opens it, pulls out a wad
of cash and counts.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          Don't worry, we're not gonna cheat you.

                    ENGLISHMAN
          Just the same.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


The Englishman finishes counting the money, pockets it, and
hands Barris a box of Polaroid film.

                       BARRIS
          Thank you.     Oh, one more thing.

Barris pulls out his automatic with attached silencer and
jams it into the Englishman's mouth. The silencer breaks the
man's front teeth. The man makes a muffled grunt.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          Sorry about your teeth.

The Englishman's eyes are wide with terror. Barris pulls the
trigger three times. The back of the Englishman's head
explodes. Blood and hair and brain are spattered against the
church wall. The Englishman slumps to the ground. Barris
reaches into the man's jacket, pulls out the envelope of
money, pockets it, and makes his way toward the churchyard
gate. There stands the fat bachelor, watching, confused.
After the initial shock, Barris smiles warmly.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          It's Ronnie, isn't it?

The fat bachelor nods.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          C'mere, Ronnie. I want to show you
          something neat. It's okay.

The fat bachelor enters the courtyard.

EXT. TERRACE - DAY

                    ACTUAL BARRIS
          I felt bad about Ronnie. But really I
          did that ugly, fat, stupid kid a favor.
          He was ugly and fat and stupid. More
          life wouldn't have changed that for him.
          No woman would ever have loved him.
          That's just the brutal truth, y'know?

INT. LONDON HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Barris enters the room, shaky and scared.

INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Barris rips open the Polaroid box, pulls out the foil paper
that protects the film, rips that open and pulls out a small
white plastic vial. Barris greases the vial with Vaseline
and sticks it up his ass.

CONTINUED:

He looks at himself in the mirror, naked and pathetic. There
is a knock at the door. He stiffens, grabs his gun and pads
out of the bathroom.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Barris peeks out the peephole.   We see a fish-eye view of
Patricia Watson.

                     BARRIS
          Olivia?

          It's Patricia, actually.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER

Barris and Patricia sit sipping champagne.   Both are drunk.

                    PATRICIA
          ... and so then I spent a year in
          Operation Chaos, inside the anti-war
          movement as an agent provocateur, nudging
          it toward violence in order to discred
          it. That was fun. I got to wear granny
          glasses.

                    BARRIS
          Sounds fun. So tell me, Patricia, why'd
          you come up here tonight?

                    PATRICIA
          I don't know. You're sort of cute in a
          homely way. And it's always lonely when
          that civilian you're fucking calls out
          the name off your fake passport.

                    BARRIS
          "All the information I have about myself
          is from forged documents."

                     PATRICIA
          Nabokov.

Barris is thrilled and kisses her. It begins to turn hot and
heavy. Suddenly Barris pulls away.

                    BARRIS
          Actually, I just gotta go into the
          bathroom and take care of something.

          No, baby.    Leave the microfilm in.

EXT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY

A plane lands.

INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT TERMINAL, CUSTOMS - DAY

Barris waits sweatily in line with a small a carry-on
suitcase. When the line moves, he walks as if perhaps he has
something up his ass. A customs agent walks past the line
with a dog. The dog sniffs Barris's ass in passing.

EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

Barris steps out of the terminal. A black limo pulls up.
The back door opens and Barris gets in.

INT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS

Seated in the back are Jim Byrd and Simon Oliver, 50. Oliver
is pure ivy league with a pipe. When he speaks it is with an
affected British accent. Byrd is pissy.

                    BYRD
          Hey, buddy. This is Simon Oliver.

                      BARRIS
          Hey.

                    BYRD
          Everything go okay?    You don't look too
          good.

                    OLIVER
          Mr. Barris, do not ever again jeopardize
          one of my missions by killing a game show
          contestant. Is that understood?

                    BARRIS
          You're welcome, pal.

                    OLIVER
          Do I make myself clear?

                      BARRIS
          Fuck you!    They're my contestants.

                      OLIVER
          Amateur.

          Chuck --

                    OLIVER
          Lovely. Tell me, Mr. Barris, are you in
          possession of my microfilm?

                    BARRIS
          Yeah, I got it.

                    OLIVER
          Let's have it then.

                    BARRIS
          It's up my ass, Oliver. Why don't you
          reach on up there and get it.

Oliver tamps his pipe.   Byrd stares down at his thumbs.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          I just feel I deserve some appreciation
          for my efforts.

                    OLIVER
          What do you think Patricia Watson was?

Barris looks at Byrd.    Byrd almost imperceptibly shakes his
head "no."

                      BARRIS
          Prick.

INT. BARRIS PRODUCTIONS - DAY

Barris, now in t-shirt and jeans, shuffles through the busy
bullpen area. Employees wave, say "hi", give Barris the
peace sign. He returns the gestures, but halfheartedly. He
seems depressed. Loretta sidles up beside him.

                    LORETTA
          Well, if isn't the hitman.

                    BARRIS
              (turning, wild-eyed)
          What?

                      OFFICE WORKERS
          Hitman!    Hitman! Hitman!   Hitman!

                    LORETTA
          I said, well, if it isn't the hitman.
          Just heard through the grapevine that ABC
          is going to pick up The Newlywed Game.

                    BARRIS
          You're kidding me.

                    LORETTA
          Not kidding you. Day-time and prime-
          time.

                    BARRIS
          Oh, fuck, Loretta.     That's sensational!

Barris kisses Loretta.

                      OFFICE WORKERS
          Hitman!    Hitman! Hitman!

Barris joins them chanting "Hitman" and dances around the
office.

EXT. TERRACE - DAY

                    ACTUAL BARRIS
          The Newlywed Game was based on my theory
          that almost any American would sell out
          their spouse for a washer-drier or a
          lawnmower you can ride on. Such was my
          respect for that most holy of unions. I
          must've been on to something, because the
          show aired for thirteen years.

EXT. MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE - DAY

Barris speeds through the curvy streets of the Hollywood
Hills. Penny Pacino, dressed as a hippy, sits in the front
passenger seat.

SUBTITLE: HOLLYWOOD HILLS, 1969

                    PENNY
          Great wheels, man.

                    BARRIS
          Yeah, I decided to start treating myself
          right. You spend so much time denying
          yourself things. Life's too short.

                    PENNY
          Yeah, I really gork what you're saying,
          man.

          Oh.
              (beat)
          Really?

The car screeches to a halt in front of a fancy house with a
"For Sale, Open House" sign out front.

INT. FANCY HOUSE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

The house is empty. Barris and Penny are greeted at the door
by a real estate agent.

                    PENNY
              (looking around)
          Outa sight! Buy this one.

                    REAL ESTATE AGENT
          Hi. Welcome, folks. If you wouldn't
          mind signing-in on our sheet over th --

          I'll take it.

                       REAL ESTATE AGENT
          I'm sorry?

                    BARRIS
          I'll take the house.

                       PENNY
          Yay!

Penny happily kisses Barris.

                     REAL ESTATE AGENT
              (beat)
          Very good, sir.

INT. EMPTY LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Barris and Penny are having sex on the floor.

                    PENNY
          So, man, are you seeing anyone?

                    BARRIS
          Nobody serious. You?

          Aw, Pen, don't start --

                    PENNY
          No, listen, it makes sense. You and I
          feel exactly the same about marriage,
          right? How much bullshit it is, right?
          And the odds of us finding someone else
          with the exact same view on it are small.
          So, it makes sense.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Barris, 50, types away. He is sweaty and naked except for a
towel draped over his head.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          I liked Penny. I even loved her in my
          way. But the idea of tying myself down
          for the rest of my life... I remember my
          parents' marriage.

INT. CHILDHOOD KITCHEN - NIGHT

Barris, five, sits at the dinner table with his parents. His
father, dressed in a dental smock, stares down at his plate
as he eats. His mother absently chews and stares vacantly
into space.

                    MOTHER
          We need a new ice box.

The father shrugs.

INT. DATING GAME SET - DAY

The set, which holds four couples, divides in the middle to
reveal a new refrigerator.

                    ANNOUNCER
          A brand new Amana refrigerator-freezer
          with automatic ice maker!

One of the couples is cheering and screaming hysterically,
happy and in love and kissing. The other couples look
disappointed and angry at their spouses.

We pull back to reveal we're watching this on a tv in:

                                                              61.



INT. BARRIS'S OFFICE - MORNING

The office is filled to capacity with with hippy-like
employees watching The Newlywed Game. Many sit on the floor,
jammed up against each other. A few women are nursing
infants. Someone passes a joint. Barris sits behind his
desk, with a "Make Love Not War" helmet on his head, his feet
up, and a guitar in his lap.

                    BARRIS
          Beautiful. Did you see that? How much
          they loved each other just then? That's
          what it's all about, kiddies.

Everyone agrees.   Someone switches off the tv.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          Okay, guys, new business. We're winning
          our slots every week.

Everyone cheers.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          But that means we need you Bandits to get
          on the contestant mill. Our supply of
          dumbfucks is lagging behind our demand
          for dumbfucks. And I'm gonna be
          introducing three new shows in the coming
          months: The Parent Game, The Game Game,
          and the Dollar Ninety-Eight Beauty
          Pageant, so we're gonna really need you
          guys to carry your weight. Nuff said.
          Any other business?

                    EMPLOYEE #1
          Yeah. Rick took four slices of pizza at
          lunch yesterday. Everyone else only got
          two.

                      BARRIS
          Oooh.    Is that true, Rick?    Where are
          you?

                      RICK
          Here.    No, it's not true.

                    BARRIS
          Any other witnesses to this alleged
          infraction?

                      EMPLOYEE #2
          I saw it.    He took four.    I only got one.

          Limits" featuring the musical stylings of
          the CBP Stompers.

Everyone cheers.

          Aw, Chuck.

                    BARRIS
          Get up here, you rascule, you.

Rick heads up to Barris's desk. Everyone laughs. A few
employees have joined Barris at his desk with instruments.
They break into a raucous banjo version of "Out of Limits."
Rick dances. Everyone's laughing and clapping.

MONTAGE

As "Out of Limits" continues, now the actual version, we see
montage of Barris shooting, stabbing, and garroting various
foreign-looking people in strange, murky locations intercut
with Barris having sex with Patricia Watson in different
bedrooms and motel rooms, Barris dancing with Patricia in
various exotic locales, and Barris on the set for his many
game shows, happily directing the bustling activity.

INT. RANCH-STYLE LIVING ROOM - DAY

The actual Jim Lange, host of The Dating Game.

                    JIM LANGE
          Sometimes Chuck would just disappear for
          weeks. I remember once we had a conflict
          on the set over the right way to throw
          that kiss at the end of the show,
          y'know...
              (demonstrates kiss)
          ... and Chuck was just not reachable to
          resolve it.

          What was the conflict?

          Look, it's water under the bridge.     I'm

INT. BARRIS'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The previously bare room is now filled with lovely and
expensive furnishings. But Barris and Penny are again on the
floor, now playing Scrabble by candlelight. Penny lays down
some tiles: I-N-T-E-R-P-E-T

                    BARRIS
          The word's interpret.

                        PENNY
          Interpet.

                        BARRIS
          Interpret.

                    PENNY
          Well, do you have an extra "r" then I
          could borrow?

                    BARRIS
          I'm not going to give you a letter.
          You're lucky I don't make you forfeit a
          turn.

                        PENNY
          Oh.   Okay.

Penny retrieves her letters and studies the board. Barris
empties the wine into Penny's glass. There wasn't much left.

                    BARRIS
          I'll run to the store and get some more.

                        PENNY
          All right.

                    BARRIS
          Don't cheat.

                    PENNY
          You neither.

EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

Barris pulls up in a Jaguar XKE convertible. A pretty,
innocent-looking young woman, Monica, is emerging with a big
laundry bag from the laundromat next to the liquor store.
She glances, momentarily, at the Jaguar and at Barris.

                                                              64.



INT. BARRIS'S LIVING ROOM - A BIT LATER

Barris enters with a bottle of wine.   Penny is in the same
position on the floor.

                    PENNY
          Intrepet's a word, right?

                      BARRIS
          Intrepid.

                    PENNY
          Shit fuck piss.

          Okay okay okay...

                    BARRIS
          Pen, we should call it a night.     I'm
          kinda tired.

                    PENNY
          You're tired.

                    BARRIS
          I got a date.

                    PENNY
          Since when?

                    BARRIS
          I just met this girl.

          Yeah.    Kinda.

                    PENNY
          Well, that's rude.

                      BARRIS
          Sorry.

                    PENNY
          Yeah, well, see ya...

Penny picks up her bag and exits in a huff.

INT. MONICA'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

It's a young woman's apartment, small and girly.    The
doorbell rings.

Monica, clearly not out of her teens, enters the room and
answers the door. Barris stands there with the bottle of
wine.

                    MONICA

          Wow, this is a beautiful place you got!

Barris enters, looks around. There's another teenage girl in
pajamas in the kitchenette, mixing tuna salad.

          Chuck, this is Mindy, one of my
          roommates.

                    BARRIS
          Hi.

                    MONICA
          Have a seat.

Barris sits on the couch. Monica sits next to him. Mindy is
in the background, futzing around in the kitchen area.

                    MONICA (CONT'D)
          So... have you accepted the Lord Jesus
          Christ as your savior, Chuck?

                     BARRIS
              (beat)
          Yes, I have.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MONICA'S LIVING ROOM - A BIT LATER

Barris, Monica, and Mindy sit on the couch watching a
religious show on television.

                                                           66.



EXT. TERRACE - DAY

                     ACTUAL BARRIS
          Yeah, I remember that religious girl,
          sure. Monica Something. Fleming. Oh
          God, she had the softest, fleeciest clam
          I ever experienced. It took a little
          more work than usual, but I got in there,
          baby.
              (smacks lips, then stares off
                into space)
          It was some clam. Oh Lordy. You get
          old, y'know, but the taste for soft clam,
          it just doesn't go away. This is the
          great tragedy of getting old.

INT. BARRIS PRODUCTIONS - DAY

The room is abuzz with activity. Lots of people on the phone
talking. A potential Newlywed Game couple being interviewed.
Monica sits in the waiting area, eavesdrops on the interview
with the Newlywed Couple.

                     WOMAN
          Getting married to Alan is the best thing
          I've ever done. It's just so wonderful
          knowing that you've got someone by your
          side through everything for he rest of
          your life.

The couple kisses.

                       LORETTA
          'kay, Mon.     He's off.

Monica enters the office.

INT. BARRIS'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Monica enters.   Barris wears a deerstalker cap.

                    BARRIS
          My sweet little clamato.

Monica leans down and kisses Barris.

                    MONICA
          I'm pregnant.

Barris's eye twitches.

              (crying)
          I can't be pregnant, Chuck.

                    BARRIS
          Is it mine?

Monica looks at him incredulously, flings an ashtray at him,
misses. She sits at the desk, looks glumly out the window.

                    MONICA
          I can't believe you asked me that.

                     BARRIS
          I know. I'm sorry.
              (beat)
          But you're sure, right?

                    MONICA
          I hate you so much right now.

                    BARRIS
          Look, we'll take care of it.

                      MONICA
          How?    Are you gonna marry me?

                    BARRIS
              (carefully)
          Well, no. Not at this point.

                    MONICA
          I'm not murdering my baby!
              (weeping)
          I can't... do that. Please...

Barris sighs.    He touches Monica's hand.

INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

Barris and Monica sit in first class. Barris stares out the
window. Monica stares straight ahead.

                    BARRIS
          Beautiful country, isn't it?

EXT. MEXICAN ALLEY - DAY

Barris leads a crying Monica down the garbage-strewn alley.
They find a doorway. Barris opens it.

                    BARRIS
          Here we are.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

Barris supports her and leads her into the office.

                       BARRIS
          It's okay.     It'll be okay.

EXT. SCULPTURE GARDEN, UCLA - DAY

Barris and Penny walk sadly through the garden.

                    PENNY
          What a waste.

                    BARRIS
          Tell me about it. I figure over the
          years I must've spent close to twenty
          grand on these abortions: airfare,
          hotels, doctors, gifts.

                    PENNY
          That's not what I meant.

                    BARRIS
          And I don't even know how many of these
          fetuses were mine. That's what really
          kills me.

          Uh-uh. I just needed someone to pay for
          it. He was a wallet with legs.

          Yeah, I was just a kid.   It ruined my

EXT. TERRACE - DAY

                    ACTUAL BARRIS
          I don't really want to talk about this.

We hold on a silent Barris.

EXT. SCULPTURE GARDEN - DAY

Barris and Penny walk in silence.

                    PENNY
          So I'm assuming this means Monica is out
          of the picture.

                    BARRIS
          Yeah, I got baptized for nothing.

                    PENNY
          Chuck, I was thinking... I have this
          plan now, now that you're free --

                    BARRIS
          God, you look cute today.

                    PENNY
          I always look cute. Don't distract me.
          What was I going to say?

                    BARRIS
          I don't know.

                    PENNY
          You do know.
              (enthusiastically charged)
          Chuck, why don't we get married? We've
          known each other forever. We've fucked
          each other forever. You think I'm cute,
          you just said. You always come to me
          when you're in trouble. And you're
          almost forty, Chuck.

Barris turns violently toward Penny.

                    BARRIS
              (shouting)
          I know how old I almost am! That's it.
          Don't ever ask me to marry you again!

                    PENNY
              (quietly)
          I won't.

INT. BARRIS'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Barris and Penny are having sex. It is gentle and quiet.
Penny is crying, trying to conceal it. Barris notices.

                    BARRIS
          I'm sorry I yelled at you today, Pen.

                    PENNY
          I'm not crying because you yelled at me.
          This is it, isn't it? This is us.

Barris studies Penny's face in the dim light.

EXT. TERRACE - DAY

The actual Barris puffs on his cigar.

                       ACTUAL BARRIS
             I almost asked Penny to marry me right
             then. But I didn't.

INT. SEEDY HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Barris sits naked on the bed, swigging from a bottle of
vodka, as a prostitute in a black dress and veil sings "Happy
Birthday" to him. When she's done, she lifts the veil, looks
confused.

                    PROSTITUTE
          Is that right?

INT. BARRIS'S OFFICE - DAY

Barris sits staring out the window. His mood is somber. On
the table beside him are many birthday cards. The anarchic
and youthful decor of the office seems to mock Barris now.
Loretta enters.

                       LORETTA
          Chuck?

Flexner enters.    He's a suit.

                      FLEXNER
          Chuck!    Great to see you.

                    BARRIS
          What's up, Rod?

                    FLEXNER
          Well, the thing is, Chuck, some of your
          shows aren't doing too well in the old
          ratings war. The Family Game, for one.

                       BARRIS
          Okay.

We move into Barris's eyes.

INT. FAMILY GAME SET

The show is in progress. Suddenly shots are fired from
offstage. The host and contestants are slaughtered. It's
bloody and violent.

INT. BARRIS'S OFFICE - DAY

We're on Barris's eyes.

                    FLEXNER
          And How's Your Mother-in-Law is, quite

INT. HOW'S YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW SET

A mother-in-law is being garotted with piano wire.   Her neck
is sliced. Blood spurts.

                                                             72.

The contestants on the set are all bloody and dead. An
applause light flashes on and off, but the audience members
are also dead.

INT. BARRIS'S OFFICE - DAY

                    FLEXNER
          So I've been put in the unfortunate
          position of having to inform you that the
          network is canceling all four of these
          shows. Now don't shoot me, Chuck, I'm
          just the messenger.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

Barris drinks alone.   He's sullen and sauced.

                    BARRIS
              (to bartender)
          They killed my babies. Just like that.
          I pushed them into the world through the
          birth canal of my imagination. Lovingly.
          Tenderly. Where's the humanity of these
          people?

                    BARTENDER
          The fucking bastards.

              (screaming)
          Fuck you!

The large man stands to face Barris. He is very large.
Barris stands. The man swings at Barris. Barris easily
deflects the punch, grabs the man's forearm and breaks it
with a sickening crack. The man screams. Barris gets him in
a chokehold from behind. The man whimpers and gags.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          Let's see, if I remember correctly, the
          next move breaks your neck, which kills
          you instantly or paralyzes you.
          Depending on your luck.

The large man hurries from the bar. Everyone in the bar,
including the large man's date, watches Barris.

          needs. But this is our house!

          This is not our house, it's my house.

                    PENNY
          It's our house! I found it with you. I
          decorated it for you! I spent six months
          sitting on that fucking couch she's
          fucking you on, fucking waiting for the
          fucking plumbers to come! God, you are
          such an asshole!

Penny throws the house key at Barris. It hits him in the
forehead. Then she turns and storms from the house. Barris
looks over at the woman. She looks confused.

                    WOMAN
          I should go. This doesn't feel right.

The woman stands, grabs her purse, pulls out an 8x10 glossy
of herself and hands it to Barris, then exits. Barris stares
at the photo for a moment, then opens a drawer and puts on
top of a pile of similar photos.

EXT. PENNY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Barris pulls up, gets out of his car, and heads toward the
building.

INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Barris walks down the hall, carrying a bouquet of flowers.
He arrives at Penny's door. There is an envelope attached to
it with Barris's name on it. He opens the envelope and reads
the letter.

         Dear Chuck,
         I'm dead now. I hope you're happy.
         The door's open.
                            Love always,

Barris hurriedly opens the door, enters the apartment looks
around, finds Penny face down on the floor, surrounded by
empty champagne bottles and vials of pills. He stares at her
body for a moment, feeling faint. He drops to his knees.

Barris and Penny sit in a booth. Penny has black coffee in
front of her. She is pale and drawn.

             Why were you with that girl in our living
             room?

             That's your defense?   You know what it
             feels like to see you with someone else?
             In any living room.

                    BARRIS
          You know who I am, Penny.    I don't force

          You don't force me?   Fuck. So you're

          way or the other?

                    BARRIS
          No, I'm not saying that.

                    PENNY
          Well, then, what are you saying, Chuck?
          Do you want me around or not? Do you
          even like me?

                    BARRIS
          Of course I like you.

                       PENNY
          How much?

                       BARRIS
          What?

                    PENNY
          I need to know how much you like me.

              (beat)
          I don't even know what that means, "how
          much?" How can I rate a person in that
          way? That's ridiculous.

                    PENNY
          You could if you felt it. If you felt
          it, it would be easy to rate me. You
          could spread your arms as wide as they
          would go and say, "This much, Penny."

                    BARRIS
          Everything's complicated, Pen.    Nothing's
          black and white like that.

                    PENNY
          Do you want me around or not? If you
          don't, just say so, so I know. Okay?

Barris and Penny look at each other.    She starts to cry.

                    BARRIS
          I love you, Pen, in my way. Maybe not in
          that crazy, head-over-heels thing, but
          what is that, anyway? Romantic love.
          Isn't that just an illusion?

                     PENNY
              (beat)
          But you just said you love me, right?

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT

A non-descript American car is parked on the quiet wooded
street. Barris pulls up in his Jaguar. He gets out of the
car, looks in the window of the empty American car.

                    BYRD (O.S.)
          Over here, Strawberry-dick.

Barris looks over and makes out Byrd sitting on a rock with a
view of L.A. spread out in front of him. Barris joins him.

                    BARRIS
          Jesus, how do you know these things?

                    BYRD
          We even know what she actually thought it
          tasted like.

CONTINUED:


                    BARRIS
          Really? I could never find that out.
          What did she think?

                    BYRD
          It's a "need to know", my friend.   So
          tell me, what can I do you for?

                    BARRIS
          I could really use an assignment, Jim.
          To straighten my head.

                    BYRD
          I got something for your head.

INT. DATING GAME SET

A Dating Game couple waits anxiously for host Jim Lange to
announce their destination.

                    JIM LANGE
          ... and we're the sending the two of you
          for three days and three nights to
          beautiful... West Berlin!

The couple screams excitedly by reflect, but as the
destination sinks in, their perplexity becomes apparent.

EXT. WEST BERLIN STREET - DAY

Barris and the Dating Game couple walk along. It's cold and
gray and they all wear heavy coats. The couple wear cameras
around their necks. Nobody looks happy.

INT. BEER HALL - NIGHT

Barris sits in the corner of this noisy, smoky place. He has
a stein of beer and reads a paper as a group of drunken
Germans in the background sing a song. Patricia Watson
approaches and sits. Barris looks up and smiles.

                       BARRIS
          Treesh.

                    PATRICIA
          Leibchen.
              (kisses him, sits)
          So, here's what we got.   Name's Hans
          Colbert.
              (pulls out photos)
          Other side of the wall.   We don't like
          him very much.

                    BARRIS

          Bye-bye, Colbert, bye-bye.

                    PATRICIA
          You'll work with a kraut named Keeler.
          He's been trailing Colbert for a month
          now. Knows the routine. Keeler's a
          drunk, so you stay sober and take charge.

                    BARRIS
              (collecting photos)
          Done and done. See you after?

                    PATRICIA
          Prove how much you love me, baby.   Kill
          for me. Then I'm all yours.

INT. TUNNEL - DAY

Barris crawls through a long dirt tunnel. Telephone cables
run along the floor. An occasional bare bulb lights the way.

INT. APARTMENT BATHROOM - DAY

A middle-aged man stands in his underwear at a mirror and
shaves. The stall shower pushes away from the wall revealing
a hole. Barris steps through it, covered in dust. He nods at
the shaving man. He nods back, hands Barris a gun and a
change of clothes, and continues shaving.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

Barris exits the apartment building in the clean clothes. We
see the East Berlin side of the wall in the background. A
car pulls up and Barris gets in.

INT. CAR, RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

Barris sits in the parked car with Keeler, a heavyset, silent
German man with nicotine stained fingers and teeth. He is
constantly smoking and writing in a tiny notebook. There is
a long silence.

                    BARRIS
          What you writing, Sig?

                    KEELER
          I am keeping track of all the goings on
          on this street.

Barris looks out the window. There is nothing going on, yet
Keeler keeps writing. More silence.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                            79.
CONTINUED:


                    BARRIS
          Hey, Keeler, a bird just flew by.

                     KEELER
          Yah.   I know how to do my job.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

INT. PARKED CAR - NIGHT

Barris and Keeler are still in the car. Keeler continues to
smoke and write. A well-rested, happy-looking Colbert walks
by with a group of people.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

INT. PARKED CAR - AFTERNOON

Barris looks even more sickly. Colbert rides by happily on a
tandem bike with a lovely woman on the back. Keeler
continues to smoke and write.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

INT. PARKED CAR - EVENING

Barris and Keeler wait in the car. Colbert emerges from his
house, alone, and walks toward the car. A drained Barris
sighs a sigh of relief, then suddenly and with unexpected
force, Keeler swings open the passenger door. The door hits
a stunned Colbert and sends him flying. Keeler races around
the car, grabs Colbert, throws him into the back seat, and
jumps on top of him. Barris watches, surprised at the
dramatic personality shift in Keeler. Keeler is strangling
Colbert. A cigarettes is dangling casually from his lips as
he does this. Keeler turns Colbert over so he's facing him,
so he can watch him die.

                    KEELER
              (calmly to Barris)
          Under the seat, please.

Barris reaches under the seat, pulls out a Polaroid camera.

                    KEELER (CONT'D)
          Please, if you don't mind, a photograph.
          To remember.

Barris is stunned, scared. He takes the photo. The flash
illuminates the bulging-eyed Colbert and the calm Keeler.

                                                             80.



INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

Barris types.   A knock at the door.   He looks up, panicked.

                     BARRIS
              (falsetto)
          Who is it?

                    HOUSEKEEPER (O.S.)
          Housekeeping, Mr. Barris.

Barris looks around. The place is a disaster. Food
wrappers, crumpled papers, liquor bottles, strewn clothing,
plastic army men set up for battle. He gets up, puts on a
hotel bathrobe and his hat, grabs his gun, checks the
peephole for a long moment, and answers the door. The
housekeeper is plump and kind-looking.

                    BARRIS
          Good morning, Mrs. Reynolds.

                    HOUSEKEEPER
              (looking around)
          Another rough night, huh?

                    BARRIS
              (tapping his head)
          The human psyche is a wondrous thing.

                    HOUSEKEEPER
              (smiling maternally)
          Yes, I know it is.
              (taking gun)
          We don't need this now, do we?    Why don't
          we just put this away?

She puts the gun in a drawer, starts to pick up.   Barris
watches her, then:

                    BARRIS
          Mrs. Reynolds, may I rest my head on your
          bosom for a little while?

                    HOUSEKEEPER
          Oh, that doesn't really seem like a very
          good idea, Mr. Barris.

                    BARRIS
          I'm sorry. You're right. I just... I'm
          just without... comfort of any sort, and
          I... please forgive me.



                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                81.
CONTINUED:


                    HOUSEKEEPER
              (smiles at him)
          No harm done.

Barris smacks himself in the head.

                    BARRIS
              (bowing)
          Thank you. Thank you.      Thank you.   You
          are a scholar and...

                    HOUSEKEEPER
          It's fine, sir.

                    BARRIS
          Mrs. Reynolds, what do you suppose God
          thinks of someone like me?

                      HOUSEKEEPER
          God?

                      BARRIS
          Yes, God.

                    HOUSEKEEPER
          Well, Mr. Barris, your television shows
          have brought laughter and joy to millions
          of people. That's a very important
          thing, I think, in these difficult times.
          I would imagine God likes you very much.

Barris smiles a rubber-band smile.

                    BARRIS
          Thank you, that's very kind.
              (glances at her ample bosom)
          So... I should get back to...

                    HOUSEKEEPER
          Yes, of course, sir. Don't mind me.

Barris resumes typing.   The housekeeper cleans.

EXT. EAST BERLIN STREET - EARLY MORNING

A hollow-eyed Barris approaches the building that conceals
the tunnel entrance. Suddenly there's a commotion on the
quiet street. The shaving man is being led handcuffed out of
the building by two trench-coated men. They shove him into a
car. Barris continues to walk by, betraying no interest. He
glances casually into the entranceway of the apartment
building. Another trenchcoated man waits inside the shadows.


                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                      82.
CONTINUED:

The car drives away. Barris stops at the end of the block,
stares at the imposing wall.

                    BARRIS
          I'm really, really fucked.

Another car pulls up next to him. Picard, a        serious-looking
Frenchman, sticks his head out the window.

                         PICARD
          Get in.

                         BARRIS
          What?       Who the hell are you?

                        PICARD
          No time.      Get in or die.

Barris hesitates, gets in.        The car screeches off.

INT. PICARD'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Picard drives fast. Barris eyes him suspiciously, fingers
his gun. Picard spots a Fiat in his rearview mirror.

                    PICARD
          Merde. KGB. They know who you are,
          Monsieur Barris. It is their intention
          to kill you very much in East Berlin.

Barris checks in the passenger side mirror.

                        BARRIS
             Merde!   MERDE!
                    PICARD
          Not to worry, my friend.

Picard speeds up dramatically, but continues to drive calmly.
Barris is agitated.

                    PICARD (CONT'D)
          I am Paul Picard, by the way. Nice to
          meet you. Do not worry, I am not KGB.            I
          do not want to kill you, I want you to
          live a long happy life and have many
          dancing grandchildren to admire.

Picard screeches around a corner, then another one.            He's
lost the Fiat, for the moment.

                                                             83.



EXT. QUIET EAST BERLIN STREET - EARLY MORNING

Picard's car stops at the curb. Picard and Barris emerge.
Picard opens the trunk. He lifts out a big folded-up clump
of rubber with a an engine mounted on it.

                    BARRIS
          What the hell is that?

                    PICARD
          Your ride, Monsieur Barris.

Picard unfolds the rubber mass. He pulls a cord and it
begins to inflate. It is an airplane, a one person
inflatable plane.

                    BARRIS
          No fucking way.

                    PICARD
          It's quite reliable and easy to operate.
          It will get you over the wall. Or you
          can stay here. In the German Democratic
          Republic. I will arrange for you to get
          a good factory job. No, you must fly,
          like Daedalus before you, to the freedom
          of the west.

                     BARRIS
          Christ.   What about you?

                    PICARD
          They do not catch me, monsieur. This is
          my talent, to get away always. In
          guerre. In amour. This is my talent,
          and perhaps this is my curse.

EXT. BERLIN WALL - DAY

The fully-inflated rubber plane flies down the street,
dipping and rising erratically. The noise is deafening.
Barris lies on his stomach and steers, looking petrified.    He
approaches the wall and manages to get the plane over it.
The plane is shot by a soldier. Air hisses out.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

Barris sits on a park bench.   Jim Byrd approaches, sits.

                    BYRD
              (chuckling)
          So, did you have a nice flight?

CONTINUED:


                       BARRIS
             Fuck you, Jim. It was terrifying.

                       BYRD
             Seems the KGB knew exactly what you were
             up to. You were there to kill Colbert,
             they were there to kill you. I'm
             thinking we got a mole. So much hate in
             the world, Chuck.

                       BARRIS
             Am I in danger still?

                       BYRD
             Jesus, yes. KGB didn't go out of
             business since yesterday, so far as I
             know. You're fucked, Chuck. But our main
             concern should be: if they know who you
             are, they know who I am.

                          BARRIS
             Fuck off.     What do we do?

                       BYRD
             Bow out. Lay low. That's what I'm gonna
             do. You're lucky you have another career
             to immerse yourself in.

INT. REHEARSAL HALL - DAY

Barris sits with a several network executive and some other
staff members watching a fat man tap dance badly and, because
of his weight, extremely loudly. It's painful for everybody
to watch. The fat man finishes.

                          BARRIS
             Thank you.     Thanks.   That was great.

The fat smiles and exits.       Barris puts his head in his hands.

                       EXECUTIVE WOMAN
             I don't know, Chuck. It's looking bleak.

                       BARRIS
             There's gotta be somebody in America with
             some talent. Ted Mack got bookings every
             week.

The executives look at each other.

                       BARRIS (CONT'D)
             Bring in the next thing.

CONTINUED:


An assistant opens the door and a middle-aged woman in pale
blue polyester pants and Joan Crawford painted on eyebrows
enters with a guitar. She begins to sing a folk song, very
sincerely, in a very off-key monotone. It's unbearable and
depressing. Barris glances over at the executive; she's
checking her watch again. The song is endless.    Barris's
eyes grow cloudy.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. FIELD - DAY

This is the same field where Renda was shot. Now, the
folksinging woman is in the field singing. Barris pulls out
a gun and aims it at the woman. Her eyes widen in terror,
but she keeps singing. A church bell chimes and Barris
shoots her. She flies back, spurting blood. Her guitar hits
the ground with a twang.

INT. REHEARSAL HALL - DAY

Barris snaps out of his fantasy with renewed energy      The
folksinger is still droning on.

                    BARRIS
              (ushering out)
          Thank you. Thank you. We'll be in
          touch. That was wonderful.

Barris closes the door behind the folksinger and turns to the
executives.

                        BARRIS (CONT'D)
             We've been going about this all wrong.
             Rather than killing ourselves trying to
             find good acts, we just book bad ones and
             kill them.

                    EXECUTIVE #2
          Chuck, it's torture to sit through even
          one of these people --

                    BARRIS
          We kill 'em before they're through. As
          soon as it gets unbearable, we kill 'em.
          Dead.

                       EXECUTIVE WOMAN
             For God's sake, what are you talking
             about?




                                                     (CONTINUED)

                    BARRIS
          Celebrity judges ring a bell to end the
          act... to kill 'em. And when you kill
          something, it stops. This I know to be
          true.

INT. GONG SHOW SET - DAY

Barris and some suits watch from the booth as an octogenarian
woman on stage sings "Born Free" in an impossibly high voice.
Jamie Farr gongs the woman. The woman is angry. A vacuous
host with great hair appears next to the woman. He seems
genuinely agitated.

                       HOST
             Why'd you do that, Jamie? This is
             someone's grandmother. She was really
             trying.

                       JAMIE FARR
             This is The Gong Show, not the Van
             Cliburn eliminations.

                       HOST
             This is a human being with aspirations.
                    BARRIS
              (muttering)
          Oh, fuck me. This guy sucks.     He's
          bringing everyone down.

The executives eye each other.

                    EXECUTIVE WOMAN
          None of the hosts are getting it, Chuck.
          But we have a thought.

                         BARRIS
             What?

                         EXECUTIVE WOMAN
             You host.

All the executives smile at Barris.

                    EXECUTIVE WOMAN (CONT'D)
          You get it. And we believe your awkward,
          non-professional, mumbling persona is
          exactly right for the show.

                       BARRIS
             I don't want to be on tv.


                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                             87.

                    EXECUTIVE WOMAN
          Listen, we can't sit through anymore of
          these test shows. Do it, Chuck, or we
          advise the network to pull it.

INT. BARRIS PRODUCTIONS - NIGHT

Barris switches on the lights, walks through the empty
bullpen area to his office, unlocks the door, enters.

INT. BARRIS'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Barris enters, stares out the window, looks at himself in a
full-length mirror.

                    BARRIS
              (stiff)
          Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to The Gong
          Show! I'm your host, Chuck Barris!
              (turns away in disgust)
          Ucchhh.

Barris sits behind his desk, draws a line down a piece of
paper and writes "Pros" and "Cons" at the top of the page.
He thinks. Under "Pros" he writes "Become National
Celebrity", "Get More Attention from Stewardesses", "Even
more women will want to have sex with me". Under "Cons" he
writes: "Easier target for KGB." He gets up, paces.
Suddenly, a shot rings out. It comes through the window and
shatters the mirror.   Barris dives to the floor. More
shots, crazy relentless shooting. Barris crawls on his belly
to the window, carefully reaches up and lowers the venetian
blinds just as another shot whizzes through. The blinds
explode. The shooting stops He waits on the floor, shaking
like a leaf. He pulls the list off his desk and writes under
"Pro": "I need another hit before I die."

INT. GONG SHOW SET - DAY

Center-stage is empty.   The band begins to play.   The studio
audience cheers.

                    ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
          And now, here's the host and star of our
          show, Chuck Barris!

The curtain rises. Barris appears in a tuxedo coat, denim
work shirt, cowboy boots and a hat pulled down over his eyes.

                    BARRIS
          Welcome to The Gong Show. Here's an
          esoteric act if there ever was one.
          Ephemeral. It's an ephemeral act.

                     BARRIS (CONT'D)
           One that should get us our Emmy. Do we
           have an Emmy? We don't? Well this
           should get us one. Anyway, ladies and
           gentlemen... Big Nose!

Big Nose leaps onto stage. He is skinny, wearing a flowered
shirt and a sarong, and playing a toy flute while dancing in
ladies platform shoes. Suddenly he drops his flute, rips off
his sarong, revealing polka-dotted boxer shorts and a yellow
leotard. He rushes to a steamer trunk, opens it, and begins
crazily pulling out endless amounts of old newspapers.

Barris watches from the wings, mesmerized. Big Nose is
gonged. Barris dances out onto stage to join him.

                           BIG NOSE
             Why?   Why?     Why?

                       BARRIS
             I don't know. I don't understand.

Barris glances out into the audience. Something glints. Is
it a gun. He starts to sweat. Jaye P. Morgan is saying
something about Big Nose. But we can't understand it. The
audience laughs. Barris continues to scan the audience.
Someone in headphones signals Barris from behind a camera.

                       BARRIS (CONT'D)
                 (to Big Nose)
             Well, win a few, lose a few.
                 (to audience)
             We'll be back with more stuff... right
             after this message.

Barris waits on his mark for the taping to again begin. He
watches the commotion around him with eagle eyes: technicians
and stagehands running around, the audience chanting "Chuckie
Baby", the celebrity panel joking with each other, the guys
in the booth smoking, the guys in the band laughing. Barris
turns around and around on his mark, trying to catch every
movement, looking for a gun, a suspicious character. The
chanting continues, louder and more distorted. The faces in
the audience turn grotesque. Barris sweats profusely, his
breathing becomes more and more shallow. Suddenly his eyes
roll back in his head and he drops to the stage floor,
unconscious.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

We see Barris in bed, hooked up to machines The executive
woman sits by his bed showing him the headlines.

                    EXECUTIVE WOMAN
          You can't quit.

                    BARRIS
          I can't quit? But I get panicky, Louise,
          in front of all those people.

                    EXECUTIVE WOMAN
          You lack confidence, that's all.

                    BARRIS
          I lack confidence?

                    EXECUTIVE WOMAN
          But we'll take care of that. We'll get
          you some confidence powder. Leave that
          to us.

          Confidence powder?

                    EXECUTIVE WOMAN
          Nose candy, Chuck. Blow. Snow.        Flake.

The curtain rises. A young man with a square of Plexiglass
in his hands, presses his lips against the Plexiglass and
blows. It makes a farting noise and allows to the audience
to see inside his mouth.

INT. WINGS - CONTINUOUS

Barris snorts some cocaine. We hear the act and audience
"booing" and yelling "Gong him!" in the background.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

The actual Jaye P. Morgan is being interviewed.

                    ACTUAL JAYE P. MORGAN
          Chuck was real different on stage and
          off. Very tense. He was always looking
          over his shoulder. Even when we were
          fucking. Sort of an enigma.

INT. GONG SHOW SET - DAY

Barris dances onstage with Gene Gene the Dancing Machine.

INT. SUBURBAN LIVING ROOM - DAY

The actual Gene Gene is being interviewed.

                    GENE GENE
          Oh yeah, a real Jekyll and Hyde.
          Sometimes nice as you please. Give you
          the shirt off his back. Other times he'd
          rant like a crazy man. I remember once
          he screamed at me that I didn't know
          anything about dancing. "Nijinsky," he
          yelled, "now there was a dancer!"

INT. GONG SHOW SET - DAY

A black guy with weird teeth and a speech impediment attempts
stand-up. He looks petrified.

                    BLACK COMEDIAN
          Today I had a bad day today...

The audience yells "How bad was it?"   This throws the
performer. Finally he continues.

                    BLACK COMEDIAN (CONT'D)
          It was so bad, my wife didn't even know
          how to cook.

          That barracuda took an egg, put it in a
          pot of water, and burned the water. We
          had to rush that to the hospital.

The audience boos.

                    BLACK COMEDIAN (CONT'D)
          My mother-in-law...

The booing continues. The comedian can't take it. He looks
disoriented. He turns away from the audience and puts his
head in his hands. Jamie Farr gongs him.

EXT. SWIMMING POOL - DAY

The actual Jamie Farr sits next to the pool. In the
background we see a couple of kids with enormous noses
splashing around in the water.

                    JAMIE FARR
          Chuck used to love to discuss philosophy.
          I think he was very saddened that the
          public saw him as this sort of spastic
          moron. I remember at the time I was
          reading Wittgenstein. And Chuck was just
          thrilled to have someone else in addition
          to Rex Reed to talk about that stuff
          with.

INT. BARRIS'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

Barris lies in bed next to Patricia. It's 12:30 AM. He's
chatting on the phone, lazily twirling the cord. Patricia
reads.

                    BARRIS
          Look, Jamie, you know as well as I that
          language does not exist without an
          outward criteria.

                    JAMIE FARR (TELEPHONE VOICE)
          Certainly.  Wittgenstein said as much in
          Investigations. But if you read Ryle
          carefully --

                    PATRICIA
              (looking at clock)
          Chuck...

                    JAMIE FARR
          Yeah. But consider my thinking on
          elementary propositions. I'm serious.

                     BARRIS
          Will do.   Love ya.

                    JAMIE FARR
          Right back at ya, amigo.

Barris hangs up. Patricia kisses him.       She pulls away.

                    PATRICIA
          I'm concerned about you. I think you
          need to get back into the life. Our sex
          was always amazing after you killed.
          Truth is you're not that great after your
          discussions with Jamie Farr.

The phone rings.

                       PATRICIA (CONT'D)
          Oh, c'mon.

                    BARRIS
              (picks up)
          Jamie, I can't talk anymore tonight --

                     KEELER (O.S.)
               (telephone voice)
          This is Siegfried Keeler.     I need to see
          you.

Barris jerks up, surprised, alarmed.       Patricia watches him.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          Assassins do not fraternize. That Keeler
          was calling me could mean it was my turn
          to get hit.

                    KEELER (O.S.)
              (phone voice)
          I am in town on business, Chuck. And I
          desire nothing more than your company for
          dinner. I consider you one of my closest
          friends.

                    BARRIS
          Sure. Dinner sounds good. There's a
          place called La Scala. See you there at
          eight.

Barris hangs up.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

          Dinner sounds good with whom?

                    BARRIS
          Keeler.

Patricia glances over at Barris.   They stare at each other.

EXT. LA SCALA PARKING LOT - EVENING

Barris pulls into the parking lot. As he waits for the valet
parking attendant to get to him, he adjusts the gun strapped
to his ankle.

INT. LA SCALA - EVENING

Barris enters the crowded restaurant, looks around, spots
Keeler sitting at a table in the rear. As he makes his way
back, Barris shakes hands and says hello to several early
seventies tv celebrities scattered throughout the restaurant:
Carrol O'Connor, Joanne Worley, Flip Wilson, Ron Palillo.
Barris arrives at Keeler's table. Keeler rises and embraces
Chuck. He's already drunk. They sit.

                    KEELER
          A very fancy place.

                    BARRIS
          Only the best for my friend.

                    KEELER
          The friendships one develops during
          wartime are remarkably strong.

                    BARRIS
          Yes.

There is an awkward silence.

                    KEELER
          So how is the business of television?

Barris, pleased to have something to talk about, rambles.

                    BARRIS
          Well, it's hit and miss. I've got a new
          show called "Operation Entertainment"
          which I believe is going to kill. It's
          sort of a Bob Hope visiting the troops
          thing, but it's weekly and...

Keeler is staring right through Barris.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                    KEELER
          Why do you do what you do, Chuck?

                    BARRIS
          Well, I like to think that I bring joy
          and laughter to millions of people. I'm
          not saying that my shows are as good as
          they could be. Yet. But --

                    KEELER
          Why do you kill?

Barris looks around, clears his throat.

                       BARRIS
          Oh.

                    KEELER
          During the second world war, I had the
          pleasure of killing. Yes, pleasure. I
          found it exhilirating. Afterwards, I
          could find nothing else to fill me so
          much with life. So I became what I am
          today. I wanted the exhiliration
          again... of death.

The waiter appears.

                    WAITER
          Are you gentlemen ready to order?

                    KEELER
          I'll have the shrimp scampi and a green
          salad.

                    WAITER
          And for you, sir.

                    KEELER
          Um, Just give me a steak.    Rare.

                       WAITER
          Thank you.

The waiter leaves.    Keeler sips his drink, stares at Barris.

                    KEELER
          "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it

          That's Carlyle!

                       KEELER
          Yes.

                    BARRIS
          It's amazing you should quote him.   He's
          my hero.

                     KEELER
          I read in a book recently that killing
          your first man is like making love to
          your first woman. Every smell, every
          nuance, you remember with a special
          allure, as if the acts had occured
          outside civilization, outside time. And
          when the allure is gone, you are
          condemned.

                       BARRIS
          Condemned?

                    KEELER
          I am condemned to live the rest of my
          life outside civilization. You will be
          too, my good friend.

Barris looks into Keeler's hollow eyes.

EXT. TERRACE - DAY

The actual Barris puffs on his cigar.

                    ACTUAL BARRIS
          The next day I heard Keeler offed
          himself.

EXT. L.A. HOTEL - NIGHT

Keeler falls silently in slow motion from a very high window.

                    ACTUAL BARRIS (V.O.)
          You never really know in the world of
          espionage if something labeled a suicide
          actually is a suicide. But he was dead.
          That I knew.

INT. MARTONI'S - NIGHT

Barris eats dinner with Penny.   Barris seems depressed.
Penny is reserved.

         When you called, I wasn't gonna come.

                   BARRIS
         I'm glad you did, Pen.

                   PENNY
         I said to myself, enough.      Enough of this
         jerk already. Enough.

                    BARRIS
          I could see how you would feel that way.

                    PENNY
          But I've come upon something interesting
          through my delvings into human
          psychology. It's called TA, Transactual
          Analysis.

                       BARRIS
             Transactional Analysis.

                   PENNY
         Now see, by correcting me you're
         responding as "Parent" to my "Child."
             (authoritative voice)
         "Here's the proper way to say this word,
         Penny." But that's okay. As long as we
         both understand that's what you're doing.
         Y'know, I'm okay, you're okay. So what's
         wrong, Chuck? Are you okay?

                       BARRIS
             A guy I knew killed himself last night.

                       PENNY
             My God. Everyone you know kills
             themselves. Or tries. Who is it this
             time?

                       BARRIS
             You don't know him.   A stagehand.

                       PENNY
             Why'd he do it?

                       BARRIS
             He didn't like his work anymore.

                        PENNY
             Is being a stagehand really bad or
             something?

Patricia storms up to the table.

                    PATRICIA
          You were supposed to meet me at The Palm
          two hours ago.

                    BARRIS
          Oh fuck, I forgot.

          Who is this?

          Um, Penny, this is Patricia.
              (to Patricia)
          How did you find me?

                    PATRICIA
          Are you serious? That's what I do for a
          living.

                    PENNY
          Who's Patricia? What does she mean,
          that's what she does for a living?

                    PATRICIA
          You're dead in my book, Strawberry-dick.

          Nice meeting you, Penny. I've heard a
          lot about you.
              (to Barris, walking away)
          Oh, by the by, Byrd's dead.

Patricia exits.   Penny just looks down at the table.

                    PENNY
          And... and okay... I'm only gonna give
          you one more chance, man. That's it.
          Get it?

INT. BARRIS'S ROLLS ROYCE - NIGHT

Barris snorts some coke, pulls out of the studio parking lot.
The sound of his heart beating pounds in his ears. Another
car pulls behind him. A wired Barris notices the car in his
rearview mirror. He turns. The other car turns also.
Barris speeds up. So does the other car. Barris panics; he
tries to lose the other car. A chase ensues. Finally Barris
screeches to a halt, pulls a gun from his glove compartment.
The second car screeches to a halt behind him. Barris
already out of his car and at the driver's side window of the
second car. He looks in and sees there are two petrified
teenagers, a boy and a girl, holding up their hands. Barris
pulls open the door.

                    BARRIS
              (screaming)
          Who sent you?! Who the fuck sent you?!

                    TEENAGE BOY
          Nobody, man. We just waited for you to
          leave after the show. We just think the
          show is cool. We just think you're cool.

The girl is crying.

                    TEENAGE GIRL
          Please don't kill us.

Barris points the gun at them for a long while, his hands
shaking wildly.

INT. GONG SHOW WINGS - DAY

Barris stands backstage waiting for his cue. The Unknown
Comic appears next to him, wearing a paper bag with two
eyeholes cut out over his head. Barris glances over at him.

                    UNKNOWN COMIC
          Hey, Chuck.

Barris doesn't say anything. He studies the bag. Barris
pulls a pistol from an ankle holster, and jams it against the
bag.

                    BARRIS
          Take it off.

                      UNKNOWN COMIC
          Huh?

                    BARRIS
          The fucking bag. Take it off.

Barris stares him down.

Barris dances onto the stage.

INT. GONG SHOW SET - CONTINUOUS

Barris is clapping his hands together.   He looks happy and
relaxed. The audience is cheering.

                    BARRIS
          Here he is, the Prince of Puns, the
          Wizard of Whoopee... The Unknown Comic!

The Unknown Comic appears upstage with bag on head.

          Baby...

          What?   What do you want?

                    UNKNOWN COMIC
          What's the difference between toilet
          paper and a shower curtain?

                    BARRIS
          I don't know.

                    UNKNOWN COMIC
              (calling off)
          Here's the guy!

The audience laughs. Barris feigns annoyance and pushes the
unknown comic off the stage.

                    BARRIS
          Get out of here.

                    UNKNOWN COMIC
              (for Barris's ears only)
          You're fucking crazy, man.

          Of course I do.

                    TUVIA (O.S.)
          I'm in town and I've been following your
          career and I wondered if you might want
          to get a drink. For old times sake.

INT. CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - DAY

Tuvia plays with the dog.    White panties are revealed.

          Not now.

                    GUY
          Just take a second.

The guy gets down on all fours and starts barking and panting
like a dog. It is a repulsive and frightening sight, but
Barris becomes transfixed by it and cannot take his eyes off
the guy.

                       TUVIA (O.C.)
          Chuck?

Barris tears his eyes away from the dog guy to look at Tuvia.
She is an older middle-aged lady. Younger than Chuck, but
clearly of no interest to him. The disappointment on his
face is palpable.

                    TUVIA (CONT'D)

INT. BAR - LATER

Barris sits in a booth across from Tuvia. The relationship
has shifted once again. Now middle-aged Tuvia is trying to
flirt. As they talk, she touches his arm repeatedly. She
laughs at everything he says. She reapplies lipstick as they
talk. There's a quiet desperation in her eyes. Barris is
pleasant but unengaged.

                       BARRIS (V.O.)
             Ah, Tuvia. The fantasy of Tuvia forever
             cast out by the reality of Tuvia.
             Finally, because of my fame and her
             desperate straits, her poverty and single
             parenthood, she was going to submit to
             me. Finally I could've had her.

          The winner is Miss Tiny Brooks!

A model appears with a trophy and a big check and hands it to

midgets dance. The band plays. A massive amount of confetti
and balloons fall on everyone.

INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

It's the Emmy Awards. Barris is in the audience, next to his
starlet date. He sweats through his tuxedo, fidgets. Ed
Asner and Caroll O'Connor are on stage presenting.

                    ED ASNER
          And the winner is Taxi!

The Taxi theme starts as the winners make their way to the

             James L. Brooks, Stan Daniels, and Ed.
             Weinberger, executive producers.

The starlet whispers into Barris's ear, outraged at the
unfairness.

                        STARLET
             I don't see why your shows are never
             nominated.

Barris looks sick.    Jim Brooks is on stage accepting.

                    JAMES L.BROOKS
          And I honor you, members of the academy,
          for recognizing and supporting high
          quality television.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Barris is locked in a stall, vomiting. The door to the
bathroom opens. Someone enters. Barris peeks through the
closed stall door. It's Jim Brooks, whistling and holding
his Emmy. He places it next to the sink, unzips his fly and
pisses. An agitated Barris pulls his gun from his ankle
holster, opens the stall door a crack, and shakily aims the
gun at Brooks' back.

                                                          104.



EXT. TERRACE - DAY

                    ACTUAL BARRIS
          But as I stood there, I realized, I
          couldn't kill Jim Brooks, the man who was
          responsible for such good stuff: Mary
          Tyler Moore, Rhoda, Cindy, Phyllis,
          episodes of My Friend Tony. I loved
          those shows as much as anybody in
          America.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Barris is crying. He turns the gun away from Brooks, almost
against his will, and sticks it in his own mouth. After a
moment, he realizes he can't do that either.

                    ACTUAL BARRIS (V.O.)
          I couldn't kill either of us, so I let us
          both live. Jim Brooks and me. The rest
          is history.

Barris puts the gun away, flushes the toilet and exits the
stall.

                    BARRIS
          Hey, congratulations, Jim.

Brooks turns and looks at Barris.     He smiles.

          Thank you.     I appreciate that.    I really
          do

They smile and nod at each other awkwardly. Chuck waits for
some sort of return of the compliment. It does not come.
They continue to nod at each other.

                                                            105.



INT. OFFICES OF GRACIE FILMS - DAY

The actual Jim Brooks is being interviewed.

                    ACTUAL JIM BROOKS
          I don't really remember ever meeting
          Chuck Barris.

                    INTERVIEWER (O.C.)
          In the men's room at the Emmys, he says.

Brooks thinks, looks at interviewer.

                    ACTUAL JIM BROOKS
          I'm not saying it didn't happen. I'm
          just, y'know... If he remembers it, I'm
          sure it happened. Really doesn't seem
          like much of an anecdote though.

INT. CHATEAU MARMONT BUNGALOW - NIGHT

A big party is in progress. The place is packed. Late
seventies celebrities abound. Alan Alda is there. Burt
Reynolds, Jamie Farr, Jaye P. Morgan, Gene Gene the Dancing
Machine, Pam Dawber, Farrah Fawcett Majors and Lee Majors,
John Belushi. Chuck Barris steps out of the bathroom, drink
in hand. He wipes his nose like someone who's just snorted
coke. He wanders disconsolately and slightly wild-eyed
through the crowd. He sits in a chair. A man sitting across
from him looks at Barris. His eyes light up.

                    PARTY MAN #1
          Hey, you're Chuck Barris!

                    BARRIS
          Yeah.

                    PARTY MAN #1
          I love your show!

                    BARRIS
              (unenthused)
          Great. I'm just heading --

                    PARTY MAN #1
          I have a talent I think you'd really
          appreciate.

                    BARRIS
          Uh-huh.

Party Man #1 begins farting "Jingle Bells."   Barris   gets up
and moves away.

             Hey, didn't you ever hear of Le Petomane?
             He was a star, buddy! These are totally
             smell-free!

Barris settles by the fireplace.      A pretty woman approaches,
smiling.

                       PRETTY WOMAN
             Hi.

                       BARRIS
             Hi.

                       PRETTY WOMAN
             I thought it was you.

                       BARRIS
                 (bowing)
             It's me.

                       PRETTY WOMAN
             I'm glad to meet you because I wanted to
             tell you that I've seen The Gong Show and
             I think you are the most insidious and
             despicable force in entertainment today.

                       BARRIS
             Well --

                       PRETTY WOMAN
             How dare you subject the rest of the
             world to your loathsome view of humanity.

                       BARRIS
             I don't think it's that loathsome.

                       PRETTY WOMAN
             What is it then? To mock some poor,
             lonely people who just crave a little
             attention in their lives. To destroy
             them. So everybody's not brilliantly
             talented. They're still people. They
             deserve respect and compassion. I mean,
             who the hell are you? What the fuck have
             you ever done that elevates you above the
             pathetic masses? Oh, I forgot, you
             created The Dating Game. Wow, right up
             there with the Sistine Chapel. I guess
             that's what gives you the right to...

                    BARRIS
          Excuse me, I've got to --

Barris loses himself in the crowd.    He hurries past a guy who
recognizes and starts chanting.

                    PARTY MAN #2
          Chuckie Baby! Chuckie Baby!     Chuckie
          Baby!

Barris turns and makes his way through the crowd to the door.

EXT. SUNSET BLVD - NIGHT

Barris makes his way down the crowded street. People stare,
turn their heads to gawk. We hear over and over again: "Hey,
isn't that Chuck Barris?" and "Hey, look, The Gong Show
guy!", and "Chuckie baby, Chuckie baby!" Barris smiles wanly
and nods. People shove paper and pen in his face and he
scribbles autographs without stopping. Sweat forms on his
brow. His polyester shirt is drenched.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          She was right. What the hell had I done
          with my life?

Among the fans on the street, Barris spots the fat bachelor
he killed in London. He sports a bullet hole in his head
Barris does a double take.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          Wait, you're that guy. You're dead.
          This is screwy.

                    FAT BACHELOR
          I only want to be loved.

                    BARRIS
          That's all I fucking wanted!

Barris hurries away from the fat bachelor. He begins to spot
others converging on him: the corpses of those he killed,
bloody and disfigured. Crazy, angry-looking gonged Gong Show
contestants appear in the crowd with weapons. KGB agents in
trench coats and sunglasses wield guns, Day of the Dead
skeletons dance after him. Barris breaks into a run.
Suddenly confetti and balloons pour down on him out of the
L.A. night sky. Barris dashes across the street, almost
getting hit by a car. He ducks down an alley to catch his
breath. As he leans against the wall and heaves, a middle-
aged woman appears, somewhat backlit by the street light.

                    MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
          Mr. Barris?

                       BARRIS
          No, I'm...

                    MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
          My name is Louise Wechsler and I'm here
          from Tulsa with my family and...

                    BARRIS
          Please, I'm not feeling well.

                    MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
          Just a moment of your time. I love your
          show. And, well, I, sort of, have a
          talent myself.

                    BARRIS
          You can stop by the office to audition
          tomorrow.

The woman continues to approach.

                    MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
          Well, I'm leaving tomorrow and I was just
          wondering. See, I dance a little and I
          was just wondering --

There's no way out of this.     Barris sighs.

                    BARRIS
          Yeah, all right. Go ahead.

Barris turns to face the woman, who's very close now. She
starts to dance around, sort of ballet-like, very badly.
Barris watches. She pirouettes, arms above her head.

                       BARRIS (CONT'D)
          Very nice.

Something in her hand glints in the light. Barris
reflexively grabs her arm. It's an ice pick. The two
wrestle for it. The woman is extremely strong. Barris jams
the palm of his hand up into the woman's nose. She staggers
back, but doesn't drop the ice pick. Barris leaps at her.
The two roll on the ground. The woman pins Barris. She
straddles him and is about to stab him through the air.
Barris reaches under her skirt and grabs her crotch. The
middle-aged woman is a man. He screams in a distinctly male
voice. Barris takes the moment of distraction to grab the
ice pick and jam it up through the assailant's chin and into
his brain. The assailant slumps over.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

Barris pushes the body off himself, kneels beside it, and
pulls off the wig. He gets up, shaking and heaving. He
looks at the body one more time, kicks it in the head with
all his might.

EXT. TERRACE - DAY

                    ACTUAL BARRIS
          That was it. I just disappeared. The
          network had to put The Gong Show into
          reruns. It was 1981. I holed myself up
          in this hotel in New York. Parker Hotel.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

SUBTITLE: NEW YORK CITY, SPRING 1982

We see Barris from above, shivering and naked in the corner.
The manuscript pages are piled high next to the typewriter.
Barris looks up at the camera with outstretched arms,
appealing to the gods.

                       BARRIS
          Who Am I?

There is a pounding on the wall from a neighbor.

                       NEIGHBOR (O.S.)
          Who cares?     Shut the fuck up!

There's a knock at the door.    Barris crawls toward it, peeks
through the peephole.

                     BARRIS
          Fuck.   Shit. Piss.

Barris unlocks the door.    Simon Oliver stands there.

                       OLIVER
          Barris.

                    BARRIS
          How'd you know where I was?

                    OLIVER
          Chuck, Chuck, Chuck, don't be an
          orangutan. We always know where you are.
          We always know what you're doing. By the
          by, I'd think twice before I'd attempt to
          get that tripe you're writing published.
          And there's a typo on page --

                    BARRIS
          Look, what do you want, Oliver? I don't
          work for you anymore. I have things
          to...

Barris trails off.

                    OLIVER
          I'd like you to come back for one last
          assignment, Chuck.

                       BARRIS
          No.     Now get... Good-bye

                    OLIVER
          I think you might be interested when I
          tell you it's the mole who fingered your
          friends Jim Byrd and Paul Picard... and
          Seigfried Keeler.

                    BARRIS
          Keeler committed suicide.

                    OLIVER
          Yes, of course he did. He threw himself
          from a twentieth floor window after he
          strangled himself to death with an
          electrical cord.

                     BARRIS
              (beat)
          I'm not interested, Oliver.

                       OLIVER
             As long as the mole's alive, you don't
             have a chance in hell of remaining so.
             Besides, killing is in your blood, old
             man. You fit the profile.

Barris lunges at Oliver, pushes him against the wall.

                       BARRIS
             That fucking profile again! What's the
             fuck is it?! What the fuck do you
             bastards know about me, that I don't?!

                        OLIVER
             Indeed.   Where to begin.   First, let go
             of me.

Barris lets go.    Oliver sits in a chair, straightens his
shirt.

                    OLIVER (CONT'D)
          Let's see. Well, you had a twin sister,
          stillborn, strangled by your umbilical
          cord. Your first hit, Chuck. Your
          mother always wanted a daughter. She
          blamed you for your sister's death. And,
          so, until your sister Phoebe was born,
          she raised you as a girl.

                    BARRIS
          That's not true.

                    OLIVER
          Oh, and your father the dentist? Not
          really your father. Your biological
          father was a man named Edmund James
          Windsor. A serial killer. A fact your
          mother didn't know when she had an affair
          with him in 1930. If you want to look
          him up, he was also known as the
          Tarrytown Troll, because he had been
          described by witnesses as short and ugly.
          Windsor died in the electrical chair at
          Ossining in 1939. We believed your self-
          loathing tendencies coupled with that
          extra Y chromosome and whatever else you
          inherited from your father would serve us
          well.

                    BARRIS
          You're lying.

                    OLIVER
          I'm trying to think what more I can tell
          you. I'm sure there's more. But you have
          me at a disadvantage here, Barris. I
          don't have your files in front of me.

                    BARRIS
          Just leave me the hell alone!

                    OLIVER
          Your mother always loved the game shows,
          and you so wanted to please her. We
          never expected the game show business to
          work out for you. But that it did,
          turned out to be in our favor. I guess
          your need to be a good daughter drove you
          more than we anticipated.

Barris lunges at Oliver. The two wrestle on the floor.
Barris punches him repeatedly in the face.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

Barris lies sleeping in a tangle of sheets. There's blood on
his hands. A knock at the door. Barris jumps awake, grabs
his gun. He looks around. The room is a mess, stuff knocked
over. There's been a fight. He sees his bloody hands.
Another knock.

                       BARRIS
          Huh?     What?

                      PENNY (O.S.)
          Chuck?    It's Pen.

Barris brings his gun with him to the door, looks through the
peephole, then opens the door. Penny stands there, takes in
the room, the mess, the haggard Barris.

                       PENNY (CONT'D)
          Oh, Chuck.

                    BARRIS
          Jesus, how'd you find me? Am I listed in
          some guidebook or something?

                    PENNY
          You sent me your last letter on hotel
          stationary.

                    BARRIS
          Oh. Well, it's great to see you, Pen.
          You look beautiful.

Barris hugs her.

                    PENNY
          I don't really. But I appreciate the
          lie. I know how you hate lying.
              (looking around)
          Boy, this place is scary looking.

                    BARRIS
          Yeah.

                    PENNY
          I came to take you back to California
          with me. It's a lonely state without
          you.

                    BARRIS
          I don't know, Redhead.

                    PENNY
          I can't wait forever for you to ask me to
          marry you, you know. Well, apparently I
          can. But I really don't want to. Chuck.

                       BARRIS
          Pen.

                    PENNY
              (crying)
          I love you so much. You don't
          understand. I don't even know why.
          You're such a schmuck.

                    BARRIS
          You don't know the half of it.

                    PENNY
          You're not gonna marry me, are you?

                    BARRIS
          I don't know if I can.

Penny nods her head and leaves.    Barris watches her go, then
falls to the floor and weeps.

INT. UNION OYSTER HOUSE, BOSTON

Barris, dressed in a suit, sits with Patricia Watson.     He
smiles across the table at her.

                       PATRICIA
             I can't believe you finally left your two-
             hundred-dollar-a-night cave to see me.
             I'm honored.

                       BARRIS
             Y'know, I got a visit this morning from
             Penny. She's wanted to marry me forever.
             But she doesn't know who I am, what I've,
             what I'm capable of.

             And she can't ever know. So what does
             she really love? A lie. And I started
             thinking, Treesh, you are the only woman
             in the world who truly knows me. I know
             I've screwed you over in the past, and
             I'm really sorry. I just want you to
             know that you're the one I want to be
             with. I love you, Treesh.

Patricia looks at him. Her hard-as-nails demeanor softens.
She smiles. Barris smiles and reaches across the table for
her hand.

EXT. WHARF - NIGHT

Barris and Patricia stand looking out at the harbor.

                       BARRIS
             I hate myself for how I've lived, Treesh.

                        PATRICIA
             Neitzsche said, "Whoever despises oneself
             still respects oneself as one who
             despises."

                       BARRIS
             I never thought of that. Jesus, I can't
             even despise myself with any insight.

                       PATRICIA
             Insane asylums are filled with people who
             think they're Jesus or Satan. Very few
             have delusions of being the guy down the
             block who works at an insurance company.
             Wonder what that means.

                        BARRIS
             Y'know, I wanted to be a writer once. I
             wanted to write something that someday
             some lesser person would quote. But I
             never did. I'm the lesser person,
             Treesh. I never said anything meaningful
             that wasn't said by somebody else first.
             I am disposable. I disposed of people
             and I am disposable.
                 (beat)
             You look cold.

Barris drapes his jacket over Patricia's shoulders.

                       PATRICIA
             Chuck, what's gotten into you? You're
             actually acting like a gentleman.

CONTINUED:


Barris kisses her.      She lets him.

                       PATRICIA (CONT'D)
             Well, it's late. I should get going.

                       BARRIS
             I suppose you still won't tell me where
             you're staying.

                        PATRICIA
             No.   But I'll show you.

She takes his hand.      They walk off.

INT. PATRICIA'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Patricia enters followed by Barris.       She turns on the light.

                         PATRICIA
             Drink?

                         BARRIS
             Sure.    Bourbon.

Patricia pours some drinks. There are a couple of chairs
near the window. Barris sits in one.

                       PATRICIA
             I've been thinking a lot about you
             lately, Chuck.

                         BARRIS
             Yeah?

Patricia approaches Barris with the drinks, hands him one.

                       PATRICIA
             I've missed you.

                       BARRIS
             You could've fooled me.

                       PATRICIA
             Well, I've mellowed.

Patricia takes Barris by the hand, leads him to the window.

                       PATRICIA (CONT'D)
             Look. Boston's a beautiful city. We
             could start over here. A normal person's
             life. Together. Selling insurance.



                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                116.
CONTINUED:


                    BARRIS
          That sounds right.

Patricia flops down in the chair that Barris had been sitting
in. Barris sits in the chair across from her. Patricia
raises her glass.

                        PATRICIA
          To life.

                        BARRIS
          To life.

Patricia casually slides her hand under the chair cushion.
In one swift move, Barris pulls a gun from his ankle and
shoots Patricia three times, twice in the head, once in the
heart. The force of the bullets has tipped the chair over.
Patricia lies sprawled on the floor.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
              (bitterly)
          L'Chaim.

Barris stands and looks at Patricia's body.      She holds a gun.

INT. QUIET CAFE - MORNING

Simon Oliver sits sipping an espresso. He has a black eye
and bruised face. Barris enters, looking haggard. He sits
and stares at Oliver.

                       BARRIS
             It's done and I'm done.   Agreed?

                        OLIVER
             Agreed.   But if you get antsy... and you
             will.

Oliver smiles and walks off. Barris sits for a moment, then
stands, walks over to a payphone and dials.

                       BARRIS
             Hey, Redhead?

INT. CHAPEL - DAY

Barris and Penny are getting married surrounded by friends in
a small chapel.

                       JUSTICE OF THE PEACE
             We have come here today to join together
             Penny Pacino and Chuck Barris.

Barris looks at Penny. Should he slug this guy?    She gives
him a "be patient" look.

                    JUSTICE OF THE PEACE (CONT'D)
          ... The Game Game, Dream Girl of 1968,

          Leave it to the Women, The Dollar-Ninety-
          Eight Beauty Show, and The Gong Show.
          The Chuck Barris, who I'm sure will be
          back with even more shows to...

EXT. CHAPEL - DAY

Well-wishers, family, fans, photographers, reporters, and
passers-by are lined up on either side of a red carpet that
leads from the chapel to a limousine waiting at the curb.
Barris and Penny emerge from the chapel. Everyone cheers,
photos are snapped, rice and confetti are thrown, as the
happy newlyweds make their way to the limo, Barris spots a
pinky-ringed hand in the crowd holding a gun. Barris pushes
Penny toward the white limo. The driver stands there holding
the door open. Barris shoves Penny in, then screams at the
driver.

                       BARRIS
             Drive, Danny! Now!

Barris jumps in the car, the driver slams the door closed,
hurries around the driver's door and gets in. The car peals
away from the cab.

INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

An ashen Barris looks back at the crowd.    Penny watches him.

                       PENNY
             What's going on?

                       BARRIS
                 (still looking out window)
             Pen, I have something to confess.

Penny's expression shifts, turns slightly stony.   She's
getting ready for something bad.

                       PENNY
             Okay.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                        BARRIS
             Okay.
                 (beat)
             Okay, but what you don't know is that
             I've brutally murdered thirty-three
             people for the CIA.

Penny just stares blankly at Barris, who can't look at her.
Suddenly she starts to laugh. Danny joins in. Eventually so
does Barris.

EXT. TERRACE - DAY

The actual Barris is being interviewed.

                       ACTUAL BARRIS
             Y'know, I came up with a new game show
             idea recently. It's called The Old Game.
             You got three old guys with loaded guns
             on stage They look back at their lives,
             see who they were, what they
             accomplished, how close they came to
             realizing their dreams. The winner is
             the one who doesn't blow his brains out.
             He gets a refrigerator.

The camera holds on Barris's face as he puffs a cigar.

                                                         BLACK.

           So I'm dead...
FADE IN:
EXT. - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT (PRESENT)
Dumpsters overflow with the day's garbage. A pillar of
steam rises from an underground grate. It's the dark
place between buildings that a reasonable person avoids.
We see JAKE VIG, a guy in his late 20's whose fashionable
suit and good looks are in obvious contrast to the
surroundings-- At first glance, you'd think he could run
for Congress some day.  At first glance.
Jake faces a garbage dumpster on his knees, execution
style. His face gives away nothing-- He could be kneeling
in a strawberry field.
                       JAKE (V.O.)
           And I think it's because of this
           redhead...
                       BUTCH (O.S.)
           Know who I am, Jake?
                       JAKE
           The Anti-Christ?
                       BUTCH (O.S.)
           No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the
           Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy
           looking for some answers.
There's the LOUD UNMISTAKABLE "CLICK" of a gun being
cocked. The barrel of a gun slides gently along Jake's
ear and comes to rest at the base of his skull.
The voice and the gun belong to BUTCH (40's). With his
suit and conservative looks, you'd make him out for a
"Steve" or "Roger" more than a "Butch".
                       BUTCH (cont' d)
           Things are probably going to end badly
           for you, Jake.
                       JAKE
           Gee... What makes you say that?
                       BUTCH
           Your life flashing before your eyes?
                       JAKE
           Just the last three weeks.

EXT . - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT
Title: Three Weeks Ago...
The same alley... The door of a building bursts open as
LIONEL DOLBY (late 40's), dressed in a cheap suit, stumbles
out breathing heavy. The dim light of a bare bulb glares
off the sweat on his forehead.
A moment later, Jake emerges from the same door carrying
a large black revolver.
                         JAKE
             I lost my head. I'm... Sorry.    I don't
             know what happened.
                         LIONEL
             Y-y-you fucking shot him!   That's what
             happened!
                        JAKE
             I had to! That motherfucker was about
             to welch! You saw what he was doing,
             right? You heard him!
Lionel starts shaking his head spastically.
                         LIONEL
             I can't be here! You understand?     I
             can' t--
                         JAKE
             Listen to me! It went to shit.     It
             happens sometimes.
In the distance, A POLICE SIREN WAILS, growing louder.
                         LIONEL
             Oh Jesus!
                         JAKE
             LISTEN to me! We don't have much time.
             We can still get through this but you
             have to keep your head and trust me!
Jake takes a tentative step forward.     Lionel sees a BLOOD
STAIN on Jake's shirt and recoils.
The SIREN GROWS LOUDER, Jake turning his head towards it.

                            JAKE
             Help me.
Jake waves Lionel back through the door they came out of.
                                                           CUT TO:
INT. - THE EUCLID BAR
A dive furnished with a few mismatched chairs and a bar.
A single overweight PATRON sits at a corner table with
face buried in his hands as he WHIMPERS. Jake and, Lionel
Dolby pass him as they emerge from a back hallway.
MILES, late 20's, wipes blood off the bar. Placed at the
edge of the bar are two briefcases, both open, both filled
with neat stacks of blood splattered money.
A DEAD GUY lies face down on the floor in a pool of blood.
Jake grabs the Dead Guy's legs as Lionel watches in
disbelief.
                           JAKE
             Come on.    Grab his arms.
Lionel stands frozen.       Jake, drops the dead guy's legs
with a THUD.
                         JAKE
             Lionel... He's dead. Yeah, maybe you
             didn't pull the trigger, but you were
             standing right there and watched me do
             it. Help me. Grab his arms.
The POLICE SIRENS grow LOUDER.
                            MILES
             Tick-tock...
                         JAKE
             If you wanna help, then help.    If not,
             shut up.
                            MILES
             Your mess.
                         JAKE
             Then shut up.
                            MILES
             My place.

Miles lets out a little chuckle; it's just enough to set
Jake off again.
Jake pulls the gun and points it at Miles.
                            MILES
             Oh please...
Miles non-chalantly pulls a sawed off shot gun frown under
the bar.
                         MILES (cont' d)
             You think this kinda shit hasn't happened
             here before? Given it's usually on
             Thursdays. And usually, I gotta tell
             the cops, "No, Officer... I didn't really
             get a good look at the shooters."
             Usually anyway.
                         PATRON
                 (without looking up)
             I didn't see nothing. And I swear if
             you let me go now, I won't say-
                         JAKE
             Relax, porkchop.
The POLICE SIRENS sound like they're right outside.
                         LIONEL
             I can't be here!
Jake cocks his gun, never taking his stare off Miles.
                            JAKE
             Then go.
Lionel looks at the briefcases of bloodied money.
                         LIONEL

                         JAKE
             What about this situation makes you
             think I can answer that question right
             now?
Lionel again looks at the briefcases; then the shotgun
leveled at Jake; then at the direction of the POLICE
SIRENS... He runs for the door without a second thought.

EXT.- THE EUCLID/CITY SIDEWALK- NIGHT
Lionel emerges up the stairs from the basement level bar
to street-level just as a POLICE CAR SCREECHES to a halt
in front of the bar, lights flashing, SIREN WAILING. On
the door is the emblem for the NEW YORK POLICE
DEPARTMENT.
Lionel does his best to look casual as TWO UNIFORMED
OFFICERS jump out of the car and rush the Euclid. One of
the Officers catches Lionel looking over his shoulder.
The last thing Lionel hears before he turns a corner--
                      OFFICER (O.S.)
          Everybody FREEZE!
As soon as he's turned the corner, Lionel breaks into a
full sprint down the street.

INT.- THE EUCLID
OFFICER WALTER SOBOZINSKI, a middle aged cop with a couple
of spare tires, stands by the front door with his gun
drawn, in a dramatic stance.

              (yelling)
          I said, freeze you motherfucking,
          cocksucking, scumbags!
The second middle aged cop, OFFICER RICHARD ROTTOVICH
comes calmly down the stairs behind Sobozinski.
                         ROTTOVICH
          We're clear.
Rottovich closes the door and locks it behind him.
                      SOBOZINSKI
              (still yelling)
          Or I'll blow off every one of your
          fucking heads!
Sobozinski lets out a bellowing LAUGH.
We PAN OVER TO REVEAL Jake, Miles and BIG AL (the Patron)
sitting at the bar by the Dead Guy.
                      JAKE

             Nice.
                         DEAD GUY
             What took so fucking long?
The Dead Guy stirs-- GORDO, late 20's, dressed in a blood
soaked suit stands up; wiping blood off his face.
                         DEAD GUY/GORDO
             I've been lying in this shit like half
             the night.
                         MILES
             You guys were late.   We had to go to a
             Mexican stand-off.
                         JAKE
             And you know I hate guns.
Jake tosses the revolver on the bar.
                         SOBOZINSKI
             We were fighting crime.

             Keeping the city streets safe for drug
             dealers and pedophiles everywhere.
Jake starts taking    the money out of the briefcases. Gordo
strips out of the    jacket and shirt, revealing a THIN WHITE
VEST. A wire runs     from a battery pack on his belt, up
the center of the    vest, ending at a scorched, bloody,
explosive squib.
Gordo drops the vest along with a plastic bag containing
fake blood. A nasty bruise on his chest marks the spot
where the squib was.
                         GORDO
             Shit.
                         JAKE
             I told you, use less powder.
                         GORDO
             But you won't get that splatter effect.
Jake removes the blood stained bills from the top of the
pile.

Big Al moves over to the bar.

             Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to
             play the Inside?
                         JAKE
             Gordo plays the inside.   You're the
             Shill.
                         BIG AL
             Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is
             cry and get insulted.
                         JAKE
             What are you talking about? You should
             get a fucking Academy Award for the
             Shill work you do.
                 (off Al's smile)
             We got it down cold, Al. You don't
             want to jinx it by changing something
             up, do you?
                         BIG AL
             I' m gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want
             eggrolls?
Al slaps Jake on the back and exits.
Jake catches Gordo hawking over his shoulder.
                          JAKE
             What?   I can feel you looking at me.
                         GORDO
             That's a lot of cash. He came up with
             it pretty quick.
                         JAKE
             Probably some investment banker or
             convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did
             you see how fast he ran out of here?
             It's done. He's not coming back.
                         GORDO
             I guess. I gotta drop a dime.    Did
             anybody mess up the hoop?
                           MILES
             It's clean.
Gordo disappears dawn the back hallway.

Sobozinski and Rottovich head for the door with their

             business in town. But what can I say?
             Twenty percent's still better than

             Sorry. I'm just... Look what they did
             to him. Right in the middle of his egg-
             foo-young.
Big Al stares up at them with those bulging, vacant eyes,
his mouth hanging open. Jake reaches down and grabs the
remote control and turns the TV off.
                         JAKE (V.O.)
             Big Al used to send money to his Father,
             some Vietnam Vet slowly losing his mind
             in a VA hospital in Cleveland. Al was
             like that. That's why Al never played
             the Inside.

Gordo enters and takes a seat in the back booth with Jake
and Miles.
                         GORDO
             Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a
             sudden case of drowning last night.
They just pulled him out of the East River.
                         JAKE
             Well, this is just fucking great...

             It gets worse. Now I know     why he was
             such a good rope. X mean,     cash....
             That much and we never had    to put him
             on the "Send?" Turns out     this ducking
             Moe was an accountant for    the King Pin.
Gordo throws Jake a hard look, letting the news sink in.
Jake can only slump back into the booth.
                           MILES
             Who's that?
                         GORDO
             The cash we fleeced off of him was
             collection money. He was supposed to
             take that money and give it to the
             King earlier yesterday like he does
             every Thursday. `Cept this time, he
             figured he could make a little
             something for himself off us and still
             get the King's money back before any
             body says "boo."
                         MILES
             What's a King Pin?
Gordo looks to Jake, but can see that he's still processing
the information.
                         GORDO
             Currently, the King Pin is a very large-
             type pole stuck up our asses.
                           MTLES
             Mob?
                         GORDO
             Independant. Same shit, just
             independant. They call him the King
             Pin because he looks like that guy from
             the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
                          MILES
             So what?   We hide, right?
                         GORDO
                 (shaking his head)
             What are you? New? Let me tell you
             how good this guy is. Last night, Al
             calls this bookie to settle up.
             Apparently he's been ducking him for
             like a month. So the guy asks him where
             he's got all this money all of a sudden,
             right? What does Al do?

             Does he tell him that he cashed in a
             fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell
             him he's been giving head out back for
             twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts
             going on about this job he just pulled
             and how he fleeced some Wall Street
             asshole -type... How HE fleeced.
                         MILES
             You're pissed we didn't get credit?
                         GORDO
             No, that was the only semi-fucking smart
             thing he said! Except anybody that's
             ever met Big A1 knows that the only
             thing he's comfortable doing alone is
             eating. This guys tells this guy, that
             guy tells some other guy, eventually it
             works it's way back to someone who works

Big Al sits on the Lazy Boy, about to take a big bite of
egg foo young. He stops as the front door is kicked open

             Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young.
             The whole thing took about two and a
             half hours. That's how good he is.
                         MILES
             We sure Big Al threw him to us?

             Come on...
All three of them turn their attention out the window.
They watch the bustle of people walking past wondering if
any one of them is looking back.
                         JAKE
             A bird flew into my house last night.
Gordo and Miles exchange a look, unsure of how to

             Leave him. Someone's going to find him
             eventually. Then they'll start looking
             for us, too.
A WAITRESS approaches.

INT.- THE EUCLID- DAY
Jake, Miles and Gordo sit at the bar of the run down
watering hole. Jake stands placing neat stacks of money
into a Fed-Ex box.
                      JAKE (V.O.)
          Gordo fleeced the deed off some idiot
          in a card game. We used it every now
          and then for a rag, but mostly it was
          our office. Our Power Point.
Gordo and Miles start unloading the same neat stacks of
money from their pockets. It's not as much as Jake put
in.

          That's it?

Shaking his head, Jake seals the Fed--Ex box, then hands
the form to Miles and. Picks up the phone.

          Do we want insurance?

          Just mail it to the hospital.

          I know where it is. That will be fine.
          Thank you.
Jake hangs up the phone.

             stabs you or shoots you or causes any
             other form of profuse bleeding, call a
             cab because you are not getting back in
             this car!
Jake nods and approaches the door where Harlin and Lupus
stand vigil. Lupus wears another loud sweatsuit.
                         HARLIN
             We appreciate your punctuality.   Mr.
             King is expecting you.
Jake takes a step towards the door, but is pushed up
against The wall by Lupus who begins to roughly pat Jake
down.
                         HARLIN
             Lupus!
                        LUPUS
             What? You said pat him down, I'm pattin'

Jake steps back and raises his arms.

just big, constructed of circles and topped off with the
baldest head you've ever seen.

             Buddy, that was business. Besides, you
             have more crew. Then there's you...
                         JAKE
             I'll get the money back, plus interest.
             I go on the grift for you. You get a
             cat, I get a cut. And we get square.

The King Pin stands up and moves over to Jake.
                         KING PIN
             I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A
             grifter comes in here with a fifteen
             hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit,
             cooler than an Eskimo in winter and
             tells me he wants to grift for me?
             First thing I have to ask myself is,
             is he playing for me or is he just
             plain playing me? You tried it once.
                         JAKE
             We got caught. So you know it won't
             happen again.
With surprising speed, the King Pin grabs Jake by the
neck.
                         KING PIN
             I know it won't happen because you're
             going to feel like a Prom Queen who
             just got gang fucked by the wrestling

A few pained CHOKES from Jake as his knees buckle.
                         HARLIN
             Mr. Vig arrived with an escort.   NYPD.
The King loosens his grip and let's Jake fall.

             Grifters... Always working  an angle.
             Alright. I can see you got   some vision.

             the who and you give me the  how. Lupus
             go with him.
Lupus snaps to attention.
                          LUPUS

Jake turns to find Lupus and Harlin on either side of
him. They take him by the wrists and hold his hands up
for the King.

             once, Junior. I want you to know how
             much that irks me.
The King begins to gently trace between Jake's fingers
with the nail file.
Jake remains rigid against Lupus and Harlin as the nail
file scrapes along the soft, fleshy webbing between his
fingers.
Jake shuts his eyes... Then opens them to find the King
now gently stroking his hands-- Almost a loving caress.
                         KING PIN
             You have incredibly soft hands. Good
             cuticles . They' re like a baby's hands.
             Grifters with rough hands... You know
             that they're probably not that good.
             Means they've had to do some hard
             labor to make ends meet. But you...
             Smooth... Supple.
The King continues to stroke Jake's hands with his own
meaty paws.

Jake may be aware that he's stopped breathing.

inch more, her lips an eyelash away from his. She
whispers...

             the top of the pile or to the bottom,

             Our guy gets us approved for the start

             transferred to any one person. On the

Another empty bank... A lone TELLER MATERIALIZES behind
the counter.
                         JAKE (V.O.)
             That same day, I show up in the Caymens
             with the proper I.D. and corporate papers
             to make a withdrawal.
Jake MATERIALIZES on the empty bank floor, walking
confidently up to the Teller with a SILVER BRIEFCASE in
hand.
                           MILE5 (V.O.)
             Uh...
                           JAKE (V.O.)
             What?
                         MILE5 (V.O.)
             I'm just thinking out loud here, but...
             Two million in a briefcase?
                           JAKE (V.O.)
             Good point.
Jake approaches the Teller, now wheeling a BLACK SUITCASE
behind him by the handle.
Jake presents the Teller with a series of papers and a
photo I.D.

             It's bank policy not to release this

             So we cash the check at another bank.
             Jake slides the suitcase and the check

a sign marked "Customs."

             Now, this is the most important part--
             You can't just walk into the United
             States with a suitcase full of cash
             without evoking the words "cavity
             search".
As we get closer to the Custom's Desk, a CUSTOMS OFFICER
wearing a white short sleeve shirt and a badge
MATERIALIZES behind it.
                         JAKE (V.O.)
             That's why you need someone on the inside
             at Customs.
Jake approaches and slides the suitcase towards him. The
Officer slides it back to Jake, revealing another envelope
stuffed with cash under it.

             Then we disappear.
As he walks away, WE SEE some PEOPLE MATERIALIZE carrying
luggage... Then a FEW CARS... Then an AIRLINE REP...
Gradually more and more people and cars, each MATERIALIZING

             This might just be me, but that is hands

                         GORDO
             People have tried this before, Jake.
             It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and
             his crew went on vacation in Chicago
             for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched
             in L.A.
                         JAKE
             It never worked before because A, they
             didn't flush the bank enough; B, their
             corporate papers were for shit; C,
             they didn't have someone on the inside
             with Customs.

             this is only the second time I've even

Lupus exits the restroom, heading back towards the booth.

             How's the hoop, superstar?   Clean?

             Is it all fugasi?

             No, the corporate papers have to be
             legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A
             clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get

             What about Customs?
                         JAKE
             I'll worry about Customs.

             later about a smaller cut.
                         JAKE
             Take a deep breath. You sound like you
             just broke up with your boyfriend or
             something.
Jake rolls his eyes as Lily glares at him.
                                                         CUT TO:
INT.- BULLDOG GYM- DAY
Boxers at the bags, a jumping rope, etc...
Jake and Lily stand in front of the King Pin, who's
dressed in shorts and a t-shirt. He wears boxing gloves
and headgear. Lupus and Harlin stand vigil by the
sparring ring.

             I need you to stake me. I can't do it
             without it. It's just a couple hundred
             grand. Taken out of our cut when we're
             done.
King Pin eyes Jake suspiciously for a second.
                         KING PIN
             That's more than you already owe me.
             What happens if you fuck this up?
                         JAKE
             Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

             You just might learn something here.
Lily just shrugs and rolls her eyes.

             Listen, Scooter---
                         JAKE
             No, you listen. We're partners now and

             you, I'm still running the show. That

             And I gotta tell you, for a guy who
             spends all his time in a gym, you
             could be in better shape.
A few of the BOXERS training around stop and turn.          The
King Pin lowers a glare at Jake.
                         KING PIN
             Take off your shirt.
Jake looks behind him to see Harlin looming.
                          JAKE
             Excuse me?
                         KING PIN
             I said take off your fucking shirt.
A few more BOXERS stop and turn. Jake notices he's being
watched. The King Pin takes a step towards Jake...
                          JAKE
             Fine. You want me to take it off, I'll
             take it off.
Jake unbuttons his shirt and stands in front of the King
Pin, arms crossed. It's getting weird.
                         KING PIN
             Look at you, you skinny prick.
                         JAKE
             You're not going to bust out baby oil
             and start rubbing me down or anything,
             are you?
The King smiles and begins to take off his shirt.       Harlin
and Lupus share an uncomfortable glance.
The King strips down to the waist and reveals an incredibly
large, incredibly round stomach which he SLAPS loudly.
                          KING PIN
             Come here.   Feel this.
                          JAKE
             No thanks.   I'm good.
                          KING PIN
             Come here!
The King grabs Jake's hand and puts it on his stomach.
It just got weirder.
Now the whole gym has stopped, everyone focused on Jake
and the King Pin.

             Shut up. Feel that? That's solid
             muscle. Not an ounce of fat. Go ahead.
             Punch it.
                         JAKE
             I am not going--
The King starts to get that look again.
Jake winds up and punches the King in the stomach.           He
shakes his fist in pain.
                           KING PIN
             Come on.    Harder.
                         JAKE
             I think I just broke my hand.
                           KING PIN
             Harder.    Remember, I killed your buddy.
Jake's demeanor changes as he winds up and hits the King
as hard as he can. The King just smiles.
                           KING PIN (cont'd)
             All muscle.
The King then hits Jake back in the gut with surprising
speed. Jake falls to his knees, but the King's right
there. With one arm he pulls Jake up and starts to pummel
him in the stomach with an unbridled visciousness.
Jake spits up blood as the King hurls him face first into
the ring.
                         KING PIN
             Maybe it's true. Maybe you can't cheat
             an honest man. Me? I'm about as
             dishonest as they come and that's the
             truth. But if you even think about
             trying to con me they'll find fucking
             pieces of you in each of the five
             boroughs. Pieces of you, pieces of
             her, pieces of your whole crew. Can't
             be any mare honest than that. I'll
             stake you, but that's three hundred
             fifty you're in the hole and consider
             the juice running. Now go make me proud.
Harlin and Lupus lift Jake up.        Lily looks at Jake with a
pained expression.

Jake watches as she hails a cab. A MAN, also hailing a
cab goes for the same one. Michelle gets into a screaming
match with the man.
FREEZE FRAME ON MICHELLE--- A CGI SIGN appears over her

             Last of the red hot grifters.
Suits grabs Jake with a hug.     It's a heartfelt one.

             Back in the day, Suits made money
             running fight stores and the wire with
             a Fix so tight it was like a legit
             business. I never understood what the
             point was if grifting became like a
             regular job.

                           SUITS
             Not easy   pickin's. Papers like these
             speak to   larger issues. Sorry about
             Alfonse.
                 (off   Jake's nod)
             You into   something big?
                            JAKE
             Pretty much.
                         SUITS
             In over your head?
                            JAKE
             Pretty much.     Suits eyes Lily.
                         SUITS
             Can I speak to you in confidence?
                           JAKE
             Huh?   Oh.   She's alright.
Suits gives Lily another suspicious look.
                         SUITS
             Try and keep up... You ask for      the
             Advantage Goods, then you guys      come in
             looking to be Bean Traps. So I       gotta
             think you're either working the      mace or
             playing the Jug Mob.
                         JAKE
             A little bit of both.
Lily watches in utter confusion.
                         SUITS
             Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so
             I got no problem with the way you help
             yourself, Jake.

             I saw you go up from the Knecker,
             working that Grind, learning the
             Barnard's Law and I thought, "the
             kid's a prodigy.'" But I know that if
             you're using these goods... So then I
             figure, what's worth that? You're
             either looking for a little history or
             a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
                          JAKE
             Can't say.

             Then who's the Banker?
                          JAKE
             The King.
A dead look comes over Suits.
                         SUITS
             The King? Jake, you play the heavy
             rackets like that... They put the lug
             on for nothing at all.
                         JAKE
             I can handle it.
                         SUITS
             I don't doubt your talent. You looking
             for that place in the hall of fame?
                         JAKE
             It's not history.
                         SUITS
             So what do you want?
                         JAKE
             I want to get out from under all this
             for good. And I want to fuck them all
             doing it.
                         SUITS
             Then I gotta say, in my opinion, you
             can't get what you want.
Jake considers those words for a moment.
                          JAKE
             Yes I can.
Suits guages the seriousness in Jake's face and nods.
The he gently rests his hands on the papers.

             Can't do it Suits.      I can't lay down
             for this one.

             Okay. Here's the thing... You fall
             flat, you might not get anything short
             of stiffed. Then it's Blue River Land
             for everybody. Papers like these are
             dangerous because papers tend to
             multiply, then they start to take
             shape. Usually it's the shape of an
             arrow. I hate to do it, but after this,
             I gotta give you the blowoff.
             We Jake, Jake?
Suits holds out his hand.         Jake takes it.
                           JAKE
             We're Jake.
They shake, knowing it'll be the last time.

We follow Lily and Jake out of Suit's office.           Lily can

Jake stops and turns to her, looking her up and down.

INT. - TIFFANY'S - NIGHT
Jake and Lily enter the store. Jake takes a quick moment
to case the place-- A few scattered CUSTOMERS, some being
helped by SALESPEOPLE. All the Customers look like the
uppercrust crowd you'd expect at Tiffany's.
                         JAKE
                 (to himself)
             Oh yeah. This is good. This will do
             nicely.
                 (to Lily)
             This is about confidence. Your
             confidence and their confidence. You
             get their confidence by giving them
             yours.
Jake leaves Lily by the front counter as he starts a slow
turn around the store.
He casually pretends to be browsing as he moves next to
MR. LEWIS, an older, distinguished looking gentleman,
being helped by a SALEGIRL, who is scribbling on an order
form.
                         SALESGIRL
             Let me read this back. One silver
             Cattier watch, engraved-- "To Carolyn,
             the Attorney at Law. Happy Graduation,
             Counselor. Love Mom and Dad."
                         MR. LEWIS
             Right.
                         SALESGIRL
             One bracelet, engraved "To Abby.   Happy
             25th Anniversary, Love Tom."

                         SALESGIRL
             I' ll just go put this in, Mr. Lewis.
The Salesgirl takes the order form and walks away.
A change comes over Jake. It's subtle-- Posture, facial
expressions, a slight tug of an accent-- but it's there.
                          JAKE
             Mr. Lewis?
Mr. Lewis turns and looks at Jake. There's no real hint
of recognition, but Jake's smiling up at him like an old
friend.
                          JAKE
             It is you.   Hello!
Jake extends his hand.
                          MR. LEWIS
             Sorry, I--
                         JAKE
             Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool
             with your daughter. Carolyn. We met
             once or twice.
Mr. Lewis seems to search for second, then extends his
hand more in an effort not to appear rude.
                          MR. LEWIS
             Of course.   Jake. Nice to see you.
                         JAKE
             Well, it certainly is a coincidence.
             Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
                          MR. LEWIS
             Great.   Thank you.
The Salesgirl returns.
                         JAKE
             Excuse me? I believe you're holding
             something far me under Pearson.
                         SALESGIRL
             Do you have a ticket?

             I'm   afraid the ticket was in it. But
             the   name's Pearson.
                         MR. LEWIS
             While you're back there, could you make
             sure that Carolyn is spelled with a
             "y"?
The Salesgirl nods and disappears again.
                         MR. LEWIS (cont'd)
             What brings you down from Boston, Jake?
             Taking advantage of the long weekend?
                         JAKE
             My wife and I are just taking a little
             vacation.
Behind his back, Jake discreetly waves Lily over.
                         MR. LEWTS
             Carolyn's down this weekend too.
Lily approaches. When she does, Jake pulls her close and
gives her a loving kiss on the lips. It throws Lily for
a second.
                         LILY
             Uh... Everything okay?
                         JAKE
             Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn
             Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my
             wife, Lily.
Lily and Mr. Lewis exchange handshakes.
                         JAKE
             I'm sorry, honey.    I'm almost done.
Jake taps Lily on the back with the hand wrapped around
her waist.
                           LILY
             It's okay.    I'll be looking for
             earrings.
Jake gives Lily another kiss before she leaves.
                         MR. LEWIS
             Attractive girl.

             anniversary   this weekend. She thinks
             I'm here to   pick up something for my
             mother, but   it's actually a gift for
             her. Think    I've fooled her?
                         MR. LEWIS

             Very much so.
Jake smiles ear to ear, like the happy newlywed he's
pretending to be. The Salesgirl returns.
                         SALESGIRL
             We have Carolyn with a "y". I'm sorry,
             there's nothing under Pearson. If we
             had an invoice number--
Jake's smile dissolves as he grows a little anxious.
                         JAKE
             I told you. My wallet was stolen.
             Please... Check again.
Jake takes a nervous look over at Lily, who is drying on
earrings with another Salesperson.
                           MR. LEWIS
             Good luck.    Congratulations again.
He and Jake shake hands.

             Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this
             isn't too much of an inconvenience, but
             if Carolyn is coming down for the
             weekend, perhaps I could give you
             something for her? It's a check. We
             split the cost on a few books and I
             haven't had the chance to pay her back
             yet. Could you..?
                           MR. LEWIS
             Sure.
Jake pulls out a checkbook and pen.
                         JAKE
                 (writing)
             That'd be a great help.

Jake quickley scans the jewelry in the glass case.

             A ring for my wife. Alot like that
             one. In fact, it was that one.

             I'm sorry, sir. Thank you very much
             for doing this. And please tell Carolyn
             hello for me.
Jake seems to be lost. Mr. Lewis looks over at Lily, who
gives him a friendly smile, then back to Jake.
                         MR. LEWIS
             Why don't you let me put the ring on
             the card and you can write me a check
             in return?
Unseen to Mr. Lewis, one corner of Jake's lip goes up in
a grin.

Jake and Lily exit the store.     Jake hands Lily the
trademark colored box.
                         JAKE
             Happy anniversary.
Lily takes the box and shakes her head, impressed. Jake
Looks up to see Mr. Lewis watching them as he tries to
hail a cab.
Jake's demeanor quickly changes as he puts on a big smile.
                         JAKE
             Smile. You just got a present from the
             man of your dreams.
Lily puts on a big smile while opening the box.
                         JAKE
             Now we gotta give him a strong finish.

Jake pulls Lily closer and looks into her eyes. She leans
in and they kiss-- A deep, slow kiss that makes people
have to walk around them.
Mr. Lewis sees them and smiles to himself as he gets into
a cab.
Jake and Lily are still kissing as the cab pulls away.
Lily finally breaks the kiss--- Slowly.

             He's gone.

once before disappearing around a corner.

             Kylie over at the Bureau. Tell him I
             got something that might interest him.
             A guy they call the King Pin. I think
             there may be a corruption case brewing
             here, too... That's right. So even if

             if you took the time to light three
             cigarettes with one match, some Nazi
             would be able to figure out where you
             were. Then, well... It was the last
             cigarette you and your two buddies ever
             had. So three on a match is bad luck.

             Well, typically, corporate loans are
             relatively simple matters, but you do
             need to demonstrate a capacity for gross
             fund recovery.
Lily arches an eyebrow at Ashby.
                         LILY
             Don't tell me you started a tech firm
             here before us.
                          ASHBY
             No, no.   Nothing like that.   I work in
             a bank.
                          LILY
                  (leaning in)
             Really? Wish we had met eight hours
             ago.
Ashby nods and shyly looks away. He could be blushing.
Lily lets the moment play out for a beat before looking
over her shoulder.
                         LILY
                 (getting up)
             My partners are here.
Ashby reverts back to schlub mode.

             Oh.   Well, thanks for the drink.
                         LILY
             You're welcome. I was just going to
             ask you if you'd like to join us. Ashby
             brightens again.

INT.- THE BULL AND THE BEAR PUB/TABLE- LATER
Ashby sits with the crew, a few empty glasses in front of
him. He looks remarkably relaxed, just another guy hanging
around with a group of friends.
                         JAKE (V.O.)
             She got one leg out from under him.
             Now we had to lean.

                      GORDO
          So then Miles walks straight into the
          Creative Director's office and says
          "The code's fine, the program's for
          shit" and throws down like a thousand
          pages of code on the guy's desk!
They all break out into LAUGHTER.
                      JAKE
          So this is our boss, right? He chases
          me and Miles out of his office and
          he's yelling and screaming, "You're
          fired! Your whole team's fired!" He
          starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo--
                      MILES
          But the best part was that he couldn't
          find Gordo! He was in the bathroom.
          So he finally goes in there, kicks in a
          stall door and starts yelling! And
          there's Gordo, pants at the ankles,
          holding a PC World Magazine!
More LAUGHS.
                      GORDO
          I haven't been able to use a public
          bathroom since.
                      LUPUS
          Especially with the thing!
Lupus's non-sequitur brings the whole rhythm of the
conversation to a grinding halt.
                      JAKE
          Uh, right... And that was it. That's
          when we decided to start our own
          business. No more shithead bosses.
                      ASHSY
          I envy you guys. Taking a chance like
          that.
                      GORDO
          Masters of our own destiny.
                      LILY
          So far, masters of our own demise.
          What bank are you with?

She throws Ashby a flirty smile.

             Yeah.   He's our boy.
Lupus casually punches Ashby in the arm. It's meant to
be a friendly tap, but it's hard enough to jerk Ashby's
head to the side. Ashby lets out an uncomfortable LAUGH
as he rubs his arm.

             Right. The guys who started that did
             what a lot of companies in the Valley
             do. They get a good idea, shop it
             around, raise some capital, then sell
             it off to a bigger company. Microsoft,
             Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of
             it is, they've pretty much sold the
             company before they're even real. The
             bigger company is already set to buy
             it, all they want to do is make sure
             that the idea actually works. So they
             get some start up capital, make it work,
             then sell it for like five times the
             initial loan.
                         ASHY
             Sort of like a letter of intent.
                         JAKE
             Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you
             can't tell anyone about the offer,
             because if it's public, you could start
             a bidding war and that's considered a
             breach of etiquette. It could kill a
             deal. But, wait too long and you're
             not considered hot anymore.
                         ASHBY

             little.

Jake and Lily share an almost imperceptible look.

              (yelling back)
          SAID, HOW DO--
              (the subway passes)
          Deal with that?
Lily shrugs indifferently.
                      LILY
          Do you think we can do it?
Jake resumes kissing Lily's neck, trying to rekindle some
of last night's magic.
                     JAKE
          Maybe. Even if we don't, you'll be
          alright. You're not in the hole with
          the King.
Lily rolls away from Jake.   Undaunted, Jake starts kissing
her back.
                      LILY
          Who says you have to know the King to
          be in a whole? I actually did have a
          real job once. When I was in high
          school, I worked as a candy striper.
                      JAKE
          Sounds respectable.
                      LILY
          Not the way I did it. I was loaded
          half the time. I don't know how you
          could change bedpans sober.

             I used to hang out with this guy,
             Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or
             something.
                         JAKE
             You want to talk about an old
             boyfriend right now?
Jake, kissing up the length of Lily's neck.
                         LILY
             He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a
             boyfriend at the time... What was his
             name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty.
             I was only fifteen. But he was a nice
             guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We
             used to get loaded on pills from the
             nurses station and then listen to
             Morrisey or some stupid shit like
             that.
                         JAKE
             Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never
             worked for me.
                         LILY
             We were friends. I trusted him. I
             should have known it was weird. But,
             then again I was weird.
                         JAKE
             You guys got busted.   This is a great
             neck.
Jake still kissing...
                         LILY
             No, we never got busted. We were done
             with a shift one night, both a couple
             of Percocets down and I was telling
             Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we
             were thinking about doing it, you know?
             I was thinking about letting him be my
             first because I loved him.
                 (pause)
             What the hell was his name?
                         JAKE
             Glenn talked you out of it.
                         LILY
             Sort of. I was telling him about this
             great love of my life who's name I don't
             remember, and I could see... He was
             getting pissed. I thought it was just
             because he was worried about me, but...

             He told me that I was stupid because
             my boyfriend didn't really love me.
Jake grabs Lily and rolls her over onto her back.     He
climbs on top of her.
                         JAKE
             He was looking out for you.
                         LILY
             Then he grabbed me and threw me down
             on the floor, that really cold
             linoleum tiled hospital floor and
             started ripping my uniform off.
                 (pause)
             He said he was going to "fuck some
             sense into me."
Jake stops kissing Lily and looks up at her.
                         LILY
             Shit, what was that guy's name?   I really
             liked him.
                         JAKE
             Lily... Jesus Christ...
                         LILY
             After Glenn was finished, he gave me a
             couple of valiums and I went home. The
             next day, I finished my shift and met
             him around back, like we always did. I
             stuck a number eight scalpel into his
             chest. Three or four times.
Jake slides off Lily.
                         JAKE
             Did, uh... Did you kill him?
                         LILY
             I don't know. I packed up my shit and
             ran away. To this... So unlike you, I
             guess I do have something to prove, in
             a repressed anger sort of way.
Jake considers for a second.
                         JAKE
             No. You trusted him... You were just
             getting square.
                         LILY
             You know why I told you that, Jake?
                 (turning towards him)
             Because I trust you too.

Butch lowers the gun down and looks over at Lily.

Butch freezes as A POLICE SIREN WAILS in the BACKGROUND,

Ashby leafs through the money in the envelope.

Three or four times over.

INT.- LA SCALA- NIGHT
An elegant restaurant. Jake sits confidently in an
expensive suit speaking to the shabbily dressed Moonan
across from him.
                      JAKE (V.O.)
          These guys we have now, sure, give
          them twenty bucks and they'll look the
          other way on a parking ticket. But a
          Fed... You get a guy like that as your
          Fix...
Jake nonchalantly slides a fat envelope over to Moonan.
Moonan picks it up and finds a wad of cash.
                      JAKE (V.O.)
          It was probably a stupid idea. There I
          am, Armani and Rolex. There he is, JC
          Penny and Timex...

Moonan smiles and slides the envelope back over to Jake
with a disappointed shake of his head.
                         JAKE (V.O.)
             So I took a shot. But now he had me on
             attempted bribery of a Federal Agent.
As Moonan stands, we see Big Al get up from the next table.
A1 "bumps" into Gordo, dressed in a waiter's white jacket.
Gordo "trips;" spilling scalding hot coffee into Moonan's
lap.
Jake casually gets up and leaves.
FREEZE FRAME ON MOONAN'S CONTORTED FACE.
                         JAKE (V.O.)
             That's when Gordo comes in with the
             Hazelnut French Roast.
RESUME-- Moonan falls to the floor, holding his crotch in
agony.
                                                          CUT TO:
EXT.- LA SCALA/PARKING LOT- NIGHT
Miles pulls up in an old Cadillac, picking up Jake at the
entrance. They pick up Gordo and Big Al from a side door
and drive off as Moonan limps out of the restaurant, still
holding his crotch.
                                                          CUT TO:
INT.- THE EUCLID- DAY (RESUMING)
Jake finishes the story to Lupus.
                         JAKE
             And that's how Special Agent Gunther
             Moonan and I became friends.
Lupus nods, satisfied.
                           GORDO
             Moonan.    Here. Shit...
                          LILY
             So what?   We just stay clear of him.
Jake gets up, hard enough to knock the chair over.
                         LILY
             Jesus... Take it easy.

                         JAKE
             No, I'm not going to take it easy. You
             can't stay clear of this guy. He will
             be on this until the end of time.
                         MILES
             What do we do? We change the scam?
                         JAKE
             There is no scam!    I've got a fucking
             sign on my back!    I can't leave town
             now and come back   with a suitcase full
             of money. You get    it? It's over. We

             What do I always tell you guys? Don't
             spend it all. Sooner or later we're
             going to run into some bad luck. Save
             some. Put it away, so when shit like
             this happens, you're not desperate.
             That's it. The gig's up.
                         LILY
             That's it? What are you talking about?
             We can still do this!

             Jake, I mean, come on--
                         JAKE
             No, no, no! Not  this time. I am doing
             this for your own good! You guys have
             got to learn when to stop. You with

                         LILY
             You are such a raving pussy sometimes.
                          JAKE
             Hey, we fucked once, honey. That
             hardly makes you a good judge of
             character. And don't think I didn't
             know you were working some angle with
             that either.

                         JAKE
             There are three people I trust-- him,
             him and a guy who got killed. I don't
             know who you are! You're like some
             stray doq that wandered into the
             house. So I'm telling you to cut loose
             of this. No one's looking for you, Not
             the King, not Moonan and not Gillette.
             Just go wherever it is you would go.
             It's over.
Lily looks around the room. No one seems to be backing
her up.
                         LILY
             What about...
                         JAKE
             What about what?
                         LILY
             What about the money?
Jake stops and levels a look at Lily.
                         JAKE
             So there it is. You got that big itch
             you need to scratch. It's all about
             the fucking money. What do you want,
             an apology?
                         LILY
             No, I want my cut!
                         JAKE
             I'm going to say this one last time for
             You, so take a deep breath and count to
             ten. There is no cut.
Lily levels a look of utter contempt at Jake.
                         LILY
             You're an asshole.
With that, she grabs her coat and leaves.
Lupus sits quietly, taking it all in.
                         GORDO
             So that's it...

                         LUPUS
             What I'm saying is, is that the King
             ain't gonna care. See he had a real
             thing with getting this Gillette guy,
             If you ask me I think he's jealous.
                          JAKE
             Of what?   They're both crooks.

             Exactly. `Cept this Gillette guy. He
             gets to walk around in three piece
             suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a
             bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the

             Your buddy. That fat guy. The King
             couldn't wait to have that guy
             whacked. He didn't even know who the
             guy was, but he was so pissed off at
             him, he gets him drilled. It ain't
             personal. It's business.
                         JAKE
             Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
                         LUPUS
             Point is, you don't go through with
             this, he's going to go after you next.

Jake doesn't move.    Butch grabs him by the hair and turns
him towards Lily.

The King Pin on a cell phone. Harlin stands in front of

sweating. The King seems to hardly notice.
                      LUPUS (O.S.)
          Coupla things. They got this Fed , loo
          king around and the girl just split.

          A Fed?    Is he close?
                      LUPUS (O.S.)
          I don't think so. Their Fix gave us
          the heads up and Jake's got a plan
          that'll probably keep him off.
BACK TO LUPUS
                      LUPUS
          But this girl, the redhead. She knows

          No. She won't. She's not going to be

HEAVY FOOTSTEPS from the hall catch her attention, growing
louder, then stopping at her door. A KNOCK.

             Lily?
Lily frantically rumages through drawers. She pulls a
knife, but it's only a butter knife. She tosses it aside.
Lily moves to the door and looks out the peep hole.
                         HARLIN (O. S.)
             .Jake sent me.
Lily moves to the closet.
                        LILY
             Jake? Hold on. I just got out of the
             shower.
More KNOCKING.

Lily rumages in the closet and a baseball bat. She hefts
the bat and takes a stance in front of the door.
More KNOCKING.
                           LILY
             HOLD ON!
Another KNOCK. Lily slowly reaches for the doorknob.
Then the door flies open with a CRASH. Harlin fills the
doorway.
                         HARLIN
             The King would like to have a word
             with you.
Lily, wide-eyed, stands frozen with the bat still cocked..

             Uh, right now?
                           HARLI
             Please.    I have a car waiting.
Lily takes a swing.      Harlin easily grabs the bat and
backhands Lily. She      goes flying back into the far wall,
bounces off and lands     with a THUD at Harlin's feet where
she finds the butter     knife.
Harlin reaches down and pulls Lily up by the hair.            The
egg SIZZLES in the pan.
Lily takes a stab at Harlin, but the knife just bounces
off his coat. Harlin slaps Lily again, sending her flying
into the stove. Smoke starts to rise from the burning
egg.
Harlin steps closer, but Lily throws her hands up in
surrender.
A spoon RATTLES in a cup as the RUMBLE of a subway train
grows LOUDER.
                         HARLIN

                         JAKE
             HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull
             a switch and he got us all fucking
             pinched!
Lupus picks up the phone and dials another number... No
answer.
                           LUPUS
             Shit.
Lupus cocks the gun and crams it back into Jake's mouth.
                           JAKE
             Aaaaiiit!!!    Ooopusss!!
Lupus takes a newspaper off the bar and covers Jake's
face with it.
SLAM!!!-- Blood splatters across the front page of the
Metro Section. The paper falls away revealing Jake, wide-
eyed, the gun hanging from his mouth.
Lupus lies in a heap at the floor.

Jake lets the gun fall and Looks up to see Butch, standing

             I never thanked you for that.

Jake runs his tongue across the front of his teeth.

                         LILY
             Can we please all stop being so
             goddamnfucking-polite and get to the

                          BUTCH
             Right.   Where's the money, Jake?
Butch presses the gun against Jake's head.       Jake turns
and looks at Lily. They lock eyes.
                         JAKE
             What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee?
             Because it is all about the money,
             right?
                         LILY
             You sold me out. You should have trusted
             me like I trusted you. You fucked up.
             You fucked up HUGE.
Butch taps Jake on the head with the gun.
                          BUTCH
             Alright... Turn around. She doesn't
             get shit, unless I get that money.
             Where is it?
                         JAKE
             Probably safe in the hands of the Federal
             Government.
Butch buttons his coat.

             big con?
                         JAKE
             It's like putting on a play, where
             everyone knows their part except for
             the mark.
                         BUTCH
             Like putting on a play... Guess some
             people forgot their lines.
                         JAKE
             Guess so.

             So why don't you take a deep breath,
             Jake, and I'll count to ten. One.
             Two. Three...
As Butch continues to count, Jake slowly turns his head
and looks at Lily.
Butch, still counting, smiles at Lily's obvious contempt
then slides the gun along the back of Jake's head.
                         JAKE
             I do trust you, Lily.
Butch turns back to Lily to see her reaching into her
bag...

Butch spins and aims at her.

                             EARLY PRODUCTION DRAFT

                             November 14, 2002




FADE IN:





EXT. ISTANBUL - DUSK

Glimpses of an ancient city.   Almost motionless against
the tide of time.
Sea swelled along an endless wall. Billowing silk frozen
against the sky. Birds lighting on Byzantine columns.
FINAL IMAGE is of an imposing STRUCTURE beyond the trees.




INT. PRISON FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE

Corridor of ancient stone and steel extends into infinite
darkness. Stale air hangs in the dim half-light like
atomized ether.
There is WHISPERING.   And tangled VOICES.
DRIFT IN PAST prison cells the size of closets. Brief
flashes of carved faces, insanity -- COMING TO REST ON the --




FINAL CELL

A gaunt PRISONER kneels on the granite, head bowed to a
wall hung tapestry of Christ. But he's not just praying.
He's digging. With his arm under the tapestry, he
scratches at the stone with a SPOON. After only a year,
the spoon finally breaks through.




INT. NARROW CHANNEL

Prisoner claws his way between ancient walls, comes to a
dead end against a thick wooden door. He nudges a
shoulder against it, digs in and pushes. DOOR GROANS
open, sucking air into the pitch black CHAMBER.




INT. PRISONER'S CELL

The tapestry covering the HOLE is pulled against the
wall, then billows outward like a sail.




INT. CHAMBER - PRISONER

pulls himself inside, chokes in the heavy air. He scans
the musty room. Antique furniture. A few empty crates.
And the remains of several deteriorating skeletons.

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                       2.





CONTINUED:

He looks to the far wall, sees a hint of light above
through the crumbling limestone. A way out. Too high to
reach, Prisoner pulls an old CHEST out of a cobwebbed
corner and slides it under the light.
He steps up onto the chest, grabs the edges of the hole
and starts to shove off when the top of the chest gives
way and his foot crunches through.
Prisoner reaches down to free his foot when he sees
something inside -- wrapped in a red cloth. He pulls it
out and as he unwraps it, he discovers the cloth is a
Nazi flag.
At the center is a crudely-shaped IRON RELIC. Eight inches
long. Stains on the edges. Could be the petrified tooth of
some prehistoric animal. Or maybe an ancient arrowhead.
As he holds it, feverish sweat starts to form on his face.




MYSTERIOUS POV

From BEHIND. As if he's being watched by someone else.
Prisoner spins, looks back AT us. Nothing.




PRISONER

starts toward the way out.




INT. PRISONER CORRIDOR

The Guard's flashlight beam probes the cell -- one by one
-- falls on the tapestry. Christ billows out from the
wall, revealing the hole.




INT. PRISON - VARIOUS SHOTS

ALARMS SOUND.    Lights BLAST ON.   Guards with weapons rush
through.




INT. NARROW CHANNEL

Prisoner squeezes toward light, grips the relic tight.




EXT. PRISON - NIGHT

SIRENS BLARE as SPOTLIGHTS sweep across the ominous
structure. Prisoner breaks from the darkness, runs for
the trees on the other side of the wall.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                         3.

                            GUARDS

                      (in Turkish)
             Stop!   Stop!
Prisoner spins, griping the relic tight. GUNSHOTS RING
OUT. Bullets streak toward him but never hit their
target. Guards check their weapons on the run.




EXT. NEAR A ROAD - NIGHT

Prisoner breaks from the trees, runs into a road.
Headlights wash over him and TIRES SCREECH. Prisoner
spins, is right in the path of a car.
BRAKES SQUEAL -- car locks up but too late -- IMPACTS
Prisoner who is violently thrown and lands in a heap.
CAR slides to a stop. DRIVER jumps out, sees the front
end sheet metal has accordioned all the way to the tires.
He scans the area for a body, spots the Prisoner and is
stunned to see him getting to his feet. Uninjured.
Prisoner is just as amazed. He glances at the RELIC in
his hand, notes the wrist has reddened and an odd SYMBOL
has appeared as if embossed in the flesh.
Driver calls out but the Prisoner is spooked, runs off.
OVER this we hear -- A CHILD'S SCREAM.




INT. APARTMENT - DAY

FATHER HENNESSEY (50), stands over a young teen (13),
JEANIE, splashes holy water on her body. She screams
again.

                           HENNESSEY

             Et separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut
             num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui
             serpentes!
Her body convulses, pulls against the bandages tying her
hands and feet to the bed frame. Notice her fingernails.
Drained of color. Almost black.
Her MOTHER is off to one side, completely hysterical.
On the other side is a crowd of bewildered TENANTS, all
crammed into the hallway outside the opened door.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                     4.





CONTINUED:

Nothing can compare with an exorcism.   Especially one
that's gone bad.
The rather obese Priest tries to steady his hands and his
heart. It's obvious he's totally out of his league here.
GIRL lets out another SCREAM that ECHOES OVER --




EXT. AGING APARTMENT BUILDING

Not in a third world country but smack center in one of
America's richest cities. Sparkling high-rises tower in
the distance while flashy billboards tout the sexiest
fashions, the hottest automobiles and the smoothest malt
liquor.

SUPERIMPOSE:   LOS ANGELES - TODAY





EXT. ALLEY BY THE APARTMENT

A faded yellow taxi PULLS UP and stops. Someone steps
out, grinds a cigarette butt into the asphalt.




INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - FOYER

Doors open, flood the musty darkness with a brief relief
of sunlight. A MAN -- whose face we don't see -- steps
inside, his trench coat hanging like the folded wings of
a raven.
He pauses, pulls an ORNATE LIGHTER and lights a
cigarette. Takes a puff and pushes on inside.




INT. NARROW STAIRCASE HALL WALL

Lined with tenants trying to get a glimpse of the
unexplainable.
The Stranger pushes through. Suspicious faces step out
of his path. The ones that don't he pushes aside -- even
the gangbangers.
The man has no patience for politeness, no time for tact,
no fear of anything.
This man is JOHN CONSTANTINE.
He arrives at his destination, barges into --




                                                      5.





INT. APARTMENT 7B

One scan of the situation is all it takes. The bed --
the child -- the panicked priest -- who rushes to John.

                        HENNESSEY

                  (whispering)
          Thank God you're here...
John shoots him a disgusted look.    Hennessey gives him a
wide berth.
John walks past the panic-stricken MOTHER without a
glance, sets his cigarette on the nightstand, the glowing
tip drooped over the edge. He puts a gloved hand to the
child's face and it burns on contact. His demeanor
instantly changes as he leans right next to the ear of
the little girl and whispers --

                        JOHN

          This is Constantine. John
          Constantine, asshole.
The girl JOLTS, bandages on her arms cut into her skin.
Eyes snap open -- glare right through him.

                          JOHN

          How ya doing?

                        JEANIE

          Vamos juntos a matarla.
John whips out a key chain crammed with medallions.

                        JOHN

          Let's see who we got here...
He holds them up so they cast shadows across Jeanie's
face. He flips through each of these sculptured SAINTS
until the child suddenly reacts to one -- tries to look
away.
John stares at the Saint responsible, seems genuinely
puzzled. He turns to the Mother -- very serious.

                        JOHN

          I need a mirror. Now.
Shaken, the Mother produces a small compact.   John pushes
it away, turns to the doorway crowd.

                        JOHN

          A large mirror. At least --
                  (sizes up the child)
          -- three feet high.

                                            (CONTINUED)





                                                        6.





CONTINUED:

The hallway crowd discusses possibilities.

                             JOHN


             MOVE.

Tenants run to retrieve a mirror.     Hennessey looks
worried.
John grabs the bed -- shoves Hennessey aside as he swings
the bed around, legs gouging hardwood all the way. Faces
it toward the window.




INTERCUT - APARTMENT 5G BELOW

Several of the MEN from the hallway crowd storm through
an OLD WOMAN'S stuffy apartment, locate a huge iron-
framed mirror and rip it and half the plaster from the
wall.




JOHN

centers on a drapery ROPE, pulls hard. Drapery HOOKS
EXPLODE off the curtain rod as he swings open the window,
looks down into the alley where that yellow taxi is
parked.

                             JOHN

             Chaz?
CHAZ (20s) looks up from his cab. Cool. Frustrated.
You just know he'd love to be up there, not down here.

                             JOHN

             Move the car.

                             CHAZ

             Why?

                           JOHN


             MOVE THE DAMN CAR.

John frees the drapery rope, ducks back into the room.

                           CHAZ

             Park the car -- Move the car...
Chaz shifts into reverse, moves the car three feet.

                           CHAZ

             There, I moved the damn car.




                                                      7.





INT. HALLWAY

Four men struggle to carry up that enormous mirror. The
Old Woman follows, begs them to be gentle. They swing
the mirror around, take out a chunk of banister. She
freaks.




INT. APARTMENT 7B

Hennessey can only watch as John threads the drapery rope
through the fire escape railing, drapes it back through
the window and loops it over the ceiling fan.
He climbs onto the bed, leans over the child whose eyes
have closed and she's shaking badly. Her body seems to
be going into shock. Isn't strong enough for this.
John has no choice -- slaps her. Eyes pop back open.
Dark and dilated. He yells down at her in Aramaic and
English.

                        JOHN

          Amar natash bow basar! -- Rescind
          from the flesh I command thee --
The girl chokes as if ready to spit.

                        JOHN

          That's it -- time to go home.
Jeanie SCREAMS --

                        JEANIE

          Tiempo para morir!
Her body suddenly PULSES half again larger. John recoils
for a beat. Odd. He continues in Aramaic --

                        JOHN

          Amar natash bow basar --
Another PULSE and this time a SHAPE is clearly seen
expanding under the child's skin -- as if the demon
inside were trying to burst right through.
John backs off -- watches as the shape ripples her flesh,
like fingers caressing from the other side. John glances
to Hennessey. What the hell?
MIRROR arrives at the doorway, BANGS against the JAM.
John waves them in. The four men heft it into the room.

                         JOHN

          Lift it.   Over the bed.   Up.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                           8.





CONTINUED:

John ducks, settles on the girl as they raise it over
him.

                           JOHN

             Hennessey, tie it off --
Hennessey is glad to be called into service -- quickly
ties one end of rope to the mirror. John straddles the
girl, positions his head between her and the mirror above
him.

                           JOHN

             Now close your eyes -- all of you
             -- and whatever happens -- do not
             look into the mirror.
The men close their eyes.        Muscles tense under the
weight.

                           JOHN

             Amar natash bow basar! -- rescind
             from the flesh I command thee!
Jeanie reacts -- that SHAPE reappears, contorts the young
body all out of proportion.
John unblocks the mirror for a second and Jeanie is
reflected inside. It's not just the image of a young
girl in there, but something else. The surface of the
mirror FLEXES in the hands of the men. One starts to
look --

                             JOHN

             No!
Jeanie SCREAMS -- breaks free of the straps. She rises
up, grabs John tight around the throat. Nails dig deep.

                             HENNESSEY

             John?!

                              JOHN

                        (looking into
                         mirror)
             Not yet!
John struggles, puts his hands over her mouth -- cutting
off her air supply. Question is, who's going to pass out
first?
Jeanie's body is racked by whatever's inside her. She
goes into shock, body collapsing -- shaking -- close to
death.

                                                 (CONTINUED)





                                                       9.





CONTINUED:


                            JOHN

             Look!   Look at me!
But she's passing out first. John quickly takes the
medallion that caused the earlier reaction --

                           JOHN

             Goddamit -- look!
-- and presses it against her forehead. Eyes snap wide
and John unblocks the mirror. Jeanie locks on her
reflection and the image in the mirror changes
drastically.

                           JOHN

             Smile pretty you vain prick.
The child's reflection has now changed to a pissed off
DEMON. One that knows it just got suckered in.
MIRROR VIBRATES wildly in the men's grip. Demon
reflection ripples the glass -- bending it outward into
three-D space as the girl takes her last breaths --

                           JOHN

             Now, Hennessey. Now!
Hennessey PULLS the rope with all three-hundred-plus
pounds as John gives the demon face a full extended

FINGER.


                             JOHN

             For your boss.
Demon pushes for him but mirror is jerked into motion.
Swings right out the window but catches on a sliver of
wood --

                             JOHN

             No you don't.
John jumps up and helps push the mirror free.




EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HUGE MIRROR

Falls SLOW MOTION from the 7th story -- tumbling end over
end, sunlight beams glancing off the glass, PROJECTING
the image of the Demon into the LA cityscape. ONTO
buildings, sidewalks, a passing truck -- until all three
hundred pounds of IRON AND GLASS come CRASHING down ON
the taxi's hood.

                                            (CONTINUED)





                                                       10.





CONTINUED:


                           CHAZ


             SHIT!

Demon's image SHATTERS on impact -- GLASS SPLINTERING
into a million diamond-like fragments that choke the air.
The GROAN of something evil reverberates into the city
beyond.
Chaz looks up, sees he missed dying by three feet.




INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Jeanie GASPS -- takes her first breath as a child again.
And CRIES. Mother pulls her in, hugs her tight. Note
the girl's fingernails. No longer black.
John's beat, reclaims that stub of a cigarette, still
burning. Takes a drag. He pushes past Hennessey who is
approaching the mother.

                           HENNESSEY

             Now about the fee...
John slips FROM VIEW into the kitchenette, hides the fact
that he has to lean against the door to keep his balance.
He catches his breath, looks up and is staring right at a
child's crayon drawing magneted to the fridge. A drawing
of a figure poking another in the side with a long stick.
This image is repeated over and over.
John tugs it off the fridge, tucks it away.




INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - LATER

Hennessey follows John down the spiraling stairs, passing
the gathered tenants. A few are freaked, cross
themselves. Others horrified. But many want to touch
them, shake their hands.
A shadowy FIGURE several floors up stares over the rail
at the heroes below. Note the slick suit, the polished
veneer.
This is BALTHAZAR and he definitely does not rent here.
He flicks an ancient COIN between his fingers.
JOHN pauses, gazes up through the stairwell as if sensing
something. No one there. Balthazar is gone.

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                         11.





CONTINUED:

JOHN shakes off the feeling, continues down the steps
where Hennessey is shoving his HAT in front of the
tenants. They're gladly giving to the cause.

                              HENNESSEY

             Thank you.     Yes... Gracias...

                             JOHN

             Hennessey.
Hennessey stops his panhandling, continues toward the
exit.




INT. FOYER

John and Hennessey stop near the front entrance.      John
rips the white collar from Hennessey's neck.

                           HENNESSEY

             I know, I know, but I didn't think
             she was really possessed, not like
             that.

                           JOHN

             I'm not back an hour and you drag
             me into --

                           HENNESSEY

             -- Don't be mad, John, don't be --
John rummages through his coat pockets --

                           HENNESSEY

             On the left side.
John keeps searching.

                             HENNESSEY

             Vest pocket.
John rips his smokes from the left vest pocket --

                           JOHN

             Don't do that shit on me --

                             HENNESSEY

             Sorry, sorry.    Here, you can have
             half.
Hennessey starts to divvy the cash but John snatches the
hat.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        12.





CONTINUED:


                            JOHN

             I should take it all, save you
             from yourself.
He gestures that bagged BOTTLE in Hennessey's jacket.

                           HENNESSEY

             It keeps them out, so I can sleep.
             Please, John, I need to sleep.
John stares at his pathetic friend, sighs, finally slips
a few bills from the wad and hands them over.
Hennessey is bubbling with appreciation, starts to
follow. John simply holds up a hand. Hennessey stops,
watches John walk out. Alone.




EXT. ALLEY BY THE APARTMENT

John turns the corner, spots Chaz punching a dent from
the taxi's hood.

                           JOHN

             I told you to move it.

                           CHAZ

             Well maybe if you had told me you
             were dropping a three-hundred
             pound mirror with a pissed-off
             demon in it I would have moved it
             further.
Chaz slams the hood.      They slide into the car.

                           CHAZ

             Well?

                           JOHN

             Well what?
Chaz reaches back into John's front coat pocket -- pulls
out Hennessey's wad of cash -- slips off a few bills.

                           CHAZ

             Shouldn't have cut your stay in
             the land of enlightenment. You
             were so close to growing a
             conscience.
John grins, pulls his special lighter, lights a smoke and
sits back.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                        13.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

             Los Angeles...
He looks back up at the apartment, still puzzled.

                           JOHN

             Never ceases to entertain.
Chaz crams the car in gear as John takes a drag, coughs.




EXT. THE SKY

One of those perfect days. With perfect clouds. So
clear you feel you could reach out and touch Heaven.
Two young girls rise INTO FRAME on side-by-side swings.
For a moment they're suspended against that incredible
sky. Then gravity takes hold and they fall back to
Earth.

                           MAN (V.O.)

             You still with me?




INT. SUBWAY - DAY

ANGELA'S (30) weary eyes open. She's on her belly hidden
between track ties and shadows even deeper. Grips a
police-issue revolver tight. She's pinned down, unable
to move.

                           ANGELA

             Yeah...
The MAN is thirty feet down the same track. Their VOICES
ECHO off the curved walls, come from everywhere.
How either of these two got here isn't important.      Who
will get out is.

                           MAN (O.S.)

             So what's next, Detective?   We
             gonna do a full marathon?
Intermittent RADIO CHATTER buzzes from Angela's WALKIE-
TALKIE. You get the sense Angela is not alone in here.

                           ANGELA

             Put your weapon on the tracks and
             step out with your hands above
             your head.

                           MAN (O.S.)

             Or how 'bout you show yourself and
             I put a bullet in your skull just
             like I did hers!

                           ANGELA

             That's just not going to happen.

                           MAN (O.S.)

             You sure about that?!
Angela checks the chamber -- sees she has one bullet
left.

                           ANGELA

                     (almost pleading)
             Now put down your weapon on the
             tracks and --
GROUND BEGINS to VIBRATE.     Tunnel starts to GLOW.

                           MAN (O.S.)

             Well ain't this a peach?!
Angela looks back, sees several SHADOWS of figures waving
far off. Her RADIO is flooded with futzed CHATTER.

                           DETECTIVE WEISS (V.O.)

                     (over radio)
             Get off the tracks! Blueline is
             coming! Clear the tracks!
Angela peeks over the track.     Still no sign of her perp.
The TRAIN is coming INTO VIEW and its BEAM shoots through
the tunnel, turning every particle of dust into a supernova.
The SOUND is DEAFENING.

                           MAN (O.S.)

             C'mon, Detective, step into the
             light and be saved!!
Angela looks back, squints into the brilliant LIGHT.
She grips her GUN and in one burst of flat-out bravado --
rises as she AIMS.
And there he is -- the Man rising with his own gun.
Angela FIRES as both dive off the track. His BULLET
RICOCHETS behind her. Hers finds its mark. Man goes
down right in the train's path.

                                                (CONTINUED)

Angela rolls over on the side of the tracks, catches her
breath. She closes her eyes and crosses herself as the
train roars past in a staccato blur.




EXT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY - DAY

Chaz's taxi pulls up, parks.




TAXI TRUNK

OPENS, REVEALS suitcases stamped with AIR INDIA.   John
starts inside, pauses as Chaz yells --

                           CHAZ

             There are four bags. I have two
             hands. This give you any ideas?

                           JOHN

             Make two trips?
John walks in.     Chaz curses under his breath.




INT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY

Evening leagues are going strong. John walks in, looks
totally out of place. He moves down the BALL RACK area,
runs his fingers across the various leftovers, finally
stops at a pearl-white dazzler.
He lifts it from the rack, steps out into the prep
area -- in front of one of the few lanes not in use.
Number 13.
John snatches a grease pencil from the overhead,
scribbles right on the ball -- "PROVISIONS DEPLETED."
He fluffs his trench coat back, steps onto the polished
wood with his well-traveled Oxfords.
Young bowlers on both sides stop to look at this oddity.
An attractive brunette is rather curious. John gives her
a wink. Her boyfriend doesn't appreciate it.
John bowls. Perfect hook ball. Strike! Brunette grins.
John returns the smile, heads into the hallway by the
pool tables.

INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT

Seems small until you walk in and realize it's as long as
a bowling lane. Makes that cage enclosed bed at one end
seem like it's a mile away.
Chaz throws the suitcases on it as John arrives.

                        CHAZ

                  (yells across room)
          Simple question. How much longer
          do I have to be your slave?
John pulls a chain and a wall of window shutters open.

                        JOHN

          You're not my slave, Chaz. You're
          my very appreciated assistant.
          Like Tonto and Robin and that
          skinny fellow with the fat friend.
Along the floor, encircling the entire room, are 5 gallon
Sparkletts bottles. Each is adorned by a small hand-
marked CROSS. John takes a moment to adjust one out of
place.

                        CHAZ

          How much longer?
John doesn't like his tone.

                        JOHN

          Well I don't know, what's the
          going rate for saving a taxi
          driver hanging from his
          fingernails about to be swallowed
          into the jaws of Hell?

                        CHAZ

          So what time you want me back?
John gives him a knowing look, goes back to emptying his
pockets.

                        JOHN

          I need to make an appearance at
          Midnite's. Say ten-ish?
Chaz sighs, starts out --

                        JOHN

          Chaz...?
Chaz turns back, catches an object John throws him.

                                            (CONTINUED)





                                                         17.

                           JOHN

             A little something from Delphi.
It's a dashboard air freshener shaped like a cow.
Chaz tips it.     Moooooo.   John finds it rather amusing.

                             CHAZ

             Gee, thanks.
Chaz leaves. John removes a small BLACK BOX from his
jacket. He sets it carefully on its own shelf by the
window -- stares out.

                           BEEMAN (O.S.)

             'Provisions depleted?'
John turns to see BEEMAN waddle in.

                           BEEMAN

             I gave you three months worth.
             You were gone only one.
This diminutive occult version of Bond's "Q" carries a
custom bowling bag and squints in the light like a mole.

                           JOHN

             What can I say, Beeman, India was
             a real drain.
They shake hands.     Beeman sets his bowling bag onto the
table, unzips it.

                           BEEMAN

             So what do you need?

                           JOHN

             Everything you got.

                           BEEMAN

                     (pausing)
             You smell something, John?

                           JOHN

             Maybe. Incubus in this girl I
             just exorcized seemed a bit more
             spirited than usual.
Beeman starts pulling things out.      First is a frayed RAG.
Then glass containers...

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         18.





CONTINUED:


                           BEEMAN

             Well, I've got your stone
             fragments from the Road to
             Damascus, dust from the Dead Sea
             Scrolls -- oh, you'll love this --
Out comes a little MATCHBOX with a smiling bug graphic.

                           BEEMAN

             Screech beetle from Mount Sinai.
He shakes the matchbox and the BEETLE flutters inside.
It's WINGS create an eerie HIGH-PITCHED WHIRL. John
shrugs. So?

                           BEEMAN

             Yeah, to you it's nothing but to
             the Fallen -- like fingernails on
             a chalkboard.

                           JOHN

             What is it with you and bugs?
Beeman pulls out a set of sculptured BRASS KNUCKLES.
Actually solid gold and engraved with religious markings.
John takes them, tries them on. Nice fit.

                           BEEMAN

             Gold was blessed by the Bishop
             Anicott during the Crusades.
John spots a foot-long COPPER TUBE in the bag, pulls it
out, grips the bicycle handle on one end.

                           BEEMAN

             Watch it there.
With this puny little thing? John gives the handle a
squeeze and WHOOOOSH -- ten-foot FLAME BELCHES out.

                           BEEMAN

             Dragon's breath.

                           JOHN

             I thought you couldn't get it
             anymore.
Beeman shrugs, modesty. John starts to put it down on
the table and Beeman quickly pulls the frayed rag away.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                       19.





CONTINUED:


                           BEEMAN

             Whoa, don't want to get a flame
             near this.
                     (off John's look)
             Piece of the shroud Moses wore to
             the mountain.
John picks it up -- You're shitting me, right?    Nope.

                           JOHN

             Got any callinicus?

                           BEEMAN

                     (intrigued)
             How spirited was this incubus?

                           JOHN

                     (coughs)
             Like it was trying to come right
             out through the girl
Beeman just stares at him -- is this a joke?

                           JOHN

             I know how it sounds...

                           BEEMAN

             We're finger puppets to them,
             John, elaborate costumes -- they
             can work us but don't come through
             us. They can't. You know that.

                           JOHN

             Check the scrolls anyway.
             Corinthians. See if there are any
             precedents.

                            BEEMAN

             Sure, John.   Anything else?

                           JOHN

                     (coughs again)
             Wouldn't happen to have anything
             for --
Beeman sets down a bottle from the bag -- Vick's 44.

                             BEEMAN

             On the house.




EXT. LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

Lots of blue on blue in this parking lot.




                                                          20.





INT. LOCKER ROOM

Locker door opens and Angela is there, covered in the
grime of the subway. She's pained as she pulls off her
shoulder holster. Looks at herself in the door mirror.
Tired, aging eyes stare back.

                        WEISS (O.S.)

          Gutsy move out there, Dodson.
Angela glances at DETECTIVE WEISS as he opens his locker.

                          ANGELA

          Gutsy?    Well that's a new one.
The two exchange a look.

                        WEISS

          You're alive. Bad guy's dead. No
          point in using the other words.

                          ANGELA

          Thanks.

                        WEISS

                  (shuts his locker)
          Even though it was reckless --
          irresponsible -- stupid...

                        ANGELA

          I knew you still cared.

                        WEISS

          You're good, Angela, real good but
          one of these days...

                         ANGELA

                   (heard it before)
          I know, nobody's luck lasts
          forever.
He meets her eyes.    Exactly.     He really does care.
Weiss breaks it off, leaves. Angela turns to close her
locker door, notices her reflection does not turn.
She grabs the door, looks back in. Reflection is as it
should be. She shudders, slams the locker door.




EXT. CLUB MIDNITE - 10 PM

So exclusive there's not even a line out front. Just a
pair of bouncers waiting to roll someone just for fun.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                     21.





CONTINUED:

Chaz follows John from the cab to the entrance. A
Bouncer selects a PICTURE CARD from a deck. On the front
are TWO FLYING DOLPHINS. Only we can see the back, which
is --

                           JOHN

             Two frogs on a bench.
Yep. They let him pass. Chaz steps up and lucky him --
he gets the same TWO FLYING DOLPHINS.

                           CHAZ

             Two frogs on a bench.
But Chaz is stiff-armed because the back of this card
shows a BEAR in a dress.

                            CHAZ

             What?   But I'm with him!   Right,
             John?   John?
John glances back -- gives him an impassive look.   Chaz
backs away, stares after him. Someday.




INT. CLUB MIDNITE

MUSIC FLOODS this exclusive establishment. It's a clash
of cultures and influences not easily dated. A retro
speakeasy for the new millennium.
John walks through a maze of passages while the fantasies
of a twisted city play out in the shadows. He pauses,
sees a clan of suited businessmen in a corner, showing
off for several ladies.
One fills a line of shot glasses from a pitcher of water.
Another waves his hand over them, turns the water into
RED WINE. The ladies are very impressed, drink up.
NICO, a young black man, walks past John.

                           NICO

             Neighborhood's going to Hell.
John offers a half smile. He likes this kid, walks on.
One of the men in the group turns, watches John.
Balthazar. He grins and pockets that odd COIN.




INT. HALLWAY

John starts up a long flight of stairs, stops in front of
two very large doors.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                         22.





CONTINUED:

Their surface is ancient, the wood petrified over
countless centuries. John places his fingers into the
gnarled folds, closes his eyes --

                           JOHN

             Numquam leadatur a morsu.
A living GROAN BELLOWS from the rigid seams but the doors
don't budge.

                           JOHN

             Bastard changed the code again.
                     (bangs the doors)
             Midnite! Come on, do I have to
             huff and puff here?!
The doors unlatch.




INT. MIDNITE'S OFFICE

SWEEP ACROSS a meticulously-crafted ORRERY, a scientific
sculpture that normally displays our solar system in
relative motion. But the planets here are ancient RELICS
with symbols and names -- MATERIAL, ASTRAL, SPIRITUAL,
ICONIC, etc. And the globe at the center -- "CREATOR."
This is an orrery of the forces of the Universe.      And
it's not moving.

                           MIDNITE (O.S.)

             Et separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut
             num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui
             serpentes...
John steps in through the doors behind.

                           JOHN

             Deciding which color to paint this
             place again?
PAPPA MIDNITE stands in the jungle he calls an office.
Part African witch doctor, part savvy businessman. A
full six and half feet of solid contradictions.

                           MIDNITE

             You're back early.

                           JOHN

             I got tired of spending your
             money.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         23.





CONTINUED:


                           MIDNITE

             But I'm sure you spent enough.

                           JOHN

             Well I do have a certain standard
             of living.

                           MIDNITE

             Tell me you found it.

                           JOHN

             I found the vault.

                           MIDNITE

             That's not what I asked.

                           JOHN

             Hey, can I help it if Buddhist
             monks don't take bribes?
Midnite strides toward him when John calmly pulls from
his pocket a small ebony and gold RELIC. It stops
Midnite cold.

                             JOHN

             Gotcha.
A reluctant grin cracks Midnite's stern features. He
takes the relic in his thick fingers -- stares
breathlessly at a gaunt figure bracing itself against a
cosmic wind.

                           MIDNITE

             Second century depiction of a
             sephiroth in the 4th realm...

                             JOHN

             Right.    So we good here?
Midnite ignores his outstretched palm, slides the relic
precisely onto one of the many rods jutting from the
Universal orrery.

                           MIDNITE

             It should counter the iconic
             plane --

                           JOHN

             That damn thing's never going to
             balance.
Midnite lets go and the complex machine actually starts
to move. To turn.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          24.





CONTINUED:

John is somewhat intrigued until the newest relic
collides with another and the orrery jams to a halt.
Midnite deflates, stares at John, suspiciously.

                           MIDNITE

             Must I remind you of what selling
             fake relics will do to your
             health?

                           JOHN

             It's authentic, Midnite, you just
             have the wrong piece. Jesus...
The two have a mini stare-down. John's rigid poker face
is only broken by a cough. Midnite sighs, breaks it off.

                           JOHN

             What? -- I didn't blink -- that
             was a cough. You never cough?
Midnite reaches into his tuxedo jacket and hands over a
thick stack of HUNDREDS.

                           JOHN

             Better not be any Washingtons in
             here this time.

                           MIDNITE

             Why did you cut your trip short?
John stops the counting, actually thinks about it.

                           JOHN

             I don't know... Just a feeling --
John suddenly spins toward the entrance doors, is stunned
to see --

                           JOHN

             Balthazar.
Balthazar is behind him.     Utterly confident.     Chillingly
so.

                           BALTHAZAR

             We're not still whining about
             Manhattan, are we?
John's attempt to disguise his anger fails.

                           BALTHAZAR

             That expression alone has made my
             entire night.

                                                 (CONTINUED)





                                                          25.





CONTINUED:

John takes several steps toward him.       Grins.   Malevolent.
There's history here.

                           JOHN

             I'll make your night -- I'll
             deport your sorry ass right where
             you stand --

                           MIDNITE


             JOHN.

John stops in his tracks.

                           JOHN

             It's bad enough that you let these
             half-breeds in at all but this
             piece of shit --

                           BALTHAZAR

             Perks of becoming a primary
             investor.

                           JOHN

             What?!
Midnite's eyes say it all -- not here, not now.

                           BALTHAZAR

             Things change, balances shift.
             Get used to it, Constantine.

                           JOHN

             Not while I'm still breathing --
John starts to cough again.

                           BALTHAZAR

             I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.
John tries to catch his breath, can't. And that scares
him a bit. He tries to hide it, pushes out.




EXT. CLUB MIDNITE

John SLAMS out the exit -- coughing. He pulls the Vicks
44 from his jacket, struggles with the child protector
cap.

                           HENNESSEY

             Hey, John.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         26.





CONTINUED:

John is surprised to see Hennessey waiting. He chokes,
is about to bust the Vicks 44 bottle.   Hennessey grabs
hold, twists off the cap with one flick. John guzzles
the syrup.

                           HENNESSEY

             I'm real sorry about this morning,
             John, real sorry. Please don't
             hate me for draggin' you into
             that. Please don't...
John can finally breathe.

                           JOHN

             I don't hate you.

                           HENNESSEY

             That's good to hear. Real good...

                           JOHN

             But could you at least wait until
             I call for you before you show up?

                           HENNESSEY

             You didn't call?

                           JOHN

             Not yet. Jesus, Hennessey, you
             freak me out sometimes.

                           HENNESSEY

             So you want me to go away and come
             back?

                           JOHN

             No. I've got an assignment for you.

                            HENNESSEY

             Really?   What kind of assignment?

                           JOHN

             The kind you'll have to be sober
             for.

                           HENNESSEY

             Oh God, you want me to surf the
             ether.
He instinctively touches an AMULET around his neck.       Four
intersecting crosses.

                           JOHN

             Come on, you know that exorcism
             wasn't right.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                       27.





CONTINUED:


                           HENNESSEY

             I... I don't have the Sight
             anymore.

                           JOHN

             Don't have it or don't want to use
             it?
Hennessey vacillates.     This is obviously tough for him.

                           JOHN

             Just look around. A few days.
             You spot anything unusual,
             anything -- you let me know.
             Okay?
John wraps an arm around his shoulder like a good buddy,
then reaches behind his neck --

                           JOHN

             It'll be like old times.
-- and unclips the amulet from Hennessey's neck. That
unnerves the big guy. John drops it in Hennessey's
pocket.

                           JOHN

             Just for a few days.

                           HENNESSEY

             Okay, okay... for you, John.      Like
             old times. Right.
Hennessey takes one last sip from his drink, hands the
bottle over. John downs the rest. Nods.




INT. ST. ANTHONY'S CHURCH - CONFESSION BOOTH - NIGHT

Angela sits inside.

                           ANGELA

             I killed a man today.   Another
             one.
FATHER GARRET sits on the other side of the mesh window.

                           FATHER GARRET

             I'm sorry, Angela.

                           ANGELA

             Most cops go twenty years without
             firing their gun. Not me. I
             always seem to be in the wrong
             place at the wrong time.




                                                     28.





INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - SERIES OF SHOTS - NIGHT

Angela arrives home. Pours milk for a cat.     Lets her
hair down. Slips off her shoes.

                        ANGELA (V.O.)

          I didn't even see his face. I
          just pulled the trigger and he
          went away. Just like all the
          others...
Angela in the SHOWER -- trying to wash off the guilt.

                        FATHER GARRET (V.O.)

          These feelings are natural in your
          line of work, Angela. I'd be
          worried if you didn't have them.
Angela now in a recliner, cat in her lap.   She's tired.
Eyes are heavy.

                        FATHER GARRET (V.O.)

          But you have to be strong. You
          can't allow your faith to be
          overshadowed by guilt.

                         ANGELA (V.O.)

          I'm trying.
Her eyes close.

                        ANGELA (V.O.)

          I'm trying real hard.




INT. RAVENSCAR - NIGHT

Angela's eyes open. An Angela whose frightened features
are dripping with a fever sweat.
She's in a hospital gown, stares around a corner.
Janitor polishes the floor in the distance. A nurse
checks off charts in the f.g. And right between the two
darts Angela, unseen by anyone.




EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

A metal fire door swings open and Angela bursts out --
breathing deep. She runs across the tar roof, almost
afraid to look back.
She gets to the ledge, steps up.   A BOTTLE in the way
fall -- FOLLOW IT DOWN TO the --




                                                    29.





COURTYARD

-- where it SHATTERS --




INT. GROUND FLOOR HOSPITAL ROOM

The sound has drawn the attention of BARRY (10) lying in
bed. He moves up and stares out the window -- sees the
broken glass in the courtyard. He scans up the building
and spots a FIGURE standing on the roof.




ROOFTOP - WIDER

Chilling April air flutters Angela's gown, vaporizes her
breath. Tears stream down her cheeks as she contemplates
the unthinkable.
Cityscape of lights are spread out below but Angela is
seeing something else.

REFLECTED IN HER EYES --

is a city engulfed in RED FLAMES. Follow that tear with
the same reflection of fire inside as it traces her cheek
and slips into her mouth.
ANGELA shudders, rubs her wrist where we see the skin has
swelled and reddened just like the Prisoner's. And
there's that same circular symbol in the flesh.
She wipes her tears -- tries to be strong. Takes a few
breaths for courage, them simply steps off.




INT. BARRY'S ROOM

BARRY'S WIDE EYES follow her down.




EXT. COURTYARD - LATER

Barry approaches across the barren courtyard, leans down
to Angela's contorted body. But she's still alive.
Barry stares into eyes that are fading fast. He reaches
out, touches her face. Eyes close. She's gone.




INT. ANGELA'S APARTMENT

Angela stirs awake.   Disturbed.
OVER this we hear INCESSANT COUGHING --




                                                       30.





INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM

John switches on the light, leans up from the sink and
wipes his mouth with a towel. It's covered with blood.
More runs down the drain. He stares at himself in the
mirror. ON John's worried eyes --

                                       MATCH CUT TO:





ANGLE - ANGELA'S EYES

looking equally distraught.

                        WEISS (V.O.)

          It's her, Angela...




EXT. RAVENSCAR HOSPITAL - WIDER - CONTINUOUS ACTION -


DAY

Angela is led by Detective Weiss past several officers
and medical personnel.

                         WEISS

          It's Isabel.
They arrive at the covered body in the courtyard.
Coroner sees Angela approach and lifts the sheet from the
face.
Angela comes to a dead stop, emotions coming fast and
furious.
She leans close and we see a mirror of Angela. That's
when you realize that wasn't a dream. This is her twin.
But that circular symbol is nowhere on her wrist now.
Angela's eyes well with tears. It takes everything she
has to stay in control. Helps to wrap herself in the
job. She steps back, looks up at the tall building.

                        ANGELA

          She... she fell from the roof?

                         WEISS

          No.   She jumped.
Angela gives him an incredulous glare.   Shakes her head.

                        WEISS

          I know it's hard to accept but --

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                        31.





CONTINUED:


                           ANGELA

             Isabel would never in a million
             years take her own life. Never.

                           WEISS

             Angela... there was a surveillance
             camera on the roof.




INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

John marches down a hallway, his trench coat a step
behind. He unconsciously rubs his left wrist, coughs.
Flicks an unlit smoke between his fingers.
John stops at a doctor's office door -- hesitates.




INT. RAVENSCAR - SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE

View of the rooftop. There's Isabel in her nightgown,
stepping up -- pausing just a second. Then one step and
she's gone. So clear. So unrefutable.




WIDER

Angela shudders as a comforting HAND rests on her
shoulder.

                           WEISS (O.S.)

             Take some time...
Angela brushes off his hand, then spots Weiss and the
others on the other side of the room. Whose hand was
that?




INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE

A LINE OF LIGHT BOXES illuminate several CHEST X-RAYS. A
DARK sinister splotch snakes through both LUNGS. John
stands there, stares at this wall of death with disbelief.

                           JOHN

             No -- I've beaten things,
             insurmountable things, things most
             people have never even heard of
             and after all that you think I'm
             going to be done in by THIS?
He raises a puny little cigarette. DR. LES ARCHER (50)
sighs. A delicate bedside manner is not his specialty.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         32.





CONTINUED:


                           DR. ARCHER

             You wouldn't be the first, John.

                           JOHN

             It can't be that simple. I mean
             come on, Les, you saved me before.
             You can do it again, right.

                           DR. ARCHER

             This is different. This is
             aggressive.
John tries to stay cool -- fails.     He TRASHES the X-ray
boxes. Diseased lungs disappear.      Doc shakes his head.

                           DR. ARCHER

             Twenty years ago you didn't want
             to be here. Now you don't want to
             leave.

                           JOHN

             That's because I know exactly
             where I'm going this time.




INT. HALLWAY

John steps outside of the Doctor's office, pauses to
gather himself. He starts walking. Wants out of here
fast.




INT. RAVENSCAR - HALLWAY

Angela is on the move. Emotions are coming in strong.
She can't get out of here fast enough.
She aims for the elevators, sees a MAN has just entered
one.

                           ANGELA

                     (rushing toward it)
             Wait, hold the door!
Angela, gets to the elevator, looks in. John stands
inside alone. This should be the first time we realize
they were in the same hospital.

                           ANGELA

             Going down?
John pauses as the doors start to close.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                      33.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

             Not if I can help it.
The doors close right on Angela.




EXT. SOMEWHERE IN ISTANBUL - DAY

A PICKUP TRUCK crosses a barren landscape.
In the back bed are several goats and one Prisoner.
He grips the relic tight in one hand.   That anxious fever
has returned.
Glazed eyes dart to the side and lock on a rising
jetliner in the distance -- dart back to the road they're
on -- heading the opposite way.
Prisoner clamps his eyes tight, grips to the relic
tighter.
Eyes snap open and he turns, thrusts his elbow through
the center window, leans in and grabs the Driver -- jerks
his head back against the bulkhead -- cracking it in the
process.
Prisoner latches onto the wheel, takes control. He
swerves the car off the pavement, gets out and takes over
as driver.
Truck continues on, bouncing through a shallow ditch and
into the field beyond, aiming straight for the rising
airliners in the distance.




EXT. L.A. APARTMENT - DAY

Close to condemned status. SCAN UP floor after floor,
COMING TO REST ON a window covered with aluminum foil.




INT. HENNESSEY'S APARTMENT

Every wall of this tiny shithole is covered in aluminum
foil. A sober Hennessey stands surrounded by decades of
newspapers and periodicals -- tries to get his breathing
in check.
He instinctively reaches to his neck to touch the amulet
but it's not there. Oh yeah -- in the pocket. Decision
made, he reaches up, starts tearing the foil from the
walls and the window.




                                                       34.





EXT. ECHO PARK (DOWNTOWN L.A.) - DAY

John sits at a park bench. Motionless. Taking in the
world. Clouds passing the sun. Shadows drifting across
the city. Leaves swirling after passing cars.
John just sits there, HEARING every breath he takes,
wondering which one will be his last.

                         ELLIE (O.S.)

          Lung cancer?   Lung cancer?!
John turns to see ELLIE (23) strutting up the sidewalk.
Uninhibited. Oozing sex appeal. But dangerous. In more
ways than you think.

                        ELLIE

          That's funny as shit, John.

                        JOHN

          As if you guys didn't have
          something to do with it...

                        ELLIE

          Hey, I think you brought this one
          on yourself.
John stares at her, tries to get a read.

                        ELLIE

          Now why wouldn't you trust me?

                        JOHN

          I don't know, something in the
          air --
She sits right on his lap, playfully.

                        ELLIE

          Don't worry, John, you'll beat
          this. You beat everything.

                        JOHN

          Not this time, Ellie.
John lifts her off of him, sets her aside.

                        ELLIE

          Oh wow, you're serious... No
          wonder the Boss is in such a good
          mood.

                        JOHN

          Yeah, I thought maybe you could
          talk to him for me. You know...?

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                       35.





CONTINUED:

Ellie jumps off the bench, creates an odd SOUND as she
does.

                           ELLIE

             What?! Dammit, John, I know I owe
             you but to even ASK that? All
             those saints and martyrs slipping
             through his grasp -- his own foot
             soldiers sent back to him in
             chunks. He's going to take all
             that out on you, John, and he's
             going to enjoy ripping your soul
             to shreds until the end of time.

                           JOHN

             So I take that as a 'no?'

                           ELLIE

             You're the one soul the man
             himself would actually come up
             here to collect. And you know how
             much he despises this place.

                           JOHN

             I'm starting to see his point.
Ellie sits back down, strokes his arm.

                           ELLIE

             Have you gone to see the Snob?
Like scratching fingers across a blackboard.     No way.

                           ELLIE

             Look, don't let your ego get in
             the way on this. I'd miss having
             someone up here I can... relate
             to.
She gives him a kiss. And for a second John's leg is
brushed by a tail. John doesn't react. Just turns and
walks away.




INT./EXT. CHAZ'S TAXI - DAY

Seen through a mild rain is the Theological Society
building, a foreboding structure that looks out of place
for this city. John stares out the back seat window,
takes a swig from a bottle of hard liquor. He turns to
Chaz --

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                         36.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

             I'm sure I can get you in here.
Chaz gives the building another glance, shoves the meter
flag back down. Tick... tick... tick...

                           CHAZ

             Pass.




INT. THEOLOGICAL SOCIETY - LATER

A few bishops talk quietly. A cardinal studies
Scriptures. Definitely not the place for atheists.
John walks through the vaulted chamber room to the --




LIBRARY

John stops, fixes on the two gentlemen standing in front
of a fireplace. One is a young man of pure class wrapped
in Armani's best. The other is Father Garret.
John stands to the side and waits for their conversation
to end. An ATTENDANT makes the rounds.

                           ATTENDANT

             Can I take your coat, Mr.
             Constantine?

                           JOHN

             No thanks, I'm not staying long.

                           ATTENDANT

             How about you, ma'am?
Attendant turns to Angela standing just a few feet away,
her gaze fixed on the same two men.

                           ANGELA

             I'm not staying long either.
John glances over and for the second time they make
contact. Something about her eyes. John stares a bit
too long. Angela looks back toward the fireplace.

                           ANGELA

             My business with him is urgent.

                           JOHN

             First come, first served.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         37.





CONTINUED:


                           ANGELA

             So you're rude no matter where you
             are.
John gives her a look. The two men shake hands and start
to part. John and Angela make their move toward the men.
Both are surprised when Angela goes for Father Garret and
John goes for --
-- the SNOB, officially known as GABRIEL.       Yes, that one.




FATHER GARRET

and Angela have retreated to another area for privacy.

                           ANGELA

             Why is he stalling on this? My
             sister needs a Catholic funeral.

                           FATHER GARRET

             Angela, it's still considered a
             mortal sin --

                           ANGELA

             She didn't commit suicide.

                           FATHER GARRET

             The Bishop has read otherwise.

                           ANGELA

             Father... David -- this is Isabel.
                     (meeting his eyes)
             Please...
Father Garret stares at her, tries to be compassionate.

                           FATHER GARRET

             I'll talk to him again.
But Angela has just lost a load of faith.




BY THE FIREPLACE

Gabriel sits in his chair, watches the fire with
unblinking eyes. John approaches from behind and against
the backdrop of flame, sees the nebulous shape of wings.
The ghostly image is visible for only a heartbeat.

                           GABRIEL

                     (without looking back)
             I know what you want, son.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         38.





CONTINUED:

John sits across from him.

                           JOHN

             Been keeping your all-seeing eye
             on me, have you?

                           GABRIEL

             I could offer how a shepherd leads
             even the most wayward of his flock
             but it might sound disingenuous.

                           JOHN

             So you're going to make me beg?
Angela pauses on her way out, looks over.

                           GABRIEL

             It wouldn't help. You've already
             wasted your chance at redemption.

                           JOHN

             What about the minions I've sent
             back, the souls that I've saved --
             that should guarantee my passage
             across --

                           GABRIEL

                     (keeping it private)
             -- No -- passage requires faith
             and faith by definition is belief
             without proof. You have proof.
             And that means you're not playing
             by the same rules as everyone
             else. Your work has mostly been
             for selfish reasons. I'm sorry.

                           JOHN

             This is bullshit -- bullshit!
Now he's really got Angela's attention.

                           JOHN

             It's like you've got some cosmic
             scale weighing everything we do --
             help an old lady across the
             street -- put in a nickel, kick a
             dog, take out a dime -- you're
             fucking nickel and diming us to
             death down here!

                           GABRIEL

             Keep your voice down.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                     39.





CONTINUED:

John jumps up, leans into his face.

                           JOHN

             And you know what, you're the ones
             with the problem, not us -- You make
             these impossible rules to decide who
             goes up, who goes down and you don't
             even understand us --
This more than anything gets under Gabriel's skin.

                           GABRIEL

             Each of you is born with the
             promise of salvation preordained.
             The cost of your redemption is
             simple belief. And yet you whine
             about impossible rules. Sometimes
             I imagine you hardly deserve the
             gift you have been given.

                           JOHN

             Gift?! More like a curse the way
             you manage things.
Gabriel stands and towers over John.

                           GABRIEL

             I am taking your situation into
             account, John, but don't push me.

                           JOHN

             Why me, Gabriel? It's personal,
             isn't it? I didn't go to church
             enough? I didn't pray enough? I
             was five bucks short in the
             collection plate? Why?
Gabriel moves right up to him, makes this very personal.

                           GABRIEL

             You're going to die because you
             smoked 30 cigarettes a day since
             you were 15. And you're going to
             Hell because of the life you took.
             Or to put it in a way that your kind
             would understand. You're fucked.




EXT. THEOLOGICAL SOCIETY - MINUTES LATER

Angela stands on the porch at the edge of a downpour.
She hears a cough, looks over to see John standing on the
other side, looking equally frayed. They share another
glance.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                          40.





CONTINUED:

John fishes a pack of cigarettes from his pocket.        Empty.

                           JOHN

             He has a rotten sense of humor.
                     (steps past)
             And his punch lines are killers.
John tosses the cigarette pack, walks right into the
RAIN, away from Chaz's taxi pulling up.

                            CHAZ

                      (shouting out)
             John?   It's raining! Hey!
Angela watches John disappear in the rain, looks down at
the empty cigarette pack.

                                          DISSOLVE TO:





INT. HENNESSEY'S APARTMENT - A CIGARETTE PACK

lies on the floor next to food wrappers, Coke bottles and
stacks of newspapers. Hennessey sits amongst the
garbage, slumped over. But he's not sleeping.
He's surfing the ether. Allowing his sixth sense to
guide him. His hands move down and across the stacks of
newer periodicals, fingers probing the layers of
information.
Left hand suddenly stops.
Hennessey's eyes open. He removes the layers of periodicals
on top of his left hand, leans close. Edges his fingers
away and sees an OBITUARY. A name -- Isabel Dodson.




EXT. L.A. STREETS - EVENING

John walks the streets, numb to the world. A rat
scurries past near the curb. Then another. Several
crows fly by.
Above him is a BILLBOARD - "YOUR TIME IS RUNNING OUT."
Doesn't matter that below it is -- "TO BUY A NEW CHEVY."
The point is crystal clear. John shakes his head, breaks
out laughing which quickly turns into a coughing fit.
He leans to a gutter. Another rat scoots past. John
barely notices. Then a frog jumps past. But it's the
crab crawling by that finally catches John's gaze.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        41.





CONTINUED:


                           VOICE OF MAN (O.S.)

             Hey, buddy, you got a light?
John turns, settles on a silhouetted figure standing
behind him, unlit cigarette butt in its mouth.

                           OLD MAN

                     (coughs)
             We gotta stick together, right?
John gathers himself. As he walks over to this OLD MAN,
he rummages through his coat pocket, retrieves a
matchbox.
The box shudders as a high-pitch FLUTTERING filters from
inside. Old Man winces as his entire body VIBRATES.
John realizes -- this is Beeman's matchbox, the one with
the screech beetle inside. And now he knows -- a beat
too late.
Old Man attacks.
John is knocked onto his haunches. As the Old Man closes
in, he's revealed in more detail. Body and face are
actually an intricate puzzle, an assemblage of city
vermin. Rats, insects, crows, frogs, crabs -- all held
together in the shape of a man.
John scampers backwards, just inches from this being's
outstretched grasp. He shakes the matchbox and the
screech beetle inside flutters again.
Old Man/Demon cringes as his entire body vibrates apart
for a second, then snaps back together. He GRABS onto
John with fingers of squirming vermin. Snake wraps
around his wrist. Crab snaps at his skin.
John shakes the beetle box harder -- causing the parts to
vibrate even further. Old Man grabs John's head and
vermin of various leg count crawl right onto John's face.
John's had enough -- shakes the matchbox violently, then
smashes it against the sidewalk.
BEETLE lets out a death SHRIEK and the Old Man
stutters -- his parts vibrating so wildly you can
actually see the b.g. through the seams.
John scampers loose, grabs a road barricade and swings it
with all his might. Old Man form shatters on impact.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                        42.





CONTINUED:

The entire mess collapses to the ground in a flood of
scattering critters. John starts stomping on them as
they scatter into the city.
John stands there, shocked and concerned.      What the hell
is going on?




INT. ANGELA'S APARTMENT - DAY

That surveillance VIDEO FOOTAGE from Ravenscar plays
again. There's Isabel in her nightgown walking across
the roof.
Spread out on a cluttered coffee table is Isabel's case
file. CORONER'S REPORT is opened. Let's see "NO DRUGS
IN SYSTEM" and the biggie -- "Cause of Death -- SUICIDE."
Angela sits on the couch in her robe.      Disheveled and
distraught. She's taking this hard.

                           ANGELA

             I'm sorry, Isabel...
She lowers her head.     And in that brief moment of
silence --

                           ISABEL (V.O.)

                     (on TV)
             Constantine.
Angela snaps back to the TV, freezes in shock.
There's Isabel ready to jump but this time she's looking
right back AT us -- at Angela. Then she's gone.
Angela quickly rewinds the tape and watches the sequence
again. This time Isabel doesn't look back. This time
there is no name. But Angela did see it. Did hear it.
She sits for a second.     Stunned.




INT. MIDNITE'S OFFICE

John paces as Midnite works on that Universal orrery,
adjusting components but balance continues to elude him.

                           JOHN

             A few months, maybe a year.
             That's it. End of story. Game
             over.

                            JOHN (CONT'D)

                      (as Midnite doesn't
                       react)
             Well, don't break down on my
             account.

                           MIDNITE

             What do you want from me?   A
             shoulder to cry on?

                           JOHN

             This bastard attacked me right out
             in the open -- on Sepulveda no
             less.

                           MIDNITE

             They don't like you, John. You've
             deported how many back to Hell?

                           JOHN

             That's just it -- this wasn't some
             possession or wayward half breed,
             it was a full-fledged demon.
             Here. On our plane.

                           MIDNITE

             Right.

                           JOHN

             I know what I saw.

                           MIDNITE

             You must have just crossed over
             and didn't even realize it --

                           JOHN

             I didn't cross over -- It was on
             this side. Here.

                           MIDNITE

             -- it's wet out, you're wandering
             around aimlessly, not to mention
             completely emotional --

                           JOHN

             Emotional?!
John slams a fist against the counter. The orrery almost
topples but Midnite saves it. Decades of work almost
lost.
Midnite glares at a desperate John.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         44.





CONTINUED:


                           MIDNITE

             Okay, so you saw something. We've
             seen a few small ones slip through
             now and then.

                           JOHN

             It's more than that... first the
             girl, then this.

                           MIDNITE

             John, you know my connections.
             Any shifts or tremors in the
             planes and I'd hear about it.
John just shakes his head, looks up -- convinced.

                           JOHN

             Something's coming.
Midnite sighs, gives up with him.




INT. LAPD OFFICE - LATER

The name JOHN CONSTANTINE is center screen on a
monitor -- typed into the police station's SEARCH ENGINE.
Angela sits alone in the squad room, rain streaking
across the windows.
Interpol comes back with results and a list of priors
scroll under John's name.
Must be a hundred PARKING VIOLATIONS. Several SPEEDING
tickets and a few RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT. In fact John's
license has been REVOKED.
But it's the other incidents that draw Angela in.

BRIEF CLOSEUPS

Of specific words in a few HEADLINES -- "Occult activity
on the rise..." "Claimed possession is refuted by
Bishop..." "Satanic cult dissolved..."
Accompanies with an assortment of unusual case photos.
-- BLOOD PATTERNS on a WALL -- Odd SYMBOLS burned into a
ceiling. A cross burnt to a crisp.
-- JOHN in handcuffs looking back at a mother holding her
son in her arms. A younger and more noble Father
Hennessey stands beside them, looking grateful.

                                                (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Another line -- "INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE to PROSECUTE."
Angela scrolls, sees cities listed where John has made
waves -- LONDON -- PARIS -- ROME -- BUDAPEST -- MOSCOW.
Stops on the one that matters -- LOS ANGELES. And
there's an address.
Angela hits PRINT and the HP HUMS away.
A desk PHONE RINGS. Angela quickly looks around, sees
she's the only one here. She gets up, answers it.

                            ANGELA

             L.A.P.D.   This is Dodson, hello?
Dead air. The next PHONE RINGS. Angela reaches for it
when the NEXT ONE RINGS, and the NEXT, the NEXT.
The RINGS HOP phone to phone in intimidating mockery.
Angela freezes, forces herself to stay calm.     Sure
enough, the RINGS abruptly CEASE.
Angela reaches over, rips the page from the printer,
leaves.




INT. ISTANBUL AIRPORT - DAY

A police guard scans passengers and a printout of the
Prisoner. He walks past a man standing in the metal
detector line.
This is actually the Prisoner wearing the clothes and
glasses of the Driver. Is that a blood stain on the
lapel?
Sweat drops from his forehead and he nervously places the
iron relic in a bag he took from the truck driver. He
has no choice but to place it on the conveyer belt.




MYSTERIOUS POV

Watching the Prisoner.      He looks back AT us, suspicious.
Nothing there.




PRISONER

looks back nervously, as his bag goes through the
detector.




                                                         46.





DETECTOR SCREEN

shows the folds of the bag, a wallet, a passport and
nothing else. The iron relic doesn't even produce an
outline.
Bag slides out, untouched. Prisoner can't believe his
luck, grabs the bag and walks on toward the gates.




EXT. LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

VARIOUS of the city -- the contrasts between the bright
and cheerful and the dark and mysterious. That abandoned
mission behind Bob's Big Boy, the Islamic Temple wedged
between competing banks.

COME TO REST ON --

The towering statue of The Good Shepherd. His hands are
welcoming us into the "HOLY CROSS CEMETERY."
Right across the street is the 20 Lanes Bowling Alley.




INT. 20 LANES - THE BAR

John drinks alone.   Pissed at life.      At death.
That small black box of his lies on the table unopened.
Spider runs across the table. John flips an empty glass,
traps it underneath. He takes a drag on his cigarette,
tips the glass and blows smoke inside. Spider can't
escape the poison air, bumps the glass. Trapped. Dying.

                        JOHN

          Welcome to my life.

                        ANGELA (O.S.)

          Mr. Constantine?
John looks up, spots Angela.        Those eyes again.

                        ANGELA

          I saw you at --

                           JOHN

          -- I remember.

                           ANGELA

          And --

                           JOHN

          Yeah.

She did make an impression.

                           ANGELA

             I'd like to ask you a few
             questions.

                           JOHN

             I'm not really in the talking mood
             right now.

                           ANGELA

             Could you just listen then?
Angela sets her LAPD detective badge on the table.

                           ANGELA

             Please?

                           JOHN

             Always a catch...
Angela sits across from him, puts the badge away.

                           ANGELA

             My sister was murdered last week.

                           JOHN

             Sorry to hear...

                           ANGELA

             Her name was Isabel.   Isabel
             Dodson?
She looks for a reaction.     None.

                           ANGELA

             You don't remember her?

                           JOHN

             Never met her.

                           ANGELA

             You sure?

                           JOHN

             She look anything like you?
                     (as Angela nods)
             I would've remembered.
Another beat as their eyes meet.       John looks away.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         48.

                           ANGELA

             She was a patient at Ravenscar.
             Then last Tuesday she just decided
             to step off the roof.

                           JOHN

             I thought you said she was murdered?

                           ANGELA

             Isabel would never take her own life.

                           JOHN

             You'd be surprised at what people
             will do.

                           ANGELA

             Look, I know I'm not making much
             sense -- hell I'm not really sure
             what I'm doing here... I just
             feel -- the circles you travel
             in -- the occult, demonology,
             exorcisms...
John just stares at that spider in the glass.       Trapped.

                           ANGELA

             I believe someone got to her, Mr.
             Constantine, brainwashed her into
             stepping off that roof. Some kind
             of legion or cult.

                           JOHN

             Sounds like a theory.   Good luck.

                           ANGELA

             Well I thought with your
             background and experience, you
             could at least point me in the
             right direction.

                            JOHN

             Yeah, okay.   Sure.
John points -- toward the exit.      Angela is not amused.
But she's not giving up.

                           ANGELA

             My sister always talked about a
             world better than this. Heaven as
             some call it. She wasn't afraid
             of dying because she knew it was
             waiting for her. What everyone
             fails to grasp is that if she had
             really taken her own life --

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                       49.





CONTINUED:


                            JOHN

             -- she would have committed a
             mortal sin and her soul would have
             gone straight to Hell where it
             would never feel love or
             compassion or anything but pain
             again as the master himself rips
             her apart over and over for the
             rest of eternity.
                     (beat)
             That about right?
The words have hit so hard that Angela is speechless.
John sees the hurt in her eyes, would like to take it
back -- but it's too late.
She turns and starts out, slows --

                           ANGELA

             You're not the only one afraid of
             Hell.
John tries not to let that get to him. She leaves. He
glances out the window, watches her pass by. So long.
Good riddance.
But something's not right. Those deep shadows on the
buildings seem to be moving. John watches, confused,
realizes they're heading in Angela's direction.

                           JOHN

             Oh shit...
He stands, gains his bearings. As he walks out he flicks
the glass over. Spider runs free.




EXT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT

Cars are lined all the way down the street. Angela walks
along the sidewalk unaware of the shadow following her.
It's joined by another in the trees -- both closing in
with each step.

                           JOHN (O.S.)

             Detective!
Angela looks back, sees John in the street.

                           JOHN

             How open is your mind?

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                         50.





CONTINUED:

She doesn't answer, continues walking. What she doesn't
see are the shadows seeping back into the fringes. But
John does. He starts walking toward her.

                           JOHN

             Do you believe in Heaven and Hell?
                     (off no answer)
             How about what comes out of each?
Angela keeps walking.      He catches up with her.

                           JOHN

             Hey!

                           ANGELA

             You mean like angels?

                           JOHN

             And demons.
Angela stares at him, continues walking.       He keeps up.

                           JOHN

             See, you don't have the mindset
             for this kind of work.
They walk together down the lonely street.

                           ANGELA

             Look, I see terrible things every
             day. A mother drowns her baby. A
             ten-year-old shoots his father.
             But it's not demons, it's the evil
             that men do.
Behind them, a streetlight BLINKS OUT. Then another.
They're not looking back so they don't see it.

                           JOHN

             You're right, we're capable of
             terrible things but we usually
             justify it with motives like money
             and power and jealousy.
Another LIGHT FIZZES, blinks out.

                           JOHN

             Then sometimes, something comes
             along and gives us just the right
             nudge and we do truly evil things
             just for the kick of it.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                             51.





CONTINUED:


                           ANGELA

             I don't believe in demons.

                            JOHN

             You should.   They believe in us.
They pass another streetlamp as it goes bright, then
blacks out. Both look up.
The next LAMP FLARES then FIZZES OUT.
Angela turns and sees that there are no lights behind
them. She looks to John. But he's staring straight
ahead. Because now the light in front of them is FLARING

BRIGHT.


                           JOHN

             We should go...
Second later it BLINKS OFF.         John grabs her hand --

                             JOHN

             Fast.
Angela's confusion turns to tension as a raspy guttural
WIND races toward them.
John jerks her into action. They run towards the next
light. It blinks out right when they reach it.
They race to stay in the light, aiming toward the safety
of the brightly-lit statue of the Good Shepherd.




EXT. HOLY CROSS CEMETERY

They make it through the gate, pass through an alley of
overhanging trees. Something RIPPLES through the
branches -- flitters right past Angela's face. She swats
at it, manages to get a branch across the cheek.
They near the Good Shepherd and the floodlights FLICKER,
fade out. Statues of saints become dark monoliths.
John stops in an OPEN AREA between trees and a mausoleum.
A lit CROSS on the wall provides the only illumination.
Angela feels the scratch on her cheek, sees a trickle of
blood. Now she hears SOUNDS in the darkness. Like
LEATHER RUBBING. Surrounding them.

                             ANGELA

             What is that?

                                                  (CONTINUED)





                                                         52.





CONTINUED:

John is just as surprised he's saying this --

                           JOHN

             Wings.

                           ANGELA

             Wings?
John rummages through his trench coat -- fishes out that
cloth Beeman gave him. The one supposedly wrapped around
Moses.

                           JOHN

             And maybe talons.
The cross is getting dimmer and dimmer...

                           ANGELA

             Are you kidding? Of what?

                           JOHN

             Something that's not supposed to
             be here.
John quickly wraps the cloth tight around his hand.
Angela spins, eyes seeing only darkness as the sounds get
CLOSER -- ghastly sound of MOVEMENT in the fringes of
light.
The cross now resembles a dying wire filament and with
every second the circle of light gets smaller and those
SOUNDS GET CLOSER. John takes out his special lighter.

                           JOHN

             Close your eyes.
They are now standing in pitch darkness.

                           ANGELA

             Why?

                           JOHN

             Suit yourself.
John flicks the lighter and in one powerful motion --
sweeps his arm up as he lights his hand.
Sacred cloth catches fire -- then IGNITES with a
brilliant retina-searing FLASH -- blinding Angela and
illuminating a --
-- CIRCLE OF WINGED DEMONS -- a roiling broth of
reptilian death -- right there -- ready to pounce.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         53.





CONTINUED:

RED FLAME radiates from the cloth and DEMONS SHRIEK as
they are instantly vaporized.
John tucks his burning hand into a coat pocket,
extinguishes the flame. He leans down to a rubbery stain
left from one of the burnt demon carcasses. Shakes his
head in disbelief.

                           JOHN

                     (to himself)
             'I accidentally crossed over?'    I
             don't think so.

                           ANGELA

                     (coming up behind)
             What was that? I saw wings -- and
             teeth -- they were flying. What
             the hell were those things?!

                           JOHN

             They weren't angels.
John scans the area, trying to think this through.

                           JOHN

             Seplavites, actually. Scavengers
             for the damned.
                     (off her lost look)
             Demons?

                           ANGELA

             What? You can't be serious...
             this is impossible...

                           JOHN

             Yeah...
                     (to himself)
             And I don't think they were after
             me...
John looks at her with renewed interest.

                           JOHN

             You really believe she wouldn't
             commit suicide?

                           ANGELA

                     (a bit thrown)
             My sister?
                     (a beat)
             Never in a million years.
John makes the decision.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        54.





CONTINUED:


                             JOHN

             Let's be sure.
He starts walking.     Angela is now compelled to follow.

                             ANGELA

             How?

                            JOHN

             Simple.   See if she's in Hell.




EXT. L.A. COUNTY MORGUE - NIGHT

Not exactly an inviting place.
Hennessey steps off the curb, looks up at his
destination.




INT. ANGELA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

John stares at a photo of Angela and her father in police
uniform. Obviously happier times.
Angela walks out of her bedroom holding a cardboard box.
That gray cat follows close to her heels.

                           ANGELA

             These are all Isabel's things.

                             JOHN

             The cat too?

                             ANGELA

             Yeah, why...?
John ignores the box of items, picks up the cat. He
studies it a bit, then sits back in a chair with it.

                           ANGELA

             Don't you need candles and a
             pentagram for this to work?

                           JOHN

                     (deadpan)
             Why, do you have any?
John puts his feet, shoes and all into a BUCKET OF WATER.

                           JOHN

             I need you to step outside now.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                      55.





CONTINUED:

Angela wants to stay.

                            JOHN

             Angela?   Please.
Angela reluctantly moves toward the exit. John holds the
cat, stares into its huge, unblinking eyes. There's a
moment where animal and man seem to connect.
The water around John's feet begins to BOIL.
ANGELA pushes the door closed behind her but it slows on
its way to latch.
Bulbs pulsate as current ramps down. The room flickers,
is suddenly caught in a ghostly dim half-light and John
has now crossed over into --




APARTMENT IN HELL

Same layout, different decorator. John takes a deep,
raspy breath, slowly stands. He turns to the wall behind
him which is torn away, looking like some half-bombed
structure in Beirut.
Beyond the wall is no longer the blackness of a
nightscape but a sickly sepia glow. Not quite day, not
quite night.
John steps over the crumbling wall into --




EXT. HELL LOS ANGELES

John walks out onto the top overpass of a crumbling maze
of intersecting freeways. Burnt-out husks of long-
forgotten vehicles sit in rows of gridlock. A low DRONE
penetrates the silence.

                             JOHN

             Is she here?
On the horizon is a dying RED SUN.    It strains to cut
through the putrid brown haze.

                             JOHN

             Is she here?!
His VOICE REVERBERATES to infinity.

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                          56.





CONTINUED:

John cautiously steps closer to the railing, looks down
to the ribbons of twisting streets below. They're
crammed with teeming masses of the damned. All walking
down in silence, faces numb with sorrow and grief.

                              JOHN


             IS SHE HERE?!

That low DRONE RISES IN PITCH and John now spots a huge
blanket-like BLACKNESS crawling over the cityscape,
rapidly closing in on him. You get the feeling this
isn't a safe place for the living.

                            JOHN

             It's a simple question!    Is she
             here or not?!!
John suddenly locks on something far off.
On top of a distant skyscraper is a FEMALE FIGURE in a
sheer white gown. John can't make out her face but knows
she's looking right at him.

                              JOHN

             Isabel?
She lifts something and tosses it. John watches as a
small object tumbles toward him just ahead of closing
darkness.




INT. ANGELA'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY

In that same motion we left her in -- Angela finishes
pushing the door closed. As it LATCHES --

                           JOHN (O.S.)

                     (weakly)
             Angela... come back in...
Confused, Angela pushes the door back open. Cat BOLTS
out. Angela catches her breath, moves inside.




INT. LIVING ROOM

John sits slumped in the chair, drained. Steam rises off
his skin. Angela sees the water in the bucket has almost
all boiled out. She walks in, kneels down to him.

                              ANGELA

             John?     What happened?

Sweat drips off as he looks up. He opens his palm --
reveals to Angela a simple HOSPITAL BAND. The name
"ISABEL DODSON" is typed on it.
Even as a semi-convert, this news completely floors
Angela. She takes the plastic band -- grips it tight --
tries to hold herself together. The adrenaline and pain
overwhelm. Her knee buckle and she drops to the floor.
John watches, isn't sure how to help. He finally reaches
out a single hand -- slowly rests it on her shoulder.
The contact seems to open a floodgate of emotion and
Angela falls right into his arms. John hasn't been this
close to anyone in a long time. Angela finally composes
herself.

                            ANGELA

             How?   How did you do this...?
John tries not to stare into those eyes too long.     Fails.




INT. L.A. COUNTY MORGUE - NIGHT

Body drawer slides open -- reveals Isabel. Lying in a
cold, sterile room of death. A Hell of a different type.
Hennessey stares down at her, looks around the room
again, makes sure he's still alone.
He reaches in, rips open the protective plastic and
lowers his hand inside. Places it first on her forehead.
Nothing. Then on her chest. Nothing. Wrist is last.
Hennessey shudders. This is it.
He closes his eyes and opens himself to the void --

                           JOHN (V.O.)

             When I was a kid, I saw things...




FLASHBACK - EXT. STREET - DAY

A TEN-YEAR-OLD John comes out of a corner store with milk
in a bag. He slows, eyes a MAN at a mailbox.

                           JOHN (V.O.)

             Things I wasn't supposed to.
The man looks right at young John as he passes. His face
is distorted and his feet have sprouted roots which are
dug into the ground.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                           WAITRESS (O.S.)

             Coffee?
Young John looks up toward the voice --




INT. DINER - NIGHT (PRESENT)

John looks up at the Waitress.

                           JOHN

             Tea.
She leaves. Angela sits across from him.      They're at the
table by the window.

                           JOHN

             My parents sent me to a doctor, a
             shrink, a priest. I was in four
             different institutions by the time
             I was eighteen.
Angela notes him rubbing his wrist.

                            JOHN

             The last place they put me was run
             by a church...
A DOCTOR rushes past their table.     PAN WITH him INTO...




FLASHBACK - INT. MENTAL INSTITUTION - HALLWAY

The Doctor rushes toward distant SCREAMING.

                           JOHN (V.O.)

             The revered Father made the
             brilliant deduction that I was
             possessed, said I needed to be
             exorcised...




INT. ROOM - HIGH ANGLE

The Doctor runs in. Sees the revered Father below,
leaning over a bed where an 18-year-old John is held down
by three interns and that Doctor. John angrily screams
at them all.

                           JOHN (V.O.)

             It was like someone trying to pull
             teeth that weren't there.
Young John clamps his eyes shut tight.




                                                      59.





INT. DINER - JOHN (PRESENT)

Present-day John does the same, remembering the pain.

                        JOHN

          So I took things into my own hands
          and I found a way out.

                        ANGELA

          You attempted suicide.
John sees she's looking at his wrist. The hint of a
jagged scar can now be seen under the sleeve.

                        JOHN

          I never attempt anything.
John's reflection in the window becomes --




FLASHBACK - TEENAGE JOHN

kneeling with a pair off scissors.     He's inside a...




INT. CLASSROOM

Teenage John looks up at a room filled with people from
all walks of life. Teachers, doctors, lawyers, garbage
men. All somewhat different than normal. They sit in
school chairs and wait for John to do the deed.
He puts the blade to his wrist -- one swipe and the world
around him accelerates away in a STREAKED BLUR --




INT. DINER (PRESENT)


                        ANGELA

          But you're still here.    Alive.

                           JOHN

          Not my doing.
His chest suddenly HEAVES forward -- and we're on...




FLASHBACK - TEENAGE JOHN

as he's jolted by DEFIB PADS.     He's in the back of a...




INT. AMBULANCE - MOVING

Paramedics are soaked in sweat. One looks a bit like a
young Dr. Archer. Heart monitor is FLAT LINE. There's
little hope.




                                                     60.





EXT. LOS ANGELES

The ambulance moves through a city that is transforming.
From this world's Los Angeles to a barren Hell version.

                        JOHN (V.O.)

          Officially I was dead for seven
          minutes. But believe me, seven
          minutes in Hell is a lifetime.
Ambulance heads toward that dying RED SUN.




INT. AMBULANCE

FLAT LINE on the monitor suddenly SPIKES with a pulse --




INT. MORGUE (PRESENT)

Hennessey's hand jerks back from the plastic. His eyes
fix on Isabel's wrist. That odd circular SYMBOL is back.
Hennessey's unsettled, quickly shoves the drawer closed.
He rushes out, slams right into a SECURITY GUARD coming
in.

                        SECURITY GUARD

          Hey, what're you doing in here?
Guard looks back into the body room, sees a drawer
partially open. He walks over, pulls it out further --
sees the plastic cut away. Jesus.
The symbol has already faded from Isabel's wrist.

                        JOHN (V.O.)

          When I returned I didn't just see
          demons anymore, I could do the one
          thing they couldn't -- come and go
          as I please.




EXT. MORGUE - HENNESSEY

runs as fast as a very obese man can -- aiming for that
PHONE BOOTH on the corner. He grabs the receiver,
punches numbers as fast as he can. RING -- RING --

RING --


                        HENNESSEY

          Be there, John... please...
Something shivers up Hennessey's leg and into his body.
Eyes glaze over and Hennessey settles on a RESTAURANT.

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                        61.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN (V.O.)

             Heaven and Hell are right here,
             behind every wall, every face --
             the world behind the world. It's
             crossing over that's the real
             trick. That's why most demons can
             only whisper in our ears. But
             even a whisper can turn your
             favorite pleasure into your worst
             nightmare.




INT. LATE NIGHT RESTAURANT

HENNESSEY barges in, squeezes past the MAITRE D'.

                           MAITRE D'

             Sir, you need a reservation!
But Hennessey is on a quest.     For food.   And it's
everywhere.
He starts grabbing meals right off of plates. Fish,
pasta, prime rib. Shovels it all in. Patrons are
yelling -- screaming. He's eating as if his life
depended on it. And even though he's devouring anything
in sight, this huge man is wasting away before our eyes.
In the middle of all this chaos is one customer calmly
eating his meal. Balthazar.
Hennessey hijacks a food cart -- consumes everything on
it yet his skin is getting looser and the body inside
gets thinner.
He grabs a steak from a woman's plate but she jerks it
back so he bites into his arm. She screams as her
husband pulls her away.
Hennessey's strength is withering away. Desperate, he
grabs a FORK, digs it into his own hand.
A Hispanic BUSBOY rushes into the room, grabs onto
Hennessey.

                           JOHN (V.O.)

             But the worst demons are the ones
             that are allowed to be here -- the
             ones that are half-human so they
             blend in...
Balthazar stands, throws a few bills on the table and
starts toward the back EXIT.

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                         62.

                           JOHN (V.O.)

             ... just like those with the
             angel's touch living alongside of
             us. The half-breeds.
That Busboy lowers Hennessey to the floor. For a moment
we see him framed against the front doorway. And in that
instant we get a brief glimpse of --




ALTERNATE LOS ANGELES

An incredible pristine lake reflecting a city of light.




BACK TO SCENE

BUSBOY looks up, meets Balthazar's eyes. Bitter enemies.
Balthazar grins, flips that coin between his fingers. He
leaves out the back exit.

                           JOHN (V.O.)

             They call it 'the Balance.' I
             call it hypocritical bullshit.




INT. DINER


                           JOHN

             So when one of them gets a little
             cocky, peddles their influence or
             hijacks a soul -- I deport their
             scaly ass right back to Hell.
                     (takes a sip of tea)
             I don't get them all but maybe
             enough to insure my retirement.

                           ANGELA

             Sounds like you're trying to buy
             your way into Heaven.

                           JOHN

             Well, what would you do if you
             were sentenced to a prison where
             half the inmates were put there by
             you?
Not a serene image at all.     Angela studies him.

                           ANGELA

             Why you? I mean many go to Hell,
             why were you able to escape?

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          63.

                     (sips tea)
             I don't know.

                           ANGELA

             God has a plan for all of us.

                           JOHN

             Not for me.
John's bitterness is obvious.     Angela just stares at
him -- finally --

                           ANGELA

             Isabel saw things too.
John looks up. Moment is lost when her CELLULAR RINGS.
The cop in her reacts, flips it open.

                           ANGELA

             Detective Dodson here.




EXT. RESTAURANT - LATER

The morgue is seen across the street.     The Guard that
chased Hennessey is just outside.

                           WEISS (O.S.)

             Security Guard spotted him near
             the body, chased him out.
We MOVE PAST Angela standing with Weiss.       Around them is
a complete shambles of fine dining --

                           WEISS

             He comes over here, makes a run at
             the entire menu and pow --
             deflates like a fricken Macy's day
             balloon.
-- COME TO REST ON John's shattered face. He stares down
at Hennessey. Now yards of loose flesh sunken over an
assemblage of bones. Only that ragged black tie he wore
is familiar now.
John leans down to the remains of his friend. A cop
starts to intervene but Angela blocks him. Let him be.
John has trouble taking this in, reluctantly reaches into
Hennessey's coat pocket -- finds the protective amulet he
himself removed from his friend. That's even more
crushing.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                    64.

                           JOHN

             Shit...
                     (sympathetic)
             Why didn't you call me, you fat
             sonna bitch...
John lowers his head, then spots blood stains on one of
Hennessey's hands. He opens the fingers, studies the
fork wound. The blood is already drying over it.
John reaches over to the mess of dishes on the floor and
grabs a melting ice cube.
He pushes it into Hennessey's hand, wiping away the dried
blood. It quickly becomes apparent -- this isn't random
stabbings. This is a shape.
John takes a napkin, lays it on the palm and presses.
Residual blood creates a symbol onto the napkin.
It's the same circular symbol we saw on Isabel's wrist.
John doesn't know what it is, but he knows it's important.

                           JOHN

                     (to Hennessey)
             Rest in peace, Father.




INT. 20 LANES - BEHIND THE LANES

With a loud crowd and 20 huge PIN MACHINES GRINDING AWAY
the noise back here is DEAFENING. But this is Beeman's
home. See the desk, the TV. The fold-away bed.
Beeman is on the phone. There's a conversation but it's
way too noisy to hear. All we see are the emotions on
Beeman's face. No doubt news of Hennessey's death is one
of the biggies.
Beeman quickly reaches for a marker, puts it to paper and
starts drawing -- listening and drawing --
He's finished, hangs up. Stares at the Symbol. That
cabinet with the ancient books now gets his attention.

                           JOHN (V.O.)

             I need to see where Isabel died.




EXT. EAST LA - NIGHT

Graffiti-adorned walls give way to a tall iron fence,
heavily-shadowed grounds and finally the six-story
hospital complex of RAVENSCAR.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                         65.





CONTINUED:

A rim-lit figure stands on the roof. But this one isn't
wearing a hospital gown, he's wearing a trench coat.

                           ANGELA (V.O.)

             Seances, crystals -- channeling...
             Our father thought she was just
             trying to get attention. She
             certainly did that.




EXT. ROOFTOP

Angela stands behind John. A large water tank is
anchored to the roof next to her. Note the FLAME logo.

                           ANGELA

             She'd tell everyone about things
             she said she saw. Crazy things.
             Things that hadn't happened yet.
             She'd scare my mother to death,
             talking on and on about
             Revelations and the end of the
             world. Then one day she just
             stopped... never said another
             word.

                           JOHN

             So you put her in here.
Angela doesn't need to be reminded.     It hurts even more now.

                           JOHN

             Show me her room.




INT. CORRIDOR

John and Angela head toward Isabel's room. A NURSE
appears from around the corner walking with a boy. It's
Barry, the boy in the courtyard.
He locks on Angela and when she makes eye contact he
breaks away from the Nurse, runs toward her with arms
outstretched.

                           NURSE

             Barry!
He runs right into Angela's arms, hugs her tight. Angela
is totally baffled. John is thoroughly intrigued.

                           NURSE

             Oh God...

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         66.





CONTINUED:

She rushes in, gently tugs the boy away.

                           NURSE

             No, Barry, that's not Isabel.
Barry stares at Angela. He reaches out, touches her
face, confused. Nurse pulls him back even further.

                           NURSE

             I'm sorry. They were friends. He
             kind of had a crush on your sister.
Angela nods, understanding. The Nurse leads Barry away.
He doesn't take his eyes off Angela the entire time.
Neither does John.

                           JOHN

             You were twins.
Angela nods, steps inside.      John pauses, thinking.




INT. ISABEL'S ROOM

John steps inside, gives the sterile room a thorough
scan.

                            JOHN

             So how long?

                            ANGELA

             Two months.
                     (beat)
             This time.
He pulls out a drawer, looks at the bottom.

                           ANGELA

             I already did all that.
John runs his hands under the steel bed frame.

                           ANGELA

             Now you're insulting me.

                           JOHN

             You don't walk off a building
             without leaving something behind.

                           ANGELA

             You saw everything she left
             behind. In that box.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                          67.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

             Maybe she left something else.
             Something more personal. Just for
             you.
Angela doesn't like that look he's giving her.

                           JOHN

             You were her twin, Angela.    Twins
             tend to think alike.

                           ANGELA

             I'm not like my sister.

                           JOHN

             But you were at once time. When
             you were kids. When you'd spend
             every waking hour with each other.
             You'd start a sentence, she'd
             finish it. You'd get hurt, she'd
             cry.

                           ANGELA

             That was a long time ago...

                           JOHN

             That kind of bond doesn't just
             disappear.

                           ANGELA

             There's nothing here.
Angela seems unbalanced.     John gets more aggressive.

                           JOHN

             She planned her death in this
             room, she thought it up right
             where you're standing --
Angela backs away.     John advances.

                           JOHN

             She knew you'd come -- She counted
             on you to see what she saw, to
             feel what she felt -- to do what
             she did. What did she do, Angela?

                           ANGELA

             How should I know?

                           JOHN

             What did she do, Angela?

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          68.





CONTINUED:


                             ANGELA

             I don't know!

                           JOHN

             What would you do?
Angela backs into a wall.       Nowhere else to go now.

                           JOHN

             What would you leave her? What
             would it be? Where would it be?!
             Where would it be?
Angela lashes out, shoves John hard, pushing him out of
her way. She turns to the window, almost hyperventilating.
John stays back, watches. Angela opens her eyes. The
tension seems to flow right out of her when she sees --

                             ANGELA

             The tree.




EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT

A lone tree stands in the center of the lit courtyard.
John and Angela approach it. Examine it. Nothing. John
drops lower on the tree, to a child's height.   Finally
sees something near the ground, gestures to Angela.
She kneels down next to him, sees what he sees.
That same SYMBOL. The one Hennessey carved into his
hand. But this time there's more.

                           ANGELA

                     (trying to
                      rationalize)
             There must have been a tree in our
             backyard... when we were kids...
John may not be buying it but he's not saying anything.
His fingers trace these words carved below the symbol --

                             JOHN


             'COR 14:01.'


                             ANGELA

             Cor?

                             JOHN

             Corinthians.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                    69.





CONTINUED:


                           ANGELA

                     (shaking her head)
             There is no 14h act in Corinthians.
John's face goes pale --

                           JOHN

             I need a church.




INT. HOSPITAL CHAPEL - MINUTES LATER

Several families sit in solemn prayer. The pastor
comforts a man and wife. John and Angela slip through,
head for the shelves of reference books on the back wall.
They whisper.

                           JOHN

             Corinthians goes to 21 acts in the
             book of Ethenius. It's like a
             dark mirror of the Bible. It
             paints a different view of
             Revelations, says that the world
             will not come to an end at the
             hand of God but be reborn in the
             embrace of the damned.

                           ANGELA

             There's a difference?

                           JOHN

             Depends on which side of the fence
             you're standing.
John stops, casually sticks his hand in the pastor's bowl
of holy water near the altar.

                           ANGELA

             So why haven't I seen this book
             before?

                           JOHN

             Because it doesn't exist here on
             this side.
John closes his eyes and the water in the bowl begins to

BOIL --


                           ANGELA (O.S.)

             What do you mean --
Flickering candlelight slows to a stop, catching Angela
mid-question and the room in that dim half-light.
John turns and is inside --




                                                     70.





SAME CHAPEL - HELL

The epitome of blasphemy -- A church in Hell. Only they
don't worship God in here. And that's not Christ on the
cross. And those stained glass windows are now slate
black.
John is now facing books with completely different
markings. He searches as a DRONE rises in pitch and an
INKY BLACKNESS begins to flow down the walls, getting
closer to John with each heartbeat.
He finds the book, steps back as he closes his eyes --




REGULAR CHAPEL


                        ANGELA

          -- not here on this side?
John turns, covered in sweat. He's holding a book she's
never seen, is already flipping through it.

                        ANGELA

          Where did that come from?

                        JOHN

                  (stopping to read)
          13:29. 13:30 -- Here...
          Corinthians 14:01...
                  (skimming to this)
          'The sins of the father would only
          be exceeded by the ego of the
          son.'

                        ANGELA

          Whose son?
John stands, his brain going into overdrive.

                        JOHN

          Symbol isn't a demon's... that's
          why I couldn't place it... not a
          normal possession...

                        ANGELA

          John, what are you talking about?

                        JOHN

          But he can't cross over --
          impossible for the son to cross
          over...

                         ANGELA

          Whose son?   God's?

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                       71.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

             No.  The other one.
                     (off her look)
             Lucifer had a son too.




INT. 20 LANES - BEHIND THE LANES

Beeman sits under the glow of a desk lamp. The narrow
alley of machines stretches out behind him. He stares
into the scrolls -- an ancient book with a single page
folded a thousand times. Turns another page.




BOWLING AREA

Amazing how disturbing a bowling alley is when it's
closed. Rows of empty lanes stretching into darkness,
the unlit pin areas looking like the jaws of an army of
beasts.

                           BEEMAN (O.S.)

             Oh my...




BEHIND THE LANES

Beeman has stopped turning pages. That's because he's
now staring at an etching of the same symbol. Below are
ink drawings of a ghastly beast rising up through a body.
But it's what's above the beast that is most troubling.
A figure on a cross -- his arms outstretched -- seemingly
welcoming the beast into this world.

                           BEEMAN

             This is not good...
BOWLING BALL hits a lane.     Beeman spins to the sound.
BALL ROLLS round and round, closer and closer until it
CLANGS dead against the back wall of one of the lanes.
Beeman gets up, starts down the corridor of dormant pin
machines.
He stops at lane 13, leans way way down, past the
machinery and peeks out the pin hole.

                           BEEMAN

             John?




                                                     72.





EXT. LA STREETS - NIGHT

Angela's SUV races quickly through traffic while John
gets her up to speed.

                         JOHN (V.O.)

           The myth says Mammon was conceived
           before his father's fall from
           grace but was born after.




INT. SUV


                         JOHN

           But unlike his old man, he's never
           been in the presence of the Creator
           so he has no fear of him, no respect
           either. That goes double for us --
           God's most prized creations. Mammon
           would be the last demon we'd ever
           want crossing over.

                         ANGELA

           But demons can't come and go,
           that's what you said.

                         JOHN

           Unless they found a bridge.
                   (off her look)
           Some psychic with the chops to
           reach all the way to Hell and the
           grit to withstand whatever shit
           she'd pull out.

                          ANGELA

           Isabel...

                         JOHN

           But even a bridge wouldn't help
           Mammon. Because to cross over, the
           myth says he'd still need the one
           thing he could never get. Divine
           assistance. The help of God.
Angela sits back, letting that sink in.

                         ANGELA

           So it's impossible.

                         JOHN

           Impossible? Sure it's impossible.
           That's what makes it so dangerous.
           These things exist to break the
           rules, to find the loopholes. If
           the past is any indication, then
           the future isn't on our side.

                                            (CONTINUED)





                                                         73.





CONTINUED:

John sits back, gut churning.       Angela's in detective mode.

                          ANGELA

             She knew. That's why she killed
             herself. But it doesn't make
             sense...

                           JOHN

             Makes sense to me.

                           ANGELA

             John, she sacrificed herself to
             beat him.
John nods.     Your point?

                           ANGELA

             Why is she in Hell?
One of those rare moments where John has no answer.




INT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY

Something small and SHINY is rolling down the alley.      It
lands in the trough, spins round and round --
Beeman leans out to try and see what it is.      The silver
object keeps spinning.
He waits for it to stop, swats a fly near his face.      Then
another.
Book on his desk ignites in flame.




EXT. 20 LANES - NIGHT

SUV pulls into the empty parking lot. John is out before
Angela gets it in park, unlocks the side door. A few
flies escape to freedom as he opens the door. John
rushes in.




INT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY

Only a LOW HUM pervades the dead stillness of the alley.

                             JOHN

             Beeman?
John grabs the door that leads behind the pin area.      It's
locked from the other side.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         74.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

                     (pounds on door)
             Hey, Beeman? Beeman?!
The LOW HUM fluctuates -- sounds like a BUZZING.

                           ANGELA

             Maybe he's not here.

                           JOHN

             He's always here.
Several more flies flit by him. This time John notices,
turns and spots the source of the HUM -- a cloud of FLIES
near the center aisles. Angela follows his gaze, spots
them as well.

                           ANGELA

             What?
John heads across the lanes. Swarm gets thicker and
thicker. Angela keeps up with him, covers her mouth.
They approach the pin area of the center lane. The
source of the swarm is slowly revealed. In the catch
trough is a solid mound of flies.
John leans closer, spots a HAND protruding from the
mound.

                           JOHN

             Oh Jesus, no --
He rips his coat off, flings it at the mound and million
flies scatter -- revealing the body of Beeman. Ravaged.
Flies pouring out of his mouth, his ears --

                           ANGELA

                     (stepping back)
             Oh God --
John goes ballistic, screams to the walls --

                           JOHN

             Who are you?! Answer me!!
             Goddamit -- reveal yourself!   I
             summon you!
He angrily rips his sleeves up -- revealing two distinct
TATTOOS on his forearms. Slams them together with all
his might -- clenching his eyes tight -- concentrating --
Veins in his arms and neck bulge, look ready to explode --

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                            75.





CONTINUED:

Angela steps back in awe as the air around his
outstretched arms begins to WARP -- to tear a faint hole
from the bowling alley right into another world right
here -- darker -- Hellish --

                           JOHN

             Into the light I command thee!!
             Into the light I --
John is choked by a cough -- can't finish -- arms
separate and he buckles to his knees, reveals to Angela
just how ill he really is.
She leans down to him, sees hints of blood on the floor.

                           JOHN

             ... this is my fault... I sent
             them in... I sent them right to
             their deaths... a damn one-man
             plague.

                           ANGELA

             John, you need a doctor.

                           JOHN

             I've seen a goddamn doctor!!
Angela glares at him -- understands now.       He's dying.
John stands, almost stumbles.       Angela tries to help.

                           JOHN

             Get away from me!!

                           ANGELA

             John?

                           JOHN

             Stay the hell away --
                     (tortured look to her)
             Please --
He uses the handrail to walk away. Angela stands there,
confused by her own emotions. She turns back to the
carnage, hears the distant SIRENS.




INT./EXT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

John sits in his opened window, simmering. He holds a
lit cigarette but doesn't dare put it to his lips.
Outside the city goes about its unending churn.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         76.





CONTINUED:

Down on the street are several police vehicles. ENGINES
START and they drive away. Swirl of blue and red lights
flash across John's moist eyes.

                           ANGELA (O.S.)

             There were no trees in our back
             yard.
John finds Angela across the room in his doorway.

                           ANGELA

             But you knew that already, didn't
             you?
John meets her eyes.     Sees the questions piling up.

                           ANGELA

                     (walking towards him)
             You see something in me...
             Something Isabel had.

                           JOHN

             Go home, Angela.

                           ANGELA

             I need to understand --
John just shakes his head.

                           ANGELA

             Why not?

                           JOHN

             Because you open up to that world,
             you're inviting whatever's out
             there back in. That's what
             happened to Isabel.

                           ANGELA

             I'm not Isabel.

                           JOHN

             No, she embraced her gift while
             you denied yours and that denial
             is exactly why you're still alive.
             Stick with me, that'll change.
John gets off the window, starts walking away.

                           JOHN

             And I don't need another ghost
             following me around.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                           77.





CONTINUED:


                           ANGELA

             Dammit, John -- they killed my
             sister!
That stops him cold.

                           ANGELA

             I can't let them get away with
             that. Even if it means going down
             the same path she did. Now if you
             won't help me get there, I'll find
             my own way. But I won't run.
             Never.
The two stand there -- locked in this moment.

                             ANGELA

             Please...
John can't believe this day -- looks her dead in the eye.

                           JOHN

             You do this, there's no turning
             back. You see them -- they see
             you. Understand?
Angela never blinks as she nods in agreement.




INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - LATER

Pushing slowly through a lifeless apartment -- drawing
closer to the opened bathroom door. WATER is pouring.

                            ANGELA (O.S.)

             Do I take off my clothes or leave
             them on?
                      (a beat)
             John?

                             JOHN (O.S.)

             I'm thinking.

                             ANGELA (O.S.)

             John.

                             JOHN (O.S.)

             On is fine.




INT. BATHROOM

John fills a 70-year-old porcelain BATHTUB.       Angela
stands in the center.

                             ANGELA

             Why water?

                           JOHN

             It's the universal conduit.
             Lubricates the transition from one
             plane to another. Now ask me if
             there's water in Hell.
John turns off the faucet.

                             JOHN

             Sit.
Angela grabs his shoulder for balance, lowers herself.
When she's sitting, the water is all the way to her neck.

                           JOHN

             Normally only a portion of the
             body has to be suspended but you
             wanted the crash course...

                           ANGELA

                     (teeth chattering)
             What will I see?
His eyes say it all.      Enough.

                             JOHN

             Lie down.

                           ANGELA

                     (gesturing the depth)
             Lie down?

                           JOHN

             You have to be fully submerged.

                             ANGELA

             For how long?

                           JOHN

             As long as it takes.     Here --
John cups the back of her neck, holds her face just above
the water as she lowers down. Her breathing is picking
up. John leans over the tub, looks straight down at her.

                            JOHN

             Last chance...
                     (off her look)
             Take a deep one.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          79.





CONTINUED:

Angela takes a deep breath, holds it. John pulls his
hand away and she settles to the bottom, her eyes riveted
on his the entire time.




ANGELA'S POV

A silent John ripples above.     His hand grips her arm,
skin to skin.




BACK TO SCENE

Angela lies there and panic sets in. She starts to
surface but John pushes her head back to the bottom,
holds it firm. Her eyes dart about. Air is running out.
She can't hold her breath much longer. It's not
working --
But the room's lighting begins to pulsate -- as if the
current were ramping down. It slows to that dim half-
light as --
JOHN'S EYES -- CLOSE.     A single blink.
ANGELA is lying in now BOILING WATER, screaming for all
of her life. Water muffles the sound but not the fury.
Huge TUB SHUDDERS hard -- snapping out of the hold down
bolts. John is stunned -- how powerful is this woman?
Another SCREAM and the inch-thick TUB CRACKS.     Water
starts streaming onto the tile.
John lunges, grabs Angela and PULLS her up from the
water -- her muffled SCREAMS SHATTERING the air as her
mouth breaks the surface. She SLAMS hard against his
chest -- arms wrapping tight -- fingers digging into his
back -- leaving marks that might just scar.
TUB GIVES WAY and the damn breaks. John and Angela go
down -- hit the tile as one -- water washing over them
both.
ANGELA lies there on top of John. Trembling.      She looks
up him, eyes filled with revelation.

                           ANGELA

             All those people... so sad...
John nods, helping her understand.

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                       80.





CONTINUED:


                           ANGELA

             ... I've always known... where the
             bad guys are... where to aim, when
             to duck... it's not luck... I've
             always known...
Tears stream down her cheeks. John reaches out to touch
her when her eyes CLAMP TIGHT in pain --

                           JOHN

             Angela?
Eyes snap open and she's off him in a second, runs out.
John pries himself from the tile, goes after her.




INT. BEHIND THE ALLEY

Angela runs behind the vertebrae of machines, dripping
water the entire way. John tries to keep up.

                           ANGELA

             It was rolling toward him -- not a
             ball -- something smaller. Shiny.
She stops, kneels to the floor.     John walks up to join her.
Something glints in the catch trough. She reaches down,
plucks it up and brings an odd COIN INTO VIEW --
John's face contorts with rage as he takes the familiar
coin.

                           JOHN

             Balthazar.




INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - LATER

Beeman's bowling bag is flipped and the contents are
dumped onto a table. Powder, bugs and bullets go
everywhere. John retrieves the odd-tipped bullets.
Those brass knuckles and that copper pipe are taken also.




CHRISTIAN RELICS

are removed from a display cabinet.
There's the pure platinum Flask of Divinity, the
petrified husk from the River of Life -- the hollow shaft
of an iron cross -- all striking pieces individually but
when twisted and locked together form a very imposing --

                                                    81.





CONTINUED:


-- HOLY SHOTGUN.

He swings the cross down, pours a pound of blasting
powder into the husk -- chambers a special bullet into
one of the ten barrels, snaps it shut -- turns and FIRES.
BULLET leaves a trail of flame as it streaks across his
endless apartment, blasts the center out of --
A carton of Lucky Strikes.
SETTLE ON the Surgeon General's warning -- burning away.

                           ANGELA (V.O.)

             Can you kill him? What about the
             Balance?




INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - LATER

John is stuffing the bowling bag while Angela watches,
now dressed in dry clothes. That shirt is John's.

                            JOHN

             That half-breed tipped my scales
             when he started killing my
             friends. I'm just adding a little
             counterweight.
John lifts that holy shotgun -- KA CHICK --

                             ANGELA

             What about me?    I can't stay here
             forever.
John turns to her -- locks on those eyes. He reaches
into his coat pocket as he walks up to her. She shudders
as his arms wrap around her face and for a beat they're
cheek to cheek. When he pulls back she sees he has
clipped Hennessey's AMULET around her neck.

                           JOHN

             Think of it as a bulletproof vest.

                             ANGELA

             So I'm going.

                           JOHN

                     (knows he can't win)
             You're staying in the car.




                                                    82.





INT./EXT. 20 LANES - DAWN

FAT-ASS TIRES BURN under the full torque of a 426 HEMI.
A jet-black '70s BARRACUDA BLASTS from the basement
garage of 20 Lanes -- slides onto the streets of L.A.
Angela hangs on as John grabs the SKULL shifter knob --
slams into 2nd -- leaves another layer of tread behind.




EXT. OCEAN

FLYING OVER the ocean, a 747 ROARS RIGHT OVER US.
Dipping out of cloud cover, it reveals the coast of a
sprawling metropolis stretched out miles below.




L.A. LANDMARKS - DAWN

streak PAST. The Big Donut, the occult bookstores, the
'57 Chevy sign, that Mission in the park.
This is actually the POV FROM John's Barracuda.
He downshifts -- DRIFTS PAST a building with a facade of
pre-stressed concrete and huge gold letters -- "BZR

FINANCE AND BROKERAGE."


                           JOHN (O.S.)

             This shouldn't take long.




INT. BZR BROKERAGE

Elevator opens and John steps out into a lobby of
concrete and glass. Pretentious design screams money.
Lots of it.
Since trading is still a half hour away, the place is
practically empty.
Across the room a stainless steal DOOR HISSES open. John
looks the other way as a Security Guard exits. Thick
DOOR glides closed, seals with another HISS. No way in.
John notices the janitor down one hallway. It's Nico
from Midnite's. He and John lock stares. Nico opens a
"Security Only" door, steps inside -- leaves the door
open.




INT. TRADING ROOM

Monitors are powering up around the room. A few of those
Young Businessmen we last saw at Midnite's are here.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                        83.

                           YOUNG TURK

                     (into phone)
             Hey, early bird is a fat bird,
             know what I'm sayin'?
Balthazar walks through, looking every bit like the smug
and successful businessman he is. He stops at a LONG
MIRROR on one wall. Adjusts his collar, his hair. His
"look."

                           PRETTY BOY

             What are we pushing today, sir?

                           BALTHAZAR

             Phillip Morris.
As Balthazar admires himself, his reflection distorts
slightly. The demon in him? He touches his face, does a
vowel stretch. His face distorts even further.
That's got him moving closer to the mirror.
Balthazar's concerned because now his skin appears
in motion, rippling as if liquefied. And just when he
sees the surface of the mirror BLISTERING and starts to
move --

BOOOM --

One way GLASS EXPLODES outward on the front edge of a
FIREBALL -- sending Balthazar flying with glass and
flame.
John stands on the other side in an ACCESS CHANNEL --
that Dragon's breath flamethrower now duct-taped to his
holy shotgun.

                           JOHN

             How's he doing it?
John steps into the trading room, eyes Balthazar rising
from the floor. Suit's in shreds, half his face is
burned off, but now he's pissed.

                           BALTHAZAR

             This is in direct violation of the
             Balance!

                           JOHN

             Screw the Balance.
John hits him with another BLAST of FLAME -- pins him
hard against the wall.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                       84.





CONTINUED:

Balthazar's young turks attack. One leaps over the
trading station. John swings around -- aims the SHOTGUN
-- BOOM -- half-breed is blasted midair.
The other turk seems to defy gravity as he scampers
across the ceiling. John aims up -- PUMPS SEVERAL ROUNDS
-- steps out of the way as a body falls, smashes into a
desk. BOOM -- BOOM -- that'll keep it down.




INT. BARRACUDA

Angela hears the GUNSHOTS. Cop instinct takes over and
she gets out of the car. Checks the amulet. Intact.




INT. BZR TRADING ROOM

John turns his attention back to Balthazar, doesn't
hesitate and hits him with a continuous tide of flame.
Suit and skin is peeling off, revealing something else
underneath. The true form.

                           JOHN

             How's he doing it, you half-breed
             shit?!
John swings the flame aside so he can KICK Balthazar
against the wall. But now his WEAPON SPUTTERS. Shit.
Charcoal hand thrusts out, bats away the shotgun and
grabs John by the throat.
Balthazar rises from the ashes.     He may be burned, but
he's one tough son of a bitch.
Balthazar slides    John up a wall by his neck. John can't
break his hold.     He's choking, frantically rummages
through his coat    pockets. Comes out with those sacred
GOLD KNUCKLES on    his right hand.
Balthazar tightens his grip and John swings, clocks him
across the face. The enhanced punch sends a dizzying
ripple throughout Balthazar's body.
But he doesn't let go. John is choking, starts whaling
on him. Again and again -- each punch weakening this
demon more.
John finally gets him against the wall. Right arm's
tired so he slips the gold knuckles onto his left hand,
and with extreme pleasure -- continues punching away.
Drives Balthazar to the floor, right to the brink of
death.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                         85.





CONTINUED:

He leans up, winded. Watches in delight as Balthazar
strains to take his final breaths.

                           BALTHAZAR

             I will see you very soon...

                           JOHN

             Not really, no.

                           BALTHAZAR

             You can't cheat it this time...
             you're going back to Hell.

                            JOHN

             True.   But you're not.
John removes that small BLACK BOX from his coat.
Balthazar tries not to be concerned until John unlatches
it and removes the one weapon he hardly ever uses --
A Bible.

                           BALTHAZAR

             What are you doing?

                           JOHN

             I'm reading you your last rites.
Balthazar reacts.      This isn't good.

                           BALTHAZAR

             Your remedial incantations have no
             relevance to my kind.

                           JOHN

             Aren't you half human?
Balthazar doesn't have to answer.

                           JOHN

             You see, that makes you eligible
             to be forgiven. You do know what
             it is to truly be forgiven? To be
             welcomed into the kingdom of God?
Balthazar's worst nightmare.

                           JOHN

             A demon in heaven -- love to be a
             fly on that wall...

                           BALTHAZAR

             You're not a priest, you have no
             power...

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                       86.

                           JOHN

             -- I escaped hell, who else do you
             know that has the power to do
             that?!
Balthazar is now doubting his own beliefs.

                           JOHN

             Just tell me how Mammon is
             crossing over and you can go back
             to your shithole.
Balthazar isn't convinced.
John stands -- raises the Bible and starts to read --

                           JOHN

             'May the merciful God have mercy
             on you and grant you the pardon of
             all your sins...'
He places a hand on Balthazar's forehead. Balthazar
glares at it as John's voice rises with commanding
authority.

                           JOHN

             'Whosoever sins you remit on earth
             they are remitted unto them in
             heaven. I absolve you from -- '

                           BALTHAZAR

             -- It may not even work...

                            JOHN

             How?   How's he doing it?!
Balthazar looks scared as shit to tell him.

                           JOHN

                     (bellowing out)
             'Grant your child entry into thy

             and the Son and the Holy Gh -- '

                           BALTHAZAR

             ... Sangre de dio.
John is stunned -- did he hear right?     Balthazar nods.

                            JOHN

             How?

                                              (CONTINUED)

             What killed the Son of God will
             give birth to the son of the
             devil.
John's mind races and he finally puts it together.

                           JOHN

             He's found the Spear.
Balthazar's expression confirms it.

INT. 747 - MID-FLIGHT

Prisoner in an aisle seat, trying to keep calm. He looks
behind him as if being watched. Just nerves again.

EXT. BZR BROKERAGE - FRONT AREA

ANGELA moves through the gathered crowd looking up at the
building. As she makes her way through, the amulet
brushes against bodies -- swinging from side to side.
Angela suddenly stops in the center of the street,
turns...

                           ANGELA

             Something's coming...
She stares at her surroundings with an increasing sense
of dread. Then hears the RUMBLE and TIRES SCREECHING.

Angela spins, spots John's BARRACUDA exploding around the
corner. It barrels up the street and slides to a
SQUEALING stop in front of her. Passenger door swings
open.

                           JOHN

             What happened to staying in the
             car?

                           ANGELA

             You were in danger.

                           JOHN

             Well now there's a premonition.
SIRENS crack the air.     Angela jumps in and John PEELS

OUT.





INT. BZR

Balthazar is taking his last breaths when the sound of
WIND filters through the room. He looks up as a shadow
drapes across him. Eyes widen.

                           BALTHAZAR

             One more chance...
Shadow darkens and his decimated form shudders.

                           JOHN (V.O.)

             Jesus didn't die from being nailed
             to a cross.




EXT./INT. BARRACUDA - MOVING

John takes a turn at 70 as Angela stares into John's
Bible.

                           JOHN

             He was finished off by a soldier's
             spear.
He points in the Bible at a detailed painting of the
event -- Jesus hanging on the cross -- being pierced by a
soldier's spear. It matches that child's drawing John
removed from the fridge -- now lying on his seat.

                           ANGELA

             I'm Catholic, John -- I know the
             crucifixion story.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                           89.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

             Then you know what this spear
             would mean to a demon trying to
             cross over.
She doesn't.

                           JOHN

             The stains on its edges?
Angela looks back at the painting, notes the liquid
flowing from Jesus' wound. Angela can't believe it --

                           JOHN

             Mammon needed divine assistance --
             how's the blood of God's only son?
Angela sits stunned for a moment.

                           ANGELA

             So that's it -- he's got
             everything he needs to escape...

                           JOHN

             Not quite.
                     (glances at her)
             Twins.
Angela gives him a look.       Something in the rearview
mirror catches his gaze.

                             JOHN

             Here we go --
John floors it and Angela glances out the back window,
spots something in the traffic -- bounding over vehicles,
hitting the pavement on all fours --

                             ANGELA

             What is that?

                           JOHN

             A hound on the hunt.
A blur of muscle and bone leaps over cars at incredible
speed -- denting in roofs, CRACKING a WINDSHIELD --
causing general chaos. Cars brake -- SLIDE into each
other. And still this thing keeps coming.

                             JOHN

             Hang on --
BARRACUDA slides into an alley, races toward the other
end.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                        90.





CONTINUED:

Angela looks back, sees their pursuer enter the alley.
It makes huge strides along the walls, defying all manner
of physics.

                            ANGELA

             Impossible.
The beast goes right up the wall and disappears above the
building.

                            ANGELA

             I lost it.
BAM, something lands hard on the roof, denting it a good
foot.
A huge clawed TALON punches into the sheet metal, starts
shredding it right over Angela. Talon thrusts in.
Angela dodges it -- her amulet swinging wildly.
John HITS the BRAKES and the beast flips off the roof and
onto the hood -- right INTO VIEW.
A muscular anomaly with eyes that are unmistakably
Balthazar's. He lashes against the windshield with an
extra appendage. Thank God for safety glass.
He jerks back his embedded talon, pulls the entire
windshield out with it, smashing it on the hood. GLASS
PARTICLES EXPLODE into the car.
John throws the car into a spin, slamming the Barracuda
into several parked cars. Balthazar is uprooted, is
thrown from the car.
Angela looks back, sees Balthazar rolling into traffic.

                            ANGELA

             He's down --

                            JOHN

             He's not down.   Gimme your phone.
Angela pulls out her cellular.

A BRITISH COUPLE sit in the back of Chaz's taxi, staring
out at the seedy side of town as if it were "Wild

             Yeah, but I'm kind of busy right
             now, John.

                           JOHN

             Dammit, Chaz, I'm trying to save
             my ass here!

                           CHAZ

             What else is new...

             Sorry, tour's over.

             OUT YA WANKERS!!! NOW!!





EXT. LA STREETS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

John heads toward the skyline now -- at 90 mph -- to the
3rd Street Bridge on the horizon.
Angela scans behind them, can't believe her eyes.

                           ANGELA

             He's back.
Here comes Balthazar through traffic on all fours --

                           ANGELA

             John, he's back and he's gaining!

                           JOHN

             Of course he's gaining.
John PUNCHES the GAS to the floor.




EXT. 3RD STREET BRIDGE

Chaz swerves onto the other side of the narrow bridge.
He SCREECHES TO A STOP across the roadway -- opens the
glove box, grabs a velvet-wrapped object and pulls a
glass vial out of it.
Inside flows a phosphorescent green liquid. Chaz jumps
out, runs to the back of the car, pauses when he hears
the sound of a STRAINING ENGINE.
Here comes the topless Barracuda over the bridge's arched
roadway. And what the hell is that running behind it?

                           CHAZ

             Shit -- shit -- shit --

Chaz twists off the gas cap, drops the vial into the tank.
He pulls out his BEEPER, rips the cover off, exposing the
electronics.
He wedges the beeper into the tank inlet, then starts
sprinting off the bridge while --

             6... 6... 6

Here comes Balthazar up the bridge. Like a supercharged
cheetah, running full stride. And not even winded.

                           ANGELA


             6... 6... 6

Balthazar is almost to the taxi -- John waits -- then --

Balthazar is caught in a haze of brilliant red particles
that tear his body apart in midair. His final SHRIEK is
chilling.




EXT./INT. BARRACUDA

John smacks the wheel, victoriously -- looks over to
Angela who sighs with relief. His expression changes as
he centers on the empty necklace dangling around her
neck.

                           JOHN

             Where's the amulet?
WHAM -- something reaches through the roof hole and JERKS
HER right out of the car.

                           JOHN


             ANGELA!!

John SLAMS the BRAKES home -- car spins and John is
already jumping out before it comes to a stop. He runs
to the rail.

                           CHAZ

                     (running up)
             What the hell was that?!
Both leap onto the concrete rail, lean over and spot a
HUGE WINGED SHADOW just as it disappears below the
bridge.
Chaz is speechless as he turns to John. This is too
much. John gives him the out he's been waiting for --

                           JOHN

             We're even.
Chaz nods and John leaves him at the rail.   He jumps back
in the BARRACUDA and PEELS OUT.
Chaz watches him race away, looks back at his burning
taxi.

                           CHAZ

             Even?

John bursts through a door -- Midnite right on his heels.

                         MIDNITE

           Mammon has been trying to climb
           out of his father's shadow for
           eons.

                         JOHN

           And this time he might just make
           it.

                         MIDNITE

                   (unconvinced)
           Because he's got the Spear?

                         JOHN

           And the bridge.

                         MIDNITE

           You're giving this girl way too
           much credit.

                         JOHN

           You don't know her.

                          MIDNITE

           And you do?   That would be a
           first.
John swings open a STORAGE ROOM DOOR -- looks in at
large-scale relics -- statues, props, etc.

             hero from a fool.

                           JOHN

             I'll take my chances.

                           MIDNITE

             And taint my establishment with
             your blood? I don't think so.

             dumb shit?!
Midnite just stands there -- his body inflating past it's
seven feet. John knows he went too far.

                           JOHN

             That was the cancer talking, you

             What's in your bathroom, a Renoir?

                           MIDNITE

             I have insurance issues.
John clears off the seat, starts to sit.        Midnite blocks
him.

                           MIDNITE

             You haven't surfed in decades.

                           JOHN

             Like riding a bike...
He tries again.     Midnite blocks him again.

                           MIDNITE

             You'll be lucky to reach an
             elemental plane.

                           JOHN

             Then just increase the juice.
John tries again.     Again Midnite stops him.

                           MIDNITE

             In your condition your body won't
             take much.

                           JOHN

             I just need enough rope to find
             her.

                           MIDNITE

             And if you do -- what then?

                           JOHN

             One goddamn problem at a time --
John shoves past him, plops his ass in the huge chair.
His feet dangle off the ground. Midnite stands by, won't
help. So John starts strapping himself in the chair.
His chest, his ankles. One wrist. He obviously can't
strap the other. He looks to the big man.

                           JOHN

             You want me to sign a waiver?

Midnite sighs -- finally straps the other wrist in --
pulls it TIGHT. Ouch.

             Hang on, Angela.




EXT. SKY - CLOSE ON ANGELA

moving in a surreal fashion across an evening sky. Below
her the City of Angels sweep past. Her eyes drift open
and widen in horror as she sees beyond reality --




REFLECTION IN HER EYES

The city is ON FIRE. It's a repeat of Isabel's prophetic
vision before she jumped.

                           MIDNITE (V.O.)

             Listen to my voice inside...




INT. MIDNITE'S - STORAGE ROOM

Midnite kneels in front of John who is now handcuffed to
the chair, cables draped from every limb.

                           MIDNITE

             I'll try and guide you out.

                           JOHN

             Try?

                           MIDNITE

             Mammon was forced out of that girl
             when she jumped so unless he found
             a holding vessel to wait in, he
             would have fallen back to Hell.

                           JOHN

             No, he's still here.   I'm sure of it.

                           MIDNITE

             Then watch yourself. He could be
             in anyone out there.
John nods. Midnite lifts a palm of INSECT WINGS in front
of his face.

                           JOHN

             Roach wings? What happened to
             using lilac pedals -- ?

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                           99.





CONTINUED:

Midnite cranks the JUICE on the panel as he BLOWS and John
reacts as if being hit by a blast of wind. His head slams
back against the slats. His skin ripples from the force.
STAY ON his face as the sound of POWER courses through John.

                           MIDNITE

             Peter do caelis, Deus, misere
             nobis. Fili Redemptor mundi,
             Deus, Miserere nobis...
A FLASH turns into a streak behind John's face --
stretching to infinity.

                           MIDNITE (V.O.)

             Find the possessor and the Spear
             will be revealed... find them...
             find them and follow...
The flash whips back TOWARD us and John is suddenly
somewhere else. He looks O.S.




INT. PRISON CHAMBER FROM THE OPEN

FROM that MYSTERIOUS POV, we watch the Prisoner hold the
Spear for the first time. Like before, he turns and
looks behind him where --
John now stands. Watching.      John centers on the Spear in
the Prisoner's hand.




FLASH AHEAD - INT. ISTANBUL AIRPORT

That same MYSTERIOUS POV of the Prisoner in line.      He
turns as he did before and it's --
-- John behind him.     Watching.   Prisoner turns away.




FLASH AHEAD - EXT. LAX TERMINAL - EVENING

MYSTERIOUS POV is ON the Prisoner at the exit doors.        He
looks back, suspiciously, and there's -
John.   Watching.    Prisoner turns, heads to the minivan.




FLASH AHEAD - EXT. EAST L.A. - MYSTERIOUS POV - NIGHT

of a minivan still smoking from a recent impact against a
large iron ENTRANCE GATE. Prisoner is running from it,
glances back --

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                        100.





CONTINUED:

John is there. Watches as the Prisoner enters the
abandoned wing of -- Ravenscar. John reacts. How did he
miss this?




FLASH AHEAD - INT. SLEEP ROOM

Fifty beds with fifty patients. Asleep. The Prisoner
kneels next to one of the beds. John walks over, touches
him and he rocks to the floor. Dead. Body reveals the
Spear on the blanket of the bed.
John reaches out to touch it when the boy BARRY suddenly
SITS UP from under the blanket and grabs him by the
throat. NOTE the boy's BLACKENED FINGERNAILS.
John struggles to pull him off but the boy's grip is
locked tight. John grabs at his hands -- chokes out the
name --

                          JOHN


             MIDNITE!!

John's hands suddenly become MIDNITE'S as his ally pulls
him back into --




INT. MIDNITE'S - STORAGE ROOM

John's face is held tight in the life-saving fingers of
Midnite's grip. John gasps as he comes back -- nods to
Midnite and finally --

                           JOHN

             Ravenscar. The abandoned wing.
             He's in the boy.




EXT. OVER HILLSIDE - FLYING - EVENING

WINGED SHADOW glides across the landscape, sweeps across
manicured grounds and rises to reveal Ravenscar Hospital.




INT. MIDNITE'S OFFICE - LATER

Midnite piles ASSAULT RIFLES, SHOTGUNS, GLOCKS onto a
table.

                           MIDNITE

             You know these won't kill them.
John adjusts the flames of a butane heater under a pan.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         101.





CONTINUED:


                           MIDNITE

             You probably won't even get close
             enough to use them.
In the pan is that RELIGIOUS RELIC he brought from India.
It's now MELTING. Midnite has trouble watching it
dissolve.

                           MIDNITE

             And it's not just the boy.
John coughs, pours the melted gold into several small
casting blocks.

                           MIDNITE

             You better worry about whoever's
             helping him.
John gives the big guy a glance, dips one of the castings
into a pot of water -- HISSSSSS.

                           MIDNITE

             As much as I admire your blind
             faith even in the most dire
             situations -- expecting to just
             waltz into a facility that is
             about to become the floodgate of
             Hell is reaching a bit, even for
             you.
John stops the work, centers on him and Midnite just
knows what he's thinking. Midnite sighs, heavily.

                           MIDNITE

             Well I suppose two fools can die
             just as easily as one.
John almost smiles.

                           MIDNITE

             Hey, you think I'm trusting you to
             save the world?
John taps the casting and out falls a GOLD-TIPPED BULLET.

                           MIDNITE

             But we're going to need more than
             a few magic bullets to get inside.
John centers on the Sparkletts bottles positioned around
the room. Just like John's. Hmmmm...

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                       102.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

             That ritual you do with the water,
             can you do more than one bottle at
             a time?
Midnite raises an eyebrow.




EXT. RAVENSCAR - NIGHT

The motorized MAIN GATE is jammed -- opening and closing
on a crashed VAN. The van the Prisoner carjacked. The
abandoned hospital wing stands ominous against a moonlit
night. Vague figures move about near the emergency
entrance.
John's BARRACUDA IDLES up with its headlights off. John
stares out, points up to the WATER TANK -- on the roof.

                              MIDNITE

                        (sighs)
             Figures.




INT. RAVENSCAR - PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM

Therapy machines look like medieval torture devices in
the dimly-lit room. BARRY stands waist deep in a large
hydrotherapy tank inset into the tile floor. His skin is
pale, sickly looking. Obviously containing Mammon takes
its toll. Especially on a child.
His hands are below his waist and now we see they're
lowering a still-unconscious Angela into the water. Her
face floats just above the surface as he buckles
restraining straps around her wrists.




INT. RAVENSCAR - ABANDONED WING

Front glass doors swing open and John and Midnite calmly
strut inside. Stop.
HEAR the O.S. MURMURS of an unseen crowd.
This EMERGENCY ROOM is crammed with people. Lawyers.
Brokers. Soccer moms. Truck drivers. Etc... Most are
crowded in front of a set of double doors.
Room goes dead silent as all eyes lock on our guys.
John steps from Midnite, raises his hands like a riot
cop.

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                         103.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

             Okay -- let's cut the scratch and
             call it a night. Meeting's over.
That's got their attention. As entertainment. A few
chuckle. John is surprised to see Ellie stepping from
the crowd. Still that bundle of sexual energy.

                           JOHN

             Ellie?

                           ELLIE

             Oh, John, you know how much I love
             it on this side. This was just an
             opportunity to make it permanent.

                           JOHN

             You think his son will be any
             different? He'll just turn this
             place into his own Hell and then
             where will you to party, Heaven?

                           ELLIE

             No need to get nasty.

                           JOHN

             Never bothered you before.

                           ELLIE

             I am so going to miss our little
             trysts.
Ellie steps closer.     The crowd starts to close in with
her.

                           JOHN

             I'm sure you will.
John pulls out his lighter, holds it up -- flicks it on.

                           JOHN

             Now turn around and take your
             friends with you.
Can he look more ridiculous?

                           JOHN

             I will deport you.   All of you.
             You know I can.
John steps back up onto a chair, thrusts the lighter
higher --

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        104.





CONTINUED:


                           ELLIE

             Oh, John, this is embarrassing.
             Where is your pride?
-- right under a SPRINKLER HEAD.

                           JOHN

             Go to Hell.
Ellie looks up just as the sprinklers trigger.




SERIES OF SHOTS

Ellie and a room of half-humans -- all looking up as
water sprays from every nozzle. John and Midnite tense
because the first drops have no effect. A beat -- a
SPURT in the waterlines and suddenly -- SHRIEKS fill the
room as half human skin begins to FRY.

                           ELLIE

             Holy water!
Emergency lighting has snapped on -- throwing the room
into a strobing nightmare of action. Flashes of human
skin melting, revealing snippets of the true demons
underneath. It's total pandemonium as their rage is
directed toward the only real humans in the room.
John and Midnite fling their coats open -- draw their
WEAPONS and starts FIRING away at the attacking horde.
Sacred bullets cause major damage -- wounds that ripple
out through demon bodies.
John and Midnite slam back to back -- spinning under the
protective shield of a showering sprinkler head --
shooting at all manner of distorted forms that venture
into the COLUMN OF SPRAY.
One reloads while the other FIRES. It's a hellish form
of a turkey shoot. Nothing sacred, nothing spared.
John goes for the double doors. Midnite covers him --
blows away another two disintegrating demons. Two come
up behind and he spins, takes them down.
JOHN gets to the doors, starts to open them when Ellie
jumps onto his back -- nails digging in.

                           ELLIE

             I'm not going back there!

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                      105.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

             We are what we are, Ellie --
John FIRES over his back, loosens her grip. He grabs
hold, shoves her face up into the spray of an overhead
sprinkler head. Legs flail about.
Midnite comes out of the rain -- grabs John.

                           MIDNITE

             Let's go.
John drops Ellie to the floor. No more pretty face -- no
face at all -- yet the screams still come.
John and Midnite get to the doors -- shove through.




INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM

Angela's body and face are completely submerged now. She
comes to, sees Barry above her -- tries to rise but the
boy pushes her head to the bottom, holds it there. Last
bubbles are floating up from her mouth. Barry places his
other hand on her arm, closes his eyes.




INT. CORRIDOR

Holy rain has stopped in here. A fine mist floats in the
air. John and Midnite make their way through. Only
their footsteps on the tile break the stark silence.
Another set of doors is ahead. Before they reach it a
faint shadow crosses in the mist. Both pause, expecting
something to reveal itself. But it doesn't.




INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM

Faint waves undulate Barry's skin -- ripple from his
chest, down his arms and into a submerged Angela. Every
muscle in her body tenses in stark relief.




ANGELA'S POV

Barry's image ripples above her in silence. Room
lighting starts to pulse -- slower and slower and when
it's caught in that dim half-light -- Angela JOLTS and
this time we CROSS OVER INTO --




                                                        106.





PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM HELL

Angela is lying in a bone-dry tank, lifts her head up to
see a room not much different than the one she just left.
Except for the SOUND. That low DRONE RISING IN PITCH --
those DEMONIC SCREECHES scratching at the walls.
And now those INKY splotches begin consuming the color
and light from the walls. Moving in on Angela. Closer
and closer -- whatever's coming is just about on her.

                         MAMMON (O.S.)

          Angela.
Angela SPINS and for a split second comes face to face
with the hideous form of MAMMON. She SCREAMS.




INT. NORMAL PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - REAL TIME

John and Midnite burst into the room, spot Barry standing
in the tank. His hands in the water. On Angela.

                          JOHN

                    (rushing toward him)
          Barry!
Barry looks up, sees the two men rushing toward him.
Guns aimed.

                         JOHN

          Let her up!!   Let her up!!
A beat as John meets Barry's eyes -- realizes he's
staring at a frightened child. Barry backs away as --
-- Angela sits up behind John.    Water rippling off,
straps dangling free.
John turns -- locks on her BLACK EYES.

                         JOHN

          Shit --
John thinks fast -- scans the area and sees every mirror
in the room has been shattered. So much for the quick
fix.
He jumps into the water with her, grabs her face and
pushes her against the tank walls. This is an exorcism
on the fly.

                        JOHN

          Amar natash bow basar! Rescind
          from the flesh I command thee --

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                         107.





CONTINUED:

Angela's eyes snap open -- dark and dilated. John sees
it -- clasps a hand over her mouth -- cutting off her air
supply.

                           JOHN

             Back to Hell, asshole --
Her body undulates as Mammon's shape tries to come through.
Pulsating through her arms, her chest -- her face.
Angela BITES into his palm. John recoils. She shoves
him off and John hits the tile hard. Angela jumps from
the tank, pushes past in a blur. John spins to see
Midnite standing right there -- Angela now firmly in his
size-twelve grasp.

                           MIDNITE

                     (to John)
             Finish it.

INTERCUT WITH:





MYSTERIOUS HIGH POV

John coughs, struggles to stand. He tries to cover but
it's obvious his end is nearing. Midnite positions
Angela to face him, braces her arms out from her sides --
crucifixion-style. She tries but can't break free. John
puts a hand to her forehead --

                           JOHN

             Et separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut
             num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui
             serpentes.

                           JOHN/MIDNITE

             Rescind from the flesh I command
             thee -- Amar natash bow basar!
Angela's body stops fighting. The darkness in her eyes
and fingernails begins to fade. It's working...
Midnite is suddenly JERKED backwards with an agonizing
YELL. Angela is dropped, slips into unconsciousness.
John watches in horror as Midnite's 300-pound frame is
lifted right off the floor by an INVISIBLE GRASP, slammed
into the ceiling, then twisted and thrown with incredible
force against the floor.
Midnite glares at John, tries to speak.     But the words
die on his lips.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          108.





CONTINUED:

Enraged, John scans the empty room, sees a large SHADOW
on the ceiling that doesn't belong to any object.
He holds back a cough long enough to rip up his sleeves
and slams those tattoos together --

                           JOHN

             Into the light I command thee!
             Into the light I command thee!
It takes every ounce of John's life force to keep this
spell alive and when he's about to drop from exhaustion
the shadow is brought fully into the light -- becomes
that familiar shape of WINGS.

                           VOICE OF MAN (O.S.)

             Your ego is astounding.
John strains to see the shadow become the real thing --
the majestic wings of an angel.

                           JOHN

             Gabriel?
John is too weak to even be surprised anymore.

                           JOHN

             Figures...
Gabriel touches down in front of him.       Spear in his hand.

                           JOHN

             And the wicked shall inherit the
             Earth.

                           GABRIEL

             You presume to judge me, John.

                            JOHN

             Betrayal, murder, genocide?    Call
             me provincial.

                           GABRIEL

             I am seeking to inspire humankind
             to be all that was intended.

                           JOHN

             By unleashing Hell on Earth?     Good
             thinking...
Gabriel's wings fold behind as he walks around John.

             You've had it too easy for too
             long.

                           JOHN

             So what's a few thousand years of
             pain, right?

                           GABRIEL

             You never deserved to be blessed.
             You've all been born with a silver
             spoon in your mouth, never really
             appreciating the gift you were
             given so freely -- unconditional
             love from your creator.

                           JOHN

             And that just bugs the shit out of
             you.

                           GABRIEL

             It's not your fault. Like the
             animals you are, you never learn
             unless sufficiently prodded.
             Pleasure has no lasting effect.
             But subject you to pain,
             unpleasantness -- suffering -- and
             you will take notice, you will
             fight to overcome, to earn your
             redemption. That is when you're
             at your best.
Angela's fingernails are starting to darken once again.

                           JOHN

             You're trying to teach us a
             lesson?

                           GABRIEL

             No, I'm giving you the chance to
             rise above the suffering and truly
             earn the love of God.
                     (a beat)
             The road to salvation begins
             tonight. Right now.
John just stares at this rogue angel, centers on the
Spear in his hand. He makes a break for it. Gabriel's
wings beat once.
The GUST BLOWS John through the double doors, back into
the --




                                                       110.





CORRIDOR

-- where he smashes against a mesh-screened window, drops
to the floor in a heap with the other dying carcasses.




PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM

Gabriel turns back to Angela. He approaches her -- his
rippling wings sliding up around her, enveloping her --
pulling her in. Those eyes of his could melt Dracula.




CORRIDOR - JOHN

can't even stand, let alone save the girl.     Or humanity.
It would be so easy to give up. To roll over and die.
But instead, he tries something he hasn't done in a long
time.

                         JOHN

                   (whispering)
           ... I know I'm not one of your
           favorites... I'm not even allowed
           in your house these days... but I
           could use a little attention...
John waits for nothing. His body crumples, his cheek
landing flat against the tile.
Glistening shards of mirror glass lie around him. As he
stares at his reflection in one, he gets the idea.




PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - ANGELA'S EYES

begin to quiver.   The color drains.    Blackness is waiting.




CORRIDOR - JOHN

slides his back up the wall as he reels in that shard of
mirror.




PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - ANGELA'S

posture begins to change. Mammon's form ripples through
her -- starts to push out through her skin. Gabriel
stands behind her, his wings cocooned around her waist.

                         GABRIEL

                   (whispering to her)
           Cross the bridge to your destiny...




                                                     111.





CORRIDOR - JOHN

pulls up his sleeve, exposes his old scar. He pauses a
beat, closes his eyes. STAY ON his face as he makes one
swift SLICE movement.
But he's in a rush here -- makes that same motion across
his other wrist as well.
With both wrists purging his life away, John settles back
into the corner and waits for the inevitable.

                          JOHN

            Hurry...




PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - GABRIEL

reveals the Spear.




CORRIDOR - JOHN

is dying.    Eyes are starting to close as...




PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - GABRIEL

Raises the Spear over Angela's chest.
HEAR the SOUNDS of a million DEMONS inside of her ready
to break free --
He holds the Spear high above her chest -- readies for
the final thrust as --




CORRIDOR

Bulbs flicker as current ramps down and TIME COMES TO A

COMPLETE STOP.

All we're left with is a distant METALLIC DRONE, like the
reverberation of a gong struck a thousand years ago.
John lies in that dim half-light.    Motionless.
Something starts to swirl near him and just like that,
John is no longer alone. Shadow falls over his pathetic
form.

                          SATAN (O.S.)

            The time has come at last to
            collect your soul.

                                             (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

John pries his eyes open...

                             SATAN

             Hello, John.

                             JOHN

             You're early.

                           SATAN

             You're the one show I wouldn't
             miss.

                             JOHN

             So I've heard.
Satan sees John's slit wrists.

                            SATAN

             I didn't think you'd make the same
             mistake twice.
John looks up at him.

                           SATAN

             You didn't, did you?

                           JOHN

             ... so how's your son?

                           SATAN

             And why would that matter to you?

                           JOHN

             ... he's topside...

                             SATAN

             I know.

                             JOHN

             With Gabriel.

                             SATAN

             Your point?

                           JOHN

             He's helping your son create his
             own Hell on Earth...

                           SATAN

             Well, boys will be boys...

                           JOHN

             He has the Spear of Destiny.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          113.





CONTINUED:

Satan didn't know that.     Now he's concerned.     He studies
this dying man.

                           SATAN

             This is another one of your cons.

                           JOHN

             Go look for yourself...
Satan is still suspicious.

                           JOHN

             You've waited twenty years for me,
             what's another twenty seconds?
Satan contemplates his remark. Metallic reverberation is
overtaken as SOUND and MOTION ramp back to real time --




PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - THE SPEAR

is about to be thrust into Angela's chest.

                           SATAN (O.S.)

             Gabriel?
Gabriel looks up -- spots him in the room. Gabriel
reacts -- pulls the spear toward her with all his
might -- but Satan is faster -- Angela vanishes and
Gabriel has now pierced dead air.
Satan holds Angela tight -- covering her mouth like John
did. She struggles and the demon inside appears --
reflected in the huge chunks of tank glass scattered on
the floor. Hideous. The real MAMMON.

                           SATAN

             Say goodbye to the sun -- both of
             you.
Mammon SHRIEKS and Gabriel's beautiful wings ignite in

FLAME --


                           GABRIEL

             No!!!!!!!!




CORRIDOR - JOHN

is rocked by a major jolt that shakes the entire building
to its foundation. A moment later --

                                                 (CONTINUED)





                                                    114.





CONTINUED:

Satan is back. John looks up, gives him that look -- you
owe me. Satan hates admitting it but knows it's true.

                           SATAN

             So... what do you want?   An
             extension?
John shakes his head, can barely utter a sound...

                           JOHN

             Isabel...

                           SATAN

             What about her?

                           JOHN

             ... let her... go home...

                           SATAN

             You would give up your life so she
             could go to Heaven?
John manages a nod...

                           SATAN

             Fine.
                     (closes, opens eyes)
             It's done.




INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM

ANGELA gasps -- her first real breath's a strain.
Adrenaline rushes through her and she quickly closes her
eyes --




EXT. THAT GORGEOUS SKY

Stretches out BEFORE us. And here come those two swings,
penduluming up in SLOW MOTION.
Young Angela and Isabel share that moment again. But
this time Isabel lets go and jumps out of her swing.
Her body sails up and away, her fingers reaching out for
what seems so close... so close...
Isabel keeps going until she fades into the sky.

                           SATAN (V.O.)

             Time to go.




                                                       115.





INT. CORRIDOR

John relaxes, stops fighting the inevitable. Satan takes
his hand, starts to pull him home but suddenly finds
himself pulling on what seems to be infinite mass. Try
as he might, he can't budge John an inch.
And now John's other hand leaves his side, and as if
weightless, begins to rise toward something above.
No sense in beating around the bush here, John is in the
embrace of God.
Satan sees this and recoils in absolute RAGE --

                        SATAN

          The sacrifice!! No!!!!   THIS ONE

          BELONGS TO ME!!

John's rising hand drifts back down in front of Satan,
the middle finger fully extended. Final straw.
Satan goes rabid -- turns to PURE ENERGY for a split
second. His hands remain on fire.

                        SATAN

          You will live, John Constantine,
          you will live so you'll have the
          chance to prove that your soul
          truly belongs in Hell. You will
          live!
Satan eagerly plunges his blazing hands into John's
body --
John screams in agony. Satan tears through his tissue --
collecting the cancer, then ripping out a mass of
diseased tissue with one vengeful pull. John's final
blood-curdling SCREAM ECHOES over --




INT./EXT. RAVENSCAR

-- through every room. Every corridor. Rippling out
across the ground and finally dissipating in the hills
beyond.




INT. CORRIDOR

On his hands and knees, John takes that first breath.
New lungs fill for the first time. No cough. Not even a
wheeze. Face has renewed color. Wrists have sealed
tight.

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                          116.





CONTINUED:

John is healed.
He stands, steps back inside the --




PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM

John stops over the body of one seven-foot African
warrior. He stands immobilized, wrecked with emotion.          A
SOUND draws his attention to the one thing that could
cause him even greater rage --

GABRIEL --

is hunched over near a wall. Jagged cartilage stumps
protrude from his back. A pattern of sinew and bone is
burned into the floor behind him. It's all that remains
of his once majestic wings.
John approaches, spots blood dripping from the former angel.
He realizes what this means. Gets a kick out of it.

                            JOHN

             Human...
Gabriel looks up as John retrieves a gun from the wet
floor.

                           JOHN

             You don't deserve to be human.

                           GABRIEL

             Then pass judgment on me now.
John raises the gun -- puts it to Gabriel's forehead.

                            GABRIEL

             Do it.   Seek revenge.   End my
             life.
John's finger nudges the trigger.

                           GABRIEL

             Kill me! Pull the trigger!     Be
             the hand of God!
John pauses, realizes what's happening here...

                           JOHN

             ... and I'll be condemned again...

                            GABRIEL

             Do it!

                                                 (CONTINUED)





                                                      117.





CONTINUED:

It takes everything John has not to pull that trigger.
He lowers the gun, shaking his head.

                           JOHN

             You're even worthless as bait.
John starts to turn away --

                           GABRIEL

             Deny your true nature today, but
             what of tomorrow, of the tomorrow
             after that? It is only a matter
             of time before you end up right
             back where you belong. It is who
             you are, Constantine. Damned.
John's fist starts behind his back, gains momentum the
entire arc until it ends abruptly against Gabriel's face.
The ex-angel is propelled all the way to the wall --
SLAMS HARD against the concrete. Body crumples on
impact, slides down to the muck. You know this hurt like
absolute hell.

                           JOHN

             That's called pain.    Get used to it.
John turns toward the double doors -- stops cold.
Huddled in the doorway, covered in grime is Angela and
Barry. The experience has obviously left them both
drained.
John walks across the room, kneels down to them.

                           ANGELA

             Thank you, John.
He nods, beat. Wipes a trace of blood off her brow, puts
a hand on Barry's shoulder. HOLD a beat ON this gritty
family tableau.




INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - MIDNITE'S UNIVERSAL ORRERY

MOVING SLOWLY PAST the inoperative device. PAST
strangely-shaped objects of platinum and gold, with names
and symbols that make a bit more sense now.




EXT. AFRICA - DAY

Huge sun beats down on a lone FIGURE walking across a
stretch of the most barren landscape on Earth. He stops,
kneels to the heavily-cracked soil. Starts digging.




                                                       118.





INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - THE ORRERY

A HAND comes in, affixes an unseen object to a protruding
rod. Its weight causes it to drop OUT OF FRAME but a
moment later it rises back INTO VIEW and finds a balance.




EXT. AFRICA

JOHN pulls back the protective hood from his face.
Healthy and tan with a new lease on life. He pops a
NICORETTE TABLET, then unwraps rolls of cloth from around
the Spear of Destiny. He drops it in the hole, stares at
it a long beat.




INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - THE ORRERY

The entire mechanism shudders. And now miraculously,
every globe, every moon, every obscure object in this
miniature occult universe begins to rotate in complete
sync.
As it does, the defining object finally slides INTO VIEW.
John's lighter.   ANGELA watches it rotate past, nods in
approval.




EXT. AFRICA

John sighs, finally sweeps mounds of soil over the sacred
relic. He stands, nods. Job done.
A breeze blows past and John senses being watched. He
spins and finds -- nothing. For a hundred miles. He
starts walking.

                        JOHN (V.O.)

          Some people are born to make a
          difference. I had to die. Twice.

                                       MATCH CUT TO:





EXT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY - ANGELA

walking right in step. Something is closing in on her.
A new TAXI pulls up. Chaz is driving. Angela gets in.

                        JOHN (V.O.)

          God does work in mysterious ways.

John continues walking as something closes in on him at
incredible speed.

                        JOHN (V.O.)

          Some people like it...
Our view RISES OVER him and gliding across the barren
landscape are the SHADOW of WINGS.

                        JOHN (V.O.)

          Some people don't.

               STYGIAN DARKNESS

               The suggestion of traveling through space. Suddenly a star 
               sparkles to life in the distance. Gives rise to another... 
               and another... until we're looking at a whole galaxy of stars. 
               No, not stars. LIGHTS. NEON LIGHTS. A throbbing skyline of 
               neon. LAS VEGAS, NEVADA. As seen from a descending aerial 
               shot. We PLUNGE down into her shimmering embrace... DISSOLVING 
               TO:

               EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP - NIGHT

               Cruising the Strip, taking in modern day Las Vegas. Sin City 
               gone theme park. Gigantic behemoths of pulsating neon: THE 
               MGM GRAND... EXCALIBUR... LUXOR... TREASURE ISLAND... passing 
               revamped faithfuls like CAESARS and THE DESERT INN...

               ...then heading DOWNTOWN to Fremont Street, where "old school" 
               Vegas makes its last stand. BINION'S HORSESHOE, THE FOUR 
               QUEENS, THE LAS VEGAS CLUB arid...

               THE SHANGRI-LA HOTEL AND CASINO

               One thing's for sure. This place ain't no bastard child of 
               Epcott Center. At least, not yet. Sure there's some flash 
               going on, but it's more class than overkill.

               This is where the pro's come to savor a time forgotten. A 
               joint where every dealer knows your name. Where part of the 
               allure is the smell of moldy paneling and the tactile whisper 
               of worn felt. Where "funny business" doesn't just get you 
               blacklisted... It gets you dead.

               Lets us enter.

               INT. SHANGRI-LA HOTEL AND CASINO - NIGHT

               CREDITS SEQUENCE

               TRACKING through the casino floor; highlighting SLOT MACHINE 
               PAY-OFFS and pockets of rowdy players winning at BLACKJACK, 
               CRAPS and ROULETTE. It's just one of those nights. The tables 
               are on fire.

               A FLOOR MANAGER nods as a hefty bet is paid out to a shooter 
               at a craps table: He checks out his watch, anxious for the 
               arrival of...

               INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

               From behind a FIGURE in a suit. All we see is a murky 
               reflection in gold elevator doors. The floor numbers 
               descending rapidly...

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

               STICKMEN, CROUPIERS, DEALERS

               all anticipating the arrival of...

               INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

               The elevator doors open... and we PAN DOWN to the figure's 
               feet. He steps out onto the casino floor... and right away 
               we notice he has a pronounced limp.

               Following behind the figure. We haven't seen his features 
               yet... (and won't for a while.)

               TRACKING SERIES 

               -- the figure (seen in soft focus) passes a ROULETTE TABLE, 
               the wheel already in mid-spin. His hand casually brushes the 
               side of the table... and we PAN ACROSS to the wheel -- just 
               in time to see the ball landing on 00. The players HOWL 
               defeat. The croupier rakes in all the losing checks with a 
               slight nod of respect to the passing wraith...

               -- TRACKING PAST SOME BLACKJACK TABLES... RACKING from the 
               passing figure (still in soft focus) to a DEALER calling 
               out:

                                     DEALER
                         Insurance?

               At the next table, ANOTHER DEALER pulls a six card 21. Off 
               the players' stunned reactions. No way! One of the players 
               instinctively glances behind him... but the figure has moved 
               on. The dealer stifles a grin, her eyes following the figure 
               as he heads toward...

               -- A HOT CRAPS TABLE. The CROWD APPLAUDS as the shooter lands 
               a hard eight. The dice are fished back to the player. He 
               shakes them up with double ought bravado. We RACK from his 
               hand LARGE in the f.g. to our murky figure passing in the 
               background. The player throws... (we keep tracking with the 
               figure) as the stickman calls it: SEVEN OUT! to a thundering 
               chorus of disappointment.

               -- Our figure passes by in the foreground, while in the 
               background, we see a growing line of shame at one of the ATM 
               MACHINES.

               -- Following behind our figure as he turns into a corridor 
               of SLOT MACHINES. CUT TO REVERSE ANGLE from the far end of 
               the corridor. As the murky figure approaches, a player in 
               the f.g. hits a jackpot.

               Another player in mid-ground is also in the midst of a payout.

               Suddenly -- with the approach of the figure -- both payouts 
               trickle to a stop.

                                     PLAYER IN F.G.
                              (kicks the slot machine)
                         Don't you hold back, baby. Spit it 
                         out, darlin'. C'mon... Hey! Hey, 
                         this ain't right. S'posed to be eight 
                         hundred dollars. Where's the goddamn 
                         manager? Who's in charge of these 
                         rip-off slots? Yo, ma'am... change 
                         lady...

               CASINO BAR FLOOR - BAR AREA - NIGHT

               FOLLOWING BEHIND the figure as he turns out of the slot 
               corridor and heads over to the bar. He pours himself a cup 
               of coffee.

                                     FIGURE/BERNIE
                         Hey Doris, you got any cream?

               DORIS THE BARTENDER wanders over with a small container. She 
               starts to pour... Empty. We quickly STEADICAM AROUND to reveal 
               BERNIE LOOTZ's features for the first time. His sad sack 
               eyes register scant surprise at the empty cream container.

                                     BERNIE
                         Forget it.

               He's just about to leave, when an attractive COCKTAIL WAITRESS 
               cruises up. NATALIE BELISARIO -- late 20's-mid-30's. 
               Everything about her sparkles, except her eyes.

               They're post-mortem. She appears frazzled. Sifts through 
               some coin tips.

                                     NATALIE
                              (sotto)
                         Shit.
                              (to Doris)
                         Dewars and a Diet Coke. Please.

               A sheepish look comes over Bernie. He tries to catch her 
               eye. She doesn't even glance at him.

                                     BERNIE
                         Hi, Natalie.

               She looks at him. Only the faintest hint of recognition.

                                     NATALIE
                         Hi. Uh...

                                     BERNIE
                         Bernie.

                                     NATALIE
                         Yeah, Bernie.
                              (to Doris)
                         Hey, you seen Shelly around? He 
                         promised to position me at the tables 
                         tonight. I've been on skid row all 
                         week.

                                     DORIS
                              (chilly)
                         You didn't settle me from last night.

                                     NATALIE
                         No? You sure? Fuck... And I was way 
                         under. It's been, like, an A.A. 
                         convention the whole week. I'll make 
                         up for it tonight. Promise.

               Doris mutters something under her breath -- heard that one 
               before -- and dumps Natalie's drinks on her tray.

                                     BERNIE
                         If I see Shelly, I'll let him know. 
                         That you're looking for him.

               Natalie grabs up her tray. Doesn't even look at Bernie.

                                     NATALIE
                         Thanks.

               She takes off.

                                     DORIS
                         Bitch. That's the third time this 
                         month...
                              (to Bernie)
                         Let me get you that cream.

                                     BERNIE
                              (staring after Natalie)
                         Nah, it's okay.

                                     DORIS
                         Don't get sweet on that, Bernie. Not 
                         unless you're looking to get short-
                         changed.

               She raises the empty cream container for effect, turns it 
               over. A few drops dribble out.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

               Bernie limps away from the bar. We hear another spike of 
               sound from the gaming area. As he approaches, a FLOORMAN 
               stops him.

                                     FLOORMAN
                         Hey, Bernie, Shelly needs you on 
                         eleven.

                                     BERNIE
                              (nods)
                         Uh... Let's do the Chivas Regal. 
                         Have that... Natalie bring it over. 
                         The one working nickel slots next to 
                         the Paradise. I spoke to Shelly 
                         earlier, he wants her at the tables.

               The floorman nods, walks off. Bernie makes for the rowdy 
               gaming tables. Takes his time about it. His approach brings 
               an ill-wind to the area. The players appear to sense it.

               It's in their reactions. A slight hesitation of the dice.

               Fingers tensing over a pile of chips. A hand tugging at a 
               tie.

               The Cooler has arrived.

               As he reaches table eleven, Natalie intercepts him with a 
               short glass of Chivas Regal.

                                     NATALIE
                         This is you, right?

                                     BERNIE
                              (takes it from her)
                         Thanks.

                                     NATALIE
                         Joe said I should stick around. You 
                         say something to Shelly?

               Bernie just smiles at her.

                                     NATALIE
                         Wow. That was fast. Hey, thanks.

               She offers up a smile. It jump-starts those dormant eyes.

               Her whole face comes alive. Notches her up from an eight to 
               a ten. Bernie immediately glances away. He's afraid what she 
               might read in his gaze.

                                     BERNIE
                         Don't mention it.

               Bernie gestures her over to table eleven. Immediately makes 
               the HIGH ROLLER in question. A good old boy named BULLDOG.

               He's the one boasting loudly as he shakes the dice with one 
               hand.

                                     BULLDOG
                         I'll make you a fortune on five and 
                         nine. C'mon forty-five-sixty-three 
                         fifty-four!

               Bernie grabs the drink from Natalie's tray, intentionally 
               bumps Bulldog...

                                     BERNIE
                         Hey, buddy, is this your drink?

                                     BULLDOG
                         Back off, pal. I'm on a roll here.

               Another man gladly accepts the drink. Meanwhile, Bulldog 
               sends the dice high up into the air. They drop perfectly on 
               the table. The stickman calls it.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Seven out!

                                     BULLDOG
                         Mother-fucker!

                                     STICKMAN
                         Thank you for those bets, folks.

               The croupiers hungrily devour the chips from the table.

               Bernie moves on quietly before anyone notices.

               But he's been noticed all right. By Natalie. Not quite sure 
               what she's just witnessed. Who is this guy?

               We hear a VOICE over the intercom.

                                     VOICE (V.O.)
                         Conway, party of twelve, please check 
                         your reservation at the Paradise 
                         Lounge.

               Bernie reacts immediately to the code words over the speaker.

                                     BERNIE
                              (to himself)
                         Yeah, yeah, I'm comin'...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CASINO FLOOR CRAPS TABLE - MONTAGE - NIGHT

               A -- a player makes a hard six at a craps table. The players 
               howl...

               B -- from the same angle we PAN UP from losing dice to the 
               same guy. Bernie looming large in the background.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - BLACKJACK TABLES - NIGHT

               A -- Bernie taking a seat at another blackjack table. Next 
               to him, a full table of players on a good run of cards.

               B -- The same table with less players as the dealer appears 
               to be gaining an edge over the players. The only thing filling 
               up are ashtrays.

               C -- Same again, with one player. This time with Natalie 
               watching in the background. Intrigued. QUICK JUMP CUTS show 
               the player's mountain of chips going down until there is 
               only one.

               D -- The dealer taps the felt for the man to bet his last 
               chip. After a moment of indecision he flips the chip into 
               the air...

                                                             BRIDGE CUT TO:

               INT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - OVERLOOKING THE CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

               ...the chip becoming an Alka-Seltzer dropping into a glass.

               The glass is in SHELLY KAPLOW's hand. Director of Casino 
               Operations for the Shangri-la. Late 40's-early 50's.

               Distinguished, slick, oozing charm. But lose the Cartier, 
               Armani and Paco Raban and you're looking at pure street.

               He's watching Bernie through the two-way glass. Shakes his 
               head in admiration.

               Suddenly the office door swings open. THREE MEN stride in.

               Shelly projects immediate deference to NICKY "FINGERS" 
               BONNATTO. Mid-50's. Former Geovassi family underboss from 
               "back east." The guy's a relic from the days before MBAs 
               became the weapon of choice in the "family" business. He 
               wears his corporate makeover like a bad coat of paint with 
               traces of Mulberry Street primer showing through.

               Nicky's accompanied by a pair of CORPORATE TYPES in Hugo 
               Boss threads. Shelly glances their way with a look that 
               suggests he's working himself into a full-on sphincter wind-
               up. Bad news x2. Shelly's muscle, LOU stands off to one side 
               with an apologetic expression.

                                     SHELLY
                         Nicky, how the hell are you? I didn't 
                         know you were coming in...

               Nicky reaches out to shake Shelly's hand. Gets nothing back, 
               then remembers.

                                     NICKY
                              (shakes his head)
                         Whassimater? You think I don't wash 
                         up after goin' to the John? Forget 
                         about it.

               Nicky grabs Shelly, embraces him.

                                     SHELLY
                              (uncomfortably)
                         You shoulda called ahead. I woulda 
                         sent a car...

                                     NICKY
                         Ehh. We thought we'd surprise you.

                                     SHELLY
                         Well, anytime, Nicky. Anytime.

               Shelly sizes up the corporate types.

                                     NICKY
                         Shelly, I want you to meet one of 
                         our smartest VPs, Larry Sokolov. And 
                         his numbers guy, Marty Goldfarb.

               Shelly sees where this is going. Larry extends his hand...

                                     LARRY
                         How do you do, Shelly?

               ...then catches himself. Quickly pulls it back. Shelly stares 
               him down for a tense beat.

                                     SHELLY
                         What can I get you boys to drink?

               Off their uncomfortable expressions...

               INT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - A SHORT WHILE LATER - NIGHT

               Shelly seated across from Nicky, Larry and Marty.

                                     SHELLY
                         So... what brings you to town, Nicky?

               Nicky looks cautiously across the table.

                                     NICKY
                         Look, Shelly, this is your joint, 
                         you run it the way you see fit. But 
                         we got a smart kid here and he's got 
                         some good ideas on how to revitalize 
                         the Shangri-la.

                                     SHELLY
                         Revitalize? What are you talking 
                         about? We did thirty-five million 
                         last year.

               Nicky shoots a look over at Larry and Marty. Larry takes 
               this as his cue.

                                     LARRY
                         First off, Shelly, I want you to 
                         know, I have nothing but respect for 
                         you. You've done a fantastic job 
                         with the Shangri-la for the last 
                         sixteen years. No one would dispute 
                         that.

                                     NICKY
                         Yeah, no one doubts that, Shelly.

               Shelly nods carefully. But...

                                     LARRY
                         But, the business has changed out 
                         here. You just have to take a look 
                         at the Strip to see what I'm talking 
                         about.

                                     SHELLY
                         You mean, that amusement park mook 
                         fest out there? You know what that 
                         is? That's a fucking violation of 
                         something that used to be beautiful. 
                         That used to have class. Like a 
                         gorgeous high priced hooker with an 
                         exclusive clientele. And then that 
                         Steve Wynn cocksucker knocks her up 
                         and puts her in a family way.

               Nicky and Larry exchange looks. Marty drops his gaze into 
               his lap.

                                     SHELLY
                         Now she's nothing but a cheap, fat 
                         whore hiding behind too much makeup. 
                         I look at her and see all those ugly 
                         stretch marks and I want to cry. 
                         'Cause I remember her as she was.

                                     LARRY
                         Yes, well... there's no denying the 
                         bottom line. Those eyesores are raking 
                         it in. And we can't compete against 
                         that.

                                     SHELLY
                         What? You think I'm trying to compete 
                         with that? You think this joint's 
                         about bringing in the stroller crowd? 
                         Fresh off some fucking E-ticket ride, 
                         looking to break the house on red 
                         and black. Fremont's never been about 
                         that bullshit. This is where old 
                         time and real money comes to play.

                                     LARRY
                         The numbers, they don't back you up, 
                         Shelly. Nostalgia's grand. We all 
                         love nostalgia -- but it belongs in 
                         a museum. I think it's time to decide 
                         whether you're running a museum or a 
                         casino.

               Shelly is close to losing it. He catches himself, takes a 
               breath.

                                     NICKY
                         Hey, forget about it. We'll talk 
                         later. Over dinner.

                                     MARTY
                              (rubs his hands 
                              together)
                         So, how's the action?

               Larry shoots him a disapproving look. Off Shelly's disturbed 
               expression. He's already calculating serious damage control.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

               Bernie makes his way across the casino floor, when he's 
               intercepted by Shelly.

                                     SHELLY
                         Bernie. Mr. Cool. Got a moment?

                                     BERNIE
                         I was just heading over to --

                                     SHELLY
                         It can wait.

               Shelly escorts Bernie over to a nearby bar area. The BARTENDER 
               zips over with some drinks.

                                     SHELLY
                         How's the knee?

               Bernie shrugs. Natalie steps up to the bar a few feet away.

               Puts in a drink order. She catches Bernie's eye. Nods.

               Bernie smiles.

                                     SHELLY
                         I was speaking to this orthopedic 
                         surgeon over at Vegas Memorial. He 
                         tells me they can replace a man's 
                         entire kneecap with titanium. It's 
                         the kinda thing that costs a shitload, 
                         but since the man's into us for five 
                         hundred large, I'm sure we could --

                                     BERNIE
                              (stealing glances at 
                              Natalie)
                         I told you, I'm not gonna be around 
                         after Sunday.

                                     SHELLY
                              (sighs)
                         Where you gonna go, Bernie? Where 
                         the fuck are you gonna go that's 
                         better'n here? I got you covered in 
                         this town. People, they know you 
                         work for me, that's currency in your 
                         pocket. That's fuckin' respect when 
                         you walk the floor. Where you gonna 
                         get that anyplace else?

                                     BERNIE
                              (sighs)
                         Seven days, Shelly. Seven days and 
                         I'm out from under.

               A beautiful WOMAN in a low cut dress, sashays her way past 
               them, heading for a high rollers craps table. Shelly reaches 
               out, napkin in hand, grabs her arm. Hands her his card. She 
               snatches it, looks it over. Immediately loses all attitude.

               Oh shit.

                                     SHELLY
                         That's right. I like to know who's 
                         shopping it in my neighborhood. You 
                         wanna keep working the Shangri-la, 
                         you come see me tomorrow morning in 
                         my office. We'll go over the rules 
                         together. And before you come, you 
                         bring me a clean bill of health. OK?

               The hooker just nods.

                                     SHELLY
                         All right, get outta here.

               She takes off. At the same time Natalie leaves with her drink 
               order. They walk in the same direction. Shelly mistakes 
               Bernie's wandering look for interest in the hooker.

                                     SHELLY
                         You want that, Bernie? She's yours. 
                         Anytime. I'll keep a tab running for 
                         you.
                              (Bernie shakes his 
                              head)
                         What's a matter? Not your type?

               Bernie just stares after Natalie, Shelly finally picking up 
               on it.

                                     BERNIE
                         Things are getting hot on fourteen. 
                         I gotta go.

               He limps off. Shelly stares after him. A predator seizing up 
               his prey. Calculating.

               EXT. LUCKY STAR MOTEL - NIGHT

               Bernie's 1958 Buick Electra pulls into the parking lot of a 
               flea-bag motel. Next door to the motel, we see a convenience 
               store with the name, THE EZ MARK in pink glowing neon. It's 
               actually supposed to read: The EZ MARKET, but the last two 
               letters of "Market" have burned out.

               INT. LUCKY STAR MOTEL - COURTYARD - NIGHT

               One of those center pool style motels. A hard luck oasis, if 
               ever there was one.

               As Bernie limps toward his room, his neighbor, a low rent 
               HOOKER, approaches from the opposite end of the courtyard 
               with a huge-ass JOHN in tow.

               They converge at their doors at the same time. There's a 
               weariness about the hooker that's endemic to this town. She 
               winks at Bernie. He nods at her. Then casts a furtive glance 
               over at the John. The man flips him off. The hooker mouths, 
               "Sorry." Bernie hastily enters his apartment.

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Bernie flips on the light. A dim overhead bulb hardly makes 
               a dent in the gloomy surroundings. Typical drab motel 
               furnishings.

               We notice a couple of dead plants on the radiator next to 
               the window. A single place setting on the counter. Something 
               odd: an empty cat food bowl on the kitchenette floor. No 
               sign of a cat. Go figure.

               Bernie heads over to the dresser. A half-filled bottle of 
               gin rests next to a lone glass with a crack down the side.

               He pours himself a shot. Turns on the TV. A religious channel. 
               Shitty reception.

               ON SCREEN:

               an Appalachian Pentecostal service. The members of the 
               congregation taking up snakes and writhing around in religious 
               hysteria, while a number at the bottom of the screen solicits 
               viewer donations.

               Bernie doesn't even try to change the channel. He takes a 
               seat on his bed, props himself up against a pair of pillows, 
               stretches out.

               From next door, the sounds of wild humping.

                                     HOOKER (O.S.)
                         ...Oh yeah, baby, give it to me. Oh 
                         yeah, that's the spot... Do it to me 
                         harder, you big stud... Oooooh...

               Bernie closes his eyes, tries to ignore the X-rated soundtrack 
               coming at him through the carpaccio thin walls.

               The hooker's moans are starting to get to him. He raises his 
               fist to the wall, then stops himself. He's just not the 
               confrontational type.

               Instead, he heads over to the TV, cranks the volume up. The 
               hysterical moaning from the snake ritual now blends in with 
               the grunting and groaning from next door, making for a bizarre 
               remix that could only exist in the world of Bernie Lootz. 
               Bernie emits a deep sigh, closes his eyes.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - CRAPS TABLES - NIGHT

               Big action at the craps tables tonight. The players cheer as 
               MR. PINKERTON makes another pass. He exudes USED CAR SALESMAN.

               Natalie arrives with his drink.

                                     NATALIE
                         Seven and Seven?

               Pinkerton reaches for the drink without taking his eyes off 
               the table. He throws a hard six. The crowd cheers again.

               He turns around, stuffs a hundred dollar chip down her shirt 
               and slyly cops a feel.

                                     PINKERTON
                         Thanks, dollface.

               Natalie shudders in disgust. She spins around to leave... 
               runs smack into Bernie, spilling her tray of drinks on him.

                                     NATALIE
                         Oh shit... Sorry... I'm such a klutz.

               Bernie wipes himself off, helps her pick up the pieces.

                                     BERNIE
                         It's all right. Happens.

               Natalie tries to wipe him down a bit more.

                                     NATALIE
                         Sorry, this guy... fuckin' hands, 
                         you know...

                                     BERNIE
                         S'okay. You might want to stick 
                         around.

               Bernie wiggles his way next to Pinkerton. He gives the 
               stickman a certain look.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Excuse me, Mr. Pinkerton. You have 
                         no hard eight.

                                     PINKERTON
                              (throwing in a chip)
                         Gimmie a hundred dollar hard eight.

               Bernie just watches as Pinkerton throws the dice.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Eight the hard way!

               The players go nuts. The stickman taps the felt in front of 
               the shooter.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Nine hundred dollars to Mr. Pinkerton.

                                     PINKERTON
                         Parlay! Parlay!

               The Boxman seated at the center looks up at him.

                                     PINKERTON
                         C'mon. You can take that action.

               The Boxman feigns concern, then nods in approval.

                                     PINKERTON
                         That's what I'm talking about. None 
                         of this low limit bullshit.

               Just as the stickman feeds Pinkerton the dice, Bernie flips 
               a dollar chip over toward the center of the table. Natalie 
               peers between them to catch a glimpse.

                                     BERNIE
                         Dollar hard eight.

               The chip lands on Pinkerton's parlayed bet. He releases the 
               dice from his stubby little fingers.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Eight easy! Easy eight! Hard eight 
                         comes down.

               The players cry out in defeat. Pinkerton grumbles to himself. 
               He fingers his rail of chips.

                                     PINKERTON
                         Five hundred dollar hard eight. And 
                         press my nine up two units.

               He throws in the chips. The croupier places his bets. The 
               dice are fed back to him. He throws.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Easy way eight! Eight easy!

               Pinkerton is fit to be tied. After a passing moment of clarity 
               he empties his entire rail.

                                     PINKERTON
                         Hard eight.

               The entire table stops down for a second.

                                     PLAYER (O.S.)
                         Way to go, Pinkie! Bet the farm.

               Pinkerton sets his dice carefully and lets them fly.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Seven out!

               Pinkerton slams his fist down on the table. He turns to leave 
               the table to find Natalie smiling at him.

                                     PINKERTON
                         What the fuck you smiling at, bitch?

               Pinkerton starts to lose it. Security moves in, right on 
               time. Natalie shoots Bernie a satisfied look. He averts his 
               eyes shyly and limps away. She stares after him for a moment.

               INT. PARADISE LOUNGE - NIGHT

               BUDDY STAFFORD, the Paradise Lounge's star attraction, is 
               performing on stage. He's a poor man's Tony Bennett. Mid to 
               late 60's. A staple at the Paradise for the last 20 years.

               The singer sluggishly descends the stage to the lounge floor, 
               almost tripping over his microphone cable.

               Buddy works the room, leaning in real close to the ladies, 
               delivering the requisite eye contact. When their companions 
               react with mock outrage, Buddy raises his fists playfully in 
               a boxer's defensive stance. It's classic Buddy Stafford 
               schtick.

               From somewhere across the lounge, an ATTRACTIVE WOMAN jumps 
               up and throws her panties at Buddy. Buddy catches them and 
               waves them in the air... just as another pair whizzes by...

               We PAN ACROSS to Shelly seated at his corner booth, in the 
               company of Nicky Fingers, Larry and Marty.

               TIGHT ON SHELLY as he focuses on Buddy. A smile threatens 
               his patented stoicism. He's flashing back on the old days.

               While Nicky and Marty are clearly enjoying Buddy's 
               performance, Larry fixates on the singer with joyless eyes.

               We take on LARRY'S POV of Buddy --

               SLOW MOTION CLOSE-UPS of BUDDY SINGING. The MUSIC SLOWED 
               DOWN with the action, emphasizing Buddy's lack of energy.

               Sweat dripping off Buddy's forehead, splattering into tiny 
               jewels against his microphone. Buddy's tired eyes. Shaking 
               hands around the mic.

               SMASH CUT to real time APPLAUSE as Buddy reaches the end of 
               the song. Larry is the only one not clapping. RACK ACROSS to 
               Shelly as he picks up on this.

               INT. PARADISE LOUNGE - BACK STAGE - NIGHT

               Shelly approaches Buddy's dressing room. He enters without 
               knocking...

               INT. BUDDY STAFFORD'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

               ...to find a trembling Buddy hunched over on a sofa, hugging 
               himself. Buddy immediately sits up...

                                     BUDDY
                         Shelly. I was a goddamn embarrassment 
                         tonight. I shouldn'a let you talk me 
                         into going on.
                              (massages his throat)
                         It's definitely strep.

                                     SHELLY
                         You were velvet out there, pops. 
                         Silk.

               Shelly throws a pair of red silk panties to Buddy. We see a 
               room number scribbled on the crotch area.

                                     SHELLY
                         They were hanging on the door outside. 
                         Forget your tonsils. When the muff 
                         confetti stops coming, that's when 
                         you got yourself a problem.

                                     BUDDY
                              (dangling the panties 
                              on his finger)
                         You get a receipt?

                                     SHELLY
                         Excuse me?

                                     BUDDY
                         Charmayne's in the lobby. They got 
                         these on sale in the window. Victoria 
                         Secret's Valentine's Collection. And 
                         the broad waiting in the room, what 
                         she set you back? Always Grade-A for 
                         Ol' Buddy.

                                     SHELLY
                         Are you kidding me? Gimme that.
                              (snatches the panties 
                              away from Buddy)
                         You don't fucking deserve this. All 
                         those ladies going home with a sweet 
                         breeze between their legs because 
                         you still do it for them and you're 
                         fingering me for some kinda Buddy 
                         Stafford ego pimp. Hey, fuck you, 
                         old man.

               Shelly feigns as if he's leaving.

                                     BUDDY
                              (affectionately)
                         Get back here, you prick. Hand it 
                         over.

               Shelly throws the panties back at Buddy. Buddy just stares 
               at him with pained eyes, waiting for something else. Sweat 
               mirror balls his wrinkled forehead.

               Shelly nods. Removes a foil package from his pocket. Hands 
               it to Buddy. The singer rushes over to his dressing table.

               Unwraps his works. Rubber tubes his forearm. Trembling hands 
               juggle lighter and hypodermic.

               Shelly takes a seat on the sofa. Buddy, euphoric as the dope 
               hits the spot. Tears in his eyes. He picks up on Shelly's 
               somber expression in the mirror.

                                     BUDDY
                         Whassimatter, kid? You got that 
                         Nostradamus look.

               Shelly shakes his head.

                                     BUDDY
                         You ever watch those nature shows on 
                         TV?

               Shelly shakes his head.

                                     BUDDY
                         I've seen this one a dozen times. 
                         It's about lions. Cycle of life thing. 
                         The leader of the pack...

                                     SHELLY
                         Pride. It's called a pride.

                                     BUDDY
                         Yeah, pride. The leader of the 
                         pride... when he gets on in years. 
                         It's just a matter of time before 
                         some young male arrives on the scene 
                         to challenge him. They go at it and 
                         the old cat gets the crap beaten 
                         outta him. It's humiliating. In front 
                         of all the females, this goes down. 
                         And after he's defeated, he's cast 
                         out of the pride, to scavenge and 
                         die alone in the bush.

                                     SHELLY
                         Yeah, nature's got a real sick sense 
                         of humor.

                                     BUDDY
                         No shit. It's fucking tragic because 
                         the old lion can't figure it out on 
                         his own. That he's past it. It'd be 
                         so much easier for him to just walk 
                         away and save himself all that pain 
                         and humiliation.

                                     SHELLY
                         That's like admitting to yourself 
                         that you're already dead. I prefer 
                         nature's way.

                                     BUDDY
                              (a beat)
                         Yeah. Me, too.

               Shelly holds Buddy's gaze in the mirror.

               INT. PARADISE LOUNGE - BACK STAGE - NIGHT

               Shelly exits the dressing room, to find Larry waiting on 
               him.

               He's accompanied by a good looking YOUNG MAN.

                                     LARRY
                         Shelly, got a minute...

               Shelly's expression: no. But he heads over anyway.

                                     LARRY
                         Shelly, this is Johnny Capella.

                                     JOHNNY
                         How ya doin', Shelly?

               Johnny extends his hand. Shelly ignores the gesture.

                                     SHELLY
                         I know you from somewhere, right?

                                     LARRY
                         Johnny's been opening for Danny Ganz 
                         at the Mirage. Sony's talking about 
                         signing him to a three album deal. 
                         They're positioning him as the new 
                         Ricki Martin.

                                     SHELLY
                         And I should be interested in this, 
                         why?

                                     LARRY
                         Johnny's looking to headline. I told 
                         him we might be interested.

                                     SHELLY
                              (icy)
                         We?

                                     JOHNNY
                         Hey, if this is a bad time...

                                     SHELLY
                         Even if I were interested, Buddy's 
                         got ink with us through 2003. I just 
                         renegotiated his contract last year.

                                     JOHNNY
                         Sounds like the two of you need to 
                         get on the same page.
                              (to Larry)
                         If I don't hear from you by Thursday, 
                         I'm taking the Stardust's offer.

               Johnny nods at Shelly, takes off. Shelly and Larry eyeball 
               each other for a long, cold beat. Shelly's about to say 
               something, when Nicky and Marty approach. Larry shrugs, 
               flashes a chilling smile.

                                     NICKY
                         Where's Buddy? I wanna buy the old 
                         fart a drink.

                                     SHELLY
                         Buddy asked me to send you his 
                         regards, Nicky. He's not feeling so 
                         great. I think he's got that stomach 
                         flu that's going around.

                                     NICKY
                         Oh yeah? That's too bad.
                              (Shelly isn't fooling 
                              him)
                         Well, another time then.

                                     MARTY
                         Hey, Shelly, Nicky says you might be 
                         able to hook us up with some 
                         showgirls. Something with class.

               Shelly eyeballs Marty for a tense, extended beat. What do I 
               look like, some fuckin' pimp, college boy? Just as Marty's 
               starting to get real uncomfortable, Shelly cracks a smile.

                                     SHELLY
                         Sure, no problem. You got any 
                         preferences?

                                     NICKY
                              (jumps in)
                         Yeah. Something with big headlights, 
                         nice rims and low mileage.

                                     MARTY
                         You got any Asian babes?

               Shelly looks to Larry.

                                     LARRY
                         I think I'll just stick with the 
                         tables.

               We linger on Shelly's unsettled look. This guy is bad news.

               EXT. SHANGRI-LA PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Bernie weaves his way through the lot to his car. Arriving 
               at his Buick, he's startled to find Natalie leaning against 
               it. She holds up the $100 chip the drunk tipped her.

                                     NATALIE
                         Buy you a drink?

               Off of Bernie's surprised expression...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE MAKAWAO BAR AND GRILL - NIGHT

               Cheesy Polynesian decor. Mood lighting = an excuse to keep 
               the electric down. Basically, a joint where people come to 
               lose themselves.

               Natalie and Bernie are seated in a booth near the back. She 
               sips on an umbrella drink; he's nursing his usual gin.

               Natalie has an astrological chart in front of her. In between 
               sips, she makes annotations to the chart.

                                     NATALIE
                              (almost to herself)
                         Your Progressed Venus is Gemini, 
                         12.5 Degrees, and is in Direct motion. 
                         Which tells me that you're a slow 
                         starter when it comes to romance.
                              (off Bernie's taken 
                              aback expression)
                         You know what? This is real 
                         unprofessional of me. I shouldn't 
                         discuss your chart with you until 
                         I'm all done. I can tell by that 
                         look, you think this is all a lot of 
                         B.S.

                                     BERNIE
                         No... I just know what the outcome's 
                         going to be.

                                     NATALIE
                         The outcome? There's not, like, one 
                         particular outcome. A lot of things 
                         enter into it. The planets, moon 
                         phases...

                                     BERNIE
                         The outcome won't change with me. 
                         It'll be all bad.

                                     NATALIE
                         God, I have never met anyone who was 
                         so down on themselves. I used to be 
                         down on myself, OK? I don't go there 
                         anymore. I've got just three more 
                         correspondence classes with this 
                         stuff, then I'll have my certificate 
                         and everything. And you know how I 
                         got OK?

                                     BERNIE
                              (deadpan)
                         You had your chart done.

                                     NATALIE
                         Yes, as a matter of fact that is 
                         perfectly correct.

                                     BERNIE
                         Do you know what I do at the Shangri-
                         la?

                                     NATALIE
                         I asked around. You're a "cooler." 
                         You turn winners into losers.

                                     BERNIE
                         And do you know how I do that?

                                     NATALIE
                         I know there's stuff that goes on in 
                         casinos all the time --

                                     BERNIE
                         I do it by being myself. People get 
                         next to me and their luck turns. 
                         It's always been that way.

                                     NATALIE
                         That sounds to me like a self 
                         fulfilling prophecy. There's a whole 
                         chapter on that in my course. Anyways, 
                         I can see a big factor in your life 
                         is that you're lacking companionship. 
                         There's nobody to deflect off. If 
                         you've got, as you put it, bad karma, 
                         then you need someone with good karma 
                         to neutralize it. Well, that's my 
                         take on it anyway.

               Bernie maintains eye contact with Natalie for an extended 
               beat. Then drops his head, gazes at his glass.

                                     BERNIE
                         I don't know about you, but I'm real 
                         tired.

               Natalie nods. Bernie motions to stand. Natalie just remains 
               seated. Keeps talking.

                                     NATALIE
                         I have this recurring dream where 
                         I'm on some beautiful island in the 
                         Bahamas. I'm sitting on the beach, 
                         taking in this amazing sunset with 
                         one of these in my hand
                              (gestures to her drink)
                         ...and then it starts to rain. And I 
                         wake up and it's my roof leaking on 
                         me. Yeah, I'm also real tired, Bernie.

                                     BERNIE
                              (not even sure why 
                              he's telling her 
                              this)
                         I only got six more days. Well, almost 
                         five really. Then I'll be leaving 
                         town.

                                     NATALIE
                         Only five more days?
                              (a beat)
                         Then we shouldn't waste any more 
                         time.

               Natalie covers Bernie's hand with hers.

                                     NATALIE
                         Why don't we go back to your place?

                                     BERNIE
                              (completely caught 
                              off-guard)
                         I, uh... If this is... I don't know... 
                         I don't know if I can afford...

               Natalie flinches slightly. Then swiftly regains her composure. 
               It's Vegas. An honest mistake.

                                     BERNIE
                         Oh god... I'm so sorry... I didn't 
                         mean... You see -- that's exactly 
                         what I'm talking about. I've gone 
                         and "cooled" the damn table.

                                     NATALIE
                         Ah, just shut up, Bernie. You haven't 
                         gone and cooled anything. Not by a 
                         long shot.

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Natalie's hand flips on the television. Another bizarre 
               religious service. We pull back from the screen as she tries 
               to change the channel. Just gets a whole lot of static.

               Bernie's standing uncomfortably in the middle of the room.

                                     NATALIE
                         You should complain about this.

                                     BERNIE
                         I'm not here that much. Drink? Sorry, 
                         all I got's gin.

                                     NATALIE
                         Nah. I've had my fill. Go ahead.

               Bernie walks over to the dresser, pours himself a shot.

               Natalie glances around. She notices Bernie's dead plants...

                                     NATALIE
                         You know, once they're dead, they 
                         don't really grow back. In case, 
                         that's what you're waiting for.

               Her eyes land on the empty cat bowl. She's about to say 
               something, when she picks up on Bernie's expression. Let's 
               not even go there. She gestures to an old record player in 
               the corner.

                                     NATALIE
                         So... got any music?

               Bernie opens one of the kitchenette cupboards. Bare shelves... 
               except for a lone RECORD up on top. He brings it down. It's 
               a Sinatra album. Never been opened.

               Natalie looks on as Bernie meticulously removes the record 
               from its sleeve. He blows a few particles of dust from its 
               surface. Then delicately lays it on the turntable. The way 
               he goes about this is incredibly ceremonious. With as much 
               care as given to disarming a nuclear weapon.

               Natalie can't help but smile.

               Bernie lowers the needle to the first cut of the record.

               Everything seems to be going so well, until...

               SKREEEEEE! The needle skids across the surface of the record 
               with a sound worse than chalk on a blackboard.

               Bernie opens his mouth in a silent grimace... and a delicious 
               laugh comes out.

               It's Natalie's laugh. Talk about a tension breaker. Bernie 
               turns to her, shrugs. He tries again. This time the needle 
               catches... and Sinatra takes command of the room. He's singing 
               "This Town," a finger snapping upbeat Valentine to Vegas. 
               Marred only by a slight clicking caused by the scratch.

               Natalie summons Bernie over with her wagging forefinger. He 
               picks up his glass, shuffles over.

                                     NATALIE
                         Sit. Relax. I promise you, at least 
                         one of us has done this before.

                                     BERNIE
                         This is not my first --

                                     NATALIE
                         Sssh. Surprise me.

               She starts massaging his shoulders, eliciting involuntary 
               moans from him. Bernie is almost in tears. Nobody's touched 
               him like this in years. And it shows.

               Natalie takes Bernie's glass, gulps down the remains herself, 
               then sets it on the floor. She drops down next to Bernie.

               Starts kissing him. Takes it slow.

                                     NATALIE
                         You're doing real good.

               They fall back onto the mattress. Natalie taking the reigns, 
               maneuvering her hips, kicking off her panties...

               Bernie gets an eyeful of a tattoo on her butt. A pair of 
               dice. Both twos.

               In seconds, Natalie has separated Bernie from his pants and 
               underwear, taking him inside of her, Ol' Blue Eyes keeping 
               the rhythm...

               Natalie moans uninhibitedly. Surprise: she's a real screamer. 
               Moments later, we hear banging from the hooker's side of the 
               wall. Some John telling them to keep it down.

               Bernie, with tears of elation in his eyes, thrusts away at 
               Natalie... for all of thirty seconds, before he explodes, 
               convulsing in her arms with a stifled gasp.

               Frank winds down "This Town" a few seconds later. Poor Bernie, 
               he didn't even make it through the song.

                                     BERNIE
                         Sorry...

               Natalie wraps her arms around him.

                                     NATALIE
                         Don't worry, Bernie. I've had worse. 
                         We'll try again later.

               Bernie rests his head on her breasts. Closes his eyes. We 
               hold on him. A few seconds pass... and he breaks into a smile.

               Fade to black.

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               TIGHT on Bernie sleeping. He still has that goofy smile on 
               his lips. A beat or two later, he opens his eyes. We PULL 
               BACK to reveal that he's alone in the bed. No sign of Natalie.

               Bernie turns to the pillow next to him, buries his face in 
               it. Takes a deep breath. Moans at her scent. Ambrosia. He 
               still has his face in the pillow, sucking in deep breaths, 
               when Natalie steps out of the bathroom. Big smile.

                                     NATALIE
                         Hey, so, you wanna get some breakfast?

               Bernie just looks up at her; replay on the goofy smile.

               Heaven.

                                     BERNIE (V.O.)
                         -- I did six months at Rikers for 
                         running numbers. It was Shelly's 
                         thing, but I took the rap for it.

               INT. MOONLIGHTER COFFEE SHOP - DAY

               Bernie and Natalie sit eating breakfast.

                                     BERNIE
                         After I get out, I call up Shelly 
                         and he tells me to come out here. I 
                         figure he's going to set me up good 
                         at the Shangri-la. But he tells me 
                         they got all these rules about casinos 
                         employing felons. So he gets me this 
                         gig doing telemarketing for one of 
                         their fronts -- trying to scam 
                         pensioners out of their retirement 
                         money. I lasted two weeks.

               As Bernie talks, Natalie spies a very PREGNANT GIRL (20's) 
               coming out of the restroom. Her eyes follow the girl back to 
               a table where a YOUNG MAN (20's) waits on her.

                                     BERNIE
                         Already, I was getting in deep. 
                         Finally it got so bad, I had to beg 
                         Shelly to take on my markers around 
                         town. That just bought me more time 
                         to keep losing. I put Shelly in an 
                         awkward position. I understand why 
                         he did what he did.
                              (taps his knee)

                                     NATALIE
                         He did that to you? What, he shot 
                         you?

                                     BERNIE
                         Baseball bat.
                              (off her cringing 
                              expression)
                         I got off easy.

                                     NATALIE
                         That's getting off easy?

                                     BERNIE
                         I was out of control.

                                     NATALIE
                         But he maimed you...

                                     BERNIE
                         Let me tell you something. I'm 
                         grateful for what he did.
                              (off her stunned look)
                         No kidding. Every time I get an urge 
                         to play off the clock -- to so much 
                         as drop a quarter in a slot -- I 
                         reach down and squeeze what's left 
                         of my cartilage. It's one helluva 
                         reminder.

                                     NATALIE
                         Jesus... I thought stuff like that 
                         didn't happen no more. Like that was 
                         just in the movies or something.

               Bernie holds her gaze her for a moment.

                                     BERNIE
                         Anyway, Shelly and I worked out a 
                         payment plan. Two years off the books 
                         at the Shangri-la, cooling tables. 
                         Five more days and I walk.

               Before Natalie can respond, we hear the pregnant girl start 
               to moan out loud. The waitress rushes over.

                                     PREGNANT GIRL
                              (clutching her belly)
                         Oh shit, I think I'm going into labor!

               The young man at the table rushes her to her feet, escorts 
               her toward the exit in a dramatic fashion. All this without 
               paying the bill.

               As they pass by Bernie and Natalie's table, the girl trips 
               over Natalie's purse. Bernie quickly helps her up. That's 
               when he notices the young man...

                                     BERNIE
                              (shocked)
                         Mikey?

                                     MIKEY
                         Bernie...

               There's a quick moment of confusion. Bernie feels a bit thrown 
               by it all.

               EXT. MOONLIGHTER COFFEE SHOP - PARKING LOT - DAY

               Bernie accompanies them out to their car at a quick step.

               Once out the door, the girl's contractions appear to have 
               subsided. Natalie walks with the girl to try and help.

                                     PREGNANT GIRL
                         I'm OK now. False alarm. Thanks.

               Bernie pulls Mikey aside.

                                     BERNIE
                         Mikey? Is that...? You're not the...

                                     MIKEY
                              (nods)
                         Bull's eye. One time. Obviously runs 
                         in the family. I guess you're gonna 
                         be a grandfather, Bernie.

               They reach the couple's car. A rusted out 1955 Ford Fairlaine. 
               By the looks of it, they've been living out of it.

                                     BERNIE
                         This you?

                                     MIKEY
                         Hey, what the fuck, it runs. Anyways, 
                         we gotta be somewhere...

                                     BERNIE
                         How's your mom doing?

                                     MIKEY
                         I'm gonna pretend like you give a 
                         shit and tell you, she's getting by. 
                         As long as she's wasted.

               Bernie nods. He gazes past Mikey to the girl.

                                     MIKEY
                         Name's Charlene, in case you were 
                         wondering. Looks like she's carrying 
                         a whole litter in there, don't it?

                                     NATALIE
                         When was the last time you saw a 
                         doctor?

               Charlene sidles up alongside Mikey.

                                     CHARLENE
                         This clinic in Jersey. Maybe six 
                         months ago. I wasn't about to go 
                         back after they treated me like 
                         cattle. Just because I didn't have 
                         no insurance. And those places, 
                         they're crawling with T.B. from all 
                         'em spies.

                                     BERNIE
                         So, you're in town...?

                                     MIKEY
                         Maybe a week or so. Got some business 
                         to take care of.

                                     BERNIE
                         If you want, stop by the Lucky Star 
                         Motel. Give us a chance to catch up. 
                         I'm on three to eleven shift at the 
                         Shangri-la. I work the floor.

                                     MIKEY
                         No shit. Well, how 'bout that? Yeah, 
                         maybe I'll do that. We can play catch 
                         up. For the kid's sake. Gotta split.

                                     NATALIE
                              (to Charlene)
                         Take care.

               Mikey helps Charlene into the front passenger seat. They 
               drive off. Natalie looks to Bernie. She's curious, but doesn't 
               ask. He appears thankful for that.

               INT. CASINO - BLACKJACK TABLES - NIGHT

               CLOSE on a skyline of black chips neatly positioned on the 
               felt. We see the owner of the chips strike a match. His last 
               one. It fizzles out quickly. TILT UP to the PLAYER'S FACE 
               with an unlit cigarette hanging from his lips.

               A hand quickly reaches in, lights the cigarette with a Zippo.

               PULL BACK to reveal Bernie.

                                     PLAYER
                         Thanks...

                                     BERNIE
                         Don't mention it.

               Bernie sits at the table.

                                     DEALER
                              (he knows the routine)
                         Hundred dollar minimum here, sir.

               Bernie peels off a hundred from his billfold. Lays it on the 
               felt.

                                     DEALER
                         Money plays one hundred.

                                     PLAYER
                              (to Bernie)
                         No offense, pal, but there's twenty 
                         other tables. What do you wanna come 
                         sit on my head for?

                                     BERNIE
                         Just wanna play one hand. Feeling 
                         lucky tonight. I got this voice in 
                         my head, says this is the table...

                                     PLAYER
                         I know this is the table. I'm already 
                         doing good here. It's my fucking 
                         table --

                                     BERNIE
                              (touching him)
                         Hey, heard the one about the fella 
                         walks into a bar and says, "Hey, who 
                         owns that big great dane outside?" A 
                         man at the end of the bar raises his 
                         hand. "I do." The fella says, "Yeah? 
                         Well, my dog just killed it."

               The dealer finishes shuffling, begins to deal.

                                     BERNIE
                         "Whaddya mean your dog just killed 
                         my great dane? What kinda dog you 
                         have?" The fella just shrugs and 
                         says, "A chihuahua." "You tellin' me 
                         your chihuahua just killed my great 
                         dane? How?"
                              (a beat)
                         "I dunno," the fella says, "I think 
                         he got stuck in his throat."

               Bernie starts laughing. The player is less than tickled.

               Just then the dealer interrupts them.

                                     DEALER
                         Insurance?

               We see the dealer's got an ace showing.

                                     PLAYER
                         God damnit!

               The player waves off the insurance, as does Bernie. The dealer 
               checks. Nothing. As the hand plays through the dealer busts 
               out. Bernie glances over at the dealer. What the hell? Bernie 
               places his chips again.

                                     PLAYER
                         You said, one hand.

                                     BERNIE
                              (agitated; to dealer)
                         Keep going.

               The dealer plays. Bernie and the high roller win again.

               Bernie glances around him uncomfortably. We see Shelly 
               approaching. Shelly just has a nose for when things aren't 
               running smoothly. Larry is lurking behind him.

               The dealer turns up some cards. And again, Bernie and the 
               high roller win. Bernie looks absolutely perturbed. Shelly 
               gestures something with his head. Bernie cashes out.

                                     PLAYER
                         Hey, stick around, pal. You and me, 
                         we make a great team.

               Bernie strolls over to Shelly. Shelly guides him away from 
               the table under Larry's watchful eye.

                                     SHELLY
                         What was that?

               Bernie shrugs, still confused.

                                     SHELLY
                         Well, what fucking gives? Is it 
                         McGann? He's been with us twelve 
                         years. The man's as standup as my 
                         dick.
                              (thinking to himself)
                         Maybe he's got money problems. I'm 
                         gonna pull him. He wasn't counting 
                         'em, was he? The mook with the streak?

               Bernie shakes his head. Larry sidles over.

                                     LARRY
                         Is there a problem?

                                     SHELLY
                              (zero tolerance)
                         No, there's no problem. Fella's on a 
                         streak, is all.

                                     LARRY
                              (re: Bernie)
                         Let me guess? This is one of your 
                         "coolers?"

                                     SHELLY
                         Why don't you announce it to the 
                         whole fucking joint?

                                     LARRY
                              (lowers his voice)
                         Man, they told me you were a stickler 
                         for the old ways. But coolers? What 
                         is this guy, some kind of degenerate 
                         gambler? Reformed card shark? He 
                         doesn't look too effective to me.

                                     SHELLY
                         He's the best. Take it from me.

                                     LARRY
                         Sure. Whatever. But there ways -- 
                         subtle ways -- to keep things in our 
                         favor. I'm talking more forward 
                         thinking methods.

                                     SHELLY
                         That right? I suppose you got a whole 
                         fucking prospectus on the subject.

                                     LARRY
                         As a matter of fact I do. Like, right 
                         off the bat, I can tell you this 
                         wallpaper isn't going to cut it. 
                         It's too uplifting. I would go with 
                         more muted tones.

                                     SHELLY
                         Yeah? Wallpaper?

                                     LARRY
                         And personally, I think the waitresses 
                         can all pop another button or two. 
                         Myself, I wouldn't hire anything 
                         less than a C cup.

               Shelly looks to Bernie. You believe this mook? Larry extracts 
               a CD from his jacket...

                                     LARRY
                         Know what this is? Music to be sure. 
                         Pleasant, non-intrusive. But blended 
                         in at a subsonic level is a mantra. 
                         "Lose... lose... lose." And that's 
                         just skimming the surface. We really 
                         need to talk, Shelly.

               Shelly is close to losing it. When MORRIE, the manager of 
               the Paradise, comes running up...

                                     MORRIE
                         Shelly, you better come quick.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Shelly, Larry and Bernie following behind Morrie as he hastily 
               leads them down a hallway of the Shangri-la's best suites. 
               They arrive at an open door, the sound of a TELEVISION 
               beckoning them inside...

               INT. BUDDY STAFFORD'S SUITE - NIGHT

               Starting on the TV set: "Lost Horizon" (1937) is playing.

               It's the scene where Robert Conway (Ronald Coleman), his 
               brother and Maria are leaving the lost city in the end.

               Conway looks back for one last tearful view of paradise.

               PANNING OFF THE SCREEN to a pair of naked feet on the floor 
               next to the bed... revealing Buddy slumped against the side 
               of the mattress... a hypodermic needle protruding from his 
               arm. Death glaze fixated on the screen.

               Bernie slumps back against the wall. Catches his breath.

               Shelly just stares at Buddy, a slight tremor of grief 
               threatening his granite features. He glances over at Larry, 
               who takes in Buddy's deathly repose without a hint of emotion. 
               Larry meets Shelly's eye with a subtle smirk of one-upmanship.

               An incendiary beat passes between them. Then...

                                     SHELLY
                              (to Morrie)
                         Get a hold of his daughter. Assist 
                         her with the arrangements. The Shangri-
                         la will take care of everything.

                                     MORRIE
                         What about the Paradise?

                                     SHELLY
                         She goes dark tonight.

                                     LARRY
                         That won't be necessary.

               Shelly and Larry exchange looks again. Bernie picks up on 
               it. The tension in the room threatens nuclear fission. A 
               loud ANIMAL ROAR reverberates on the soundtrack...

               accompanied by jungle-like percussion... as we CUT TO:

               INT. THE PARADISE LOUNGE - NIGHT

               A "now performing" poster on a metal stand: JOHNNY CAPPELLA 
               live at the Paradise Lounge!

               PANNING off the sign and following a COUPLE through the doors 
               into the theater.

               ...our eye drawn to the stage. A troupe of gorgeous FEMALE 
               DANCERS in leopard print G-strings, grinding their hips to 
               the muscular rhythm.

               Flanking them are a pair of strutting LIONS in elevated cages.

               An EXPLOSION OF LIGHT and SMOKE... and JOHNNY CAPPELLA makes 
               his entrance. Decked out in a reflective suit that picks up 
               every light in the house and throws it back at the audience.

               Johnny's got the style of a Harry Connick Jr. and the moves 
               of Ricki Martin. The energy this guy brings to the stage 
               makes the last twenty years of Buddy Stafford's reign seem 
               like suspended animation. The women in the audience start 
               fanning themselves with delight.

               It's a new dawn in Paradise. And the panties are coming fast 
               and furious.

               We see Shelly watching from the back of the room. He shifts 
               his attention to Nicky, Larry and Marty at a primo table.

               They're having a grand time. Nicky pats Larry on the back of 
               the head. "Good work, kid."

               Larry turns and raises his drink to Shelly. Shelly stares 
               right through him. A declaration of war.

               INT. CASINO MIDWAY - NIGHT

               Bernie and Natalie wander around the midway. A middle-aged 
               WORKER at the ring toss booth gets her attention.

                                     RING TOSS WORKER
                         Over here, young lady! C'mon, give 
                         it a try. Eight for a dollar.

               Natalie drags Bernie over. She pays her money and the worker 
               hands her the rings. Natalie throws, and misses all eight.

               The man pats her on the shoulder.

                                     RING TOSS WORKER
                         Sorry there, sweetheart. Better luck 
                         next time. Wanna try again?

               Natalie is about to take him up on it, when she catches 
               Bernie's eye. His look suggests she's being played for a 
               sucker. She decides against it.

               They walk off down the midway. Bernie chuckles to himself.

                                     NATALIE
                         What?

                                     BERNIE
                         Nothing.

                                     NATALIE
                         What?

                                     BERNIE
                         Nothing. You're just an easy mark, 
                         is all.

                                     NATALIE
                         An easy mark?

                                     BERNIE
                         Yeah. Easy mark. You never heard 
                         that term?

               Natalie shakes her head.

                                     BERNIE
                         When we were kids, Shelly and me, we 
                         used to work Coney Island during the 
                         summer. When a guy would walk up and 
                         seemed eager to open his wallet, we 
                         would always mark him with chalk. 
                         We'd pat him on the back or arm with 
                         the chalk. Like, 'Hey buddy, good 
                         job!'
                              (pats Natalie)
                         Meanwhile, he had no clue the other 
                         guys saw him coming a mile away. 
                         Easy mark.

               Natalie looks down at her shoulder where the man patted her.

               She brushes it for effect. Bernie smiles. They take a seat 
               at the end of the midway.

               Natalie locks onto a little toe-headed BOY being dragged 
               around by his OLDER BROTHER and the brother's FRIEND. The 
               kid has a glazed look in his eyes.

               Natalie fixates on the boy with a haunted expression. Bernie 
               picks up on it.

                                     BERNIE
                         You OK?

                                     NATALIE
                         You notice last night, that tattoo 
                         on my butt?

                                     BERNIE
                              (are you kidding?!)
                         Little Joe.

                                     NATALIE
                         Yeah, two twos. Little Joe.

               Natalie hides her face behind her soda cup. Looks off in the 
               distance.

                                     NATALIE
                         I had a son. His name was Joe. I was 
                         his mother for a year.

                                     BERNIE
                         You know, you don't have to tell me 
                         this.

                                     NATALIE
                         I want to, Bernie. Better you know 
                         the worst of me up front. Later, 
                         when I'm already invested in you, 
                         it'll be too hard to come clean. 
                         After I tell you this, you'll 
                         probably... I mean, I'll understand.

               She tears her eyes away from Bernie. Bernie can't believe 
               what he's hearing. That she wants to be invested in him.

               What could be so bad?

                                     NATALIE
                         I gave my son up for adoption. I 
                         just wanted my life back. I was 
                         seventeen going on eighteen and I 
                         was selfish. My family, they didn't 
                         want to have nothing to do with me 
                         after that. So I hitched a ride out 
                         here. Figured I could make it as a 
                         showgirl. Ten years later...
                              (shrugs; starts to 
                              break up)
                         I like to think that if it happened 
                         when I was older -- with some guy I 
                         cared about -- maybe things would 
                         have been different. I think about 
                         my Little Joe. And, I do know he's 
                         better off. I'm convinced of that.

               She lowers her soda. Turns to Bernie. He studies her for a 
               lengthy beat, stoic features. She wipes away her tears. Oh 
               well, that's that. Bernie stands up. Looks around... focuses 
               on the arcade clock. It reads 1:40 a.m. He turns to her...

                                     BERNIE
                         So, you wanna go try your hand at 
                         the dime pitch? It's early still.

               Off Natalie's tear-filled features. She breaks into a laugh-
               cry...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Bernie and Natalie making love. Slow, tender. Natalie doesn't 
               make with the "Oh yeah, baby, you're doing great" 
               encouragement. Just some low key moans. Bernie doesn't come 
               too soon either. He outlasts Sinatra through several cuts.

               In contrast, we hear the hooker and her John howling away 
               through the walls. An escalating ostinato of "Oh Baby's."

               Until Natalie reaches behind her and raps her fist against 
               the wall. Big smile from both of them.

               EXT. LUCKY STAR MOTEL - DAY

               Bernie and Natalie returning from breakfast in Bernie's Buick. 
               Bernie can't find a parking spot. Natalie climbs out, heads 
               for the room.

               Natalie arrives at the room. She's about to stab the key in 
               the lock, when she realizes the door is ajar. She hesitates 
               for a moment, then pushes it open...

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               ...to find Mikey and Charlene waiting on them. Charlene is 
               puffing away on a Marlboro when Natalie enters. She 
               immediately stubs it out. Rises, heads for the bathroom.

                                     CHARLENE
                         I gotta go pee. I'm always peeing.

               She closes the door after her.

                                     NATALIE
                              (to Mikey)
                         How did you get in here?

                                     MIKEY
                         I told the desk clerk Bernie was my 
                         old man. He let us wait inside. That 
                         a problem?

                                     NATALIE
                         Bernie's looking for a parking space.

                                     MIKEY
                              (chuckles)
                         Shit. I musta taken the last one.

               Mikey steps up to Natalie. She hasn't moved from the doorway. 
               Her dislike for Mikey is evident.

                                     MIKEY
                         Tell me something, Natalie? Is he 
                         paying you?

                                     NATALIE
                         Excuse me?

                                     MIKEY
                         My old man, is he renting your ass? 
                         'Cause otherwise I just don't get 
                         it. A loser like my pops in the 
                         company of some primo T & A. It don't 
                         compute.

               Natalie doesn't dignify Mikey with an answer. She stares him 
               down unflinchingly. Mikey reaches out to Natalie's ear, 
               "pulls" out a $20 dollar chip.

                                     MIKEY
                         This enough to get me a taste? Family 
                         discount?

               He drops the chip down Natalie's cleavage. Natalie still 
               doesn't react. Mikey reaches up, starts caressing her face.

               She flinches. Right then, the door swings open. Bernie enters. 
               Mikey snaps his fingers and a rose appears in his hand. He 
               extends it to Natalie. She ignores the gesture, steps aside.

                                     BERNIE
                         Mikey...

                                     MIKEY
                         Hey, Bernie. I told you I was gonna 
                         stop by.

                                     BERNIE
                         Yeah... I figured you'd call ahead. 
                         We were out at breakfast.

               Charlene emerges from the bathroom. Natalie heads over. She 
               doesn't want to be around Mikey.

               She stops in front of Charlene, points to a sprinkling of 
               white powder on the side of her nose.

                                     NATALIE
                         You missed some.

               Charlene immediately swats the coke off. Natalie enters the 
               bathroom. Closes the door.

                                     MIKEY
                         You see, the thing is, Bernie, we're 
                         kinda strapped. I mean, Charly here's 
                         expecting like yesterday, and we 
                         don't have the dough to make with 
                         the right nutrition for her an' all. 
                         So, I was wondering if you would 
                         care to invest a little in your 
                         grandchild's future... his well being.

               Bernie scratches his head, thinks on it for a moment or two.

               Then heads over to the kitchenette cupboard. Pulls down a 
               coffee can. Extracts a thick wad of bills. Hands them over 
               to Mikey.

                                     BERNIE
                         There's about three grand there. 
                         That's all I got.

                                     CHARLENE
                         Bless you, Bernie.
                              (pats her belly)
                         You know, Michael, I  -- think we 
                         should name her Bernadette. After 
                         your father.

                                     MIKEY
                         You mean, Bernie. Trust me, it's a 
                         boy.

               Bernie seems quite moved by it all.

                                     CHARLENE
                              (to Bernie)
                         Wanna feel her?

                                     BERNIE
                         I don't think... I don't want anything 
                         to hap...

                                     CHARLENE
                         Ooh, I just felt her kick. C'mon, 
                         Bernie, gimme your hand...

               She places Bernie's hand over her stomach.

                                     CHARLENE
                         Feel that?

                                     BERNIE
                              (not sure)
                         I don't know... I think so...

               Mikey takes Charlene by the arm...

                                     MIKEY
                         We'll catch you later, Bernie. I 
                         think I'm gonna take Charly over to 
                         the hospital right now. Get her 
                         checked up real good.

               Charlene kisses Bernie on the cheek. He blushes.

                                     CHARLENE
                         Take care, Pop.

                                     BERNIE
                         Mikey...

               Mikey turns in the doorway, eyebrows raised. Yeah?

                                     BERNIE
                         You're not going to try anything 
                         stupid while you're in town?

               Mikey plays it dumb. Huh?

                                     BERNIE
                         You mess up and they'll cut you no 
                         slack. That's all I'm saying. You 
                         got a kid to think about.

               Mikey nods, backs out of the room. Charlene giggles. They 
               disappear into the parking lot. Natalie emerges from the 
               bathroom. She lights up a cigarette, just stares at him as 
               if to say: sucker. Bernie shrugs.

               INT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Shelly enters to find Larry seated behind his desk. Larry 
               immediately leaps to his feet, phony apologetic grin.

               Nicky and Marty are lounging on Shelly's sofa. Shelly's gaze 
               is drawn to a table in the middle of the room. There's 
               something on it, covered in a plastic sheet. He raises a 
               "what gives?" eyebrow.

                                     NICKY
                         Shelly, I hope you don't mind...

                                     SHELLY
                         What's going on, Nicky?

                                     NICKY
                         I'm sorry we didn't say nothing about 
                         this earlier... but the deal wasn't 
                         closed yet.

                                     MARTY
                         Don't worry, Shelly, you're gonna 
                         love it.

               Nicky gestures to Larry. Larry whisks the plastic sheet off 
               the table...

               ...to reveal an impressive SCALE MODEL of a redesigned SHANGRI-
               LA HOTEL AND CASINO.

               The model boasts huge snow-capped Himalayan peaks a la "Lost 
               Horizon," surrounding a completely overhauled hotel and 
               casino. A Matterhorn-like rollercoaster traverses the mountain 
               top. Gold and marbled pillars, terraces and floors promise 
               to raise the bar on Las Vegas opulence. We're looking at a 
               hundred million dollar investment easy.

                                     NICKY
                         The new Shangri-la Hotel and Casino. 
                         We break ground on her in six months.

               Off Shelly's startled expression --

                                     NICKY
                         I know what you're thinking? Where's 
                         she gonna go? You need space to 
                         expand, right? Well, that's been 
                         taken care of. We're now the proud 
                         owners of The Golden Frontier next 
                         door.

                                     LARRY
                              (gesturing to the 
                              model)
                         She's perfect. Three floors of gaming, 
                         IMAX theater, entertainment center, 
                         boutiques, restaurants, rollercoaster, 
                         you name it. She'll pay for herself 
                         in three years, and then it's easy 
                         money.

                                     NICKY
                         Isn't she great, Shell?

               Shelly slowly approaches the model like a condemned prisoner 
               mounting the scaffolding.

               We see his stoic features reflected in her sparkling swimming 
               pool.

                                     SHELLY
                         In "Lost Horizon," these people, 
                         their plane crashes in the Himalayas -- 
                         and they get rescued and taken to 
                         this Utopia in the mountains. Shangri-
                         la. It's beautiful. The place is 
                         completely isolated. Untouched by 
                         the outside world. There's no war, 
                         no greed, no bullshit... Time is 
                         slowed down. People, they don't age. 
                         It's... paradise. That's what Shangri-
                         la is. Paradise.

                                     LARRY
                         Yeah, we've all seen the movie. And 
                         your point is?

               Shelly whirls around, yells:

                                     SHELLY
                         You don't fuck with paradise! All'a 
                         ya!

                                     NICKY
                         Hey, Jesus, c'mon, Shelly. We're not 
                         trying to fuck with it. We're trying 
                         to make it better.

                                     SHELLY
                         How... how, Nicky, could it be any 
                         better? Right now it's perfect. It's 
                         the last of its kind. It's pure... 
                         and this.
                              (points to the model; 
                              weary)
                         ...this is just... it's a mockery. 
                         An insult. Trying to make something 
                         of it that it isn't.

                                     LARRY
                         What are you talking about? It's 
                         right outta the movie?

                                     SHELLY
                         Whose talking about a fuckin' movie? 
                         This ain't a fuckin' movie. This is 
                         my life. This is my house of worship. 
                         You people are shittin' on all that's 
                         sacred to me.

               A tense silence ensues. Nicky, Larry and Marty exchange looks.

                                     SHELLY
                              (tired laugh)
                         I got just one question? Where you 
                         gonna be when they decide to change 
                         it back? When the people, they come 
                         looking for the real Vegas, from 
                         before all this Epcott Center 
                         bullshit. Who's gonna it give it to 
                         them? You guys? I don't think so. 
                         You know who? The same fucks who 
                         started this shit in the first place. 
                         It's all gonna come full circle and 
                         bite you in the ass. Mark my words.

               Shelly falls silent. Massages his forehead. Shit, that wasn't 
               the way to handle it.

               Nicky gets up from the sofa, walks over to Shelly, places a 
               hand on his shoulder. Shelly flinches, but doesn't pull away.

                                     NICKY
                         You make some good points, Shelly. 
                         Maybe it'll swing back the other 
                         way, who knows? But the smart money 
                         suggests we roll the dice. I'm not 
                         gonna bullshit you; naturally there's 
                         gonna be a lot of restructuring in 
                         the months to come, but I want you 
                         to know, you'll always have a place 
                         with us.

                                     SHELLY
                         Where's that? Behind the bar?

                                     MARTY
                              (laughs)
                         Behind the bar, that's a good one.

                                     NICKY
                         I think you should take some time 
                         and think things through. All this, 
                         it's a lot to digest, y'know.

                                     MARTY
                         Speaking of things to digest, I'm 
                         starving. How's that buffet they got 
                         in the Valley of the Blue Moon? You 
                         recommend their prime rib, Shell?

               Shelly stares right through Marty. Choke and die on it, 
               motherfucker.

                                     SHELLY
                         It's food.

                                     NICKY
                         Hey, my arteries can use a workout. 
                         Lead us to the trough, Shell.

               Shelly nods at Nicky, then shifts his gaze to Larry. Larry's 
               all smiles. He steps forward to join them, his hand dropping 
               down and caressing the surface of Shelly's desk behind him.

               A subtle gesture not lost on Shelly. Shelly mentally unloads 
               a full chamber into Larry's chest. Returns the smile.

               INT. CASINO - CRAPS TABLES - NIGHT

               As Shelly and the group pass a hot craps table, Nicky is 
               drawn to it.

                                     NICKY
                         Wait up a second...

                                     MARTY
                         I thought we were gonna eat?

               Only now do we see Bernie has arrived to cool the table of 
               its hot shooter -- A LOUD, pudgy, overdressed SUBURBANITE.

               Shelly eyes Bernie.

                                     SHELLY
                         Maybe we wanna play over there. Less 
                         crowded.

                                     NICKY
                         Nah, let's play here. This is my 
                         lucky table. I always play here.
                              (to the others)
                         Go on ahead. I know where to find 
                         you guys.

               Shelly signals Bernie to back off. Bernie steps back.

               Shelly, Larry and Marty head for the restaurant. Nicky quickly 
               slaps down some green.

               The stickman slides the dice over to the suburbanite who is 
               shooting. He scuttles the dice. They bounce up over the rail 
               and spike Nicky on the forehead before dropping back on the 
               felt. The players chuckle.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Out! Seven, line away seven...

               Nicky rubs his forehead, glares at the suburbanite. He fires 
               back.

                                     SUBURBANITE
                         C"mon, pops! What the hell? I coulda 
                         paid my mortgage with the money I 
                         just lost.

               Nicky says nothing. The table is quickly cleared by the 
               dealers. The stickman skips the next shooter and feeds the 
               dice to Nicky.

                                     SHOOTER
                         Hey? I'm supposed to be next...

                                     NICKY
                         File a grievance, shithead.

               Suburbanite is still fuming over his loss. Nicky places a 
               couple hundred on the passline.

                                     STICKMAN
                         We're coming out. Crap Eleven, any 
                         seven.

               Nicky throws in some chips to the center.

                                     NICKY
                         Hundred dollar big red.

               Suburbanite watches as Nicky runs through a lengthy pre-shot 
               routine. Lots of hand jive and cuff shooting.

                                     SUBURBANITE
                         Hurry it up, gramps. Your soup's 
                         getting cold.

               Nicky throws.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Crap, Ace Deuce. Line down.

               The croupiers takes down the pass line.

                                     SUBURBANITE
                         Hey, Busketti, maybe you should try 
                         shuffleboard.

               Nicky is fed the dice again. Same routine. Nicky just fires 
               an incendiary look back at the suburbanite.

                                     SUBURBANITE
                         Uncle Palsy? Shake'em this direction.

               Nicky throws.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Four, hard four. The point is four.

               The players make their bets.

                                     SUBURBANITE
                         Good now throw it before you fucking 
                         keel over and die, old man.

               Nicky slowly starts his routine defiantly.

                                     SUBURBANITE
                         Happy birthday to me. Happy Birthday 
                         to me... Jesus, fuck, I'm another 
                         year older already.

               Nicky throws.

                                     STICKMAN
                         OUT! Seven! Line away.

               Nicky claps his hands dealer style -- for effect -- and with 
               a gentlemanly smile steps back from the table. Nicky's chips 
               are quickly swept up by the croupier.

                                     SUBURBANITE
                         Don't take it so hard, pops. Everybody 
                         craps out.

               Nicky locks eyes with the suburbanite. Then flashes a smile 
               that suggests he's going to brush it off. He turns away from 
               the table...

                                     SUBURBANITE
                         Now go change your fucking Depends.

               Nicky makes like it's all in good jest. Yeah, that's real 
               cute. He heads around the table to the suburbanite, holds 
               out his hand as if to say: Hey, no hard feelings. The 
               suburbanite shrugs. What the fuck? I was just playing with 
               you, pops. He reaches for Nicky's hand... when Nicky suddenly 
               headbutts him. Before anyone can react, Nicky starts laying 
               into the suburbanite. The man goes down and.

               Nicky continues pummeling him...

                                     NICKY
                         Who's laughing now, huh? ya fuckin! 
                         prick! C'mon, crack wise again... Ya 
                         fuckin' smooth as a Ken doll, no-
                         dick, suburbanite scum. How's that 
                         for a game?!

               Shelly alerted to the fracas, rushes back to the table. He 
               takes immediate control of the situation. Snaps his fingers 
               at security. The suburbanite is whisked away with a pocketful 
               of comps and a bruised ego. Shelly takes Nicky aside, attempts 
               to calm him. Nicky keeps railing at Shelly:

                                     NICKY
                         That ain't right, Shelly! Guy fucks 
                         up my game like that. Who the fuck 
                         does he think he is?

                                     SHELLY
                         You're right. He's just a piece of 
                         shit. Forget about him.

                                     NICKY
                         I thought this joint had more class. 
                         Used to be, we wouldn't even let 
                         bums like that in...

               Nicky catches himself. He looks at Shelly for a beat.

               There's an unspoken understanding between them. "The good 
               old days." We see Bernie in the b.g., looking more than a 
               bit shocked.

               INT. THE MAKAWAO BAR AND GRILL - NIGHT

               Bernie seated with Natalie.

                                     BERNIE
                         This town... You know, Natalie, all 
                         I want to do is go some place where 
                         I can tell day from night. Where 
                         they got clocks on the wall. I can't 
                         breathe around here no more. Four 
                         days and I'm gone. I'm not even sure 
                         I can hold out that long.

                                     NATALIE
                              (a beat)
                         So where does that leave us?

                                     BERNIE
                         A week ago, I didn't remember what 
                         it was like to have a woman's hands 
                         on me. I'm still pinching myself, 
                         expecting to wake-up from...
                              (just blurts it out)
                         Come with me, Natalie. I want you to 
                         come with me.

                                     NATALIE
                         God, Bernie, that's...

                                     BERNIE
                         I'm sorry. I didn't mean to spring 
                         that on you.

                                     NATALIE
                         Bernie... I want to be with you. I 
                         do. But I don't know if I can leave 
                         with you.

               Bernie's look: Why?

                                     NATALIE
                         I was working on a compatibility 
                         chart for the two of us. And it looks 
                         good, really, it does.

                                     BERNIE
                         So, what's the problem?

                                     NATALIE
                         That's with us here. In Vegas.

               Bernie's expression: Oh.

                                     NATALIE
                         Maybe I was being presumptuous, 'cause 
                         I knew you were leaving... and I 
                         tried working it in different ways... 
                         It wasn't good, Bernie. I got scared. 
                         But that's just for now, for the 
                         immediate future. Once the planets 
                         realign, maybe a year from now...

                                     BERNIE
                         Natalie... I can't... Not another 
                         year. Not another week.

               A somber mood falls on the table. Bernie reaches for Natalie's 
               hand. Instead, he knocks the salt over. It spills out in 
               front of them.

                                     BERNIE
                         I think... we probably shouldn't see 
                         each other anymore.

                                     NATALIE
                         Why, Bernie? We only got a couple 
                         days left together. Why not make the 
                         most of them?

                                     BERNIE
                              (a long beat)
                         Because if I spend one more night in 
                         your arms, I'm not going anywhere.

                                     NATALIE
                         And that's so bad?

               Bernie just stares at her, shrouded in sadness. Natalie stubs 
               out her cigarette, rises.

                                     NATALIE
                         Take care, Bernie.

               Bernie casts his eyes to the mound of spilled salt in front 
               of him. Nods. A few beats later he raises his head...

                                     BERNIE
                         Natalie, don't...

               Gone. A WAITRESS appears.

                                     WAITRESS (O.S.)
                         Get you another?

                                     BERNIE
                              (nods)
                         I think you better bring me the 
                         bottle. Please.

               INT. SHANGRI-LA HOTEL AND CASINO/BAR - NIGHT

               Once again, we see Bernie's feet limp across the casino floor. 
               He walks up to the bar, asks for a cup of coffee.

               Doris brings it over. Short on the cream again.

               He just sips it black. Gloom and doom features. Life sucks.

               His master's VOICE sounds over the intercom:

                                     VOICE (V.O.)
                         Chang, party of fifteen, your table 
                         is ready, Chang party of fifteen.

               Bernie looks to Doris. Sighs. Only three more days.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - CRAPS TABLES - NIGHT

               He heads for the crap tables, the sound of raucous CHEERING 
               becomes audible. A large crowd starting to gather.

               Bernie noodles his way to the front of the crowd. As soon as 
               he gets a look at the heavy hitter at the table, he tenses 
               up.

               Oh shit.

               It's MIKEY. With Charlene. Charlene is making one hell of a 
               racket. Playing up her extremely maternal state.

               Just then Natalie sidles up to Bernie with the Chivas Regal.

               Without thinking about it, he grabs the glass off the tray, 
               downs it in a single gulp.

                                     CHARLENE
                              (clutching her tummy)
                         Come on, Mikey. This is our future. 
                         Don't blow it.

               Mikey throws down a bet for the dealer.

                                     MIKEY
                         Put this on the line for the boys.

               The stickman thanks him as they place the bet. Mikey throws 
               down more money. We can see Mikey has bets all over the table.

                                     MIKEY
                         With shoes!

                                     STICKMAN
                         Dealer's got shoes. Hands high, the 
                         dice are out! The point is nine.

                                     CHARLENE
                         Come on all you's. Put a good thought 
                         in for our baby!

               As everyone dotes over Charlene, Mikey quickly swaps the 
               dice before anyone can see. He throws.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Six the hard way!

               Mikey is paid nine thousand by the croupier, as is Charlene.

               Bernie stands frozen. He doesn't bother trying to get any 
               closer to the table. He knows it'll do no good.

                                     CHARLENE
                         Oh my god, I just felt him kick! He 
                         knows. He knows you're all pulling 
                         for him. God bless you all.

               Natalie looks over at Charlene. Their eyes meet for a second. 
               It's as though Natalie knows it's a scam and Charlene's 
               acknowledging it.

               Mikey throws again.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Six the hard way! Look out, we got a 
                         shooter!

               Another nine grand. Mikey's rail is nearly full. Charlene 
               hops around awkwardly causing more distraction.

               Bernie is really sweating it out now. Then Shelly arrives.

               Larry is hot on his tail.

                                     SHELLY
                         How much?

                                     BERNIE
                         Eighteen thousand since I stepped 
                         up. I'm sorry, Shelly, I guess I've 
                         been hit and miss lately.

               Shelly's expression tells us he isn't so sure. Something 
               definitely isn't kosher.

               As Charlene chatters on, Mikey switches the dice back.

               Shelly makes him.

                                     SHELLY
                              (sotto)
                         Fucking amateurs...

               Mikey throws...

                                     STICKMAN
                         Seven out! Line away.

               The players and crowd, though disappointed, applaud Mikey's 
               achievement.

                                     MIKEY
                              (bowing)
                         I thank you. My wife thanks you. My 
                         unborn child thanks you.

               Mikey moves his rail of chips to the felt.

                                     MIKEY
                         Color me up will ya?

               Larry notices Shelly slipping on a pair of leather gloves.

                                     LARRY
                         You've gotta be kidding me.
                              (off Shelly's steely 
                              glare)
                         That's not how I propose we handle 
                         it. We'll turn the matter over to 
                         the authorities. They'll be 
                         blacklisted, their credit ruined...

                                     SHELLY
                              (gets in Larry's face)
                         And then we'll give 'em both a 
                         lollipop for the ride home. Come 
                         watch and learn, Harvard. A little 
                         lesson on how to protect your 
                         investment -- the old school way.

               Shelly walks over to Mikey and Charlene, Larry lingering 
               behind him.

                                     SHELLY
                         Hey, that was some run you had back 
                         there.

                                     MIKEY
                         Uh, thanks. Just lucky I guess.

               Mikey steals a tense glance at Charlene. She starts to fidget 
               nervously.

                                     SHELLY
                         Why don't we go do this in my office? 
                         I don't like to hand out all this 
                         amount of cash on the floor.

               Security (Tony and Lou) corrals the couple. Leads them away.

               Bernie watches as they pass by. Mikey looks into Bernie's 
               eyes. They both know he's been made. Natalie doesn't say 
               anything, just looks at Bernie.

               INT. CASINO RECEIVING AREA - NIGHT

               Slot machines everywhere -- some on the way out, some on the 
               way in. Crates of casino supplies.

               Bernie rushes in with Natalie behind him. Heading for an 
               aural beacon of BLOWS landing on flesh... GRUNTING, 
               PLEADING...

               ...arriving to find Tony and Lou kicking the shit out of 
               Mikey on the floor. Charlene lies clutching her belly a few 
               feet away. Shelly swings a baseball bat, warming up for some 
               blood sport. Larry watches from the sidelines -- at once 
               appalled and enthralled.

                                     CHARLENE
                         Oh my God... I can feel the 
                         contractions coming on...

               Bernie rushes over to Shelly...

                                     BERNIE
                         Shelly, stop them! Don't do this!

                                     SHELLY
                         Get lost, Bernie, this got nothing 
                         to do with you.

                                     BERNIE
                         It's got everything to do with me. 
                         He's my son.

               Everyone stops dead. Freeze frame. Shelly gets a weird look 
               in his eye. A fuse has just been lit...

                                     SHELLY
                         What did you say?

                                     BERNIE
                         I said, he's my --

                                     SHELLY
                         Who? This little prick?

               Shelly smashes Mikey across the shoulder with the bat.

               AARRRGGGGHHH!!! Shelly raises the bat to cream Mikey again... 
               Bernie grabs Shelly's arm. Shelly shoves him back.

               Raises the bat again...

                                     MIKEY
                         Pop, help me...

                                     BERNIE
                         Shelly, don't you fucking do it!

               Shelly freezes. He lowers the bat, throws it aside. Grabs 
               Bernie by his collar...

                                     SHELLY
                         Were you in on this? Jesus, you better 
                         come clean with me.

                                     BERNIE
                         NO! God, no! I didn't know nothing 
                         about it.

               Shelly releases Bernie. There's a strange look in Shelly's 
               eye. We see the wheels turning...

                                     SHELLY
                         How much you think their lives are 
                         worth, Bernie? Myself, I don't think 
                         they're worth piss. But, hey, it 
                         ain't my kid...

               Bernie sees where Shelly's going with this. We can almost 
               hear the cell door slamming in his head.

                                     SHELLY
                         Let me see: they were up almost a 
                         hundred and fifty grand. That's 150 
                         G's someone's gonna have to account 
                         for. What do you say, Bernie, seventy-
                         five grand a piece?

               Bernie glances over at Natalie. She has tears in her eyes.

               He looks to Shelly pleadingly. Please don't do this...

                                     SHELLY
                         Hey, I know you don't have that kind 
                         of cash. But, since you're a friend 
                         of the house, I'm willing to front 
                         you.

                                     BERNIE
                         Shelly, they didn't get away with 
                         the money... You didn't lose 
                         anything...

               Shelly glances over at Lou, nods. Lou kicks Mikey in the 
               face. His nose snaps like a twig.

                                     BERNIE
                         Oh Jesus... Yes! All right. It's on 
                         me. 150 G's.

               Charlene clutches her belly, moans...

                                     CHARLENE
                         Oh god, oh god... you gotta get me 
                         to the hospital... contractions...

                                     BERNIE
                         Shelly, please help her. That's my 
                         grandson...

                                     SHELLY
                         Hey, why don't we all break out the 
                         champagne? Lootz is about to become 
                         a granddaddy.
                              (walks over to her)
                         How you doin' there, sweetheart? 
                         Must hurt like crap, huh?

                                     CHARLENE
                              (nods)
                         Hurts so bad...

                                     SHELLY
                         Yeah?

               Suddenly Shelly kicks Charlene in the belly! WHAM! She 
               screeches out.

                                     NATALIE
                         Oh God...

                                     BERNIE
                         Jesus NOOOOO!!!

               Even Shelly's goons can't believe what they've just witnessed. 
               Larry is aghast. Bernie rushes Shelly, starts raining blows 
               on him. Shelly swats him off. He drops down next to the 
               squirming girl, rips her sweater and blouse up over her 
               stomach...

               ...to reveal a mound of fake padding. He tears the padding 
               away from her, throws it at Bernie.

                                     SHELLY
                         Here! It's a fuckin' boy. Anyone got 
                         a cigar?

               The muscle start laughing it up. Relief. Larry emits a nervous 
               giggle. Natalie's jaw hits the floor. Bernie takes a step 
               back. He's about to go into serious shock. Charlene curls 
               over, sobbing.

                                     SHELLY
                              (to Bernie)
                         You sure you still want to be good 
                         for it? Because if you want to change 
                         your mind, I don't blame you.

               Bernie looks over at Mikey. He stares up at his father, 
               trembling.

                                     MIKEY
                         I'll make it up to you, Pop, I 
                         swear...

               Bernie holds his son's gaze for a beat. He's almost tempted 
               to... He just shrugs and nods at Shelly.

                                     BERNIE
                         It's on me.

                                     SHELLY
                              (shakes his head)
                         That's the worst fucking call you 
                         ever made in your life.

               ON NATALIE at that moment. We can tell she agrees with 
               Shelly... but thinks all the more of Bernie for it. That 
               might even be love in her eyes.

               Shelly snatches his baseball bat up off the floor. Walks 
               over to Mikey, and brings it down full force, pulverizing 
               Mikey's left kneecap. Oh man, the scream...

                                     BERNIE
                         What are you doing?! I thought we 
                         had --

                                     SHELLY
                         150 G's buys their lives. This is 
                         just a little slap on the wrist to 
                         remember me by.

               Natalie turns her head. She's about to throw up. Larry 
               watches, unflinchingly. Charlene is making with some serious 
               pleading now.

                                     CHARLENE
                         Oh god... it wasn't my idea.

               Shelly steps up to Charlene, tapping the base of the bat in 
               the palm of his hand. He smiles reassuringly at her.

                                     SHELLY
                         You know, motherhood is a beautiful 
                         thing. This... you made a mockery 
                         out of it. Maybe you'll get to 
                         experience it for real one day.

                                     CHARLENE
                              (nods, sobbing)
                         I want... to be a mother... please 
                         don't hurt me...

                                     SHELLY
                         I'm not going to hurt you.

               Shelly turns his back on her. Charlene starts sobbing relief. 
               They're not going to hurt her. It's going to be all right. 
               Wrong. Shelly throws the bat to Lou. The heavy steps up to 
               the plate (as we RACK FOCUS to Shelly walking away) -- 
               CRUNCH!!! followed by the girl's SHRIEKS. Natalie buries her 
               head in Bernie's shoulder.

                                     SHELLY
                              (to Tony and Lou)
                         Get 'em outta here. You ever see 
                         them in this joint again, kill 'em.

                                     SHELLY
                              (to Bernie and Natalie)
                         You two, you're still on shift.

               Shelly catches Larry's eye: I hope you were taking notes.

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Bernie's seated on the edge of his bed, drowning his sorrows 
               with a bottle of gin. Moonlight paints him in jail bars of 
               shadow. Natalie lingers in the b.g.

                                     BERNIE
                         I did this to myself. I planted the 
                         seed. When Angela took off with Mikey, 
                         I didn't... I never made an effort 
                         to get back in his life. I figured, 
                         the kid don't need a loser for a 
                         father. Now it's all come full circle. 
                         I give him the money, I open the 
                         door to all this... I musta had it 
                         coming. Payback.

               Natalie's hand lowers the needle onto the Sinatra record.

               "Nice 'n' Easy" starts up.

               She walks over to Bernie, takes the bottle away. Helps him 
               to his feet.

               He gives himself over to her reassuring embrace. Natalie 
               raises Bernie's face to her's.

                                     NATALIE
                         Bernie, it's a big world out there. 
                         If you just took off -- if we took 
                         off.

               Bernie shakes his head. It's too late for that now.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - LATER - NIGHT

               Natalie staring up at the ceiling, Bernie nuzzled against 
               her. Her features appear softer than ever. Luminous in the 
               moonlight. Realization moist in her eyes.

                                     NATALIE
                         You awake, Bernie?

               He grunts something inaudible.

                                     NATALIE
                         I -- think I love you.

               Bernie tenses up. Huh?

                                     NATALIE
                         No, I don't think. I'm pretty certain 
                         of it.

               Bernie raises his head, not quite sure he heard her right.

               Natalie sits up, hugs her knees. Bernie finds himself staring 
               at her back.

                                     NATALIE
                         You blind-sided me, Bernie Lootz. I 
                         never saw this coming. You shouldn't 
                         do that to a girl.

               Bernie reaches out, caresses her back. She emits a shiver...

                                     NATALIE
                         There's still things you don't know... 
                         should know... I don't want to ruin 
                         it...

               Bernie pulls Natalie back toward him.

                                     BERNIE
                         It won't make any difference, Natalie. 
                         Whatever you come clean about, I'm 
                         not gonna feel any different about 
                         you. I'd say the words, but with my 
                         luck...

                                     NATALIE
                         Say 'em anyway. To hell with rotten 
                         luck. That's overs.

                                     BERNIE
                              (a beat)
                         I love you, Natalie.

               Natalie smothers her lips against Bernie's. He enshrouds her 
               in his arms. Fade out...

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Fade into SOFT FOCUS. Slowing taking form... A CAT'S FACE 
               seen in extreme close-up.

               WIDER -- to reveal the cat resting on Bernie's chest. She 
               MEOWS as he stirs awake. He's stunned to see her there.

                                     BERNIE
                         Trixie?

               The cat jumps off his chest and slinks over to her empty 
               food bowl. Meows again. Bernie breaks into a wide smile.

                                     BERNIE
                         Trix. You came back.

               Bernie shields his eyes from the bright sunlight streaming 
               in through the blinds. Huh? This is a first for him. He's 
               never gotten direct sunlight in his room before. What's the 
               deal? Did the world just turn on its axis?

               He glances over his shoulder... No Natalie. Just her 
               impression in the sheets. And a note on her pillow. For a 
               moment his heart stops. He conjures up the worst. Grabs up 
               the note, unfolds it.

               We see a lipstick kiss and the words: HAVE A SPECTACULAR 
               DAY!

               Bernie lets out a joyful whoop! Leaps out of bed...

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

               CLOSE-UP: Trixie eating some tuna out of her bowl. We hear 
               the record player needle drop on "Luck Be A Lady." Cut to:

               Bernie's feet gliding around the room... PAN UP to Bernie 
               dancing with himself. He's positively aglow. He snatches up 
               a salt shaker and sings along with Sinatra. It's true -- 
               love makes the world go around. It obviously also gives life 
               to dead plants, as evidenced by the small bulb that has sprung 
               up overnight above his radiator. But we won't dwell on that.

               INT. SHANGRI-LA HOTEL AND CASINO - DAY

               Bernie struts into the casino a changed man (still to the 
               tune of "Luck Be a Lady"). Even his limp seems less pronounced 
               as he greets fellow workers as they pass.

               He catches a glimpse of himself in a wall mirror. Maybe for 
               the first time, he likes what he sees. In the reflection he 
               notices Natalie smiling at him. He meets her eyes. She averts 
               them quickly, keeps walking.

               INT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT

               Shelly watches Bernie from the video monitor. He appears 
               less than delighted over Bernie's sunny disposition. He picks 
               up the phone, dials.

                                     SHELLY
                              (into phone)
                         Yeah, it's me. Get Bernie over to 
                         crap table six.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

               Per usual, Bernie walks up to the bar, asks for a cup of 
               coffee. Doris slides it over.

                                     BERNIE
                              (looking around)
                         Got any cre --

               Before he can answer, Doris hands him a container of cream.

               A full container. Taken aback, he starts pouring it into his 
               cup, when he hears a VOICE over the intercom:

                                     VOICE (V.O.)
                         Lovett, party of six, your table is 
                         ready, Lovett, party of six.

               Bernie looks to Doris.

                                     BERNIE
                         Duty calls.

               INT. CASINO - MONTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

               A -- Bernie arrives at a hundred dollar blackjack table just 
               in time for the dealer to bust out. The crowd goes crazy!

               B -- Bernie takes a break by leaning up against the side of 
               a slot machine. Suddenly, the woman playing it hits a jackpot.

               C -- Everywhere he seems to go, people continue to win.

               D -- Bernie, despite the spooky irony, can't help but smile 
               as mountains of chips pile up on the tables. Shelly appears 
               behind him. Not a happy camper. He gestures Bernie to follow 
               him.

               INT. CASINO SLOTS AREA - NIGHT

               They head over to a section of slots. As they pass one of 
               those huge million dollar slots, the FLOOR MANAGER cuts in 
               front of them.

                                     FLOOR MANAGER
                         Hey, Shelly, check it out. The new 
                         Mega-Million. I call her Marnie, 
                         'cause she's one frigid broad. Sure, 
                         once in a while she'll flash you a 
                         bit of tit, but your chances of 
                         hitting a home run -- one in twenty 
                         million. Here, give her a shot...

               He hands Shelly a cup of quarters, takes off. Shelly looks 
               to Bernie. He's trying to keep a lid on his anger.

                                     SHELLY
                              (feeding Marnie 
                              quarters)
                         You wanna tell me what's going on 
                         out there?

                                     BERNIE
                         I don't know...

               Shelly pulls the lever.

                                     SHELLY
                         What do you mean...

               Marnie immediately spits out a small jackpot.

                                     SHELLY
                              (reacts with surprise)
                         What do you mean, you don't know? 
                         We're down almost a mil out there. 
                         Doesn't seem strange to you?

                                     BERNIE
                              (shrugs)
                         Guess I'm having an off day.

                                     SHELLY
                         You don't have off days, Lootz. You're 
                         shitty luck incarnate. What's wrong? 
                         You coming down with something? You've 
                         got this look about you...

               Shelly starts feeding Marnie again.

                                     BERNIE
                         Nothing's wrong. Fact is, I've never 
                         felt better.

                                     SHELLY
                         What's that supposed to mean?

                                     BERNIE
                         She loves me, Shelly. She told me 
                         last night. Natalie.

               On the mention of Natalie's name, we hear a shrieking SIREN, 
               followed by a deafening toll of slot bells. Shelly's just 
               landed the million dollar jackpot. Shelly stares at the slot 
               in surprise -- then looks over at Bernie. Realization hits 
               hard. Fuck! The floor manager staggers over. His expression 
               is priceless.

                                     FLOOR MANAGER
                         Sweet Jesus... you popped her 
                         cherries.

               SEVERAL CASINO WORKERS have gathered to witness the 
               deflowering of Marnie. They gaze reverently upon her, as if 
               witnessing the "Close Encounters" mothership for the first 
               time. Shelly drags Bernie out of earshot.

                                     SHELLY
                         Natalie? She told you, she loves 
                         you?

               Bernie nods, a huge grin wrenching his cheeks apart. He's 
               about to go helium on us.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

               Natalie's serving drinks to a table of high rollers, when 
               Tony and Lou appear behind her...

               INT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               The door to Shelly's office slams behind Natalie. Shelly 
               glares at her from behind his desk. We see him thumbing his 
               steel abacus. The beads drifting toward the center. Natalie 
               shakily lights up a cigarette.

                                     SHELLY
                         Put that fucking thing out!

               Natalie, startled, drops her cigarettes. She kneels to gather 
               them up.

                                     NATALIE
                         Sorry.

                                     SHELLY
                         You should be. You've gone and fucked 
                         it up big time. I paid you to be his 
                         cooze companion, not his fucking 
                         true love. But, no, you had to go 
                         and get all profound on the poor 
                         schmuck.
                              (mimics female voice)
                         "I love you, Bernie." You know what 
                         you've gone and done, sweetheart? 
                         Those four little words of endearment 
                         have already cost this casino a 
                         million and counting today.

                                     NATALIE
                         I don't understand...

                                     SHELLY
                              (jumps to his feet)
                         Lady luck. You never heard'a lady 
                         luck?! That's what's goin' on out 
                         there. Lootz is Kryptonite on a stick. 
                         He should have 'em throwing ice cubes 
                         out there, but instead I got a fuckin' 
                         meltdown on my hands.

               Shelly walks around his desk to Natalie.

                                     SHELLY
                         OK, here's what's gonna happen. You're 
                         outta his life by the time he gets 
                         home. Don't even tell him to his 
                         face, just leave a note. I'll make 
                         some calls, situate you at another 
                         joint.

                                     NATALIE
                         I can't do that.

                                     SHELLY
                              (right in her face)
                         Excuse me?

                                     NATALIE
                         It wasn't an act. I meant it. I love 
                         him.

                                     SHELLY
                              (close to losing it)
                         What's there to fuckin' love? He's a 
                         loser. Always has been, always will 
                         be.

                                     NATALIE
                         I thought you were his friend...

                                     SHELLY
                         And I thought you were a smart cookie 
                         when I picked you out. You do not 
                         want to fuck me over, darlin'. I'll 
                         see to it that your next John's a 
                         rattlesnake out in the desert. Now 
                         get the fuck outta here.

               Natalie rushes from the office in tears. Shelly closes his 
               eyes for a moment -- gotta keep it together.

               INT. SHANGRI-LA CASINO - NIGHT

               Bernie approaches some cocktail waitresses about to go off 
               duty.

                                     BERNIE
                         Hi. Any of you seen Natalie around? 
                         I'm supposed to give her a ride home.

                                     COCKTAIL WAITRESS #1
                         I think she left already. She wasn't 
                         feelin' too good. We been covering 
                         for her.

               Off Bernie's expression: Oh...

               EXT. LUCKY STAR MOTEL - NIGHT

               Bernie's Buick pulls into the lot. He parks, heads for his 
               room.

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Bernie enters. Flips on the light. No Natalie.

                                     BERNIE
                              (calls to the bathroom)
                         Natalie? You in there?

               No answer. He heads over. Finds it empty. Concern spreads 
               across his features. He glances around the room. Notices the 
               closet wide open. Natalie's clothes missing.

                                     BERNIE
                              (sotto)
                         Natalie.

               That's when he catches sight of the note taped to the dresser 
               mirror. He rushes over, rips it off.

               I'M SORRY BERNIE. I GUESS IT JUST WASN'T IN THE CARDS FOR 
               US. TAKE CARE, NATALIE.

               Bernie slumps to the floor in disbelief. Starts to tremble.

               Then rocks back and forth, wracked by stifled sobs. Christ, 
               make it stop hurting...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - LATER

               Bernie seated at the foot of the bed, drinking bourbon from 
               a solitary glass. He's almost gone through an entire bottle.

               He glances down, notices a pair of Natalie's stockings 
               sticking out from under the bed. He brings them up to his 
               face. Breathes her in, only to exhale a sorry breath.

               INT. SHANGRI-LA CASINO - BAR - NIGHT

               Bernie stops at the bar for a cup of coffee. Doris starts to 
               pour the cream... whoops... empty. Bernie shrugs. Par for 
               the course. Time to go to work.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

               We see Bernie back in top form. Forget Mr. Cool, he's turned 
               into Mr. Freeze with a vengeance. The high rollers are facing 
               a nuclear winter on the floor thanks to Bernie.

               SERIES

               A -- A man with a fresh bankroll sits at a card table full 
               of hubris. Bernie pulls up a chair next to him.

               B -- We see a crowd of players hovering over a busy craps 
               table. The cheerful congregation turns sour as the dice are 
               flung. Players groan as they jettison the table, leaving 
               just Bernie...

               C -- We see a dealer pull a six card twenty one as players 
               sit with twelves and thirteens. They sit stunned as their 
               money is swept away. The same man with the hefty bankroll 
               unclips the last of his green. He throws it over to the dealer 
               to change in.

               D -- Larry, roaming the floor, is visibly disturbed by 
               Bernie's cooling ability. It's something he can't quantify 
               and it unsettles him. He glances up toward Shelly's 
               observation window, knows the man is gloating.

               Good call. From behind the glass, Shelly lights up a stogey. 
               Hint of a smile. You go, Bernie.

               INT. PARADISE LOUNGE - NIGHT

               Johnny Cappella rocks the house. PAN ACROSS to Shelly and 
               Bernie seated in Shelly's booth. Shelly is in a jovial mood, 
               while Bernie is a portrait of misery.

                                     BERNIE
                         I want you to tell me the truth, 
                         Shelly. Did you say something to 
                         Natalie? Did you muscle her --

                                     SHELLY
                         Jesus, Bernie, is that what you think 
                         of me? That I would fuck with your 
                         happiness? That hurts.

               Bernie shrugs an apology, shifts his gaze to Johnny Cappella.

                                     BERNIE
                         This guy's all flash. No soul. I 
                         miss Buddy. Place isn't the same 
                         without him.

                                     SHELLY
                         Buddy was tired. I gave him an easy 
                         out. It coulda been a lot worse...

                                     BERNIE
                              (confused)
                         You gave him an easy out? What are 
                         you talkin' about? I thought he...

               Shelly looks almost... tortured. Something he needs to get 
               off his chest.

                                     SHELLY
                         He woulda never taken the buy-out 
                         offer. Buddy woulda stuck to his 
                         guns, no matter what. And they woulda 
                         ended up hurting him. I couldn't let 
                         that happen.

                                     BERNIE
                         Jesus... you... How can you sit here 
                         and justify it? Like you were Dr. 
                         Kevorkian or something?

                                     SHELLY
                         Listen to me, you dumb fuck -- I 
                         loved that sonofabitch. But his time 
                         was up. What I was supposed to do, 
                         leave him to those corporate wolves? 
                         What I did, it was the humanitarian 
                         thing. That I have no doubt about. 
                         Afterwards, I held him in my arms 
                         and I cried like a fucking baby. 
                         What? You got this look -- what's 
                         this fucking look?

               Off Bernie's shocked expression --

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Bernie sits watching TV, a bottle of Ten High next to him on 
               the bed. Same religious channel. This time it's a mass baptism 
               taking place on some river bank. He's about to doze off, 
               when he hears a light rapping on the door. He cocks his head, 
               not sure if it's the booze talking.

               Bernie throws open the door --

               Natalie standing there. A lonely angel framed in the doorway. 
               Suitcase at her feet. 24 carat tears glistening in the dark.

               They just stare at each other for an extended beat. Then 
               Natalie stumbles into Bernie's arms. Clingwraps herself to 
               him. Bernie squeezes his eyes closed. Holds on for dear life. 
               It's a different kind of pain now; one that hurts so good.

               ANGLE ON NATALIE

               from over Bernie's shoulder. There's a bittersweet look about 
               her. Nothing good can come of this. But that's tomorrow. A 
               long ways off.

               INT. BERNIE'S BEDROOM - LATER

               Bernie and Natalie lie in each other's arms. Bernie seems at 
               ease. Natalie eyeballs the ceiling, smoke wisping up from a 
               cigarette.

                                     NATALIE
                         Bernie? You awake?

                                     BERNIE
                         Yeah.

                                     NATALIE
                         Let's just take off.

               Bernie looks over at her.

                                     NATALIE
                         I mean it. Let's just pack up and 
                         go. Tonight.

                                     BERNIE
                              (closes his eyes)
                         I can't do that. I've got an 
                         obligation to Shelly. There's no --

                                     NATALIE
                         Fuck Shelly. He doesn't give a shit 
                         about you. Let's just climb into 
                         your car and get the hell out of 
                         here.

               Bernie cuts her off.

                                     BERNIE
                         I can't do that, Natalie. They'd 
                         come after me. And because you were 
                         with me... I wouldn't want that on 
                         me.

               Natalie finishes her cigarette. Well, she's made her bed.

               Bernie starts nuzzling her. She turns away.

                                     NATALIE
                         Just hold me.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - DAY

               Shelly looking on as a high roller cleans up at craps. With 
               Bernie standing right there next to the guy.

               Which only seems to make it worse, as Bernie's presence spurs 
               the player on to an even bigger win.

               Bernie has that goofy "my heart is full" look about him.

               Which can mean only one thing in Shelly's book. The man looks 
               about ready to split an atom. We see Larry hovering nearby 
               with a smug grin. Off of Shelly's enraged expression...

               EXT. LUCKY STAR MOTEL - DAY

               Lou's black Oldsmobile pulls into the parking lot. Shelly 
               and the boys climb out, head for...

               EXT. THE MOTEL COURTYARD - DAY

               Natalie's sunning herself at the pool. The only other people 
               around are a middle-aged couple and a young boy.

               Shelly (slipping on his leather gloves), followed by Lou and 
               Tony, strides purposefully up to Natalie -- no hellos, nothing -- 
               just grabs her by the hair...

                                     NATALIE
                         Hey! Ouch! What are you...?

               He drags Natalie over to Bernie's room, kicks the door open, 
               shoves Natalie inside...

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Shelly throws Natalie onto the bed. Lou closes the door and 
               draws the blinds.

                                     NATALIE
                         You got no fucking right...!

                                     SHELLY
                         What did I tell you?! What did I 
                         fuckin' tell you?!

                                     NATALIE
                         I tried... I couldn't...

                                     SHELLY
                         I don't give a fuck!

               Shelly heads over to the closet, rips it open, pulls out a 
               suitcase. He starts throwing Natalie's clothes into the case.

                                     SHELLY
                         You're gone, sweetheart. History. 
                         Kiss paradise goodbye.

                                     NATALIE
                              (hysterical)
                         I can't leave! I won't! I love him. 
                         Doesn't that mean anything to you, 
                         you heartless fuck?

               Shelly stops packing. He grabs Natalie up off the bed, starts 
               smacking her around.

                                     SHELLY
                         Who the fuck do you think you are? 
                         You ain't nobody! I could make you 
                         disappear like this...
                              (snaps his fingers)
                         And nobody would ever notice you 
                         were gone. Nobody!

                                     NATALIE
                              (yells)
                         Bernie would! I got friends! You 
                         don't fuckin' own me. You got no 
                         right --

               Shelly lifts Natalie up, throws her across the room into the 
               dresser mirror. SMASH! She crumbles to the floor, glass 
               showering her. Natalie grabs up a shard, rushes Shelly with 
               it...

                                     NATALIE
                         Fuck you!

               She slashes Shelly across the arm. Ouch, fuck! Before Tony 
               and Lou can make a move, Shelly ensnares her wrist -- snaps 
               it backwards -- AARRRRGGHHH!!! Shelly snatches up the shard, 
               shoves her back on the bed. We see her terror reflected in 
               the jagged glass against her cheek...

                                     SHELLY
                         You fuckin' cunt...

               He slices her cheek open.

               Tony and Lou look on with mutual expressions: Shelly's getting 
               a little carried away here.

               Shelly staggers to his feet...

                                     SHELLY
                         You think that's bad? That's just a 
                         taste, bitch. You're still here when 
                         Bernie gets home and I'll finish the 
                         job. I'll cut you into so many fuckin' 
                         pieces, the vultures'll be trading 
                         on you for a month.

               Shelly reaches into his jacket, pulls out a wad of bills.

               Throws them at Natalie.

                                     SHELLY
                         Here... go get yourself some cosmetic 
                         surgery.

               Shelly gestures to Tony and Lou. They exit the room, leaving 
               Natalie sobbing into one of Bernie's pillows.

               EXT. LUCKY STAR MOTEL - NIGHT

               Bernie parks. Heads for his room. He's about to reach for 
               his key, when he realizes the door is slightly ajar. He pushes 
               his way into...

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               ...darkness.

                                     BERNIE
                         Natalie.

               Bernie fumbles for the light switch...

                                     NATALIE (O.S.)
                         No, don't. I've got a headache.

                                     BERNIE
                              (closing the door)
                         Did you take something? I got some 
                         aspirin in the --

                                     NATALIE
                         Yeah. I already took something.

               There's just enough moonlight in the room for Bernie to make 
               out Natalie curled over on the bed. As he approaches, he 
               trips over Natalie's suitcase on the floor.

                                     BERNIE
                         Ouch!

               He cuts himself on a splinter of shattered glass as he 
               staggers to his feet. Which draws his attention to the mirror. 
               Moonlight glows off the edges. That's all there is -- edges. 
               On the dresser: his bottle of Ten High. Empty.

               Confused, Bernie fumbles his way over to Natalie on the bed.

                                     BERNIE
                         Natalie, what happened? The mirror...

               He reaches out to touch her face... instead his hand makes 
               contact with a lump.

                                     BERNIE
                         Natalie.

               He jerks back, flips on the nightstand lamp.

                                     NATALIE
                         Bernie, no! Shit...

               Bernie chokes at the sight of her. She clutches a bloody rag 
               to her cheek. Blood on the pillow... blood on the sheets...

               And tears.

                                     BERNIE
                         Oh Jesus... Natalie, who did this to 
                         you? We need to call the police...

                                     NATALIE
                         I love you, Bernie. I just want you 
                         to know that. I fell in love with 
                         you. That wasn't part of the plan. I 
                         thought... easy money...

                                     BERNIE
                         What are you saying?

                                     NATALIE
                         Shelly. He paid me to get next to 
                         you. To keep you around. Whatever it 
                         took...

                                     BERNIE
                              (a whisper)
                         Shelly?

                                     NATALIE
                         You got it right the first night. I 
                         was for sale. Bought and paid for. 
                         You were the easy mark, Bernie.

               Bernie slumps down on the edge of the bed. Sucker-punched.

               Trying to make sense of it.

                                     NATALIE
                         At first you were just another John. 
                         But then I started to take a closer 
                         look. For the first time, here was 
                         someone who wasn't trying to hustle 
                         me. Wasn't pretending to be somebody 
                         he wasn't. Just a decent guy trying 
                         to get back on track. And it didn't 
                         hurt any that you put me up on a 
                         pedestal. It sure puts the gutter 
                         into perspective...

                                     BERNIE
                              (still in disbelief)
                         Shelly...

                                     NATALIE
                         Shelly wants me gone. He says I bring 
                         you luck. Lady luck. I stayed... to 
                         tell you to your face... and then 
                         you wouldn't want me no more... and 
                         I could just go...

               Bernie stands shakily.

                                     BERNIE
                         We gotta get you to the hospital. 
                         We'll talk about this later.

                                     NATALIE
                         Just tell me one thing, Bernie. Tell 
                         me there's gonna be a later.

               Bernie doesn't answer her.

               INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM WAITING AREA - NIGHT

               FADE IN on Bernie's hunched over figure, waiting on Natalie.

               He tugs at his car keys as he wrestles with his emotions.

               Natalie's betrayal has finally sunken in. The man's in pain.

               His natural instinct is to just take off. Run. Fuck Natalie. 
               Fuck Shelly. Fuck this whole goddamn town.

               Suddenly he looks up. A couple of people pass by in front of 
               him... and then there she is. Standing a few feet away, face 
               patched-up, arms clutching herself, not sure whether to 
               approach him or not.

               The sight of her just breaks Bernie's heart. He stands slowly, 
               legs like jelly -- and in that instant it's all so clear to 
               him. He walks over, forgiveness in his eyes, contrition in 
               hers.

               She tries to say something. He shakes his head.

                                     BERNIE
                         Ssshh.

               They embrace with an intensity that threatens to merge their 
               atoms into a single being.

               INT. BERNIE'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

               Bernie drives down a quiet Vegas street. It's spooky.

               Almost too quiet. All the lights are green as they cruise 
               into the night.

                                     NATALIE
                         Tell me again, Bernie. Tell me it's 
                         all gonna be okay.

                                     BERNIE
                         Everything's gonna be fine. This is 
                         our time. This is you and me and 
                         we're going for it.

               Natalie leans over and kisses him. As she does so, she catches 
               sight of her face in the mirror. Starts to tear up.

                                     BERNIE
                         You look in the mirror, you don't 
                         like what you see, don't believe it. 
                         You look in my eyes. That's the only 
                         mirror you gonna need. Look in my 
                         eyes, Natalie.

               She looks into Bernie's eyes. Sees the most beautiful girl 
               in the world. Tears roll down her cheeks.

                                     BERNIE
                         I love you. Marry me?

               Off Natalie's startled reaction...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HOLY ROLLER WEDDING CHAPEL - NIGHT

               A NEON SIGN READS: "HOLY ROLLER WEDDING CHAPEL. OPEN 24 
               HOURS."

               BOOM DOWN as Bernie carries Natalie out of the chapel, their 
               lips fused together.

               INT. BERNIE'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

               Bernie and Natalie burn down the highway. The lights of the 
               big city just a glimmer in the rearview.

               Up ahead, a billboard reads: THE SHANGRI-LA HOTEL AND CASINO. 
               TAKE A GAMBLE ON PARADISE.

               TIGHT on Bernie. His expression turns grim. Natalie picks up 
               on it. She shakes her head. Silently pleading: Bernie, no.

               Bernie tries to shrug it off. But the spectre of Shelly sits 
               firmly on his shoulder. There's no escaping him. We see Bernie 
               fighting it. Losing. SHIT!

               In the next instant, Bernie pulls a quick U-turn across the 
               middle shoulder, starts back toward Vegas.

               EXT. CASINO PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Bernie pulls into the parking lot. Kills his lights.

               INT. BERNIE'S BUICK - NIGHT

               Bernie reaches for the door. Natalie grabs his arm.

                                     NATALIE
                         You don't have to do this, Bernie.

                                     BERNIE
                         Yeah, I do. I have to tell him right 
                         to his face. I will not look over my 
                         shoulder for the rest of my life -- 
                         our lives.

                                     NATALIE
                         Bernie, your chart... that first 
                         night. I wasn't being straight with 
                         you. It's the worst chart I've ever 
                         seen. There's nothing in the cards 
                         for you. I'm scared...

                                     BERNIE
                         Don't you see, that was before you 
                         opened your heart to me. Everything's 
                         different now. I got lady luck on my 
                         side. Ain't nothing gonna happen to 
                         me.

               Natalie shakily opens her purse, pulls out a handful of 
               hundreds. Pushes the money at Bernie...

                                     NATALIE
                         It's three thousand dollars. Take 
                         it. Maybe Shelly'll accept it as a 
                         down payment. We can send him the 
                         rest in installments... after we get 
                         settled.

                                     BERNIE
                         I don't think --

                                     NATALIE
                         Take it.

               Bernie stuffs the cash in his jacket. Climbs out.

                                     BERNIE
                         Whatever happens, I --

                                     NATALIE
                              (abrupt)
                         I know, Bernie.

               She turns away. Stares out the window, tears streaming down 
               her cheeks.

                                     NATALIE
                              (sotto; gentle)
                         I know.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

               Bernie makes for the Paradise Lounge. SPLIT SECOND FLASHBACK 
               as he imagines Shelly laying into Natalie. Fast cuts.

               Reverberating sound echoes. Just the fuel Bernie needs to 
               make his stand. By the time he arrives at

               INT. PARADISE LOUNGE - NIGHT

               He's practically foaming at the mouth with rage. He barges 
               in to find Shelly at a table in agitated conversation with 
               Nicky, Larry and Marty. They fall silent, realizing something 
               is wrong.

                                     SHELLY
                         Bernie, what's the matter? You look 
                         a little fucking spooked.

               Bernie throws something in Shelly's face. It's that bloody 
               rag Natalie was holding to her cheek. It lands on the table 
               in front of everyone.

               Shelly swats it away with disgust. Jumps to his feet. WHAM!

               Bernie slugs him one. As Shelly doubles over, Bernie gets in 
               his face.

                                     BERNIE
                         You lay another finger on her, I 
                         swear to God I'll kill you. You hear 
                         me? I'll fuckin' kill you!

               Shelly's goons quickly move in, grab Bernie. Drag him away.

               Shelly composes himself, turns to his guests.

                                     SHELLY
                         Will you excuse me for a moment?

               He rushes off. Nicky shoots Larry a resigned look.

               INT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Lou shoves Bernie inside. Bernie kisses floor. Shelly strides 
               past, leans against his desk. Bernie slowly drags himself to 
               his feet.

                                     BERNIE
                              (a hoarse whisper)
                         Why? Why, Shelly?

                                     SHELLY
                         Because you never give up a good 
                         thing, Bernie. You are a good thing. 
                         The best fuckin' cooler there ever 
                         was. And I need him back.

                                     BERNIE
                         He ain't never comin' back.

                                     SHELLY
                         That's a dead man talking.

                                     BERNIE
                         I'm through with this joint, Shelly. 
                         Natalie and me, we just got married. 
                         We're outta here. I'll get a job out 
                         there in the world. Send you half my 
                         paycheck every month. Make good on 
                         my obligations.

                                     SHELLY
                              (gets in Bernie's 
                              face)
                         You try to walk on me, Bernie, and 
                         I'll fuckin' bury you. The both of 
                         you.

                                     BERNIE
                         I don't think so.

               Shelly's expression: Oh yeah?

                                     BERNIE
                         You whack me, then Bernie Lootz ain't 
                         the world's biggest loser no more. 
                         That honor's gonna fall upon you, 
                         Shelly. And maybe you had it all 
                         along.

                                     SHELLY
                         What the fuck? Me? I'm the loser?

                                     BERNIE
                         What you got? What do you got in 
                         your life besides this joint?

                                     SHELLY
                         What the fuck more do I need?

                                     BERNIE
                         You got nothin', Shelly. This place -- 
                         your legacy -- it's a mirage. You 
                         turn your back and it don't even 
                         exist. There's no day, there's no 
                         night, it's all just one big fuckin' 
                         blur and it don't count for nothin'!

               Shelly looks to Tony and Lou:

                                     SHELLY
                         You believe this fuckin' guy?

               Bernie gets eye-to-eye with Shelly. A first.

                                     BERNIE
                         I feel real sorry for you. Yeah, you 
                         got this fear of germs thing. But it 
                         goes deeper than that. You can't get 
                         close to no one. On an emotional 
                         level. You're the worst kind of 
                         gambler there ever was: too scared 
                         to put his chips on the table. Too 
                         scared to open his heart... to extend 
                         any real kinda friendship. Always 
                         afraid it's gonna end out in the 
                         desert. Well, sweet fuckin' dreams, 
                         pal, 'cause I'm out and if that's 
                         where it ends, that's where it ends.

               Bernie turns his back on Shelly, strides over to the door.

                                     SHELLY
                         That's a real heartfelt speech, Lootz. 
                         All that Jimmy Stewart in ya face 
                         intensity. You almost sold me.
                              (massages his throat)
                         Man, I've got a fucking lump in my 
                         throat.
                              (a beat)
                         But it still don't change things. 
                         You bail on me without making good 
                         on my 150 G's and I'm gonna be forced 
                         to close the books on you. You and 
                         the broad. You leave me no choice.

               Bernie turns, looks at Shelly. Shelly's dead serious. They 
               hard stare each other for a beat. Bernie doesn't say anything. 
               At least, not out loud. His eyes do all the talking: "I guess 
               you leave me no choice either." HOLD on Bernie's steely 
               resolve.

               INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

               This could be the opening of the film -- Bernie standing 
               with his back to us, facing the gold elevator doors. Murky 
               reflection. The floor lights ascending fast...

               The doors open and the soundtrack goes SILENT. SLOW PUSH IN 
               on him as he takes in the action -- a gladiator about to 
               enter the Coliseum. Something comes alive in his eyes. A 
               spark of determination. This is not the expression of a loser. 
               CLOSE-UP as his foot steps onto the casino floor --

               An explosion of amplified CASINO WALLA shatters the previous 
               silence.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

               We follow Bernie as he wanders through the casino like he's 
               done a thousand times -- but this time with conviction.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - CRAPS TABLES - NIGHT

               Bernie steps up to an empty table, throws down the whole 
               three grand onto the felt.

                                     BERNIE
                         Change only...

               The CREW working the table stop down as they realize who it 
               is. The table is dead. Bernie couldn't be needed. The croupier 
               slowly gathers up the green, hands it to the boxman.

                                     CROUPIER
                         Check change three thousand.

               The boxman counts the cash.

                                     BOXMAN
                         This a pleasure cruise, Bernie?

                                     BERNIE
                         You could say that.

                                     BOXMAN
                         Well, it'll be a short one. Table's 
                         dead.

                                     CROUPIER
                         It is now, anyway.

               The others chuckle. The boxman counts out the chips; they're 
               given to Bernie. He places them all on the passline.

               The stickman pushes over the dice. Bernie picks a couple.

               He throws....

                                     STICKMAN
                         Yo Eleven! Pay the line.

               Bernie picks up his three thousand dollars in winnings. He 
               lets it ride. The table quickly fills up with hungry players.

               Bernie throws the dice again...

                                     STICKMAN
                         Winner seven!

               Bernie is now paid six thousand dollars on his pass line 
               bet.

               The other players also collect their winnings. They can feel 
               something in the air.

               Bernie, forehead beaded with sweat, rubs the felt a little 
               before he picks up the dice. He throws...

                                     STICKMAN
                         Six easy. Easy way six!

               Bernie takes double odds on his bet. The boxman isn't sure 
               what to do. Does he stop him? Does he dare?

               In the b.g., people gather to watch the action. Whatever it 
               is, it's catching. The table next to them bursts into 
               applause.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR  MONTAGE - NIGHT

               A -- Close on a slot machine as it pays out. The woman grabs 
               the payout feverishly.

               B -- A group at the blackjack table cheers as the dealer 
               busts out.

               C -- The line at the cashier cage gets longer and longer. 

               -- CHIPS. Stacks and stacks of chips, being meticulously 
               counted.

               D -- A quick shot of a roulette ball dropping into number 
               twenty-one. The dealer slowly puts the marker atop a large 
               stack of chips in the twenty-one square.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - CRAPS TABLES - NIGHT

               A shot of the faces of frenzied dice players waiting for the 
               outcome of the throw. Followed by a thunderous release as 
               the point is made.

               In the center of it all. Bernie Lootz. His rail is nearly 
               full of chips. The other players pat him on the back and 
               shake his hand as the croupiers busily pay the line.

               He's a winner. And it's infectious. He's gone and 
               "contaminated" the entire casino. The slots are ringing out 
               of control. CHEERING. WHOOPING. MOANS of delight. This much 
               excitement threatens to take the fucking roof off.

               Bernie just gazes around in amazement. If only Natalie could 
               see him now...

                                     BERNIE
                              (sotto)
                         Natalie... this is you...

               Bernie takes a thousand dollars in chips, tosses it gently 
               to the croupier.

                                     BERNIE
                         For the boys.

               The entire crew stop for a moment out of respect. Bernie 
               notices. They all nod as the boxman locks up the tip money.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Okay, we're coming out. Get your YO 
                         bets, C&E, any seven...

               INT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

               Shelly sits alone in his office, nursing a glass of Scotch, 
               listening to some scratchy Chet Baker on the turntable. He 
               looks pre-occupied. Almost melancholic. Bernie's assessment 
               of his life having hit home.

               Suddenly the door is thrown open. It's Tony...

                                     TONY
                         Shelly, take a look at number 4.

               INT. CASINO - CRAPS TABLES - MOMENTS LATER

               Shelly wanders up slowly to find Bernie at the center of the 
               crowd. He steps behind the table into the casino pit to get 
               a closer look.

                                     SHELLY
                              (to the boxman)
                         How much is he up?

               The boxman looks up nervously.

                                     BOXMAN
                         Around three hundred thousand.

               Shelly mouths the words under his breath.

                                     SHELLY
                         Why didn't one of you fucking geniuses 
                         call me?

                                     BOXMAN
                         We tried. You weren't picking up. 
                         Besides, it was Bernie.

               The game resumes.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Alright. We're coming out folks, 
                         hands high...

               Bernie stops.

                                     BERNIE
                         Wait!

               Everybody quiets down to listen.

                                     BERNIE
                         Color me up a hundred fifty thousand.
                              (beat)
                         And give it to him.

               Bernie points to Shelly standing in the pit. The crowd watches 
               the drama play out.

                                     BERNIE
                         That's what I owe you, Shelly. There 
                         it is. We're square.
                              (to the table)
                         Let it be known, Bernie Lootz lives 
                         up to his obligations.

               The boxman colors up a hundred fifty thousand in chips, lays 
               them out on the table. He counts it and claps his hands 
               together for the cameras.

                                     BOXMAN
                         One hundred fifty thousand, coming 
                         in.

               Shelly stands motionless. Staring into Bernie's eyes. The 
               whole crowd watches. After what seems like an eternity, Shelly 
               nods. Then the Boxman feeds the chips in with the others. A 
               moment later, we can nary tell they were ever gone.

               Larry appears next to Shelly. Nicky and Marty watching from 
               the sidelines -- dour expressions.

                                     LARRY
                         What's the matter with you? He's one 
                         of ours and he's taking us to the 
                         fucking cleaners.

                                     SHELLY
                         Lootz's off the clock. As long as 
                         he's off the clock, he's free to 
                         play. Just like every other schmuck 
                         in this joint.

                                     LARRY
                         It smells wrong. I'm shutting him 
                         down. He's not leaving here with a 
                         dime --

               Shelly suddenly jabs Larry in the throat with the tips of 
               his fingers. Larry gasps, starts to cave. Shelly keeps him 
               upright, escorts him to a nearby men's room. Nicky and Marty 
               looking on in amazement.

               INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

               The door flies open, Larry catapults into frame. OOF!

               Bounces off the wall. Shelly's right behind him. He drags 
               Larry to his feet. Slams him into the wall again -- gets 
               right up in his face.

                                     SHELLY
                         Now you listen real good, you Harvard 
                         turd. Lootz is on the up-and-up. He 
                         leaves here tonight with whatever he 
                         comes out with. You so much as touch 
                         a hair on his head and I'll fucking 
                         wallpaper this joint with your ass. 
                         Muted tones, right?
                              (slams him hard)
                         What's that? I don't hear nothing. 
                         Wait a minute -- yeah, now I hear 
                         it.

               Blended in at a subsonic level.

               Some kinda mantra: pain, pain, pain.

               Shelly headbutts Larry. It's like the sound of a walnut 
               cracking. Larry slumps to the floor. Shelly takes a deep 
               breath. Control, control, control. He heads over to the sink, 
               washes his hands -- over and over. Larry moaning in the b.g. 
               Shelly adjusts his tie in the mirror. Control.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - CRAPS TABLES - NIGHT

               Shelly exits the men's room, makes his way back to the craps 
               table where Bernie is. Just in time to see Bernie lay twenty 
               five grand on the pass line. A waitress hands a drink off to 
               Bernie. He takes a healthy swig. Then picks up the dice.

               Throws.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Crap ace deuce! Line down!

               The crowd gasps in horror as Bernie's twenty five grand is 
               quickly raked in. He replaces it with another stack of chips.

               The dice are pushed over to him. He rubs the felt real gently 
               before throwing. Then lets loose the dice.

               All eyes follow the dice. They hit the felt and bounce around 
               behind a stack of chips. The stickman can't spot them.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Call it.

               A croupier makes the call as anxious players rubberneck to 
               get a look.

                                     CROUPIER
                         Twelve crap.

               The crowd groans again. It appears the streak is over.

               Bernie looks out over the felt. This is his moment of truth.

               He unloads his entire rail and puts it on the field.

               He yells out.

                                     BERNIE
                         Fifty thousand dollars!

               The crowd chimes in with every opinion under the sun.

                                     MAN (O.S.)
                         On the field? What're you fucking 
                         nuts?

                                     WOMAN (O.S.)
                         Don't do it!

                                     MAN 2 (O.S.)
                         Shake it, don't break it, baby!

               The dice are slowly pushed over to Bernie. The crowd is 
               feeling it. The entire casino is feeling it. Bernie lets out 
               a long soulful sigh. His whole life depends on the next throw 
               and everyone knows it.

               Bernie rubs the felt as usual and lines up the dice to show 
               a six and a six. He picks them up.

                                     BERNIE
                         Come on sixty-six!

               Locks eyes with Shelly -- then lets loose. The dice fly from 
               his hand. Slowly, ever so slowly we watch them sail across 
               the table. The entire table holds their breath in 
               anticipation...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHANGRI-LA HOTEL AND CASINO - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

               Bernie throws open the doors, stumbles out. His limp seems 
               more pronounced. He wears a miserable expression.

               At the car Bernie steps up. Opens the door, slides in behind 
               the wheel.

               INT. BERNIE'S CAR - NIGHT

               Natalie throws her arms around him...

                                     NATALIE
                         Thank God... I thought for sure...

               Bernie just looks at her. Pale, mournful features.

                                     NATALIE
                         It's okay, right? You guys worked it 
                         out. He took the three grand? Tell 
                         me it's okay, Bernie?

               He doesn't answer. Just starts up the car...

               INT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               On the surveillance monitors: the epidemic continues -- 
               players winning at every table. The Shangri-la's been wiped 
               out. There's no way they can cover this amount of winning 
               action.

               PANNING ACROSS to Shelly. Defeated. The phone rings 
               incessantly in the b.g. Shelly ignores it.

               Lou pokes his head into the office:

                                     LOU
                         Want me to get that, Shelly?

               Shelly doesn't respond. He reaches into his desk drawer for 
               that bottle and a glass. Is about to pour himself a shot...

               Fuck it. Pushes the glass aside. Takes it straight from the 
               bottle. The phone keeps ringing...

               On the scale model of the newly proposed Shangri-la. Hold on 
               it.

               WHAM! A chair enters frame, shatters "paradise."

               WIDER: Shelly trashing the model with a vengeance. Kicking 
               the debris around the office.

               Drenched in sweat, Shelly staggers over to his desk. Swats 
               the empty gin bottle to the floor. Picks up his disinfectant 
               spray, gives his desk one last wipedown. Immaculate.

               Stands, walks out...

               INT. BERNIE'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

               We see the lights of the city receding in Bernie's rearview 
               mirror. Once outside of the city limits Bernie pulls the car 
               over.

                                     NATALIE
                         What are you stopping for?

               Bernie throws open his door...

                                     BERNIE
                         I think I'm gonna...

               Throw up. And he does. It's as if he's choking up the entire 
               city. Everything that's bad about it. Finally, he pulls 
               himself back into the car. Slams the door.

               Natalie touches his cheek, a reassuring look in her eyes.

               Suddenly, he's smiling. He opens his coat and a huge wad of 
               cash tumbles out. He throws it up into the air. Natalie almost 
               chokes with surprise.

                                     BERNIE
                         Bahamas, here we come, baby.

               She throws her arms around him...

               Suddenly an EXPLOSION OF LIGHT! A flashlight. In the hand of 
               a MOTORCYCLE COP. He raps on the window...

                                     COP
                         Step out of the car please.

                                     BERNIE
                              (lowers the window)
                         What's the problem, officer?

               The cop runs the flashlight over the bundles of cash littering 
               the car interior.

                                     COP
                         Just step out of the car, please. 
                         Both of you.

               Bernie and Natalie exchange unsettled looks. The cop lowers 
               his hand to his gun. Bernie nods at Natalie. They climb out. 
               He directs them off to the side. Shines his light in their 
               faces.

                                     BERNIE
                         If my driving... if I was going a 
                         little fast -- I was just over 
                         excited, officer. See, we just
                         had a big win at the Shangri-la --

                                     COP
                         You didn't win nothing.

               The cop pulls out his revolver, trains it on them.

               INTERCUT WITH:

               INT. SHANGRI-LA UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

               Shelly opens the door to his Cadillac. Climbs behind the 
               wheel. His keys are already waiting in the ignition. Who's 
               gonna steal Shelly Kaplow's car, right?

               Shelly doesn't start her up. He just leans back in his seat, 
               emits a deep sigh. He glances up at the rearview mirror.

               Catches sight of a SILHOUETTE in the back.

               INTERCUT WITH:

               EXT. VEGAS HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               Bernie and Natalie staring into the barrel of the cop's 
               revolver. Natalie clutches Bernie's arm. Bernie nods. So 
               there you have it.

                                     NATALIE
                         Oh Jesus, Bernie, I knew it. It was 
                         too good to be true. Who were we 
                         kidding?

                                     COP
                         Get down on your knees. Both of you.

               They look at him in shock. He gestures them to the ground 
               behind Bernie's car. We CUT TO a shot from the highway: just 
               the cop standing at the tail-end of Bernie's car, Natalie 
               and Bernie hidden from view.

               ON BERNIE AND NATALIE

               down on their knees. Bernie places his arm around Natalie, 
               pulls her close to him. Paralyzed with terror, she still 
               manages a bittersweet smile.

               Bernie should be projecting fear, but there's nothing but 
               his overwhelming love for Natalie in his eyes. It's a two 
               way current.

               This is their last moment together; everything that needs to 
               be said is being transmitted through a look. A look that 
               says: no regrets.

               INTERCUT WITH:

               INT. SHELLY'S CADILLAC - NIGHT

               Nicky leans forward out of the shadows. Shelly holds his 
               gaze in the mirror. Nicky just shrugs.

                                     NICKY
                         The kid wants you should know, Shelly, 
                         he's just protecting our investment -- 
                         the old school way. See you around.

               Shelly nods. He knows the score... A flash of steel appears 
               against his head. Muzzle strobe -- THUP! So long, Shelly 
               Kaplow.

               EXT. VEGAS HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               The cop looms over Bernie and Natalie. Cocks his pistol.

               Lowers the gun to the back of Bernie's head.

               They appear oblivious to it. They're already in another place. 
               Sunning themselves in the Bahamas.

               The cop squeezes back the trigger.

               ON BERNIE AND NATALIE

               still looking at each other. Suddenly the piercing shriek of

               SCREECHING TIRES... followed by a reverberating, bone 
               crunching --

               WHAM! -- and a GUNSHOT.

               Bernie and Natalie still staring into each other's eyes, not 
               quite sure what's just transpired. Only that they're still 
               breathing. They look around, startled to see the tail lights 
               of a PICK-UP TRUCK about ten yards away. The cop, their would-
               be assassin, rendered road kill beneath the wheels.

               All this in the blink of an eye.

               Natalie clutches Bernie's arm. Suppresses a hysterical, shock-
               induced giggle. Bernie just looks dumbfounded. He staggers 
               to his feet, rushes over to the pick-up truck. The driver's 
               head is protruding through the shattered windshield.

               Death-glazed eyes.

               Bernie feels for the man's pulse just to be sure. Shakes his 
               head. We see a dozen Coors empties on the seat and floor of 
               the truck.

               Natalie checks the cop. Likewise. Bernie comes over. They

                         He was drunk. It was just freak 
                         luck...
                              (catches himself...)

                         Don't give it a name, Bernie. It 
                         scares me. All I know is, you're 
                         still running hot and that's a good 
                         thing. But we're only winners if we 
                         keep going. No looking back.

                                     BERNIE
                         Lady luck, Natalie. I'm calling it. 
                         Lady luck. And we got it as long as 
                         we're together. They can't touch us 
                         now.

               He kisses her furiously. Then drags her over to his car.

               They climb in. Drive off.

               EXT. VEGAS HIGHWAY/INT. BERNIE'S BUICK - DAWN

               Bernie's Buick racing into the sunrise. Racing toward the 
               dream. Bernie, eyes fixed on the road ahead, with the 
               contented smile of a man who has gambled on love -- and won.

               His prize, resting her head against his shoulder.

               The money, well, that ain't half bad as well. A smoky, trumpet 
               driven Chet Baker-like piece accentuates the triumphant mood 
               on the soundtrack, as we SUPERIMPOSE...

          The blade of a knife.

          Pulled from its sheath, intricate tribal etchings on the
          blade catching the light.

          The blade being pulled across a sharpening stone. Swoosh-
          swoosh-swoosh. Rhythmic. A well-practiced hand. A muscular,
          tattooed arm.

          The blade held up. Razor sharp. The glow of a TV in the
          darkened room is the only illumination.
          We see images on the TV:

          GLOBAL AND URBAN STRIFE slums barricades poverty
          starvation demonstrations repression refugee
          camps barbed wire prisons riot police tear gas
          violence...

          Then the images settle to now, BREAKING NEWS:
          FOOD RIOTS IN ROME. Images of a protest march. A crowd
          filling the streets. Soldiers moving into position. We see
          placards: "DOGS MUST EAT," "MEAT WAS MADE FOR MOUTHS."
          The man sharpening the knife watches the images. His eyes are
          cold. Almost disinterested.

          Then he stops.
          Frozen in mid-stroke.
          Something on the TV suddenly rivets him.
          His eyes no longer cold.

          The TV shows one of the soldiers, a high-ranking officer.
          Imperious. Giving orders. We will come to know this is a man
          as Caius Martius -- Coriolanus.

          TULLUS AUFIDIUS, the man sharpening the knife, gazes at the
          image on the screen.

          He leans forward. Emerging from the darkness. We see his
          face.

          He is a handsome and imposing figure, magnetic in his
          personality. Charismatic, yes, but also neurotic and edgy.
          Uncomfortable in his own skin. Some demons there.
          He watches the face of Caius Martius on the TV screen.

          Then he puts the point of his knife against the screen.
          Against Caius Martius' heart.
          Holds it there Presses the point against the screen
          Muscles knotting in his forearm As if he could thrust the

          EXT. ROME - STREET - DAY

          We move with an intense woman down the street. She is
          nervous. Checks she is not being followed.
          She is TAMORA, an extreme figure on the political landscape.
          To the Roman elite she is a dangerous anarchist -- to her
          supporters she is an ardent patriot and democrat.
          As she moves, we take in Rome.
          It might be Mexico City. Or Chechnia. Or El Salvador. Or
          Detroit. Or Baghdad. Or London.
          This Rome is a modern place. It is our world right now:
          immediately recognizable to us. Elements of classical
          architecture loom over decay. Monolithic modernism and brave
          public monuments are lost in a sea of brazen advertising
          billboards, neon shopping plazas and drab super-highways.
          Splendor and squalor sit side-by-side.
          It is a volatile, dangerous world.

          She comes to a graffiti-covered apartment building. Looks
          around. Enters.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          A secret political meeting in a police state.
          Tension. Cigarette smoke hangs in the air. Men and women
          gathered, hushed and urgent tones. A cell meeting of the
          political opposition, the resistance.
          A TV shows the food marches elsewhere in the city. The
          gathering storm.
          CASSIUS is a leading proletariat organizer:

                         CASSIUS
          Before we proceed any further, hear me
          speak -- You are all resolved rather to
          die than to famish?
          The others agree. They are not wild-eyed radicals. They are
          normal people, from all walks of life. You and me.

                         CASSIUS
          First, you know Caius Martius is chief
          enemy to the people.
          A voice from the back of the room:

                         TAMORA
          Let us kill him.
          The others turn. Tamora, just entering, pulls off her coat,
          joins the others:

                         TAMORA
          And we'll have corn at our own price. Is
          it a verdict?
          Some are unsure. She is too extreme for some.

                         CASSIUS

                         (PRESSING SLIGHTLY)
          We are accounted poor citizens, the
          patricians good The leanness that
          afflicts us, the object of our misery,
          our sufferance, is a gain to them. Let us
          revenge this with our sticks ere we
          become rakes! I speak this in hunger
          for bread, not in thirst for revenge.
          A woman, a YOUNG MOTHER, protests:

                         YOUNG MOTHER
          Will you proceed especially against Caius
          Martius?

                         CASSIUS
          Against him first.
          A COLLEGE PROFESSOR, speaks up:

          pays himself with being proud.

                         COLLEGE PROFESSOR
          Nay, but speak not maliciously.
          She has over-played her hand. Pretends to back down:

                         TAMORA
          I say unto you, what he hath done
          famously, he did it to that end...
          (a snarky smile)
          He did it to please his mother.
          Some laugh at her gossip.
          Then the TV image switches to a BREAKING NEWS update:
          From the Roman Senate. An august press room. A Senator is
          moving to a podium to make a statement.
          He is Senator MENENIUS is a seasoned and wily politician.
          Silver hair, perfectly tailored suit. He is known as a folksy
          "man of the people." It is a role he plays to perfection.

                         CASSIUS
          Soft, who comes here?

                         COLLEGE PROFESSOR
          Worthy Senator Menenius, one that hath
          always loved the people.

                         TAMORA
          He's one honest enough; would all the
          rest were so.

                         MENENIUS

                         (ON TV)
          Why, masters, my good friends, mine
          honest neighbors,
          Will you undo yourselves?

                         (SMILES BENEVOLENTLY)
          I tell you, friends, most charitable care
          Have the patricians of you,
          For your wants,
          Your suffering in this dearth, you may as

                         WELL

          (speaking to the TV)
          Suffer us to famish, and their
          storehouses crammed with grain--
          The others shush her.

                         MENENIUS

                         (ON TV)
          Alack, you are transported by calamity
          Thither where more attends you; and you

                         SLANDER
          The helms of the state, who care for you
          like fathers,
          When you curse them as enemies--
          Cassius mutes the TV. We see Senator Menenius continuing with
          his speech; his attempt to calm the dangerous situation.

                         CASSIUS
          Care for us? They never cared for us yet!

                         TAMORA
          If the wars eat us not up, they will: and
          that's all the love they bear us.
          The others are growing increasingly restive -- shifting --

                         TENSION BUILDING--

                         CASSIUS

                         TAMORA
          No more talking on it!
          To the Capitol! Come! Come!

                         CUT TO--

          EXT. STREETS - DAY

          Tamora, Cassius and the others are now in the midst of the
          protest march. The crowd has become a mob, with a life and
          will of its own. The crowd surges forward--
          They round a corner and suddenly stop--
          For a formidable sight awaits them-

          RIOT POLICE.
          Rows of black uniforms. Full riot gear with plexiglass
          shields and dangerous truncheons.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.
          A few soldiers on horses as well.
          The crowd starts and shifts nervously, unsure how to proceed.
          Should they launch themselves against this monolithic
          military force?
          A long, tense beat.
          Then...
          One of the horsemen trots forward...
          He rides a beautiful white horse...
          It is CAIUS MARTIUS. (Soon to be given the honorary title
          Coriolanus.) He is intense and patrician. Uncompromising. A
          man of steel. A soldier. He wears a crisp, military uniform.
          From his position on the horse, Martius looks over the
          rioters...
          His gaze is ice...
          A long beat...
          Then he dismounts...
          He slowly walks to the unruly mob...
          With no hesitation, unarmed...
          He stops before them...
          And speaks with absolute disdain.

                         MARTIUS
          What's the matter, you dissentious
          rogues,
          That, rubbing the poor itch of your
          opinion,
          Make yourselves scabs?

                         CASSIUS

                         (SARCASTIC)
          We have ever your good word.

                         MARTIUS

                         (SNAPS)
          He that will give good words to thee will

                         FLATTER
          Beneath abhorring.
          The crowd is hushed. Taking in his every word.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.
          We note a TV news crew has moved into position and is filming
          eagerly. Some in the crowd film with cell phone cameras.
          Streaming video. We intercut some of these perspectives.

                         MARTIUS
          What would you have, you curs?
          He that trusts to you,
          Where he should find you lions, finds you

                         HARES;
          Where foxes, geese.
          He walks along the front of the crowd. Some are frightened by
          the great Martius. Some are even awed. Others glare at him
          with loathing.

                         MARTIUS
          Who deserves greatness
          Deserves your hate...
          Hang ye! Trust ye?
          With every minute you do change your
          mind,
          And call him noble that was now your
          hate,
          Him vile that was your garland.
          He continues along the crowd, his cold eyes taking in face

                         AFTER FACE:

                         MARTIUS
          What's the matter,
          That in these several places of the city
          You cry against the noble Senate, who,
          Under the gods, keep you in awe, which

                         ELSE
          Would feed on one another?
          He stops and glares at the mob with seething anger.
          He climbs back onto his horse. Stares down at them.

                         AN ULTIMATUM:

                         MARTIUS
          Go GET YOU HOME, YOU FRAGMENTS!
          A tense beat.
          The riot police shift nervously.
          The crowd is unsure.
          The TV news crew films everything.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.
          Cassius looks around. He sees the police ready with tear gas.
          He sees old men, women and children in his crowd. He doesn't
          want this to explode.
          He exchanges a few whispers works with Tamora. Word is passed
          and the crowd begins to disperse. Some run off in a panic.
          Others walk away.
          The danger has passed.
          Senator Menenius, who has been watching from nearby, gestures
          for Martius to join him. He is an old family friend of
          Martius' as well as his mentor and chief political advisor.
          Menenius is relieved bloodshed has been avoided.

                         MENENIUS
          These are almost thoroughly persuaded;
          For though abundantly they lack
          discretion,
          Yet are they passing cowardly.

                         MARTIUS
          They are dissolved. Hang 'em.
          Senator Menenius watches the crowd. Disturbed.

                         MENENIUS
          I would they were abed.

                         MARTIUS
          I would they were in Tiber.
          They move off.

          INT. DARKENED ROOM - DAY

          We see the TV image of Martius railing at the people from

                         BEFORE:

                         MARTIUS

                         (ON TV)
          Go GET YOU HOME, YOU FRAGMENTS!
          Tullus Aufidius is leaning in. Watching so closely.
          From his POV: the pixilated close-up of Martius' face on the
          screen.
          He runs his knife blade back and forth. Turns it in the
          light; the reflection of Martius' face distorting as he
          rotates the blade.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.
          Then Aufidius leans back again.
          Back into the shadows. Disappearing.

          EXT. MILITARY COMMAND CENTER - DAY

          Rome's military headquarters. A high security building like
          the Pentagon.

          INT. ROMAN WAR ROOM - DAY

          Martius is seated with several MILITARY OFFICERS and AIDES.
          Also with him is TITUS. He younger than Martius, an old
          friend and comrade-in-arms. Like Martius he has seen a lot of
          battle.
          COMINIUS, an older general, enters. He is an experienced
          commander of men also used to dealing with the necessary
          politics of civilian oversight. West Point bearing.
          All salute. Cominius returns the salute.

                         COMINIUS
          The news is the Volsces are in arms.
          An aide presses a remote. Grainy video images play on a
          monitor: Volscian soldiers, jeeps, tanks.
          One section shows a quick image of the rebel leader, a
          striking man called Tullus Aufidius, riding past in a jeep.

                         COMINIUS
          They have a leader,
          Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to it.

                         MARTIUS
          I sin in envying his nobility,
          And were I any thing but what I am,
          I would wish me only he.

                         SENATOR
          You have fought together?

                         MARTIUS
          He is a lion
          That I am proud to hunt.
          Martius takes the remote control. Stops the video. Rewinds to
          the unclear image of Aufidius.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         MARTIUS
          Titus Lartius, thou
          Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus'
          face.

                         TITUS
          Lead you on.
          Martius rewinds and plays the image of Aufidius again,
          rewinds and plays it again, almost obsessively.
          We push in on the video image of Aufidius...
          Aufidius appears to be staring right back at Martius...
          And this takes us to...

          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING-WAR ROOM - NIGHT

          The same face.
          Aufidius, who is the leader of the rebel Volscian forces,
          stands deep in thought.
          The Volsces are an insurgent force challenging the monolithic
          might of Rome: rebels that suggest to us Latin American
          revolutionaries or Hamas fighters or Chechnian separatists.
          They are a dangerous guerilla force.
          We are in the Volsce war room in an old apartment building. A
          basement. No windows. Secure.
          OFFICERS and some civilian POLITICIANS. The room is filled
          with military maps, weapons, surveillance photos.

                         VOLSCE POLITICIAN
          So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
          That they of Rome are entered in our

                         COUNSELS
          And know how we proceed.

                         AUFIDIUS

                         (SNAPS)
          Is it not yours?
          Tis not four days gone since I heard
          thence.

                         VOLSCE OFFICER
          We never yet made doubt but Rome was

                         READY
          To answer us.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

                         VOLSCE POLITICIAN
          And it is rumored Martius, your old
          enemy, leads in their preparation.
          He tosses a glossy magazine on the desk, a picture of Martius
          on the cover.
          Aufidius' eyes spark at the image of Martius.
          He picks up the magazine and carefully tears off the cover
          picture of Martius, looking at the picture deeply.
          He continues with a strange and grim fire:

                         AUFIDIUS
          If we and Caius Martius chance to meet,
          'Tis sworn between us we shall ever

                         STRIKE
          Till one can do no more.
          By the elements,
          If ever again I meet him beard to beard,
          He's mine or I am his.

          EXT. MARTIUS VILLA - DAY

          A beautiful butterfly. Catching the light perfectly, almost
          iridescent.
          It floats before a palatial mansion in the suburbs of the
          great city. Manicured lawns. Formal gardens. Classical
          architectural lines.
          This fine home of aristocratic privilege seems a world away
          from the urban blight of Rome.
          In the immaculate front gardens YOUNG MARTIUS, Martius' son,
          is playing. The boy is about ten. There is something grim and
          lonely about him, without charm.
          Young Martius chases after the butterfly, trying to catch it.
          He fails. The butterfly flits away. Young Martius leaps after
          it. Again he misses.
          Finally the frustrated boy manages to catch the butterfly. In
          his rage he tears it to pieces, brutally shredding it.
          We realize he is being observed...

          INT. MARTIUS VILLA -- LIVING ROOM - DAY

          . VIRGILIA, Martius' wife, stands at the window. Disturbed
          by the sight of her son ripping apart the butterfly.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.
          She sees Young Martius stop and look at the tiny bit of blood
          on his fingers. Young Martius is unmoved. He glances up.
          Locks eyes with his mother.
          She turns away.
          Virgilia was well-chosen for her role as wife to one of
          Rome's most aristocratic men. She is beautiful and graceful
          but -- like Diana thrown into lion's den of the Windsor
          family -- woefully out of her depth. We feel an inner
          fragility to her.
          The room is spacious and elegantly appointed. A lovely Roman
          statue in one corner. This is a place of wealth, order and
          control.
          A fine flat-screen TV flickers with images of war. We see
           helicopters zooming over desert landscape Imbedded war
          correspondents Tanks Combat Romans . Volscians.
          VOLUMNIA, Martius' mother, stands and watches the TV. She is
          an imposing woman, handsome and tall, impeccably dressed.
          Adamantine in her strength.
          Virgilia moves from the window. Sits on a sofa. She watches
          the TV news footage of the war, upset by the images.
          A frozen silence.

                         THEN:

                         VOLUMNIA
          I pray you, daughter, sing, or express
          yourself in a more comfortable sort. If
          my son were my husband, I should more
          freely rejoice in that absence wherein he
          won honor than in the embracements of his
          bed where he would show most love.
          She moves across the room to fetch a cigarette. She moves,
          always, with stately grace.
          She walks past a series of photographs. They tell the story
          of Martius' life: the happy baby; the stern dead father; the
          rigid young military cadet; the formal wedding; the
          restrained and unsmiling adult.
          In the photos we sense a transformation: innocent boy to
          experienced, severe looking soldier. Volumnia is present in
          most of the pictures.

                         AS:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         VOLUMNIA
          When yet he was but tender-bodied and the
          only son of my womb, I, considering how
          honor would become such a person, was
          pleased to let him seek danger where he
          was like to find fame.
          She lights her cigarette.

                         VOLUMNIA
          To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he
          returned, his brows bound with oak.

                         VIRGILIA
          But had he died in the business, madam,
          how then?

                         VOLUMNIA
          Then his good report should have been my
          son.
          (she rivets Virgilia)
          Had I a dozen sons I had rather have
          eleven die nobly for their country than
          one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
          A MAID enters. She speaks to Volumnia (the true mistress of
          the house) not to Virgilia.

                         MAID
          Madam, Senator Menenius is come to visit
          you.

                         VOLUMNIA
          Tell Menenius we are fit to bid him
          welcome.
          The Maid goes.

                         VIRGILIA
          Beseech you, give me leave to retire
          myself.

                         VOLUMNIA
          Indeed, you shall not!
          She turns off the TV and goes to a bar to mix drinks. She
          mixes the drinks aggressively, strangely inspired by the
          discussion of war:

                         VOLUMNIA
          Methinks I hear hither your husband's

                         DRUM;
          Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call

                         THUS:

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

                         VOLUMNIA (CONT'D)
          "Come on, you cowards! You were got in
          fear,
          Though you were born in Rome." His bloody

                         BROW
          Then wiping, forth he goes.

                         VIRGILIA
          His bloody brow? 0 Jupiter, no blood...

                         VOLUMNIA
          Away, you fool! It more becomes a man
          Than gold his trophy.

                         VIRGILIA
          Heavens bless my lord from fell
          Auf idius ...

                         VOLUMNIA
          He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee
          And tread upon his neck.
          Senator Menenius enters, he is comfortable in this house and
          an old ally of Volumnia's.

                         MENENIUS
          My ladies both, good day to you.
          Volumnia hands him one of the drinks she has been mixing: a
          perfect martini. She knows how he takes his drink. She is not
          above flirting with him when it suits her ends.

                         MENENIUS
          How do you both?

                         (TO VIRGILIA)
          And how does your little son?

                         VIRGILIA
          I thank you, sir; well, good.

                         VOLUMNIA
          He had rather play with swords and hear a
          drum than look upon his schoolmaster.

                         MENENIUS
          On my word, the father's son!
          He and Volumnia laugh.
          Menenius has sensed Virgilia's tension. Tries to cheer her:

                         MENENIUS
          Come, I must have you play the idle
          housewife with me this afternoon.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         VIRGILIA
          No, good sir, I will not out of doors.

                         MENENIUS
          Not out of doors!

                         VOLUMNIA
          She shall, she shall.

                         VIRGILIA
          Indeed, no, by your patience. I'll not
          over the threshold till my lord return
          from the wars.

                         MENENIUS
          Fie, you confine yourself most
          unreasonably.

                         VIRGILIA
          I cannot go hither.

                         MENENIUS

                         (PLAYFULLY)
          You would be another Penelope; yet they
          say all the yarn she spun in Ulysses'
          absence did but fill Ithaca full of
          moths.

                         VIRGILIA
          No, good sir, pardon me; indeed, I will
          not forth.

                         MENENIUS
          Go with me and I'll tell you excellent
          news of your husband.

                         VIRGILIA
          0, good sir, there can be none yet.

                         MENENIUS
          There came news from him last night.
          Volumnia pounces, moving in:

                         VOLUMNIA
          Indeed?

                         MENENIUS
          Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down
          before the Volscian city of Corioles.
          They nothing doubt prevailing and to make
          it brief wars This is true, on mine
          honor; and so, I pray, go out with us.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         VIRGILIA

                         (AGAIN DECLINING)
          Give me excuse, good sir. I will obey you
          in everything hereafter.

                         VOLUMNIA

                         (SNAPS)
          Let her alone. As she is now, she will
          but disease our better mirth.
          She takes Menenius arm and pulls him out, eager for more news
          of her son.
          Virgilia sits for a beat.
          Then she presses a button on the remote control. The TV goes
          on again. More news reports of the war.
          We see images of the Volscian town of Corioles. A "BREAKING
          NEWS" scroll runs across the bottom of the screen The
          Battle for Corioles
          Virgilia watches the war footage, her eyes haunted.
          Hard cut to--

          EXT. CORIOLES - DAY

          BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! A series of explosions jolt us.
          Corioles is a small urban center. Smoke billows up from areas
          of the city. The steady crack and rattle of gunfire. The
          occasional thud of explosions.
          We see urban street-to-street fighting. The images are
          startling in their familiarity: this could be Basra or
          Belfast.
          The battle is photographed in a gritty exposure. Color is
          drained out -- blood is a darker red like oil. Soldiers are
          dark forms moving through shadows and smoke.
          Martius and Titus, leading a platoon of around twenty Roman
          SOLDIERS, run into view and take cover. Bullets zip and snap
          around them.
          The Roman soldiers wear modern battle fatigues and body
          armor, tricked out with all the latest tech gear. The
          Volscians, being a poor guerilla force, wear thrown together
          uniforms that look almost tribal.
          Martius calls over the incessant din of battle to Titus and

                         THE SOLDIERS:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         MARTIUS
          They fear us not, but issue forth their
          city.
          Sniper bullets slam into a wall near him. He coughs away the
          smoke and debris. This only makes him more angry:

                         MARTIUS
          They do disdain us much beyond our
          thoughts,
          Which makes me sweat with wrath!
          He that retires, I'll take him for a
          Volsce,
          And he shall feel mine edge!
          Martius leaps up and races on. The others follow in military
          order.
          The Roman soldiers move along the street -- it is chaotic --
          explosions, smoke and sniper fire -- they duck into doorways
          and behind abandoned cars -- returning fire as best they can--
          Martius leads -- firing stead bursts from his machine gun--
          It is slow and bloody going--
          Finally the Romans turn a corner and are stopped by a
          roadblock: a burning bus that fills the entire street--
          The Volsces use this roadblock to ambush the Roman soldiers--
          We see glimpses of Volscian soldiers darting for position --
          firing from rooftops and from inside shops--

                         BLISTERING CROSSFIRE--

          INT. BLASTED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

          Aufidius runs into a blasted hotel room. Some of his soldiers
          with him.
          He goes to the window. Scans the street below. Sees Martius
          and the others trapped at the bus. He gestures to an aide for

                         A RADIO--

          EXT. CORIOLES-STREET - DAY

          In the face of the crossfire, the Roman soldiers start

                         FALLING BACK--
          Martius refuses to yield -- pushing and shoving his men
          toward the burning bus -- screaming in fury over the noise:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

                         MARTIUS
          You souls of geese,
          That bear the shapes of men! PLUTO AND

          HELL!
          All hurt behind! Backs red, and faces

                         PALE
          With flight and agued fear! Mend and
          charge home,
          Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave

                         THE FOE

          AND MAKE MY WARS ON YOU!
          An EXPLOSION -- dirt and brick shards slash across Martius'
          face -- blood--
          This only pushes his fury to white rage--

                         MARTIUS
          Look to it. Come on!

          FOLLOW ME!
          He leaves his soldiers behind--
          Moves alone to the burning bus and fights his way through the

                         FLAMES--
          Martius is in his own world now. He doesn't even realize he
          is alone. He has become a sort of killing machine. A shark
          moving through the ocean. Ruthless and efficient.
          We become the warrior.
          From Martius' POV:
          We move through disorienting curtains of smoke...
          Continue down the street...
          Firing a heavy machine gun...
          Volscian soldiers contort and die, torn to pieces by the
          bullets...
          The heavy machine gun is empty, we drop it and use a sidearm,
          firing strategic shots...
          Volscian soldiers dart up -- fire -- and die...
          We keep moving steadily forward...
          Shadowy shapes moving nearby, we fire. Killing civilians. The
          fortunes of war...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.
          Strange surreal images. We smash into a house. An OLD MAN
          crouches, terrified, in a corner. He reaches forward. He is
          offering us water. An act of kindness amid the carnage...
          We move on...
          Panicked civilians, scattering in terror...
          Volscian soldiers rush us, attacking, we slam them aside...
          We duck down, roll under a car, emerge and fire...
          More Volscians die...
          We continue forward...
          Then the pistol is empty, we drop it and pull a machete-like
          knife...
          Still moving relentlessly forward...
          Slashing and killing...
          Hand-to-hand now...
          Carnage.

          EXT. CORIOLES-ALLEY - DAY

          Aufidius and his aides are racing down an alley, trying to
          get to Martius--
          Roman fire stops them--
          They return fire as they divert down another alley, trying
          for a better strategic position, running flat out--

          EXT. CORIOLES - LATER

          Titus and the soldiers are still pinned down at the burning
          bus. Two soldiers race back to Titus to report, they dive for
          cover.

                         TITUS
          What is become of Martius?

                         SOLDIER 1
          Slain, sir, doubtless.

                         SOLDIER 2
          He is himself alone,
          To answer all the city.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

                         TITUS
          Thou art lost, Martius...
          Titus has no time to mourn. He looks over the hopeless
          situation. Scanning the rooftops, windows and shops.
          Then he stops He sees something Past the burning bus
          Through the smoke and flames...
          He glimpses a ghostly figure...

                         TITUS
          Who's yonder,
          That does appear as he were flayed?
          0 gods! He has the stamp of Martius.
          It is indeed Martius.
          A shocking sight.
          Drenched head-to-toe in blood.
          His face splattered with gore.
          His eyes wild.
          Lost in something like rapture.

                         MARTIUS
          Come I too late?! Come I too late?!

                         TITUS
          Ay, if you come not in the blood of
          others,
          But mantled in your own.
          Martius laughs wildly and embraces Titus, who comes away
          splattered with blood:

                         MARTIUS
          0, let me clip ye
          In arms as sound as when I wooed, in

                         HEART
          As merry as when our nuptial day was
          done!
          SUDDENLY -- a deafening explosion -- and RPG EXPLODING from
          nearby. Then gunfire. Bullets shatter windows. The Volscians
          are attacking again.
          The Romans instantly begin diving for cover and taking up

                         DEFENSIVE POSITIONS--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.
          Martius scans the location. Sees the attack is coming from an
          old Hilton hotel. Now pockmarked with bullets and artillery
          shells. Most of the windows shattered.
          This is the Volscian stronghold. The last stand. He sees
          flashes of Volscian soldiers moving on the roof and
          balconies, and snipers firing from windows.
          There is an open plaza, littered with bodies and debris, in
          front of the hotel.
          Martius stops scanning with his binoculars--
          Sees Aufidius moving in the hotel, directing the battle--

                         MARTIUS
          There is the man of my soul's hate--

                         AUFIDIUS--
          Piercing our Romans.

                         TITUS
          Worthy sir, thou bleeds.
          Thy exercise hath been too violent
          For a second course of fight.

                         MARTIUS
          Sir, praise me not.
          My work hath yet not warmed me.
          The blood I drop is more medicinal
          Than dangerous to me. To Aufidius thus
          I will appear and fight.
          He turns to some soldiers, imploring them to join him. His
          bloody visage and intensity are strangely inspiring, his

                         FEROCITY INFECTIOUS:

                         MARTIUS

                         (TO SOLDIERS)
          If any such be here-
          As it were sin to doubt - that love this

                         PAINTING
          Wherein you see me smeared; if any fear
          Lesser his person than an ill report;
          If any think brave death outweighs bad
          life,
          And that his country's dearer than

                         HIMSELF;
          Let him alone, or so many so minded,
          Wave thus, to express his disposition,

          AND FOLLOW MARTIUS!
          The soldiers are pumped up -- like Marines straining for

                         COMBAT--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         MARTIUS

          0, ME ALONE! MAKE YOU A SWORD OF ME!

                         THEY BOLT--
          Zigzagging across the plaza toward the hotel--
          Titus and the others provide covering fire--

          EXT. CORIOLES-PLAZA - DAY

          Martius zigzags with his men across the dangerously exposed

                         PLAZA--
          They return fire at the hotel as best they can, but the
          barrage from the Volscians is murderous--
          Roman soldiers contort and fall, blood spraying--
          Bullets snap and ricochet everywhere around them--
          But still they keep up a steady pace, reloading and firing as

                         THEY GO--
          Then Martius is hit--

                         BLOOD SPRAYS--
          But still he keeps on--
          The front of the hotel is closer now--
          Martius and his soldiers race to the hotel and crash into the

                         LOBBY--

          INT. CORIOLES-HOTEL-LOBBY - DAY

          Martius and his soldiers battle the Volscian defenders in the

                         HOTEL LOBBY--
          It is the weird and incongruous nature of modern urban
          warfare: soldiers fighting to the death among hotel couches
          and tatty corporate artwork--
          It is brutal--
          Martius and his soldiers cut a bloody swath across the hotel

                         LOBBY--
          Another HUGE EXPLOSION rocks the hotel -- like a seismic
          blast -- an ugly 1970's chandelier falls--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.
          Martius and his men move into a stairwell--

          INT. CORIOLES-HOTEL-STAIRWELL - DAY

          Martius and his men race up the stairway-
          Volscians are firing down at them--
          Bullets ricochet crazily in the confined stairway, refracting
          from concrete walls and twisting metal railing, sending up
          sparks and clouds of dust--
          Then Martius slows to a stop.
          Looks up.
          Aufidius is on the stairway above. Glaring down at him.
          A long beat as they lock eyes. Both panting for breath in the
          heat of the combat.

                         MARTIUS
          I'll fight with none but thee, for I do
          hate thee.

                         AUFIDIUS
          We hate alike.
          Then Martius does something astounding.
          He holds out his arms to his sides and drops his weapons.
          They clatter down.
          Aufidius does the same.
          The Roman and Volscian soldiers watch.
          None daring to interfere.
          Martius and Aufidius continue to glare at each other --
          dropping weapons -- disarming -- Martius climbing up the
          stairs, Aufidius coming down -- moving closer and closer--
          At an instant-
          They slam together-
          Fighting without weapons--
          Grappling brutally. Tearing at each other. Twining together.
          Fingers grasping. Teeth snapping. Hands pulling.
          It is a bloody, terrible, graceless struggle.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.
          They crash and slam awkwardly in the claustrophobic
          stairwell. Smashing into the walls. Falling from level to

                         LEVEL--

                         THEN--
          Another EXPLOSION rocks the hotel--
          Part of the roof COLLAPSES--
          Concrete SLAMS down--
          A cloud of smoke, dust and debris obscures everything-
          Martius is tossed violently to the ground in the action--
          Aufidius is pulled away by several of his men. They drag him
          to safety. Roman soldiers fire after them. The sound is
          deafening in the confined garage.
          But Aufidius and his comrades disappear into a cloud of dust.
          Gone.
          Martius glares after him. Wipes blood from his eyes.

          INT. CORIOLES-HOTEL-LOBBY - NIGHT

          The hotel lobby has been turned into a hastily assembled
          emergency triage station.
          The moaning and screaming of the injured are constant. Roman
          medics attend to the wounded: administering IVs; arranging
          evacuations; performing battlefield surgery.
          Martius sits, dried blood covering his face, looking over his
          injured and dying soldiers as a medic stitches up a wound in
          his arm. Titus is with him.
          General Cominius enters with several attending officers,
          going to congratulate Martius.

                         COMINIUS
          If I should tell thee over this thy day's
          work,
          Thou would not believe thy deeds.
          Martius is barely listening. His attention is on a YOUNG
          SOLDIER across the room. The Young Soldier is injured, pale
          and thirsty. Dying.

                         COMINIUS
          But I'll report it
          Where Senators shall mingle tears with

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

                         COMINIUS (CONT'D)

                         SMILES;
          Where great patricians shall attend and
          shrug,
          In the end admire and say: "We thank the

                         GODS
          Our Rome hath such a soldier."

                         MARTIUS

                         (SHIFTING PAINFULLY)
          Pray now, no more. My mother,
          When she does praise me, grieves me.
          I have done as you have done - that's
          what I can;
          Induced as you have been - that's for my
          country.
          Martius continues to look at the poor dying soldier.

                         TITUS
          Rome must know
          The value of her own. It were a

                         CONCEALMENT
          Worse than a theft,
          To hide your doings.

                         MARTIUS
          I have some wounds upon me, and they

                         SMART
          To hear themselves remembered.
          The surgeon finishes stitching Martius' arm. Starts to clean
          another wound.

                         COMINIUS
          Should they not,
          Well might they fester against

                         INGRATITUDE
          Too modest are you.
          Impatient, Martius rises, painfully and slowly. He takes his
          canteen and crosses to the Young Soldier. Gives his canteen
          to the boy. The Young Soldier drinks. His deep, sad eyes gaze
          up at Martius.
          Martius watches as...
          The Young Soldier dies. The light goes from his eyes. His
          head hangs awkwardly. His boyish face is leaden.
          Martius suddenly finds himself exhausted. Morally and
          physically spent.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

                         MARTIUS

                         (TO COMINIUS)
          I will go wash;
          And when my face is fair, you shall

                         PERCEIVE
          Whether I blush or no Howbeit,
          thank you.
          Martius stares at the dead soldier.

          EXT. CORIOLES-STREET - NIGHT

          Aufidius and some of his Volscian soldiers, bloody and
          filthy, are on foot.
          They are moving through the outskirts of Corioles, leaving
          the city. Exhausted after the long and failed battle.
          Fires burn from blasted shops and homes. The Romans have
          clearly laid waste to this part of the city.
          There is a minivan stopped ahead of them. Bullets holes
          everywhere. Bodies inside.
          They walk to it. Aufidius looks in. A dead family. Father,
          mother, kids in the back. Bloody toys on the floor of the
          minivan.
          Roman atrocities.
          Aufidius gazes at the bodies. His face hardens.
          He whispers to himself:

                         AUFIDIUS
          Five times, Martius,
          I have fought with thee; so often hast
          thou beat me,
          And would do so, I think, should we

                         ENCOUNTER
          As often as we eat.
          He becomes aware some of his men are looking at him,
          disturbed at his fervor.

                         AUFIDIUS

                         FOR WHERE
          I thought to crush him in an equal force,
          True sword to sword, I'll stab him some
          way,
          Or wrath -- or craft -- may get him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

                         SOLDIER
          He's the devil.

                         AUFIDIUS
          Bolder, though not so subtle.
          A beat. Aufidius continues with prayer-like intensity:

                         AUFIDIUS
          My valor, poisoned with him,
          Shall fly out of itself ...
          Nor sleep, nor sanctuary, being naked,
          Sick, the prayers of priests,
          Nor times of sacrifice,
          Shall lift up their rotten privilege
          And custom,
          Against my hate to Martius.
          In the shattered glass of the minivan window, Aufidius
          suddenly sees himself.
          He studies his own face, nurturing his dark thoughts.

                         AUFIDIUS
          Where I find him, were it
          At home, upon my brother's guard, even
          there,
          Will I wash my fierce hand in his heart.

          INT. POLITICO BAR - DAY

          Back in Rome, we are at a comfortable restaurant/bar near the
          Senate where politicians gather to eat, drink, gossip and
          conspire. The business of state is conducted over steak and
          martinis.
          Comfortable red leather booths. Wooden panelling.
          Two Tribunes -- Senators chosen to speak for the people --
          are having lunch.
          BRUTUS is a large man in a rumpled grey suit; a sweating bear
          with a taste for bare-knuckle politics. SICINIUS is smaller
          and vulpine; crafty and cold.
          Both are ambitious politicos used to manipulating the people
          and the press for their personal ends. With them sits
          Cassius, the political agitator we met before.
          The TV over the bar shows images of Martius' victory:
          parading Roman troops; Volscian prisoners; flags; adoring
          crowds; triumphant slogans; "Mission Accomplished."

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

                         SICINIUS
          Was ever man so proud as is this Martius?

                         CASSIUS
          He has no equal.

                         SICINIUS
          When we were chosen Tribunes for the

                         PEOPLE-

                         BRUTUS
          Marked you his lip and eyes?

                         SICINIUS
          Nay, but his taunts.
          They see Senator Menenius approaching. Sicinius nods to
          Cassius, who quickly goes.
          Menenius stops by on his way out. He is jolly, knowing the
          victory will assure his protege's political future:

                         MENENIUS
          The augurer tells me we shall have news
          tonight.

                         BRUTUS
          Good or bad?

                         MENENIUS
          Not according to the prayer of the
          people, for they love not Martius.

                         SICINIUS
          Nature teaches beasts to know their
          friends.

                         MENENIUS
          You blame Martius for being proud?

                         BRUTUS
          We do it not alone, sir.
          Subtly, the polite chit-chat is turning more serious and
          pointed; Menenius growing sharper. The gloves are coming off.

                         MENENIUS
          I know you can do very little alone
          You talk of pride: 0 that you could turn
           your eyes toward the napes of your necks,
           and make but an interior survey of your
          good selves! 0 that you could!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.

                         BRUTUS
          What then, sir?

                         MENENIUS
          Why, then you should discover a brace of
          unmeriting, proud, violent, testy
          magistrates, alias fools, as any in Rome.
          The saturnine Sicinius' response seems almost a threat:

                         SICINIUS
          Menenius, you are known well enough too.

                         MENENIUS
          I am known to be a humorous patrician,
          and one that loves a cup of hot wine with
          not a drop of allaying water in it; one
          that converses more with the buttock of
          the night than with the forehead of the
          morning. What I think I utter, and spend
          my malice in my breath.

                         BRUTUS
          Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.

                         MENENIUS
          You know neither me, yourselves nor
          anything You are ambitious.
          A tense beat. They are formidable adversaries.

                         MENENIUS
          Good-e'en to your worships. More of your
          conversation would infect my brain, being
          the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians
          I will be bold to take my leave of you.
          He goes. The Tribunes watch him cut through the lunch crowd
          and exit.

          EXT. SENATE - DAY

          The Roman Senate is constructed with classical symmetry and
          clean, square lines. Probably the most striking and beautiful
          building in Rome.

          INT. SENATE-CORRIDOR - DAY

          Volumnia, Virgilia and Menenius are hurrying down a corridor,
          excited. All are well-dressed, for an important public event.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

                         VOLUMNIA
          Honorable Menenius, my boy Martius
          approaches! For the love of Juno, let's
          go.

                         MENENIUS
          Is he not wounded? He was wont to come
          home wounded.

                         VIRGILIA
          0, no, no, no...

                         VOLUMNIA

                         (VICTORIOUSLY)
          0, he is wounded! I thank the gods for
          it.

                         MENENIUS
          So do I too -- if it be not too much.
          Brings a victory in his pocket, the
          wounds become him. Has he disciplined
          Aufidius soundly?

                         VOLUMNIA
          Titus Lartius says they fought together,
          but Aufidius got off.

                         VIRGILIA
          In truth, there's wondrous things spoke
          of him. Gods grant them true.

                         VOLUMNIA
          (an exhalation of scorn)
          True?!

                         MENENIUS
          I'll be sworn they are true. Where is he
          wounded?
          Volumnia and Menenius now gleefully add up her son's wounds
          like accountants -- or campaign managers.

                         VOLUMNIA
          In the shoulder and in the left arm.
          There will be large scars to show the
          people, when he shall stand for his place
          He received in the repulse of Tarquin
          seven hurts in the body.

                         MENENIUS
          One in the neck, and two in the thigh -
          there's nine that I know.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         31

                         VOLUMNIA
          He had, before this last expedition,
          twenty-five wounds upon him.

                         MENENIUS
          Now it's twenty-seven. Every gash was an
          enemy's grave.
          We focus on Volumnia's face as she thinks about her son.

                         VOLUMNIA

                         BEFORE HIM
          He carries noise, and behind him he
          leaves tears.
          Death, that dark spirit, in his nervy arm

                         DOTH LIE;
          Which, being advanced, declines, and then
          men die.
          They hurry to the stop of a grand staircase, where there are
          people waiting...

          INT. SENATE-STAIRS - DAY

          They join Cominius and other dignitaries at the top of a
          majestic stairway.
          An honor guard of Roman soldiers in dress uniforms are
          waiting. Roman flags flutter. All very ceremonial.
          Martius enters below. The honor guard snaps to attention.
          Martius -- hereafter called Coriolanus -- slowly begins to
          cross to the steps. We see that walking is very difficult
          for him. His wounds are severe and every movement is agony.
          He has paid a steep price for his victory.
          Photographers flash photos and a TV crew film the ceremony.
          Coriolanus finally reaches the steps leading up. He takes a
          breath and slowly begins to climb the stairs, each step a
          challenge.
          Volumnia looks down on him. Unmoved by his pain.
          Virgilia is distraught.
          As Coriolanus slowly hauls himself up the last few steps,
          General Cominius speaks into a cluster of microphones and
          addresses the press:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

                         COMINIUS
          Be it known,
          As to us, to all the world, that Caius

                         MARTIUS
          Wears this war's garland And from
          this time,
          For what he did before Corioles, call
          him,
          With all the applause and clamor of the
          host,
          "Caius Martius Coriolanus!"

                         (TO MARTIUS)
          Bear the addition nobly ever!
          The soldiers salute in a grim sort of chant:

                         SOLDIERS
          Caius Martius Coriolanus!
          Coriolanus has reached the podium. An awkward beat. Cominius
          gestures for him to speak into the microphones.
          He tersely does so:

                         CORIOLANUS
          No more of this; it does offend my heart.
          Pray now, no more.
          An awkward silence. Cominius elegantly tries to covers the

                         MOMENT:

                         COMINIUS
          Look, sir, your mother.

                         CORIOLANUS

          0,
          You have, I know, petitioned all the gods
          For my prosperity.
          He kneels to her -- slowly, with great difficulty -- she lets
          him.

                         VOLUMNIA
          Nay, my good soldier, up.
          (he slowly rises)
          My gentle Martius, worthy Caius, and
          By deed-achieving honor newly named -
          What is it? - Coriolanus must I call
          thee?
          She laughs coquettishly, thoroughly upstaging her son.
          Then, almost an afterthought:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         VOLUMNIA
          But, 0, thy wife...
          Coriolanus greets Virgilia with the clumsy and stiff
          formality that marks their marriage.

                         CORIOLANUS
          My gracious silence, hail.
          An awkwardly tender kiss. He notes her tears. Reacts coldly.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Would thou have laughed had I come
          coffined home,
          That weeps to see me triumph? Ay, my
          dear,
          Such eyes the widows in Corioles wear,
          And mothers that lack sons.

                         MENENIUS
          Now, the gods crown thee!

                         CORIOLANUS
          (greets him warmly)
          And live you yet?

                         VOLUMNIA

                         (LAUGHS)
          I know not where to turn. 0, welcome
          home!
          And welcome, general. And you're welcome
          all!

                         MENENIUS
          A hundred thousand welcomes!
          Coriolanus is surrounded by well-wishers and political
          admirers. Volumnia and Menenius usher him along.
          We see the image from TV: The noble warrior returned home.
          Devoted family. Flags waving. The future golden.

          INT. VILLA-BATHROOM - EVENING

          And then the hard reality.
          Coriolanus' body is a battleground of scars. Some are livid
          and red, fresh and still oozing blood. Others are pale and
          blue, discolored and dead.
          His body is something monstrous. Stitched up. Patched
          together. Slashed around. Frankenstein's monster.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.
          He is leaning against a sink, stripped naked. His muscular if
          shattered body exposed.
          Volumnia sits and dresses her son's wounds. As she always has
          done. As she always will.
          It is a disturbing, intimate image.

                         CORIOLANUS
          The good Senators must be visited;
          From whom I have received not only
          greetings,
          But with them change of honors.
          He shifts painfully as she continues to treat one of his
          wounds.

                         VOLUMNIA
          I have lived
          To see inherited my very wishes
          And the buildings of my fancy. Only
          There's one thing wanting, which I doubt

                         NOT BUT
          Our Rome will cast upon thee.
          He catches her eye in the mirror, very firm:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Know, good mother,
          I had rather be their servant in my way,
          Than sway with them in theirs.
          They stop when--
          Virgilia enters.
          She stops in the doorway. It is embarrassing for her, as if
          she has interrupted two lovers. A long moment.
          She looks to her husband.
          To Volumnia.
          They stare back.
          There is no way she can compete with their intimacy.
          Surrendering, she silently goes.

          INT. VILLA -- HALLWAY - EVENING

          Virgilia wanders a long hallway, past a fine collection of
          antique Roman weaponry. She seems lost.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.
          She stops and opens a door, glances into her son's bedroom:
          Young Martius is asleep.
          Her eyes move across his room. The military toys. The little
          cadet uniform carefully hung. The polished boots waiting.
          All stern and joyless. Not like a child's room at all.
          Virgilia closes the door and continues down the long hallway,
          disappearing into darkness.

          INT. SENATE-OFFICE - DAY

          Darkened office. Brutus and Sicinius sit, heads together,
          focused.

                         SICINIUS
          He cannot temperately transport his
          honors, but will
          Lose those he hath won.

                         BRUTUS
          I heard him swear,
          Were he to stand for Consul, never would

                         HE
          Appear in the marketplace nor
          Showing, as the manner is, his wounds
          To the people, beg "their stinking
          breaths."

                         SICINIUS
          It was his word.

          INT. SENATE-CORRIDOR - DAY

          Brutus and Sicinius continue as they hurry to the Senate

                         CHAMBER:

                         BRUTUS
          So it must fall out with him,
          Or our authorities at an end.

                         SICINIUS
          We must suggest to the people in what

                         HATRED
          He still hath held them.

                         BRUTUS

                         (SHUSHING HIM)
          Peace...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.
          They enter the Senate Chamber...

          INT. SENATE CHAMBER - DAY

          Brutus and Sicinius make their way to their seats as we hear:

          MENENIUS (V.0.)
          It remains,
          As the main point of this our after-
          meeting,
          To gratify his noble service that
          Hath thus stood for his country...
          The interior of the grand Senate is an airy, sweeping chamber
          that suggests the Israeli Knesset or U.N. General Assembly.
          Again, classical symmetry is the rule with tiers of seats
          facing a central dais. An imposing piece of outdated modern
          art suggesting the might of Rome looms over the chamber like
          a bird of prey.
          Network TV cameras purr quietly from a corner.
          Menenius, Cominius, Coriolanus and several other politicos
          are seating at a central table on the dais, facing the rows
          of SENATORS.
          Menenius is standing at a podium, speaking into a microphone:

                         MENENIUS
          Therefore, please you,
          Most reverend and grave elders, to desire
          The present Consul, and last general
          In our well-found successes, to report
          A little of that worthy work performed
          By Caius Martius Coriolanus.

                         SENATOR
          Speak, good Cominius.
          General Cominius rises and moves to the podium.
          But then Coriolanus abruptly stands--

                         MENENIUS
          Nay, keep your place.

                         SENATOR
          Sit, Coriolanus. Never shame to hear
          What you have nobly done.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Your honors' pardon.
          I had rather have my wounds to heal again
          Than hear say how I got them.

                         MENENIUS
          Pray now, sit down.

                         CORIOLANUS
          I had rather have one scratch my head in

                         THE SUN
          When the alarum were struck than idly sit
          To hear my nothings monstered.
          Coriolanus moves across the dais and exits into a hallway.
          The door shuts after him.
          Menenius sighs. Nods to Cominius.
          Cominius moves to the podium and begins to read his speech
          from a Teleprompter. This all has the rehearsed quality of a
          campaign nomination speech.

                         COMINIUS
          The deeds of Coriolanus
          Should not be uttered feebly. It is held
          That valor is the chiefest virtue, and
          Most dignifies the haver. Alone he

                         ENTERED
          The mortal gate of the city,
          And struck Corioles like a planet,
          From face to foot
          He was a thing of blood...
          Brutus and Sicinius exchange a glance, bored by the political
          boilerplate.

          INT. SENATE-SERVICE CORRIDOR - DAY

          Meanwhile, Coriolanus stands in the service corridor beyond
          the chamber. Green industrial walls. Ugly fluorescent lights
          above.
          He leans against a wall, alone with his thoughts.
          Cominius' voice can be heard droning inside.
          Then Coriolanus glances up. A CUSTODIAN is pushing a garbage
          can down the long corridor. He stops when he sees Coriolanus.
          Coriolanus' cool, uncompromising stare makes the Custodian
          uneasy. He turns around and goes back.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.
          Coriolanus waits. His face strangely vacant.
          He flexes his wounded arm. It hurts.
          He hears Cominius finish. A good round of applause. He hears
          his name being cheered: "Coriolanus!"
          Coriolanus closes his eyes, steels himself, and then re-
          enters the chamber...

          INT. SENATE CHAMBER - DAY

          Menenius greets him and escorts him to the podium for his
          "acceptance speech."

                         MENENIUS
          The Senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased
          To make thee Consul!
          Menenius steps back.
          A beat.
          Coriolanus stares at the Senators. At the TV cameras.
          He leans awkwardly into the podium microphone:

                         CORIOLANUS
          I do owe them still
          My life and services.
          A beat.
          For an acceptance speech, rather terse. Menenius jumps in to
          salvage the moment:

                         MENENIUS
          It then remains
          That you do speak to the people.

                         CORIOLANUS
          I do beseech you,
          Let me overleap that custom, for I cannot

                         ENTREAT THEM
          For my wounds' sake to give their
          suffrage.
          Please you that I may pass this doing.
          From the Senate floor, Sicinius jumps on this:

                         SICINIUS
          Sir, the people
          Must have their voices!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.
          The Senators, led by Brutus, clamor their agreement.
          Tradition must be obeyed.

                         MENENIUS
          (calming, to Coriolanus)
          Pray you, go fit you to the custom.

                         CORIOLANUS
          It is a part
          That I shall blush in acting, and might

                         WELL
          Be taken from the people.
          Menenius quickly turns off Coriolanus' microphone.

                         BRUTUS

                         (TO SICINIUS)
          Mark you that?

                         CORIOLANUS
          To brag unto them "Thus I did, and thus!"
          Show them the unaching scars which I
          should hide,
          As if I had received them for the hire
          Of their breath only!
          Menenius sees Coriolanus is getting angry, this could be
          disastrous.
          He elegantly gestures for Cominius to escort Coriolanus out
          immediately -- as he addresses the Senators and TV cameras:

                         MENENIUS
          To our noble Consul
          Wish we all joy and honor!
          He applauds. The applause is taken up by the Senators. Some
          cheering as well for the hero of Rome The two Tribunes,
          however, are already whispering maliciously to other
          Senators.
          Menenius seems pleased with the general response. So far, so
          good.

          INT. VILLA -- LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Volumnia is pleased as well.
          She sits, watching the events unfold on TV.
          The sound of the cheering fades as we go to...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

          INT. MENENIUS' LIMO - DAY

          The limousine winds through the pedestrian traffic toward the
          Roman marketplace.
          Coriolanus sits with Menenius. Coriolanus is both angry and
          embarrassed. He is wearing a sharp business suit.

                         MENENIUS
          Have you not known
          The worthiest men have done it?

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (AGREES)
          Custom calls me to it.
          What custom wills, in all things should
          we do...
          What must I say?
          "Look, sir, my wounds.
          I got them in my country's service."

                         MENENIUS
          O me, the gods!
          You must not speak like that. You must

                         DESIRE THEM
          To think upon you--

                         CORIOLANUS
          "Think upon me"? Hang 'em!
          I would they would forget me.

                         MENENIUS
          You'll mar all!
          The limo stops. They are at the marketplace. The moment has
          come.
          Menenius takes a breath. Urges calm:

                         MENENIUS
          Pray you, speak to them, I pray you,
          In wholesome manner.

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (SOURLY)
          Bid them wash their faces
          And keep their teeth clean.
          He leaves the car.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

          EXT. MARKETPLACE - DAY

          The commercial heart of Rome. A large town square, since
          antiquity used as a marketplace.
          But now it is filled with tatty stalls selling cheap purses
          and knock-off watches. Paltry fruit stands alongside shabby
          souvenir stalls.
          Advertising billboards surround and pollute the square --
          SONY. COKE. NIKE. MCDONALDS -- obscuring any classical
          architecture that might have survived.
          Tamora and Cassius, the political activists, are in the
          crowd. They watch closely.
          Coriolanus slowly walks to the center of the marketplace. He
          stands, feeling ridiculous and not at all humble.
          He looks around.
          Waiting for something to happen.
          The CUSTOMERS and SHOPKEEPERS just look back at him. Some are
          curious. Some are amused. Some hostile and most indifferent.
          But no one approaches.
          Then Coriolanus understands. He must g to them: beg for
          votes.
          He prepares himself and then slowly moves through the various
          stalls, weaving in and out. Trying to maintain his dignity.
          He sees the Citizens from before and goes to them. We glimpse
          Brutus and Sicinius amongst the crowd.

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (TO CASSIUS)
          You know the cause, sir, of my standing
          here.

                         CASSIUS
          We do, sir. Tell us what hath brought you
          to it.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Mine own desert.

                         TAMORA
          Your own desert?

                         CORIOLANUS
          Ay, but not mine own desire.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         TAMORA
          How not your own desire?

                         CORIOLANUS
          No, it was never my desire yet to trouble
          the poor with begging.

                         CASSIUS
          You must think, if we give you anything,
          we hope to gain by you.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Well then, I pray, your price of the
          Consulship?

                         WAR VET
          The price is to ask it kindly.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Kindly, sir, I pray, let me have it. I
          have wounds to show you, which shall be
          yours in private Your good voice,
          sir. What say you?

                         WAR VET

                         (IMPRESSED)
          You shall have it, worthy sir.

                         CORIOLANUS
          A match, sir. There's in all two worthy
          voices begged. I have your alms. Adieu.
          Business done, so he thinks, Coriolanus crisply moves on.
          Cassius is not convinced.

                         CASSIUS
          But this is something odd.
          Coriolanus continues on. He sees a large JAMAICAN WOMAN with
          her CHILDREN, carrying plastic grocery bags, talking to a
          SHOPKEEPER. He goes to them:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Pray you now, if it may stand with the
          tune of your voices that I may be Consul.

                         JAMAICAN WOMAN
          You have deserved nobly of your country,
          and you have not deserved nobly.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Your enigma?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         JAMAICAN WOMAN
          You have been a scourge to her enemies;
          you have been a rod to her friends
          You have not indeed loved the common
          people.

                         CORIOLANUS
          You should account me the more virtuous
          that I have not been common in my love
          Therefore, beseech you, I may be
          Consul.

                         SHOPKEEPER
          We hope to find you our friend, and
          therefore give you our voices heartily.

                         JAMAICAN WOMAN
          You have received many wounds for your
          country.

                         CORIOLANUS
          I will not seal your knowledge with
          showing them. I will make much of your
          voices, and so trouble you no farther.

                         JAMAICAN WOMAN
          The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!
          Coriolanus is warming to the task, it's easier than he
          thought. He moves to a central, open area and declares

                         PUBLICLY:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Your voices! For your voices I have

                         FOUGHT;
          Watched for your voices; for your voices

                         BEAR
          Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice

                         SIX
          I have seen and heard of!
          A crowd is gathering. We note Brutus and Sicinius in the
          crowd. Menenius, too, has moved in.

                         CORIOLANUS
          For your voices
          Have done many things, some less, some
          more.
          Your voices! Indeed, I would be Consul.

                         WAR VET
          He has done nobly, and cannot go without
          any honest man's voice!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

          RACE TRACK TOUT
          Therefore let him be Consul!

                         JAMAICAN WOMAN
          The gods give him joy, and make him good
          friend to the people!
          The Citizens applaud and give their support:

                         CITIZENS
          Amen, amen. God save thee, noble Consul!

                         CORIOLANUS
          Worthy voices!
          Menenius, with Brutus and Sicinius, goes to him:

                         MENENIUS
          You have stood your limitation, and the

                         TRIBUNES
          Endue you with the people's voice.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Is this done?

                         SICINIUS
          The custom of request you have
          discharged.
          The people do admit you, and are summoned
          To meet anon upon your approbation.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Where? At the Senate?

                         SICINIUS
          There, Coriolanus.

                         MENENIUS
          I'll keep you company.

                         (TO BRUTUS)
          Will you along?

                         BRUTUS

                         (DECLINES)
          We stay here for the people.
          Coriolanus and Menenius go, relieved the trial is over.
          Brutus and Sicinius, however, have work to do. This has not
          gone as they wanted. They are urgent:

                         SICINIUS
          How now, my masters! Have you chose this
          man?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         CASSIUS

                         (RUEFULLY)
          He has our voices, sir.

                         BRUTUS
          We pray the gods he may deserve your
          loves.

                         TAMORA
          Amen, sir. To my poor unworthy notice,
          He mocked us when he begged our voices.

                         CASSIUS

                         CERTAINLY
          He flouted us downright.

                         JAMAICAN WOMAN
          No, it is his kind of speech; he did not
          mock us.

                         TAMORA

                         (SHARPLY)
          He should have showed us
          His marks of merit, wounds received for's
          country.

                         SICINIUS
          Why, so he did, I am sure.

                         TAMORA
          No, no! No one saw them!

                         CASSIUS
          (inciting the crowd)
          Was not this mockery?
          Brutus presses hard:

                         BRUTUS
          When he had no power,
          But was a petty servant to the state,
          He was your enemy, ever spake against
          Your liberties.

                         SICINIUS
          Did you perceive
          He did solicit you in free contempt
          When he did need your loves, and do you

                         THINK
          That his contempt shall not be bruising

                         TO YOU
          When he hath power to crush?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.
          Cassius and Tamora carefully lead the crowd in expressing
          growing alarm and resistance to Coriolanus:

                         CASSIUS
          He's not confirmed; we may deny him yet!

                         TAMORA
          And will deny him!
          I'll have five hundred voices of that
          sound.

                         CASSIUS
          I twice five hundred and their friends!
          The crowd roars approval. A frightening, animal sound.

                         SICINIUS
          Let them assemble,
          And on a safer judgment all revoke
          Your ignorant election.

                         BRUTUS
          Enforce his pride,
          And his old hate unto you!

                         SICINIUS
          And presently, when you have drawn your
          number,
          Repair to the Capitol.

                         CASSIUS
          We will so!

                         TAMORA
          We will so! All
          Repent in their election!
          Cassius and Tamora lead the crowd. It is a terrifying
          spectacle of sudden mob rage, only a razor-thin edge to
          violence.
          Brutus and Sicinius watch, satisfied, like Robespierre and
          Saint Just looking over the bloody guillotine.

          INT. SENATE-CORRIDOR - DAY

          Coriolanus, dressed again in his familiar uniform, emerges
          from an antechamber with his comrade Titus.
          Menenius, General Cominius and several pro-Coriolanus
          Senators follow them. They stride down the corridor.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (TO TITUS)
           Tullus Aufidius then has assembled a new
          army?

                         TITUS
          He has, my lord.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Saw you Aufidius?

                         TITUS
          He is retired to Antium.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Spoke he of me?

                         TITUS
          He did, my lord.

                         CORIOLANUS
          How? What?

                         TITUS
          How often he had met you, sword to sword;
          That of all things upon the earth he

                         HATED
          Your person most.

                         CORIOLANUS
          At Antium lives he?

                         TITUS
          At Antium.

                         CORIOLANUS
          I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
          To oppose his hatred fully.
          They hear the growing rumble of a crowd. Curious.
          They continue on and turn a corner to...

          INT. SENATE-CENTRAL LOBBY - DAY

          The central lobby of the Senate is an open, airy space.
          Through the glass doors at the front of the lobby an unruly
          crowd can be seen gathering. Police. Barricades.
          Sicinius and Brutus are waiting to intercept them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (TO TITUS)
          Behold, these are the Tribunes of the
          people,
          The tongues of the common mouth.

                         SICINIUS
          Pass no further.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Ha! What is that?

                         BRUTUS
          It will be dangerous to go on. No
          further.

                         CORIOLANUS
          What makes this change?

                         MENENIUS
          The matter?

                         COMINIUS
          Hath he not passed the nobles and the
          commons?

                         BRUTUS
          Cominius, no.
          Coriolanus steps closer to Brutus. The mob sees him through
          the glass doors. The tension immediately increases.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Have I had children's voices?

                         TITUS
          Tribunes, give way.

                         BRUTUS
          The people are incensed against him.

                         CORIOLANUS
          (glancing to the growing

                         CROWD)
          Are these your herd?

                         MENENIUS
          Be calm, be calm.

                         BRUTUS
          The people cry you mocked them, and of
          late called them
          Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to
          nobleness.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

                         CORIOLANUS
          But this was known before.

                         SICINIUS
          You show too much of that
          For which the people stir. If you will

                         PASS
          To where you are bound, you must inquire
          your way.
          The crowd outside is growing restless, sensing and responding
          to the building tension. The police try to hold them back,
          keeping them away from the doors. The crowd presses in.
          We see Cassius and Tamora at the forefront, urging the crowd
          on.

                         MENENIUS
          Let's be calm--

                         COMINIUS
          The people are abused, set on--

                         MENENIUS
          Not now, not now--

                         TITUS
          Not in this heat, sir--
          Coriolanus strides angrily toward the doors and exits--
          The others follow--

          EXT. SENATE-COURTYARD - DAY

          Coriolanus launches himself into the crowd with blistering

                         ANGER:

                         CORIOLANUS
          My nobler friends, I crave their pardons.
          For the mutable, rank-scented crowd,
          Let them regard me as I do not flatter,
          And therein behold themselves. I say
          again,
          In soothing them, we nourish against our

                         SENATE
          The cockle of rebellion, insolence,
          sedition,
          Which we ourselves have ploughed for,
          sowed, and scattered,
          By mingling them with us!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         MENENIUS
          Well, no more!

                         TITUS
          No more words, we beseech you--
          The mob has surrounded them all by now.
          The police are getting nervous, eyes darting uneasily from
          the unruly crowd to the volatile men.
          This all has the potential of sparking to violence.
          We note a TV news crew moving into position, covering the
          action. Others film with cell phone cameras. We intercut some
          of this footage.

                         BRUTUS
          (to Coriolanus, provoking)
          You speak of the people
          As if you were a god to punish, not
          A man of their infirmity.

                         SICINIUS
          It were well we let the people know it.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
          By Jove, it would be my mind!

                         SICINIUS
          It is a mind
          That shall remain a poison where it is,
          Not poison any further.

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (EXPLODES)
          "Shall remain"!
          Hear you this Triton of the minnows? Mark

                         YOU
          His absolute "shall"?

                         BRUTUS
          Why, should the people give
          One that speaks thus their voice?

                         CORIOLANUS
          I'll give my reasons,
          More worthier than their voices!
          Menenius tries to pull him away, Coriolanus shakes free and
          continues the attack:

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         51

                         CORIOLANUS
          By Jove himself,
          It makes the consuls base; and my soul

                         ACHES
          To know, when two authorities are up,
          Neither supreme, how soon confusion,
          May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
          The one by the other.
          The crowd roars angrily -- Coriolanus spins on them:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Thus we debase the nature of our seats,
          and make the rabble
          Call our cares fears; which will in time
          Break ope the locks of the Senate, and

                         BRING IN
          The crows to peck the eagles!

                         MENENIUS
          Come, enough!

                         BRUTUS
          Enough, with over-measure.

                         SICINIUS
          (calls to the mob)
          He has spoken like a traitor, and shall

                         ANSWER
          As traitors do!
          At the word "traitor" Coriolanus loses all reason, he is

                         FIRE:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Thou wretch, despite overwhelm thee!

                         BRUTUS
          Manifest treason!

                         SICINIUS
          This is a Consul? No!

                         CORIOLANUS
          Hence, old goat!
          Coriolanus grabs Sicinius roughly and flings him aside--
          At this -- the crowd ROARS in outrage -- the TV crews hustle

                         FOR POSITION--
          Menenius pulls Coriolanus off:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

                         MENENIUS
          On both sides more respect!

                         SICINIUS
          (calling to the crowd)
          Here's he that would take from you all
          your power!
          The crowd reacts angrily -- surging forward against the
          restraint of the police.
          We see grim RIOT POLICE marching into position. The crowd is
          not intimidated, they are spoiling for a fight.
          The Tribunes provoke the crowd even more, escalating and
          building the fever:

                         BRUTUS
          You are at point to lose your liberties!
          Martius would have all from you, Martius,
          Whom late you have named for Consul.

                         SICINIUS
          What is the city but the people?!

                         TAMORA
          True! The people are the city!

                         SICINIUS
          We do here pronounce, upon the part of
          the people,
          Martius is worthy of present DEATH!
          A huge roar from the mob. Panic and violence building. Fast

                         AND OVERLAPPING:

                         BRUTUS
          Guards, seize him!

                         CORIOLANUS
          No, I'll die here!

                         BRUTUS
          Lay hands upon him!

                         SICINIUS
          (to the crowd)

          HELP, YE CITIZENS!
          At his cue--
          The civil violence threatened from the opening moments of
          this story finally EXPLODES--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.
          With Cassius and Tamora in the forefront, the crowd attacks

                         THE POLICE--
          Riot Police march in, slamming ahead with riot shields and

                         TRUNCHEONS--
          The mob fights back with anything at hand -- some are armed
          with clubs and knives, others snatch up garbage cans and
          newspaper vending machines, throwing them, smashing windows,
          battling the police, kicking and punching and screaming--
          It is civil disobedience. But it is also drunken, thug
          violence. Terrifying in its intensity--
          Menenius gets Titus and Cominius to hustle Coriolanus away--

                         MENENIUS
          Go, get you to your house! Be gone, away!
          All will be naught else--

                         COMINIUS
          Come, sir, along with us--
          They hurry Coriolanus away--
          The Riot Police, outnumbered, start firing TEAR GAS into the

                         CROWD--

                         SCREAMS--
          TV news crew filming--
          Chaotic, flurried violence--
          Shaky TV images, cell phone video--
          Choking, acrid gas--
          It is a terrifying descent into public madness as all order
          breaks down.
          Rome is bloody.

          INT. SENATE-OFFICE - DUSK

          Menenius and the Tribunes are gathered in a darkened office
          for some high-stakes politicking.
          Tamora, her face bloody from the riot, is with them. So too
          some supporters on either side.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

                         MENENIUS

                         (URGENTLY)
          As I do know the Consul's worthiness,
          So can I name his faults--

                         SICINIUS
          Consul! What Consul?

                         MENENIUS
          The Consul Coriolanus.

                         BRUTUS
          He Consul?!

                         SICINIUS
          It is decreed
          He dies tonight.

                         TAMORA
          He's a disease that must be cut away.

                         MENENIUS
          0, he's a limb that has but a disease:
          Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.
          What has he done to Rome that's worth his
          death? Eh?
          Killing our enemies?!
          He sees that his words are having some effect, he presses the

                         POINT:

                         MENENIUS
          The blood he hath lost --
          He dropped it for his country.
          Some in the room murmur agreement.

                         BRUTUS
          We'll hear no more--

                         MENENIUS
          Consider this: he has been bred in the

                         WARS
          Since he could draw a sword, and is ill

                         SCHOOLED
          In graceful language Give me leave,
          I'll go to him, and undertake to bring

                         HIM
          Where he shall answer by a lawful form,
          In peace, to his utmost peril.

                         PRO-CORIOLANUS SENATOR
          Noble tribunes,
          It is the humane way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

                         ANOTHER SENATOR
          The other course
          Will prove too bloody, and the end of it
          Unknown to the beginning.
          Sicinius is about to retort when Brutus stops him.
          Brutus assents, assuming the voice of reason:

                         BRUTUS
          Be you then as the people's officer.
          Menenius and Coriolanus' supporters are relieved.

                         BRUTUS
          If you bring not Martius, we'll proceed
          In our first way.

                         MENENIUS
          I'll bring him to you.
          He goes quickly.
          Brutus turns to Sicinius and Tamora and begins to quietly
          explain his plan.

          INT. MARTIUS VILLA-CORRIDOR - DAY

          Coriolanus strides angrily down a long corridor, in and out
          of shafts of light, seething to Titus:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Let them pull all about mine ears,

                         PRESENT ME
          Death on the wheel or at wild horses'
          heels,
          Yet will I still be thus to them--!

                         TITUS

                         MARTIUS--

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (CONTINUING UNABATED)
          I muse my mother
          Does not approve me further!
          He slams through a door to the living room...

          INT. VILLA -- LIVING ROOM - DAY

          And stomps to confront his mother, who is currently
          conspiring with Menenius and a few Senators.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         CORIOLANUS
          (to Volumnia, angrily)
          I talk of you!
          Why did you wish me milder? Would you

                         HAVE ME
          False to my nature? Rather say I play
          The man I am!
          She is equally tough with him, not giving an inch, snapping

                         RIGHT BACK:

                         VOLUMNIA
          0, sir, sir, sir,
          I would have had you put your power well
          on,
          Before you had worn it out.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Let go!

                         VOLUMNIA
          You might have been enough the man you
          are,
          With striving less to be so!

                         CORIOLANUS
          Let them hang!

                         VOLUMNIA
          Av, and burn too!
          Her outraged fury matches his. Overpowers his.

                         MENENIUS

                         (TO CORIOLANUS)
          Come, come, you have been too rough,
          something too rough.
          You must return and mend it.
          Coriolanus turns away.

                         VOLUMNIA
          Pray, be counseled.
          I have a heart as little apt as yours,
          But yet a brain that leads my use of

                         ANGER
          To better vantage.

                         MENENIUS
          Well said, noble woman!

                         CORIOLANUS
          What must I do?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         MENENIUS
          Return to the Tribunes.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Well, what then? What then?

                         MENENIUS
          Repent what you have spoke.

                         CORIOLANUS
          For them? I cannot do it to the gods.
          Must I then do it to them?

                         VOLUMNIA
          You are too absolute,
          Though therein you can never be too
          noble.

                         CORIOLANUS
          (upset, walking away)
          Why force you this?
          She pursues him:

                         VOLUMNIA
          Because that now it lies you on to speak
          To the people, not by your own
          instruction,
          Nor by the matter which your heart
          prompts you,
          But with such words that are but

                         REHEARSED IN
          Your tongue, though but bastards and

                         SYLLABLES
          Of no allowance to your bosom's truth...
          She moves closer to him. Her voice lower. A sort of
          seduction.

                         VOLUMNIA
          I would dissemble with my nature where
          My fortunes and my friends at stake

                         REQUIRED
          I should do so in honor...
          She is very close now. Whispering. She touches him gently,
          like a lover.

                         VOLUMNIA
          I am in this your wife, your son,
          These senators, the nobles
          And you.
          A long beat. All are silent, watching her spin her web.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

                         VOLUMNIA
          I prithee now, my son,
          Go and say to them
          Thou art their soldier, and being bred in

                         BROILS
          Has not the soft way
          In asking their good loves; but thou wilt

                         FRAME
          Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs.

                         MENENIUS
          This but done, even as she speaks,
          Why their hearts were yours.

                         VOLUMNIA
          Prithee now,
          Go, and be ruled...
          (laughing to him)
          Although I know thou hadst rather
          Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
          Than flatter him in a bower.
          Coriolanus smiles. A genuinely sweet moment between them.
          Cominius enters with several other political supporters.

                         COMINIUS
          Sir, it is fit
          You make strong party, or defend yourself
          By calmness or by absence. All's in
          anger.

                         MENENIUS
          Only fair speech.

                         COMINIUS
          I think it will serve, if he
          Can thereto frame his spirit.

                         VOLUMNIA
          He must -- and will.

                         (TO CORIOLANUS)
          Prithee now, say you will, and go about
          it.

                         CORIOLANUS

                         MUST I
          With base tongue give my noble heart
          A lie that it must bear? . Well, I will
          do it.
          But he is still agitated. Volumnia shares a concerned glance
          with Menenius.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (BITTERLY)
          Away, my disposition, and possess me
          Some harlot's spirit. A beggar's tongue
          Make motion through my lips, and my armed
          knees,
          Who bowed but in my stirrup, bend like

                         HIS
          That hath charity received!
          The thought of begging is too much, he rejects it, breaking

                         AWAY:

                         CORIOLANUS
          I will not do it!
          Lest I cease to honor mine own truth
          And by my body's action teach my mind
          A most inherent baseness.
          Volumnia snarls at him, exasperated, building to a thunder
          that dwarfs his:

                         VOLUMNIA
          At thy choice, then!
          To beg of thee, it is my more dishonor
          Than thou of them. Come all to ruin! Let
          Thy mother rather feel thy pride than

                         FEAR
          Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at

                         DEATH
          With as biq heart as thou! Do as you
          like!
          The words echo.
          It is as if he has been slapped. His resolve vanishes.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Pray, be content...
          Mother, I am going, chide me no more.
          He awaits her approval.
          She will not yet grant it.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Look, I am going...
          Commend me to my wife. I'll return
          Consul,
          Or never trust to what my tongue can do
          In the way of flattery further.
          She graciously bows to him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

                         VOLUMNIA
          Do your will.
          Then she kisses him.
          And she goes.
          Like a queen. Volumnia triumphant. Always.
          Then a shocking hard cut to:

          INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY

          A crowded TV studio. The audience stands are filling up.
          Television cameras. Lights. Heavy security.
          On the stage: the set for a chat show. Translight of a city
          skyline behind the set. Two standing microphones.
          At the side of the set, Sicinius and Brutus are conspiring
          with the two citizen activists, Cassius and Tamora:

                         BRUTUS

                         (TO SICINIUS)
          In this point charge him home: that he

                         AFFECTS
          Tyrannical power. If he evade us there,
          Enforce him with his envy to the people.

                         SICINIUS

                         (TO TAMORA)
          Have you a catalogue
          Of all the voices that we have procured
          Set down by the poll?

                         TAMORA
          I have; it's ready.

                         SICINIUS
          When the people hear me say "It shall be

                         SO
          In the right and strength of the
          Commons," be it either
          For death, for fine, or banishment, then
          let them,
          If I say "Fine," cry "Fine!" - if
          "Death," cry "Death!"

                         TAMORA
          We shall inform them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         61
          Cassius and Tamora hurry off to instruct and manipulate the
          crowd as best they can. They mix with the audience in the
          stands.

                         MEANWHILE--
          A gloomy but resolved Coriolanus walks with Cominius and
          Menenius between the tiers of audience, on the way to the
          set.

                         COMINIUS

                         ARM YOURSELF
          To answer mildly, for they are prepared
          With accusations, as I hear, more strong
          Than are upon you yet.

                         CORIOLANUS
          The word is "mildly." Pray you, let us
          go.
          Let them accuse me by invention, I
          Will answer in mine honor.

                         MENENIUS
          Ay, but mildly.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!
          Coriolanus steels himself as they emerge from between the
          stands and head toward the set.
          TV news crews are waiting. Blinding lights snap on.
          The crowd, on seeing Coriolanus, lets out a ROAR. Deafening
          and savage.
          We see Cassius and Tamora moving through the crowd,
          instigating, convincing, imploring.
          Coriolanus ignores it all. Imperious to the end.
          Brutus and Sicinius wait on the set.

                         BRUTUS
          (whispers to Sicinius)
          Put him to choler straight.
          Coriolanus and his supporters move to the stage. Coriolanus
          glares at the Tribunes. The TV crews take up position.
          Menenius gestures for Coriolanus to step to the microphone,
          whispering to him:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         MENENIUS
          Calmly, I do beseech you.
          Coriolanus steps to the microphone.
          Brutus gestures for the crowd to quiet down.
          We see bits of this scene through the monitors on the TV
          cameras.
          When the crowd is silent, Coriolanus begins to make a

                         REHEARSED SPEECH:

                         CORIOLANUS
          The honored gods--
          But his voice echoes badly with reverb. Menenius adjusts the
          microphone. Coriolanus begins again, quickly and by rote:

                         CORIOLANUS
          The honored gods
          Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of

                         JUSTICE
          Supplied with worthy men. Plant love
          among us.
          Throng our large temples with the shows
          of peace,
          And not our streets with war.

                         COMINIUS
          Amen, amen.

                         MENENIUS
          A noble wish.
          His boilerplate speech over, Coriolanus turns to Sicinius who
          is at the other standing microphone:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Shall I be charged no further than this
          present?
          Must all determine here?

                         SICINIUS
          I do demand,
          If you submit you to the people's voices.

                         CORIOLANUS
          I am content.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

          INT. VILLA -- LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Volumnia watches the proceedings closely on TV. She is
          pleased with her son's performance so far.

          INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY

          Menenius, ever the People's Friend, steps to the microphone:

                         MENENIUS
          Lo, citizens, he says he is content.
          The warlike service he has done,

                         CONSIDER; THINK
          Upon the wounds his body bears, which

                         SHOW
          Like graves in the holy churchyard.

                         CORIOLANUS
          (uncomfortable with this)
          Scratches with briers,
          Scars to move laughter only.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          Aufidius sits with several of his officers, leaning forward,
          watching the drama unfold on TV.

          INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY


                         MENENIUS
          Consider further,
          That when he speaks not like a citizen,
          You find him like a soldier. Do not take
          His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
          But, as I say, such as become a soldier.
          Coriolanus cuts in, his impatience getting the better of him:

                         CORIOLANUS
          What is the matter
          That being passed for Consul with full
          voice,
          I am so dishonored that the very hour
          You take it off again?

                         SICINIUS
          We charge you that you have contrived to

                         TAKE
          From Rome all seasoned office, and to

                         WIND
          Yourself into a power tyrannical

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         SICINIUS (CONT'D)
          (the coup de grace)
          For which you are a traitor to the
          people.
          Coriolanus responds, a cobra striking:

                         CORIOLANUS
          How? Traitor?!

                         MENENIUS

                         (ALARMED)
          Nay, temperately! Your promise.

                         CORIOLANUS
          The fires in the lowest hell fold in the
          people!
          Call me their traitor, thou injurious
          Tribune!

                         SICINIUS

                         (CALLING)
          Mark you this, people?!
          The crowd responds, egged on by Cassius and Tamora. A murmur
          of voices, a chant growing, "Traitor traitor
          traitor..."
          Brutus cleverly plays the reasonable voice, knowing his words
          will further rile Coriolanus:

                         BRUTUS
          But since he hath
          Served well for Rome--

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (SNAPS)
          What do you prate of service?

                         BRUTUS
          I talk of that, that know it.

                         CORIOLANUS
          You?!
          I'll know no further.
          Let them pronounce death, exile,
          Flaying, pent to linger
          But with a grain a day - I would not buy
          Their mercy at the price of one fair
          word!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

          INT. VILLA -- LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Volumnia watches, alarmed now. She knows this rage will prove
          to be disastrous for her son.

          INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY

          Sicinius seizes the moment to destroy Coriolanus, barking
          into the microphone:

                         SICINIUS
          In the name of the people
          And in the power of us the Tribunes, we,
          Even from this instant, banish him our
          city!
          In the people's name,
          I say IT SHALL BE SO!
          Well-rehearsed by Cassius and Tamora, many in the crowd
          respond with a fierce cry:

                         CROWD
          It shall be so! It shall be so! Let him
          away!

                         TAMORA
          He's banished! IT SHALL BE SO!

                         CROWD
          It shall be so! It shall be so! It shall
          be so...!
          Cassius and Tamora keep the crowd at a fever pitch--
          They keep chanting and railing--
          A building seismic rumble--

                         COMINIUS

                         (STEPPING FORWARD)
          Hear me, my masters, and my common
          friends--!

                         SICINIUS
          He's sentenced. No more hearing.

                         COMINIUS
          Let me speak!
          The crowd's fury is building--
          It is all about to erupt--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         BRUTUS
          There's no more to be said, but he is

                         BANISHED
          As enemy to the people and his country.

          IT SHALL BE SO!

                         CROWD
          It shall be so! It shall be so! It shall
          be so...!

                         AND THEN--

                         CORIOLANUS EXPLODES--
          His rage is volcanic--
          He SLAMS the standing microphone away--
          His dragon's ROAR silences the entire studio--

                         CORIOLANUS

          YOU COMMON CRY OF CURS!
          A collective intake of breath--
          The crowd is stunned--

                         CORIOLANUS
          Whose breath I hate
          As reek of the rotten fens, whose loves I

                         PRIZE
          As the dead carcasses of unburied men
          That do corrupt my air...
          (each word an attack)

          I BANISH YOU!
          The crowd is silent. No one dares to even breathe.
          AT THE VILLA: Volumnia watches, frozen, breathless.
          IN THE APARTMENT: Aufidius stands, riveted.

          BACK IN THE STUDIO:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Here remain with your uncertainty.
          Let every feeble rumor shake your hearts!
          Your enemies, with nodding of their
          plumes,
          Fan you into despair! Have the power

                         STILL
          To banish your defenders, till at length
          Your ignorance - which finds not till it
          feels,

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

                         CORIOLANUS (CANT'D)
          Making but reservation of yourselves;
          Still your own foes - deliver you
          As most abated captives to some nation
          That won you without blows!
          A beat.
          The TV cameras hum. The crowd is silent.
          Menenius and the others watch in amazement.
          Coriolanus slowly takes one last, long look at the people of
          Rome.

                         THEN:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Despising,
          For you, the city, thus I turn my back.
          He turns and slowly walks toward one of the tunnels leading
          from the studio.
          The crowd follows every step with their eyes.
          He stops.
          Turns back.
          Steel.

                         CORIOLANUS
          There is a world elsewhere.
          And he goes down the tunnel.
          Disappearing from view.
          A silent beat.
          Then, a chilling cry of absolutely Jacobin bloodlust from the

                         STANDS:

                         TAMORA
          The people's enemy is gone!
          The crowd SCREAMS their approval.
          The SAVAGE CRY echoes around the studio.
          The echoing roar takes us to...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

          EXT. WASTELAND CHECKPOINT - DAWN

          The outskirts of Rome are an urban wasteland. Abandoned
          factories. Rusting cars. Overgrown vacant lots. Collapsing
          advertising billboards.
          There is a lonely gas station in the distance, its neon sign
          glowing a lurid green in the gray dawn light.
          We are at a Roman checkpoint on the highway into the city. A
          guardhouse and barrier. Some barbed wire barricades. Bored
          soldiers.
          Several cars pull up to the checkpoint. Two Roman security
          SUVs. Menenius' familiar limousine. And Volumnia's enormous
          Bentley.
          Security Guards climb out of their vehicle, light cigarettes
          and chat with the soldiers manning the checkpoint. Menenius,
          Titus and Cominius climb from Menenius' limousine.

          INT. VOLUMNIA'S BENTLEY - DAWN

          Meanwhile, inside the Bentley, Coriolanus is comforting his
          wife and mother:

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (TO VIRGILIA)
          Come, leave your tears. A brief farewell.

                         THE BEAST
          With many heads butts me away.

                         VIRGILIA

                         0 HEAVENS 0 HEAVENS
          Volumnia has tears in her eyes as well. Coriolanus is
          surprisingly unsentimental and tough with her:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Nay, mother,
          Where is your ancient courage?

                         VOLUMNIA
          Now the red pestilence strike all trades
          in Rome,
          And occupations perish!

                         CORIOLANUS
          Nay, mother, I shall be loved when I am
          lacked.
          She nods to him, she has regained her composure.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.
          Only then do they climb from the car.

          EXT. WASTELAND CHECKPOINT - DAWN

          Coriolanus takes his leave:

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (EMBRACING TITUS)
          Bid me farewell.

                         TITUS
          Farewell, Martius.

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (EMBRACING COMINIUS)
          Cominius, droop not, adieu.
          I'll do well yet.
          He goes to Menenius, who is genuinely distraught. For all his
          political machinations, he truly cares for Coriolanus.
          Coriolanus is moved to see Menenius so emotional.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Thou old and true Menenius,
          Thy tears are salter than a younger
          man's,
          And venomous to thine eyes.

                         MENENIUS

                         (DEEPLY)
          If I could shake off but seven years
          I'd go with thee every foot.
          They embrace.
          Then Coriolanus knows it is time to go. He picks up a
          traveling bag and slings it over his shoulder.
          Looks back at his friends and family.
          A beat.
          A certain darkness creeps into his expression. An ominous
          resolve.

                         CORIOLANUS
          You shall hear from me still.
          He turns and looks to the distance.
          Miles and miles of wasteland and desolation.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.
          His future.

                         CORIOLANUS
          I go alone,
          Like to a lonely dragon.
          He strides off.
          The soldiers manning the checkpoint raise the barrier.
          Coriolanus walks under it. And begins walking down the long
          highway away from Rome.
          The only sound is the cold, lonely moan of the wind.
          We fade to...

          EXT./INT. EXILE SEQUENCE - DAY/NIGHT

          Coriolanus' exile.
          We see his long odyssey. It is a grueling physical journey --
          and also something of a spiritual challenge. He is solitary
          and without comfort: vulnerable to the elements and also to
          the demons of his own psyche.
          We see him as...
          He walks along the barren highway. Trash piled along the
          road. A car zooms past. Whoosh. He is lost in dust...
          Blazing heat, like a furnace, as he trudges over desert
          terrain. Burning oil wells blacken the sky in the distance...
          Isolated, within himself, as he walks past the detritus of
          war a burned out tank a mountain of rusted artillery
          shells skeletons bleached in the sun...
          His clothes are dusty and dirty now. A sandstorm. He wraps a
          scarf around his head, like a burnoose. Only his eyes visible
          now...
          A gypsy boy in tattered clothing riding a white horse passes
          him. The boy looks at him intently as he passes...
          We get a sense of him moving into different terrain, up into
          a mountain range, climbing...
          Then descending. Pouring rain. Lightning sparking. He is
          almost a Romantic figure now. Byronic. Wrapped in a cloak
          against the wildness of nature; the chiaroscuro flashes of
          light illuminating his haunted eyes...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.
          We end at...

          EXT. OUTSIDE ANTIUM - NIGHT

          Coriolanus stands. Like a statue. All his life in his blazing
          eyes. He is staring at a small town in the distance.
          We see a sign: ANTIUM.
          His destination since he began. The home of his nemesis, the
          hated Aufidius.
          He begins to walk to the town.

          INT. POLITICO BAR - DAY

          Meanwhile, back in Rome, Brutus and Sicinius are having lunch
          at their usual hangout.
          They see Volumnia entering the restaurant, pulling Virgilia
          after her. An ambush. She heads toward the Tribunes.
          Volumnia's eyes have the grim intensity of a predator. She
          looks strangely wild.

                         BRUTUS
          Here comes his mother.

                         SICINIUS
          (prepares to go)
          Let's not meet her. They say she's mad.
          Volumnia stalks up to them:

                         VOLUMNIA
          0, you're well met. The hoarded plague of

                         THE GODS
          Requite your love!
          The Tribunes try to leave, she won't let them:

                         VOLUMNIA
          Will you be gone?

                         VIRGILIA
          You shall stay too. I would I had the

                         POWER
          To say so to my husband.

                         SICINIUS
          Are you mad?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         VOLUMNIA
          Ay, fool, is that a shame? Note but this,

                         FOOL:
          Hadst thou craft
          To banish him that struck more blows for

                         ROME
          Than thou hast spoken words?

                         SICINIUS
          (trying to escape)
          0 blessed heavens...
          Volumnia is creating a scene. Heads are turning.
          She continues her attack on Sicinius, but is distracted and

                         JUMBLED:

                         VOLUMNIA
          More noble blows than ever thou wise
          words,
          And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what -

                         YET GO--
          Nay -- but thou shalt stay too -- I would

                         MY SON
          Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
          His good sword in his hand.

                         SICINIUS
          What then?

                         VIRGILIA
          What then?
          He'd make an end of thy posterity.

                         VOLUMNIA
          Bastards and all.
          Menenius has entered the bar, seeing the trouble he goes to
          them, tries to calm Volumnia:

                         MENENIUS
          Come, come, peace...

                         BRUTUS
          Pray, let us go.
          He tries to leave the bar. Volumnia stops him for final
          attack, something like a curse in its power:

                         VOLUMNIA
          Now, pray, sir, get you gone.
          You have done a brave deed. Ere you go,

                         HEAR THIS:

                         (GRABS VIRGILIA)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         VOLUMNIA (CONT'D)
          This lady's husband here, this, do you
          see?!--
          Whom you have banished, does exceed you
          all.

                         BRUTUS
          Well, well, we'll leave you.

                         SICINIUS
          Why stay we to be baited
          With one that wants her wits?

                         VOLUMNIA
          I would the gods had nothing else to do
          But to confirm my curses!
          Menenius gently restrains Volumnia and the Tribunes finally
          escape the bar.
          Volumnia takes a breath, controls herself.

                         VOLUMNIA
          Could I meet 'em
          But once a day, it would unclog my heart
          Of what lies heavy to it.

                         MENENIUS
          You have told them home;
          And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll
          sup with me?
          She turns to him. A cold and killing fire in her eyes.

                         VOLUMNIA
          Anger's my meat. I sup upon myself,
          And so shall starve with feeding.
          She takes Virgilia's hand and drags her out.
          Menenius watches. Saddened.
          Once proud Volumnia, reduced to this.

          EXT. ANTIUM - NIGHT

          Antium is an old Volscian city gone to seed. It is Latin in
          flavor, something like Havana.
          There is life to the place, a certain humid vitality. Someone
          is singing in a bar. Old men are playing dominos on a patio.
          Flickering TV and radio babel from terraced apartment
          buildings.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.
          Coriolanus, his face still shrouded in the burnoose, like a
          Hamas soldier, moves through the streets.
          He takes in the life of the town as he walks. Studying the
          faces of the Volscians around him.
          Coriolanus sees a heavily-guarded apartment building at the
          end of the street. Jeeps and SOLDIERS.
          Coriolanus approaches with stealth, moving in and out of
          shadows along the street, ducking into doorways and alleys,
          taking advantage of the darkness.
          He stops. Steps into the shadows. For he sees...
          Aufidius.
          Walking with a few of his officers.
          Aufidius is beloved in Antium. He has an easy manner with the
          people. He stops and chats. Laughs with them. He dances for a
          moment with a little girl.
          Coriolanus watches from the shadows, his expression complex.
          There is real envy . Aufidius has such a comfortable way
          with the common people, he's natural, unaffected.
          Aufidius jokes with the little girl's parents for a moment
          and then moves on.
          Coriolanus watches Aufidius and his men go into an apartment
          building.
          He scans the building with the eye of a Special Forces
          soldier. He sees that the soldiers guarding the building are
          bored, it is perfunctory work.
          Two YOUNG WOMEN, perhaps hookers, move past the front of the
          building, flirting with the soldiers. The soldiers call and
          whistle to them, delighted.
          Coriolanus uses this distraction to slip into the shadows
          behind the soldiers and sneak into the building...

          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING-CORRIDOR - NIGHT

          Coriolanus moves again with stealth, heading toward what is
          clearly the center of the action: a noisy room on the second
          floor.
          The doorway is guarded by two serious GUARDS. These are not
          the bored soldiers out front, these are grim and intense
          warriors.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.
          Coriolanus considers his course.
          Decides. Takes a breath. Focuses.
          He is like ice now.

                         HE MOVES--
          A steady stride--
          He walks right up to the Guards--
          Before they can even respond--
          He punches one HARD in the throat -- the Guard recoils,
          gasping for air--
          Simultaneously, Coriolanus SLAMS his other hand violently
          over the entire face of the second Guard -- grabbing his face
          firmly and SHOVING him back into the door--
          So hard that the door slams aside--
          And Coriolanus shoves the Guard into--

          INT. AUFIDIUS' CHAMBER - NIGHT

          Aufidius is having dinner with some of his men, their wives
          and some children--
           The soldiers bolt up, upsetting the table, smashing dishes --
          pulling guns -- alarmed--
          As Coriolanus powers in, still holding the second Guard by

                         THE FACE--
          He flings the Guard aside--
          Aufidius and his men, all pointing weapons at Coriolanus, are
          stunned.
          A long beat.
          Coriolanus' face is still masked by the burnoose. Only his
          cold eyes are visible.

                         AUFIDIUS
          Whence comes thou? What wouldst thou? Thy
          name?
          Coriolanus does not respond.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.
          Aufidius is growing uneasy. His men are tense, ready to open
          fire at any second.

                         AUFIDIUS
          Speak, man! What's thy name?

                         CORIOLANUS
          A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
          And harsh in sound to thine.
          The other Guard from outside, and several other soldiers,
          rush in. Weapons drawn, surrounding Coriolanus.
          He doesn't move a muscle.
          Aufidius, intrigued by the stranger's courage, waves his men
          off.

                         AUFIDIUS
          Say, what's thy name?
          Thou has a grim appearance .What's thy
          name?

                         CORIOLANUS
          Know'st thou me yet?

                         AUFIDIUS
          I know thee not Thy name?
          Finally, Coriolanus removes his burnoose. His face is
          exposed. The Volscians are stunned.

                         CORIOLANUS
          My name is Caius Martius, who hath done
          To thee particularly and to all the

                         VOLSCES
          Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness

                         MAY
          My surname Coriolanus.
          The Volscians look to Aufidius, very nervous, unsure how to
          proceed. Aufidius just stares back at Coriolanus, staggered.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Only that name remains.
          Aufidius doesn't understand. Coriolanus explains:

                         CORIOLANUS
          The cruelty and envy of the people,
          Who have all forsook me, hath devoured
          the rest,
          And suffered me by the voice of slaves to

                         BE

          77.

                         CORIOLANUS (CANT'D)
          Whooped out of Rome. Now this extremity
          Hath brought me to thy hearth, not out of

                         HOPE -
          Mistake me not - to save my life; for if
          I had feared death, of all the men in the

                         WORLD
          I would have avoided thee, but in mere
          spite,
          To be full quit of those my banishers,
          Stand I before thee here.
          Coriolanus dares to take a step toward Aufidius--
          The Volscians react. Guns are raised, fingers tight on
          triggers, an instant from opening fire--
          Coriolanus carefully holds out his arms. He's unarmed.
          Aufidius nods to his men. They hold their fire.
          Coriolanus slowly crosses the room toward Aufidius. Step by
          step. Their eyes are locked. Nothing else in the world
          exists.

                         CORIOLANUS
          I will fight
          Against my cankered country with the

                         SPLEEN
          Of all the under fiends. But if thou
          Dares not this, then I present
          My throat to thee and to thy ancient
          malice...
          Coriolanus stops right in front of Aufidius and slowly,
          carefully, undoes his collar. Exposing his naked throat.
          Bending back his head.
          Ready for execution.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Which not to cut would show thee but
          a fool,
          Since I have ever followed thee with
          hate,
          And cannot live but to thy shame unless
          It be to do thee service.
          A long beat.
          Aufidius stares at Coriolanus.
          The Volscians watch, eyes wide, too tense to do anything now.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.
          Aufidius just continues to stare at Coriolanus.
          Eyes locked.
          Coriolanus blinks some sweat from his eyes. This tiny, human
          response sparks something in Aufidius.

                         AUFIDIUS
          O Martius Martius
          Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded
          from my heart
          A root of ancient envy.
          He offers his hand.
          Coriolanus takes it. Aufidius continues to hold him by the
          hand, rather intensely, speaking low:

                         AUFIDIUS
          Let me twine
          Mine arms about that body.
          He embraces Coriolanus.
          Aufidius' men finally relax. Weapons are lowered. Relieved
          glances exchanged.
          Some of the Volscians, though, are clearly suspicious of
          Coriolanus. They watch Aufidius and Coriolanus, concerned.
          Aufidius still can't quite believe his ancient enemy is now
          his newest ally.

                         AUFIDIUS

                         KNOW THOU
          I loved the maid I married; never man
          Sighed truer breath. But that I see thee
          here,
          Thou noble thing, more dances my rapt

                         HEART
          Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
          Bestride my threshold.
          Coriolanus glances to him, perhaps a little disturbed or
          embarrassed by the intensity of Aufidius' words.
          Aufidius steps away from him, gestures for Coriolanus to sit.

                         AUFIDIUS
          Why, thou Mars, I tell thee,
          We have a power on foot, and I had

                         PURPOSE
          Once more to hew thy target from thy
          brawn,

          79.

                         AUFIDIUS (CONT'D)
          Or lose mine arm for it. Thou hast beat

                         ME OUT
          Twelve several times, and I have nightly

                         SINCE
          Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and
          me.
          Aufidius continues quietly, almost whispering:

                         AUFIDIUS
          Worthy Martius,
          Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that
          Thou art thence banished, we would muster

                         ALL
          From twelve to seventy, and, pouring war
          Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
          Like a bold flood, overbear it.

          INT. SHOWER ROOM - NIGHT

          Coriolanus sits, naked. He has finally washed off the layers
          of dirt from his journey.
          An old woman is using an electric razor to shave his head.
          Aufidius is standing in the doorway to the room. Watching.
          His eyes move over Coriolanus' body, adding up the scars and
          wounds.
          A pause.
          Then Aufidius goes to the old woman. Takes the razor from
          her. She goes.
          Aufidius continues to shave Coriolanus' head himself.
          It is a deeply personal act, even intimate Yet Aufidius
          employs the same methodical rhythms as when he was sharpening
          his knife at the opening of the story.

          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING-WAR ROOM - NIGHT

          The Volscian military command center. Maps, recon photos and
          radio equipment. Stacks of grenade launchers and arms.
          Aufidius' CAPTAINS and AIDES wait alongside some bedraggled
          Volsce POLITICIANS in ill-fitting suits.
          Aufidius ushers Coriolanus in:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         AUFIDIUS
          0, come, go in,
          And take our friendly senators by the
          hands.
          Coriolanus shakes hands with the politicians:

                         CORIOLANUS
          You bless me, gods.
          Then Aufidius takes him to a huge military map laid out on a
          pool table. Rome and her territories. Strategic markers
          denote Roman forces and Volscian forces.

                         AUFIDIUS
          Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou

                         WILT HAVE
          The leading of thine own revenges, take
          The one half of my commission.
          The Volscian soldiers and politicos are shocked. Aufidius is
          giving Coriolanus command of half his forces!

                         AUFIDIUS
          And set down---
          As best thou art experienced, since thou

                         KNOWS
          Thy country's strength and weakness---
          thine own ways,
          Whether to knock against the gates of
          Rome,
          Or rudely visit them in parts remote,
          To fright them ere destroy.
          Aufidius looks at Coriolanus hard. There it is. The gauntlet
          is thrown down. Coriolanus will have to completely betray
          Rome: expose her military weaknesses, tell her secrets.
          For all his neurotic intensity, Aufidius is a shrewd man.
          Coriolanus nods and turns to the battle map, moving various
          markers around to show Rome's defensive positions.
          Aufidius watches him with Machiavellian calm.

          INT. POLITICO BAR - DAY

          Several weeks later, back in Rome, politics go on as usual.
          Menenius is passing the Tribunes' table. They josh with him:

                         BRUTUS
          Is this Menenius?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         81

                         SICINIUS
          'Tis he,'tis he! 0, he is grown most kind
          of late. Hail sir!

                         MENENIUS
          Hail to you both.

                         SICINIUS

                         YOUR CORIOLANUS
          Is not much missed, but with his friends.

                         MENENIUS
          All's well, and might have been much

                         BETTER IF
          He could have temporized.

                         SICINIUS
          Where is he, hear you?

                         MENENIUS
          Nay, I hear nothing. His mother and his

                         WIFE
          Hear nothing from him.

                         BRUTUS
          Caius Martius was
          A worthy officer in the war, but
          insolent,
          Overcome with pride, ambitious past all
          thinking,

                         SELF-LOVING--

                         MENENIUS
          I think not so.

                         SICINIUS
          And Rome sits safe and still without him.
          They are distracted when people begin talking loudly,
          alarmed, at the bar. They hush each other and watch the TV
          over the bar. Something has happened.
          On the TV: a SPECIAL REPORT. Breaking News. A scroll across
          the bottom of the screen reads "The Volscians On The March?"

                         TV ANCHORMAN

                         (ON TV)
          Reports the Volsces with two several

                         POWERS
          Are entered in the Roman territories,
          And with the deepest malice of the war
          Destroy what lies before them...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.
          The whole bar is growing quiet now. All watching the TV,
          which shows grainy indistinct images -- like cell phone
          pictures -- of troops and tanks.

                         MENENIUS
          'Tis Aufidius,
          Who, hearing of our Martius' banishment,
          Thrusts forth his horns again into the
          world.

                         SICINIUS

                         (NERVOUS)
          Come, what talk you of Martius?

                         BRUTUS
          It cannot be the Volsces dare break with
          us.

                         TV ANCHORMAN

                         (ON TV)
          The nobles in great earnestness are going
          All to the Senate House. Some news is

                         COMING
          That turns their countenances...
          (he listens to his ear
          piece for a second)
          Yes, the first report is seconded, and
          more,
          More fearful, is delivered.
          The TV picture switches to a flustered TV REPORTER outside
          the Senate. A lot of nervous activity behind him.

                         TV REPORTER

                         (ON TV)
          It is spoke freely out of many mouths -
          How probable I do not know - that Martius
          Has ioined with Aufidius--
          There is an audible gasp in the bar -- quickly silenced and
          hushed so all can hear the TV:

                         TV REPORTER

                         (ON TV)
          --He leads a power against Rome,
          And vows revenge as spacious as between
          The youngest and oldest thing.
          Something close to terror on the faces of the politicos.
          Menenius, without a word, goes.
          He does not want to believe this is possible.

          INT. VILLA -- BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Virgilia lies on her bed.
          On the TV an imbedded WAR CORRESPONDENT is giving an update,
          intercut with shaky and unclear images of the Volscian army
          on the move:

          TV WAR CORRESPONDENT

                         (ON TV)
          A fearful army, led by Caius Martius
          Associated with Aufidius, rages
          Upon our territories, and have already
          Overborne their way, consumed with fire,

                         AND TOOK
          What lay before them.

          INT. VILLA -- LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Volumnia sits, almost frozen, smoking, watching the TV. Her
          emotions are deep and dark.
          Her son, to her the model of all Roman virtues, has betrayed
          his country.

          TV WAR CORRESPONDENT

                         (ON TV)
          Martius has joined with the Volscians -
          He is their god. He leads them like
          Boys pursuing summer butterflies
          Or butchers killing flies.
          Close up on Volumnia's face.
          She gives away practically nothing.
          She takes a slow drag on her cigarette.

          EXT. VOLSCIAN CAMP - DAY

          Urban industrial wasteland. Old factories and abandoned
          warehouses. Broken asphalt. Smashed windows.
          The Volscians have set up camp here. On the decaying fringes
          of the city. We see military hardware. Guns. Missile
          launchers. Armored vehicles.
          Soldiers are cleaning weapons, cooking meals, sleeping,
          playing video games.
          Then...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.
          An incongruous sight...
          An old barber chair floats past. Moving across the blue sky.
          Carried overhead by a group of Volscian soldiers.
          But there is something different about these Volscian
          soldiers. They have altered their uniforms into something
          pagan and primitive. All have shaved heads. Many have face
          tattoos or wear striking war paint.
          It is like something from LORD OF THE FLIES.
          They set the barber chair down outside an abandoned factory.
          This shattered and abandoned factory is Coriolanus' domain.
          It is decorated with human skulls.
          The CAMP BARBER, a fat man in a greasy butcher's apron,
          begins to strop his razor.
          Hard core young soldiers line up to have their heads shaved.
          They are Coriolanus' ACOLYTES.
          There is no sign of Coriolanus himself.
          Aufidius and his LIEUTENANT stand on the fringes, disturbed
          by the strange cult of personality that has grown up around
          Coriolanus.

                         AUFIDIUS
          Do they still fly to Coriolanus?

                         LIEUTENANT
          I do not know what witchcraft's in him,

                         BUT
          Your soldiers use him as the grace before
          meat,
          Their talk at table, and their thanks at
          end.
          And you are darkened in this action, sir.

                         AUFIDIUS
          He bears himself more proud,
          Even to my person, than I thought he

                         WOULD
          When first I did embrace him.
          They turn and walk to the building where Aufidius is

                         QUARTERED:

                         LIEUTENANT
          Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry
          Rome?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         AUFIDIUS

                         (GRIM)
          I think he'll be to Rome
          As is the osprey to the fish, who takes

                         IT
          By sovereignty of nature.
          Aufidius nods to the guards outside his quarters and enters
          with his Lieutenant...

          INT. VOLSCIAN CAMP-AUFIDIUS' QUARTERS - DAY

          A shattered building. Old graffiti on the walls. Weapons.
          Maps. Aufidius' gear.
          Aufidius sits on his cot, deep in thought.
          He pulls a folded bit of paper from his pocket. Carefully and
          lovingly unfolds it. He has been carrying this paper for
          months.
          We realize it is the glossy magazine cover with the picture
          of Coriolanus that Aufidius tore out earlier.
          He gazes at the picture, his fingers smoothing the paper,
          tracing the contours of Coriolanus' face...

                         AUFIDIUS
          Whether t'was pride,
          Whether defect of judgement,
          Or whether nature,
          Not to be other than one thing,
          Made him feared,
          So hated, and so banished.
          A beat as he studies the picture.
          His lieutenant watches him closely, disturbed by Aufidius'
          obsession with Coriolanus.

                         AUFIDIUS
          So our virtues
          Lie in the interpretation of the time.
          He brings the picture closer, whispering now:

                         AUFIDIUS
          One fire drives out one fire; one nail,

                         ONE NAIL;
          Rights by rights founder, strengths by
          strengths do fail
          And when, Caius, Rome is thine,

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         AUFIDIUS (CONT'D)
          Thou art poorest of all -- then shortly
          art thou mine.

          INT. ROMAN WAR ROOM - DAY

          Rome is at war now, so the room is busy and tense. Maps and
          video footage chart the enemy's progress. Soldiers confer
          urgently outside the door.
          Menenius stands with the two Tribunes, Brutus and Sicinius.
          With them are several SENATORS and GENERALS.
          Menenius snaps angrily:

                         MENENIUS
          No, I'll not go!

                         SICINIUS

                         (IMPLORING)

                         GOOD MENENIUS--

                         MENENIUS
          Go, you that banished him!
          A mile before his tent fall down, and

                         KNEE
          The way into his mercy.
          They stop when Titus enters with General Cominius.
          Titus is dusty, has just come from somewhere. He is pale.
          Truly shaken.
          Menenius and the others crowd around him, waiting for his
          report.
          Titus sits, takes a moment to pull himself together, and then
          reports with the grim severity of a death sentence:

                         TITUS
          He would not seem to know me.
          A beat.

                         TITUS
          I urged our old acquaintance, and the

                         DROPS
          That we have bled together. "Coriolanus"
          He would not answer to, forbade all
          names...
          A long beat. They wait for him to go on.
          Titus searches for the words to continue.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

                         TITUS
          He was a kind of nothing.
          (a difficult beat)
          Titleless...
          Till he had forged himself a name in the

                         FIRE
          Of burning Rome.
          He has no more to say, his head drops.
          Menenius begins to leave the room. The Tribunes stop him,
          leading him to a secluded corner:

                         SICINIUS
          If you refuse your aid

                         IN THIS--

                         BRUTUS

                         IF YOU
          Would be your country's pleader, your
          good tongue,
          More than the instant army we can make,
          Might stop our countryman.

                         MENENIUS
          No, I'll not meddle.

                         SICINIUS
          Pray you, go to him.

                         MENENIUS
          What should I do?
          Brutus stops him, with real emotion:

                         BRUTUS
          Only make trial what your love can do
          For Rome towards Martius.

                         MENENIUS
          Well, and say that Martius
          Return me, as Titus is returned,
          Unheard - what then?

                         SICINIUS
          Yet your good will
          Must have that thanks from Rome.
          Menenius thinks about it.

                         BRUTUS
          You know the very road into his kindness,
          And cannot lose your way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.
          Menenius, despite all still a patriot at heart, decides.

                         MENENIUS
          I'll undertake it
          I think he'll hear me.
          The Tribunes are relieved. Cominius nods and escorts Menenius
          out.
          Brutus and Sicinius return to Titus.

                         TITUS
          He'll never hear him.

                         SICINIUS
          No?

                         TITUS
          I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye
          Red as it would burn Rome.

          EXT. CHECKPOINT-HIGHWAY - DAY

          The Roman checkpoint on the desolate highway. A formidable
          military presence here now: soldiers, heavy weapons, tanks.
          Volscian troops and a jeep can be seen down the highway.
          We see Menenius' limousine pull up.
          He and General Cominius climb out. Menenius is out of place
          in his trim business suit: a politician among soldiers.
          Menenius steels himself then passes through the Roman
          checkpoint.
          He walks down the highway toward the distant Volscian troops.

          EXT. VOLSCIAN CAMP - DAY

          Menenius is blindfolded, roughly pulled by two Volscian
          soldiers.
          We hear some of the soldiers hooting at him. We stay close on
          Menenius' blindfolded face, sharing his feeling of
          disorientation and suspense.
          The Volscians drag him into the abandoned factory--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

          INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

          Finally his guards stop him and pull off his blindfold--

                         REVEALING-
          Coriolanus. Transformed.
          And terrifying.
          He is no longer Roman. He is not Volscian. He is, as Titus
          said, "a kind of nothing."
          He sits in the barber chair. His head is completely shaved.
          His face is marked with martial face painting. These striking
          totemic markings also cover his scarred body.
          He is primitive. Inhuman. Like a dragon.
          The Angel of Death.
          His young warrior Acolytes -- similarly shaved and painted --
          are gathered around him; his personal bodyguard and cult.
          A long beat as Menenius stares at his friend, stunned at the
          pagan metamorphosis.
          Coriolanus just gazes back at him.
          Menenius finally pulls himself together and approaches, with

                         FULSOME BRAVADO:

                         MENENIUS
          The glorious gods sit in hourly synod
          about thy particular prosperity, and love
          thee no worse than thy old friend
          Menenius does! 0 Martius, Martius!
          He steps forward to hug Coriolanus. Two of the Acolytes stop
          him. He can approach no further.
          Menenius accepts this. No matter. He is completely confident
          he will be able to manipulate his protege. He always has in
          the past.

                         MENENIUS
          Thou art preparing fire for us. Look
          thee, here's water to quench it. I was
          hardly moved to come to thee, but being
          assured none but myself could move
          thee, I have been blown out of your gates
          with sighs, and conjure thee to pardon
          Rome.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.
          A long beat.
          Menenius waits for an answer. Grows uneasy.
          Then...

                         CORIOLANUS
          Away.

                         MENENIUS
          How? . Away?

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (ICE)
          Wife mother child I know not.

                         MY AFFAIRS
          Are servanted to others.
          Menenius can't believe this cold response--

                         MENENIUS

                         SIR--

                         CORIOLANUS
          Therefore be gone.
          His frigid eyes slice into Menenius:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Another word, Menenius,
          I will not hear thee speak.
          Menenius stares at him, shaken to the core.
          The Guards pull Menenius away.
          Coriolanus doesn't even glance at him.

          EXT. CHECKPOINT-HIGHWAY - DAY

          Back at the Roman checkpoint, Menenius strides toward his
          limousine. He has been deeply shaken by his interaction with
          the transformed Coriolanus.
          General Cominius follows urgently, Menenius doesn't stop:

                         MENENIUS
          This Martius is grown from man to dragon.
          He has wings; he's more than a creeping
          thing.
          He stops at his limo.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.
          A beat.
          He turns back to Cominius. We see the pain in Menenius' eyes.

                         MENENIUS
          There is no more mercy in him than there
          is milk in a male tiger.
          He climbs into his limo. Shuts the door.
          The limousine drives off, sending up a cloud of dust that
          swirls around Cominius.

          INT. MENENIUS' LIMO - DAY

          Menenius sits in the back of his limo as it speeds back to
          Rome.
          The rejection by Coriolanus has wounded him. Also he is
          plagued by guilt. He helped create this monster. He pushed
          Coriolanus into politics. And now Coriolanus has lost his
          soul, even his humanity, and Rome is to be put to the sword.
          All his fault.
          This preys on him.

          EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - DAY

          Menenius' limousine pulls over by an isolated set of railroad
          tracks. Weeds springing up. Battered advertising posters. An
          old chain link fence.
          Menenius climbs out of the car and walks along the tracks.
          Thinking.
          He stops.
          He sits on the railroad tracks.
          Pulls out a little pocket knife and, in the Roman fashion,
          efficiently slits his wrists.
          He stares out over the hideous landscape.
          Blood begins to pool around his stylish shoes.
          From afar we see him, sitting on the railroad tracks, alone
          and forlorn in this surreal urban wasteland, like a Samuel
          Beckett character.
          He slumps over.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.
          Menenius is dead.

          INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - SUNSET

          The red glow of dusk is shining through the cracked and dusty
          windows.
          Coriolanus, still in the barber chair, broods silently.
          Aufidius sits nearby, watching him.
          The visit from Menenius is troubling Coriolanus.

                         CORIOLANUS
          My partner in this action,
          You must report to the Volscian lords how

                         PLAINLY
          I have borne this business.
          Aufidius is curiously formal in his response, the
          estrangement he feels toward Coriolanus growing:

                         AUFIDIUS
          Only their ends
          You have respected; stopped your ears

                         AGAINST
          The general suit of Rome; never admitted
          A private whisper, no, not with such

                         FRIENDS
          That thought them sure of you.

                         CORIOLANUS
          This last old man,
          Whom with a cracked heart I have sent to
          Rome,
          Loved me above the measure of a father.
          Shouts and whistles from outside the factory draw their
          attention.

          EXT. VOLSCIAN CAMP - SUNSET

          Volumnia, Virgilia and Young Martius stride past the soldiers
          and mountains of military hardware. Volumnia leads, pulling
          the others by the hand.
          Some of the soldiers whistle. Some spit. Others laugh and
          make lascivious noises. Many just watch with grim dislike.
          Volumnia appears to be completely impervious to the whistles
          and cruel taunts. Her head is high, back straight, eagle eye
          forward. She was never more a Roman patrician.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.
          She is magnificent.

          INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - SUNSET

          Coriolanus stands as Volumnia, Virgilia and Young Martius are
          led into the factory.
          He tries to register nothing, assuming a sort of glacial
          calm.
          Volumnia and the others stop -- taking in Coriolanus' savage
          new demeanor and appearance -- taking in the Acolytes and
          pagan totems.
          Volumnia just stands, peering sternly at her son. As if
          daring him not to crumble before her. He doesn't.
          Aufidius watches everything closely.
          It is Virgilia, finally, who bravely approaches:

                         VIRGILIA
          My lord and husband--
          He stop her, almost a warning, with:

                         CORIOLANUS
          These eyes are not the same I wore in
          Rome.

                         VIRGILIA
          The sorrow that delivers us thus changed
          Makes you think so.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Best of my flesh,
          Forgive my tyranny, but do not say
          For that "Forgive our Romans."
          She shows great courage. Stepping forward and kissing him
          deeply. A long kiss.

                         CORIOLANUS
          0, a kiss Long as my exile, sweet as
          my revenge.
          It is a perverse response. In his monomaniacal imagination,
          his wife's kiss is obsessively equated with his revenge on
          Rome.
          He finally moves to Volumnia, simply can't resist her orbital
          pull.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

                         CORIOLANUS
          You gods I prate,
           And the most noble mother of the world
           Leave unsaluted. Sink, my knee, in the
          earth.
           He kneels before her. It is done with a sense of duty and
          protocol, not affection.

                         VOLUMNIA
          0, stand up blest.
          He rises.

                         VOLUMNIA
          Then with no softer cushion than the

                         FLINT
          I kneel before thee.
           She quickly and dramatically kneels before him. It is a coup
          de theatre and a masterpiece of manipulation.

                         CORIOLANUS
          What is this?
          Your knees to me? To your corrected son?

                         VOLUMNIA
          Thou art my warrior;
          I hope to frame thee.
          She indicates Young Martius:

                         VOLUMNIA
          This is a poor epitome of yours,
          Which by the interpretation of full time
          May show like all yourself.

                         CORIOLANUS
          (to his son)
          The god of soldiers,
          Inform thy thoughts with nobleness, that
          thou may prove
          To shame invulnerable.
          Volumnia pulls Young Martius down:

                         VOLUMNIA
          Your knee, sir.
          She pulls Virgilia down:

                         VOLUMNIA
          Even he, your wife, and myself,
          Are suitors to you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.
          All three kneel before Coriolanus. A pitiable sight. But he
          has no pity.
          He turns, sits in the barber chair.

                         CORIOLANUS
          I beseech you, peace!
          Or, if you'd ask, remember this:
          Do not bid me dismiss my soldiers, or

                         CAPITULATE
          Again with Rome's mechanics. Tell me not
          Wherein I seem unnatural. Desire not
          To ally my rages and revenges with
          Your colder reasons.
          Volumnia stands, assuming again a position of strength.

                         VOLUMNIA
          0, no more, no more!
          You have said you will not grant us
          anything,
          For we have nothing else to ask but that
          Which you deny already; yet we will ask,
          That, if you fail in our request, the

                         BLAME
          May hang upon your hardness. Therefore
          hear us.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for

                         WE'LL
          Hear naught from Rome in private.
          (coldly, to her)
          Your request?

                         VOLUMNIA
          Should we be silent and not speak, our

                         RAIMENT
          And state of bodies would reveal what

                         LIFE
          We have led since thy exile. Think with

                         THYSELF
          How more unfortunate than all living

                         WOMEN
          Are we come hither, since that thy sight,

                         WHICH SHOULD
          Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance
          with comforts,
          Constrains them weep and shake with fear
          and sorrow,
          Making the mother, wife, and child to see
          The son, the husband and the father

                         TEARING
          His country's bowels out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.
          Coriolanus' face is a study in aloof neutrality. Yet he is
          listening intensely and Volumnia's words are affecting.
          She fights back emotion. It is impossible to tell if this
          real or feigned.

                         VOLUMNIA
          For myself, son,
          I propose not to wait on fortune till
          These wars determine. If I cannot

                         PERSUADE THEE
          Rather to show a noble grace, thou shalt

                         NO SOONER
          March to assault thy country than to
          Tread on thy mother's womb
          That brought thee to this world.

                         VIRGILIA

                         (STANDS)
          Ay, and mine,
          That brought you forth this boy, to keep

                         YOUR NAME
          Living to time.
          Young Martius stands as well and approaches his father,
          challenging and warlike:

                         YOUNG MARTIUS
          You shall not tread on me.
          I'll run away till I am bigger, but then
          I'll fight!
          Coriolanus stares at him -- the intensity of the boy's
          aggression is disturbing. And familiar.

                         CORIOLANUS
          I have sat too long.
          He rises and turns as if to go--

                         VOLUMNIA
          Nay, go not from us thus!
          Her command stops him. She appeals, quickly getting to the
          point of her argument:

                         VOLUMNIA
          If it were so that our request did tend
          To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
          The Volsces whom you serve, you might

                         CONDEMN US
          As poisonous of your honor. No, our suit
          Is that you reconcile them -- so the

                         VOLSCES

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         VOLUMNIA (CONT'D)
          May say "This mercy we have showed," the
          Romans,
          "This we received," and each in either

                         SIDE
          Give the all-hail to thee and cry, "Be

                         BLEST
          For making up this peace!"
          Coriolanus does not respond.
          She softens...

                         VOLUMNIA
          Speak to me, son...
          Still he does not respond.
          His emotions are roiling.
          Still she is soft and vulnerable...

                         VOLUMNIA
          Why dost not speak?
          But softness is not a note she plays naturally. She knows it.
          Her natural aggressiveness comes out, anger and outrage
          gradually boiling to the surface:

                         VOLUMNIA
          Thinks thou it honorable for a noble man
          Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak
          you.
          He cares not for your weeping. Speak
          thou, boy.
          Perhaps thy childishness will move him

                         MORE
          Than can our reasons. There's no man in

                         THE WORLD
          More bound to his mother, yet here he
          lets me prate
          Like one in the stocks!
          She is assaulting him now, on the attack:

                         VOLUMNIA
          Thou hast never in thy life
          Showed thy dear mother any courtesy,
          When she, poor hen,
          Has clucked thee to the wars and safely

                         HOME

          unjust,
          And spurn me back; and the gods will

                         VOLUMNIA (CONT'D)
          plague thee,
          That thou restrains from me the duty

                         WHICH
          To a mother's part belongs!
          Coriolanus can take no more, turns and begins to walk away--
          Volumnia reacts like lightning -- grabbing Virgilia and Young
          Martius and dragging them to the dirt with her--

                         VOLUMNIA
          Down! Let us shame him with our knees!
          She claws at the dirt -- like Hecuba -- keening -- a shocking
          explosion of raw emotion -- almost an incantation:

                         VOLUMNIA
          Down! An end! This is the last. So we
          will home to Rome,
          And die among our neighbors. Nay, behold!
          This boy, that cannot tell what he would

                         HAVE
          But kneels and holds up hands for
          fellowship,
          Does reason our petition with more

                         STRENGTH
          Than thou hast to deny it.
          She remains kneeling, panting for air.
          Coriolanus looks at her. His noble mother. Clawing in the
          dirt like an animal. Filthy. Despairing. Her face wet with
          tears.
          She looks back up at him. She senses she has failed.
          It's over.

                         VOLUMNIA
          Come, let us go.
          She rises slowly, her age showing. Her spirit broken. Or
          seeming so.
          She stares at Coriolanus as she rips off the Roman Eagle
          medal she wears and flings it to the ground.
          The blood red sky of sunset behind her reflects her passion
          as she summons up all her strength for a lacerating and icy

                         FAREWELL:

                         VOLUMNIA
          This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;
          His wife is in Corioles and his child

          99.

                         VOLUMNIA (CONT'D)
          Like him by chance Yet give us our
          dispatch.
          I am hushed until our city be afire,
          And then I'll speak a little.
          She turns and begins to go.
          But...
          We see finally Coriolanus crack.
          Like a great building crumbling.
          Like fissures cutting across marble.
          Emotion floods into him.
          He lunges forward and grabs her hand. Volumnia stops.
          Time stands still.
          He doesn't speak.

                         THEN:

                         CORIOLANUS
          O mother mother...
          What have you done?
          He falls to his knees, clutching her hand.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Behold, the heavens do ope,
          The gods look down -- and this unnatural

                         SCENE
          They laugh at.
          He buries his head in her, like a lost child:

                         CORIOLANUS
           O my mother, mother! 0!
           You have won a happy victory for Rome;
           But for your son - believe it, 0 believe
          it! -
          Most dangerously you have with him

                         PREVAILED
          (he looks up at her

                         DEEPLY)
          If not most mortal to him.
          She looks down at him. His meaning, his foreshadowing, is
          clear: she has saved Rome, but he knows he is doomed. Rome
          will live. He will die. This is the price for her victory
          today.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.
          She is willing to pay that price. So is he.
          A moment between them.
          He accepts his destiny.

                         CORIOLANUS
          But let it come.
          He stands, regains his composure. He slowly walks to
          Aufidius.
          He leans close, speaking intimately:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,
          I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good
          Aufidius,
          Were you in my stead, would you have

                         HEARD
          A mother less? Or granted less?
          Aufidius?

                         AUFIDIUS

                         (CAREFULLY)
          I was moved withal.

                         CORIOLANUS
          I dare be sworn you were.
          And, sir, it is no little thing to make
          Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good
          sir,
          What peace you'll make, advise me.
          We study Aufidius' face. He gives away nothing.
          Coriolanus turns back to Volumnia. Looks at her.
          She is victorious.
          The crimson sky looms over her ominously.
          And we go to...

          INT. FORMAL MINISTRY HALL - DAY

          A solemn peace treaty signing ceremony.
          Coriolanus represents the Volscians. Cominius represents the
          Romans. They sit side-by-side at desks signing the treaty.
          Volumnia and Virgilia, gorgeously dressed, are present. So
          too Brutus and Sicinius. The press films everything.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         101
          It has the stiff formality of a White House ceremony.
          Cominius concludes signing:

                         COMINIUS
          A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
          No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.
          We have all
          Great cause to give great thanks.
          He looks to Volumnia.

                         COMINIUS
          Behold our patroness, the life of Rome.
          She is erect and exalted. "The Life of Rome" personified.
          She ignores her son.
          Coriolanus will not look at her.

          EXT. TRUCK STOP - DAY

           A rundown Truck Stop in an industrial wasteland.
          Garish, buzzing neon. Filthy 18-wheelers refueling. Music
          droning from a radio.
          Aufidius, his Lieutenant and seven of his men are waiting
          outside the dusty diner.
          The men with Aufidius are thugs and killers, the most brutal
          Volsces he could find. We note a couple of Coriolanus'
          Acolytes among them. They have turned with great venom on
          their hero.
          They are like a mafia hit squad, waiting for Coriolanus to
          return with the peace treaty.
          Aufidius is deep in thought.
          His Lieutenant breaks the silence:

                         LIEUTENANT
          How is it with our general?

                         AUFIDIUS
          As with a man by his own charity slain.

                         LIEUTENANT
          Our soldiers will remain uncertain whilst
          'Twixt you there's difference; but the

                         (MORE)

                         LIEUTENANT (CANT'D)
          fall of either
          Makes the survivor heir of all.

                         AUFIDIUS
          I know it,
          And my pretext to strike at him admits
          A good construction.
          A beat. He continues more to himself than them, almost
          convincing himself.

                         AUFIDIUS
          I raised him, and I pawned
          Mine honor for his truth; who being so
          heightened,
          He watered his new plants with dews of
          flattery,
          Seducing so my friends.

                         (BITTERLY)
          At the last
          I seemed his follower, not partner, and
          He waged me with his countenance as if
          I had been mercenary.

                         LIEUTENANT
          So he did, my lord.
          The army marveled at it; and in the last,
          When he had carried Rome and that we

                         LOOKED
          For no less spoil than glory--
          Aufidius works himself into an intense, neurotic rage:

                         AUFIDIUS
          There was it!
          For which my sinews shall be stretched
          upon him.
          At a few drops of women's rheum, which

                         ARE
          As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and

                         LABOR
          Of our great action -- Therefore shall he
          die,
          And I'll renew me in his fall.

                         LIEUTENANT
          Therefore, at your vantage,
          Ere he express himself or move the people
          With what he would say, let him feel your
          sword,
          Which we will second.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.

                         AUFIDIUS

                         (SEES SOMETHING)
          Say no more.
          In the distance they can see a Roman military truck
          approaching. Clouds of dust billow up.
          They exchange a look. This is what they have been waiting
          for. They stand, stretch and prepare.
          The truck stops across the highway from them and Coriolanus
          gets out. He holds a copy of the peace treaty in a leather
          portfolio. He is unarmed.
          He stops.
          He sees Aufidius and the thugs. Waiting for him. Like a death
          squad.
          Coriolanus looks at them.
          He knows exactly what's going to happen.
          He is ready.
          He nods and the truck drives off.
          Coriolanus slowly crosses the highway to the truck stop, like
          a gunslinger walking down Main Street.
          There is something new to Coriolanus here. A sort of
          acceptance. He knows his time is past.
          Aufidius and the thugs go to meet him. The thugs spread out a
          bit, strategically, getting ready to strike. Coriolanus'
          experienced eyes miss none of this.
          They meet in the parking lot.

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (TO AUFIDIUS)
          I am returned your soldier,
          No more infected with my country's love
          Than when I parted hence, but still

                         SUBSISTING
          Under your great command.
          He hands the treaty portfolio to Aufidius:

                         CORIOLANUS
          We have made peace
          With no less honor to the Volscians
          Than shame to the Romans.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

                         AUFIDIUS
          (handing the treaty to

                         LIEUTENANT)
          Read it not,
          But tell the traitor, in the highest

                         DEGREE
          He hath abused your powers.
          Coriolanus is ready for Aufidius' ploy. He is amused at the
          obvious attempt to anger him:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Traitor? How now?

                         AUFIDIUS
          Ay, traitor, Martius.

                         CORIOLANUS
          "Martius"?

                         AUFIDIUS
          Ay, Martius, Caius Martius! Dost thou

                         THINK
          I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy

                         STOLEN NAME
          "Coriolanus"?
          He spins to the others, making the case against Coriolanus
          with cutting bitterness:

                         AUFIDIUS

                         PERFIDIOUSLY
          He has betrayed your business and given
          up,
          For certain drops of salt, your city Rome-
          I say "your city" - to his wife and

                         MOTHER;
          Breaking his oath and resolution, like
          A twist of rotten silk; never admitting
          Counsel of the war, but at his nurse's

                         TEARS
          He whined and roared away YOUR VICTORY!
          Coriolanus tries to contain his anger:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Hear'st thou, Mars?

                         AUFIDIUS
          Name not the god, thou boy of tears.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Measureless liar, thou has made my heart
          Too great for what contains it. "Boy"? 0
          slave.
          Coriolanus' eyes miss nothing a Volscian thug shifting
          a bead of sweat on another one secretly reaching into
          his coat for a weapon.
          Some of the Volscian thugs are clearly nervous.
          Coriolanus is ready. He prepares himself mentally to die. He
          is acutely controlled:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Cut me to pieces, Volsces.
          Men and lads, stain all your edges on me.
          It is a dare. A challenge.

                         CORIOLANUS
          "Boy"? False hound.
          If you have writ your annals true, 'tis

                         THERE
          That, like an eagle in a dovecote, I
          Fluttered your Volscians in Corioles.
          His gaze burns into Aufidius:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Alone I did it "Boy."

                         AUFIDIUS
          Let him die for it.
          At this command, his men move--
          Aufidius steps back as--
          The Volscian thugs attack--
          With knives, machetes and tire irons--
          Coriolanus fights bravely -- disarming two, grabbing their
          weapons, killing them, fighting back--
          Slashing and cutting his way through the killers-
          Closer and closer to Aufidius, who just watches--
          Blood spattering and spraying-
          But the thugs overpower Coriolanus, there are just too many--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.
          They stab him -- slicing with knives -- battering with chains
          and clubs -- finally emptying pistols him into him--
          It is graceless and brutal carnage.
          Slaughter.
          But still he comes on. Body riddled with bullets and cut to
          bits. He refuses to fall. Like something immortal. An obscene
          demon of blood.
          Finally the thugs move away.
          Coriolanus still stands. Teetering. His face is a swollen
          mask of blood and gore. Blood flows from his body, pooling
          around his feet, spreading across the parking lot.
          Aufidius steps forward.
          What is left of Coriolanus glares at him through blood.
          Aufidius slowly pulls his knife. The same knife he was
          sharpening so carefully at the opening of the story. It has
          finally found its purpose.
          Coriolanus looks at him.
          Then slowly Coriolanus tries to raise one bleeding arm
          this requires superhuman effort his slashed fingers
          clutch his shirt he rips it open exposing his breast.
          Ready.
          He locks eyes with Aufidius.
          Aufidius steps to him. Takes his neck. Pulls him onto the
          knife. Driving it into him. Cradling his head like a lover.
          They stand like this.
          Then Coriolanus falls.
          A pause.

                         AUFIDIUS
          Take him up.
          No one moves.

                         AUFIDIUS
          Assist.
          Abrupt cut to--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

          EXT. TRUCK - DAY

          Coriolanus' body is awkwardly tossed into the back of an open
          truck. Like a sack of potatoes.

          EXT. TRUCK - SUNSET

          A crowd of Volscians are gathered around the back of the
          truck. They have come to see Coriolanus' body.
          We watch their faces. Normal people. A range of grim emotion.
          One raises a cell phone. Takes a photo.
          More phone cameras come out. Streaming video. Recording the
          moment.

          INT. VILLA -- LIVING ROOM - DAY

          On the TV:
          The footage from the cell phone video.
          Coriolanus' body in the back of the trunk.

          Volumnia stands.

          Looking at her son.

          His body sprawled ungainly in death.

          No ritual or ceremony. No honor.

          Her face.

          Snap to black.

          The End.
